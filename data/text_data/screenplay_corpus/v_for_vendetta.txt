FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the darkness, we hear a voice, a woman's voice. Her name is Evey.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Remember, remember, the fifth of November, the gunpowder treason and plot. I know of now reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot."
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Her voice has a strength that is metered by a calmness, a deep centered peace that we can feel.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those were almost the very first words he spoke to me and, in a way, that is where this story began, four hundred years ago, in a cellar beneath the Houses of Parliament.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
In the darkness, we find a lantern. Guy Fawkes, a dangerous man who wears a goatee, is struggling with a wheelbarrow stacked with barrels of gunpowder.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In 1605, Guy Fawkes attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
The wheelbarrow bumps over the heavy stone mortar of the cellar floor. From the dark depths, we hear the sound of dogs.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was caught in the cellars with enough gunpowder to level most of London.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Guy sees lanterns coming from both sides. He tries to run as the dogs reach him first. He grabs for his sword as dozens of pole axes pin him against the tunnel's stone wall.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes I wonder where we would be if he hadn't failed. I wonder if it would have mattered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
In the dim pre-dawn light, Guy is led to the gallows.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose the answer is in the rhyme. More than the man, what we must remember is the plot itself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
The coarse noose of rope is snugged up to Guy's throat. He looks into the crowd until he finds a face, a woman's face, staring up at him.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For in the plot we find more than just a man, we find the idea of that man, the spirit of that man, and that is what we must never forget.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
The lever is thrown and the woman looks down, a tear falling down her face.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This, then, is the story of that idea, of that spirit that began with an anarchist's plot four hundred years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Guy's body hangs in silhouette, lifeless against a red morning sun.

</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	I was born near the end of the millennium, the year 1997. My father used to say that people were so afraid that the world was going to end that they were willing it to happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Her father sits beside her mother on the living room couch, watching the news. From the look on their faces, the news is bad.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>

	I don't remember much of the century's turn. I don't remember the market crash or the plague or any of the Trafalgar riots.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
The television flickers with images of heavily armed soldiers fighting in a shelled city.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've read about them since but I don't recall how any of them impacted my life except for the fear. They would hide it from me, like a secret between them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Little Evey sees her father staring at her mother. They take hold of each other's hand, clasping them tight.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I could feel it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a new day. People are gathered along the street as if they were waiting for a parade.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of the chaos that seemed to swallow the beginning of the 21st century, there is one thing I do remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Evey holds her father's hand. Unable to see what is coming, she can hear it.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very clearly, I can remember that sound.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
We hear them, hundreds of marching soldiers.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I remember those boots, black leather that gleamed bright in the morning sun. I had never seen such boots. All moving in perfect unison.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Little Evey hides in the forest of adults, clinging to her father's leg, staring as row after row of boots march by with military precision.

Dascombe, a young man, paces the podium, inciting the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DASCOMBE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The time has come, London, to return to a bygone age, an age of tradition, an age of values that have been disparaged and all but forgotten. What this country needs is a leader! A true leader to remind us of that age. A righteous leader with the strength of his moral convictions to do what must be done. I give you that man! I give you our leader! Adam Susan!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DASCOMBE>
<DIRECTION>
Adam Susan rises and the crowd cheers. Evey's father looks at her mother and again they clasp hands.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It must have seemed so easy to them. They offered such a simple deal; give up control and we will restore order.

<DIRECTION>
Little Evey is asleep in her bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>

A loud crash of splintering wood wakes her up.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>

Her bedroom door bursts open and a heavily armed soldier scoops her up.

A heavy black hood is pulled over each of her parent's heads as Evey is carried out of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>

A tear rolls down Little Evey's cheek.

EXT. HOUSE

A gay man is dragged violently from his Piccadilly home. Outside, he sees his lover being forced to the cobblestones.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The homosexuals were next. What God had started with AIDS had to be finished by man. It was God's work. That's what we were told.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches for him as the clubs rise and fall, vicious and bloody.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But once they were gone, there was someone else. Someone different.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
In another neighborhood, we see the police arresting Pakistanis.

<DIRECTION>
In a different area, young black men are packed into a caged van so tightly they are unable to move.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There were those who understood what was happening, who knew it was wrong but who kept silent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
A young detective named Finch looks down as the van pulls away. When he looks up, another man in a military uniform whose name is Almond is watching him.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And in the vacuum of that silence, order was imposed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Finch sticks his pipe in his mouth and turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again, we see the marching boots.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Order that was like those boots, order that required rigorous discipline. Order that is exactly the same, where each single step falls with every step. The order of the many shaped into one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
We move through the columns of marching soldiers to a wall where a poster has been plastered up. The poster reads, "Strength Through Purity, Purity Through Faith."
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somehow in my heart, I knew it wouldn't last.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
As the sound of the marching fades, a shadow falls over the sign.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, we hear the hiss of spray paint.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What they thought they had crushed, the spirit they believed trampled and ground beneath the marching of their boots, rose up, rose as if from a four hundred year old grave, rose to remind us all that day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
The shadow sprays a "V" over the poster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:

Close on a loudspeaker. There is one on every major street corner.
</DIRECTION>
<FATE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, London. It's nine o'clock, the fourth of November in the year 2019 and this is the voice of Fate broadcasting on 275 and 285 of the medium wave.

</FATE>
<DIRECTION>
Beneath the loudspeaker is a surveillance system labeled, "For your protection."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bubble eyed lenses iris at the end of stalks that move, insect-like, racheting and clicking as they watch a little girl pedal her bicycle. The little girl glances nervously over her shoulder up at the mechanical eyes watching her.

	-- that Braxton and Streathon are quarantine zones as of today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATE>
<DIRECTION>
Evey is now a young woman. She slips into a dress that is little more than a nightgown. She tries to adjust it, pulling it down at the hem, pulling it up at the thin shoulder straps, but it is like trying to hide behind a lamppost.
</DIRECTION>
<FATE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is suggested that these area be avoided for reasons of health and safety.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Good news following the productivity reports from Herefordshire indicating a possible end to meat rationing starting mid February.

</FATE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHADOW GALLERY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move over a dressing bureau, past a wig and over a pair of black leather gloves, moving until we find the mask; it is like something from the masquerade ball of another era. It has an exaggerated goatee, harlequin cheeks and a smile, forever fixed, at once be-guiling and be-deviling.
</DIRECTION>
<FATE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty eight people, eight of them women, are currently in detention awaiting trial.

INT. EVEY'S APARTMENT

Evey coats her lips with a lascivious red. She stares into the mirror, her makeup like a mask over her own face.

(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that is the face of London tonight.

The man, now fully dressed in cloak, hat, and mask gazes into the mirror.

Close on V's boots walking in the opposite direction so that it seems they are walking towards each other.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>

EXT. CITY STREET

Evey looks up and sees a man standing mostly in shadow.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me? Uh... excuse me, Mister?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
The man turns around. It is not V.

<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like... uh, would you like to sleep with me?
	</DIALOGUE>

He smiles.

	Yes, no, I mean for money. But I know what you want and I'll do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
She presses her body to his, using her little girl eyes and her woman's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything you want, mister. Please, I need the money. I know I'm young but I promise I know what I'm doing.

<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You don't know what you're doing.

</FINGERMAN_2>
<DIRECTION>
Evey turns and there are more Fingermen behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<FINGERMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prostitution is a class H offense. Know what that means? It means that we get to exercise our own judicial discretion --

In the clenched fist of black leather, we see a flash of steel.
</DIRECTION>
<FINGERMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got a knife!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINGERMAN_1>
<DIRECTION>
V attacks and at once we know this is no normal human being. A single blow sends the largest of the Fingermen flying backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But more than his strength, it is his speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gun is cocked but before the hammer falls, a knife is buried in the Fingerman's chest and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before the body falls, the knife is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It takes a handful of seconds and three bodies lay on the ground. V turns to the last Fingerman who is struggling to pull his pants up.

	Is that why you're wearing a mask?

<DIRECTION>
He begins to lightly tap the wand in the air and, very faintly, we hear it.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't hear anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At first, you have to listen very carefully...
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
He continues to conduct and we begin to hear the music, violins and horns that seem almost like a whisper or a wind that steadily swells.
</DIRECTION>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahh, yes. There it is. Beautiful, is it not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to the parapet, his gestures growing grander as the music rises and we recognize Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music mounts a climax and V points the wand at Big Ben as cymbals crash --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Big Ben explodes with such force the world seems to shake, while --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
V, smiling, always smiling, points again with another crescendo and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The statue of justice is blown to smithereens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
V nods in appreciation while mustering the music towards it's finale as fireworks begin lighting up the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Everywhere across the city, people stand transfixed by the dazzling shimmer of the fireworks until --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A strobing final blitz leaves a single, starry image floating in the smoke filled sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is the letter V.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's beautiful...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

<DIRECTION>
From every direction, the city screams with the panicked sound of sirens.

EXT. NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A massive modern building that is the seat of the new government.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long, black car pulls up to the entrance. Adam Susan gets out, wearing a long black trenchcoat over his pajamas. He is the Leader and he looks older, heavier, and meaner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hurries past the heavily armed guards, barely acknowledging the snap and cock of their Nazi-like salute.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LEADER'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Leader enters his main chambers and we see the Fate computer system.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a cerebral cortex for a vast intelligence network. Information can almost be felt coursing through its hard drives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Leader sits, at once regaining a measure of composure. He takes a deep calming breath and accesses the system.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dozens of monitors fill with images from all across the city, most of them are of the damage caused by V.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, I will hear your reports now. Mr. Heyer, speak for the Eye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
Conrad Heyer appears on one of the screens. He is at his desk inside the command center for the Eye, the governmental organization responsible for the visual surveillance systems.
</DIRECTION>
<CONRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have less than two minutes of usable footage, Leader. It took the suspect less than a minute to dispatch the Finger's vice patrol.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONRAD>
<DIRECTION>
On an insert screen, we see grainy footage of V rescuing Evey from one of the pole-mounted cameras.
</DIRECTION>
<CONRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you can see, the suspect's reflex speed is extraordinary. As is his strength.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONRAD>
<DIRECTION>
As the last body falls, V seems to pause and looks back over his shoulder straight into the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freeze it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
The Leader stares at the smiling face.
</DIRECTION>
<CONRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid the mask makes retinal identification impossible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONRAD>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Etheridge, report for the Ear!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
Bunny Etheridge appears on another screen. Behind him, huge spooling reels of audiotape wind constantly.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHERIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were able to triangulate the origin of the fireworks. We also are currently monitoring a lot of phone surveillance indicating a high percentage of conversation concerned with the explosions. All suspect or significant transcripts are being forwarded to Mr. Almond.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHERIDGE>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good. Mr. Finch, speak for the Nose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
Finch, no longer the same young man, stands at the site of the fireworks launch.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks to Etheridge, we found the launch for the fireworks. These appear to be individually weighted flares and we have found traces of the same chemicals at both of the detonation sites which leads us to conclude that, despite a level of sophistication, these devices are all home-made with over the counter chemicals, making them impossible to trace. Whoever he is, Leader, he's good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for that professional annotation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
An intercom opens.
</DIRECTION>
<LIEUTENANT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leader, Mr. Almond has arrived.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIEUTENANT>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good. Gentlemen, keep me informed of any further developments. England prevails.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
They answer in unison as Almond enters the office. His face is harder but he has the same violent gleam in his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Leader turns in his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Almond, do you know what this is behind me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<ALMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... the Fate computer system, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMOND>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No sir. It's more than that. This, this computer is a symbol, Mr. Almond. A symbol of the highest attainable goal of mankind. Do you know what that goal is, Mr. Almond?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
Almond does not. The Leader leaps from his chair while pounding the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Control, Mr. Almond! Control! The world around us is a changing, directionless, amoral morass and it is up to man and man alone to set things right!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
He moves around the desk at Almond.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Without control, man is nothing more than any other stinking, sweating, brute animal. Control, Mr. Almond. The control that we have painstakingly built up over the last ten years. Now, do you understand what happened last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<ALMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We... lost control.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMOND>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Mr. Almond. Last night someone did the unthinkable. Someone hurt us. It is imperative that we act swiftly and precisely. I want that man found, Mr. Almond. I want his head or, by god, I'll have yours.

INT. SHADOW GALLERY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evey is wearing a blindfold and V leads her by her fingertips, guiding her almost as if they were dancing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His fingers slip free of her and she reaches out.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. I've lost you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you haven't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>

He is behind her and he removes the blindfold, revealing his house to her.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
It is a labyrinth of interconnecting underground tunnels and rooms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gallery is the main room as it is filled with an amazing collection of human culture. There is art that spans from the renaissance to the painted covers of Eerie comics, literature that ranges from Shakespeare to Spillane, philosophy from Plato to Bukowski, and a vast collection of nonfiction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are movie posters everywhere and an entire wall is lined with videocassettes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A jukebox stands in front of an enormous vinyl and CD collection of music.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A jukebox? Where did you get it?

</EVEY>
<V>

</V>

She punches a button and Billie Holiday begins to sing.

<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, it's beautiful. I've never heard anything like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not. You grew up in their world. Art is created by individuals and there are no individuals in a world where you are told what to think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This place is amazing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're welcome to stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
She stops suddenly and looks at him. The offer is terribly exciting but it is so unlike anything she has ever done that it's almost impossible to imagine.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay here... with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. If you like.

He clicks on the microphone.

</PROTHERO>
<DIRECTION>
He clears his voice and the red "record" light turns on.
</DIRECTION>
<PROTHERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, London. It is 6 am, the fifth of November 2019 and this is the voice of Fate. The new day brings good news and bright prospects from overseas, where negotiations with New China are moving in a positive direction. Last night's scheduled demolition of two deteriorating landmarks went off without a hitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROTHERO>
<DIRECTION>
Dascombe is unable to stop himself from smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<PROTHERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spokesman for the Interior ministry said both structures were severely damaged and judged to be a danger to the unsuspecting public. Plans for new landmarks are well underway.
	</DIALOGUE>

Prothero sits back, shaking his head.
</DIRECTION>
<PROTHERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you believe this crap, Dascombe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROTHERO>
<DASCOMBE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not our job to believe it, Lewis. Our job is to tell the people --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DASCOMBE>
<PROTHERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Exactly what they tell us." I Know but do you think that people will believe it?
	</DIALOGUE>

There is a muffled shriek followed by a sharp snap.
</DIRECTION>
<BODYGUARD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's happening --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODYGUARD_1>
<DIRECTION>
There is another sound, like the leather slap of a boxer pounding a heavy bag, followed by the sound of the heavy bag collapsing onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<PROTHERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROTHERO>
<DIRECTION>
He flicks on the lighter and, in the dim light of its flame, he sees the smiling face.
</DIRECTION>
<PROTHERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh god.

V sits casually, arms folded, across from Prothero. The bodyguards lay dead on the floor.

	You're making a mistake. I'm nobody --

<DIRECTION>
On the floor, he sees the bodyguard's gun. He kills the lighter and dives for it.

In the darkness, we hear the struggle. It ends quickly. When the lighter flicks back on, V is holding it and the gun.

Prothero is foaming at the mouth while a thick mucus bubbles from his nose. His breath comes in tiny rasps.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAIN_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good lord! I need a medic here.

Prothero becomes more animate, trying to tell the man something.

Suddenly, his body convulses and blood pours out his ears. His body slumps over.

The station is swarming with police. A stretcher wheels a body in a black plastic bag out from Prothero's car.

INT. TRAIN CAR

Finch puffs on his pipe, staring at something spray painted on the wall of the train car: a "V" with a circle around it.

<DOMINIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you make of this, Mr. Finch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINIC>
<DIRECTION>
Dominic, Finch's younger assistant, is holding a flower in his rubber gloved hand.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm. It's a rose. A violet carson, I believe. Strange.

<DIRECTION>
The door opens and Finch steps in.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, Mr. Finch. I sent for you because what I have to say cannot be said over a phone or a radio. What I have to say cannot leave these four walls. Do I make myself clear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe in a few things, Mr. Finch. I believe in god. I believe in the destiny of the Nordic race. And I believe in fascism. The romans invented fascism. They had a symbol for it; a bundle of twigs bound together. One twig could be broken but a bundle would prevail. That is the heart and soul of fascism. Strength in unity. I tell you these things knowing full well that they make you uncomfortable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have in fact expressed your discomfort in several arrest reports, arrests that were, in your opinion, "unnecessary." The fact that you are here, that you are not rotting in a prison cell, is a mark of my respect and admiration for you, for your craft, and for what you have done for this country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
Finch looks at the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is also because I know you, Finch. I know what you are. You're a man like me. A man who understands when they are given a job what must be done. I understand you, Finch, and that is why I can trust you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
He moves in close to Finch.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This terrorist knows us, Finch. These attacks are perfectly calculated and they are divisive. He knows what he's doing, Finch. He knows us all too well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think he's an insider?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I think is that this man must be stopped. Stopped at all costs and no one, I repeat, no one is to be placed above suspicion. Do I make myself clear?

</LEADER>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfectly.

Evey, alone in the Shadow Gallery, stares up at the inscription above the crooked staircase.

</EVEY>
<V>

She jumps, V suddenly appearing behind her.

<EVEY>

	Oh, V, you scared me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns back to the carving.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was reading the inscription. What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A Latin quotation. A motto. "Vi veri veniversum vivus vici." "By the power of truth, I, while living, have conquered the universe."
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
She nods.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I suppose you have. This place is the only universe I have right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does that bother you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I'm so grateful to you -- I just feel I should help you, you know, the way you're helping me. I mean, that's the deal, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
V drifts over to the big old Wurlitzer, fingers scanning the song list.
</DIRECTION>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No deals, Evey. Not unless you want them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up at the inscription as an old blues song begins to play.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I do. Part of me wants to stay here forever and never have to face what's going on outside. But that's not right. Is it? That's not taking responsibility. Not conquering my universe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to him.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to help you, V. I want to do something. Can we make a deal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I think we can make a deal if you like. I think I know a way you could help me very soon indeed.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Evey smiles nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. That's that, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
The blues song curls in the air around them like a heavy incense.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	V, you said that Latin thing was a quote. Who said it?

</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody you'd have heard of. A German gentleman named Dr. John Faust.

The church doors have opened with the flow of parishioners as the final mass of the day has ended.
</DIRECTION>

The tide slowly pours out onto the sidewalk, separating around the clumps of people that conglomerate to network and gossip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Church bells toll in the orange dusk above them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen Heyer, a woman whose spite and guile are hidden behind her looks and clothes she drapes them with, charges into the gossipers, her trophy husband in tow, a timid looking man that we recognize as Conrad Heyer.
</DIRECTION>
<CONRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Rosemary. Derek, how --

Helen's head snaps over at the mention of the name.

<HELEN>

	Derek!

She pushes past Conrad, giving Derek Almond an exuberant kiss on both cheeks.

Always behind her husband, Rosemary Almond smiles nervously as she straightens her drab church dress.

	Hello.

<DEREK>

	It's so good to see you. Since this bloody terrorist business, the old man has me literally chained to the office.

Helen pouts at him.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>

	Oh, you poor dear.

</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Derek taps the bottom of his cigarette box, drawing one with his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DEREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It comes with the job. How are things in the Eye, Conrad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEREK>
<CONRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we've been working some bugs out of the new Mark IX fiber optic network, actually --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONRAD>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Conrad, don't be such a bloody bore. Do tell us about the terrorist, Derek. Is it true he blew up Big Ben and the old Bailey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DEREK>

	I'm afraid so. We're dealing with a pathological psychotic in the most extreme case. We'll catch him though. I promise.

Helen rubs her white sable against her body.

From above, a hand sweeps aside the red plush curtain.

<LILLIMAN>

	Ah, there they go. My happy and contented flock. Spiritually refreshed and ready to face the world again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIMAN>

Bishop Anthony Lilliman is a slender man of pious elegance with a warm, beautiful smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns from the window to his valet, Dennis, as Derek and Rosemary get in their car.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you enjoy the sermon today, Dennis?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIMAN>
<DENNIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very inspiring, your grace. Though the segue of the forces of Satan among us did strike me as a bit of a curious digression.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENNIS>
<DIRECTION>
He whisks a lint brush over the Bishop's robes before putting them away.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm, yes. A trifle purple, I thought. Still, Fate wanted it included and who are we to question the will of the almighty, miserable sinners that we are?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIMAN>
<DIRECTION>
A gentle smile spreads across his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And speaking of sin, I wonder which of the seven deadlies the good lord will see fit to tempt me with today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIMAN>

Dennis finishes with the Bishop's robes and sweeps the closet door shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DENNIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps pride, your grace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENNIS>
<DIRECTION>
Lilliman chuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIMAN>

	I was thinking of something a little less ethereal. Has the young lady arrived?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIMAN>
<DENNIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The agency informed me she'll be here directly. However, there was a mixup. It's not one of the usual girls. She's a little older.

</DENNIS>
<LILLIMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh dear. Oh dear. Not too old, I trust?

</LILLIMAN>
<DENNIS>

	They promise me she's no more than fifteen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENNIS>
<LILLIMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifteen, hmm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Bishop rubs his cheek, ponderously.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah well, if Job could bear his disappointments, I suppose I must have the good grace to bear mine. Show her in when she arrives.

Standing next to Dennis is Evey, wearing a frilly pink summer dress, pigtails and bows and white ruffled socks.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIMAN>

A shadow begins moving across the manicured grounds borne on the thick mist like a dark phantom. V glides toward the rectory, cloak undulating against the dark, wet wind.

INT. BISHOP'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is extravagantly furnished, somewhere between posh and pimp. The Bishop is sitting very close to Evey on his plush water bed.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, "hate the sin, love the sinner." I always say. Take your dress off, please.

Evey stammers, backing up along the bedside.

He paws at her, groping hands pushing the front of her dress down as she backs up against the nightstand.

EXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT

The guards look out into the night, fear suddenly gripping their faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
V emerges demonically through the parting veils of fog, the white smiling mask bobbing eerily up and down as he rushes them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cigarette drops from the first guard's mouth, red embers exploding when it hits the wet cement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close as the two guards claw for their arms and the white hot flash of V's knives --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That slice like talons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two men crumple to the ground, clutching their gaping, gurgling wounds. A whisper. V sprints into the courtyard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BISHOP'S BEDROOM

Evey grabs a metal table lamp and swings it down on the Bishop's head. There is a shuddering clank and he collapses to the floor.

	You -- You filthy whore!

His blood speckles the white bearskin throw rug as the Bishop slowly rises after the retreating Evey.

Instantly, the point of one of V's knives is against the Bishop's throat. V presses a finger to his frozen smile.

	Shh. It isn't polite to disturb the dead on their journey.

A cramped control room that looks like something between a radio and television switching room, though it does not broadcast. It receives.

Two operators sit at the main substation as the sounds of lovemaking come over the speakers. The moans are stifled and low, however, as if they were afraid someone was listening.

He tries to dial out the background and suddenly the voices rise clearly above the din.

Close on a stain of white vomit and blood on the thick pile of a Persian rug. It is encircled in police chalk.

<DIRECTION>
Pull back to reveal the chalk outline where the body of Bishop Lilliman was found. The circled bloodstain floats above the head like the last word balloon of a crude comic strip character.
</DIRECTION>

The Bishop's quarters is slowly being picked over by a forensic team from the Nose. A photographer's flash bursts against a painted "V" on the wall near the body outline.

<DEREK>

	Everyone is so worried about the terrorist. Especially Susan. You know why? Because nobody knows what he's going to do.

He exhales through his grinding teeth.

He whispers.

</DEREK>

He smiles, blowing more smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DEREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's an old train line under the New Government Building. It collapsed when they poured the foundation. You could haul in enough TNT to launch our Leader's ass all the way to the moon.

He eyes her sucking on the cigarette.

	You need to be careful, Helen. Your mouth is going to get you into trouble one day.

</DEREK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that the same trouble you love putting in my mouth?

<DEREK>

	You never know who might be listening.

He glares at her.

	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles again and she presses her body to his.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is it, isn't it, Derek? What we've been waiting for. At last, you'll be rid of Susan. I'll be rid of Conrad. And we'll be free. Free, won't we?

INT. FINCH'S OFFICE - THE NOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finch sits at his desk, staring into the silence of his notepad. He has doodled a little "V" with a circle around it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up as Dominic enters, holding up a portable cassette player.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry it took so long. The boys had a devil of a time trying to filter out the background noise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINIC>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Background noise?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<DOMINIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The perpetrator apparently turned on the Bishop's stereo. Subsequently, a great deal of the tape is useless.

He hands the player to Finch.

<FINCH>

Finch punches "play".

Over the small speaker, we sear Evey protesting to V, then run. He stops it.

<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything on the girl yet?

	No. The agency said somebody claiming to be Lilliman's valet canceled his Sunday appointment.

Finch starts it again and this time the tape is very fuzzy.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>

We recognize some of the words though muted and crackly.

	Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...

	It goes on like that for a while. Fairly incoherent except we could make out a few words in this part. Transubstantiation.

</DOMINIC>
<DIRECTION>
Finch nods, understanding.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That miracle business when the wafer transform into the body of Christ.

</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
He shuts off the tape.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have got the initial path report back. The host was full of cyanide.

Finch picks up the bag with the violet carson.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And do you know what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
He rises, sliding into his jacket.

	When it reached his abdomen, it was still cyanide.

Finch is standing next to the cadaver gurney with the coroner, Delia Surridge. She is a serious woman, hair wound tight behind her head in a severe bun.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, was anything taken?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
She fills the dead man's head with cotton and replaces the top of his skull.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just lives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
Pulling at the man's scalp, she stretches it over the replaced skull piece.

	I know it's too early for your profile but do you have any initial impressions?

</FINCH>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...

</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
She points at a jagged puncture wound at the base of the man's sternum with a ball point pen.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's incredibly powerful. This man's sternum was split like dry wood from the base all the way up to the manubrium.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
Finch peers into the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he's resourceful. On that table behind you is a breakdown of all the chemicals found in Prothero's blood stream.

Finch hefts the pile of computer paper.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bloody hell.

	<DIALOGUE>
	There were hundreds of different chemicals in him. From trinitrotoluene to estrogen to motor oil.

</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
He flips through the document, biting into the wooden end of his pipe.

<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps Fate will make something more of all this. I certainly can't.

<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Leader finally authorized an uplink for you? He must be getting nervous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quite. Government directed terrorism never sews healthy ideas into the public. Oh, that reminds me.

Finch pulls the evidence bag from his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you tell us anything about this?

</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
Delia's eyes lock onto the violet carson.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We found one in the carriage with Prothero and this one in the Bishop's quarters. A violet carson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
He hands it to her.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard that strain had died off. Thought a botanist might shed some light on it. Delia?

</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
Delia, riveted to the rose, suddenly looks up to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- Yes, of course.

V rises, lifting the rose and moving into the darkness of the Shadow Gallery.

A small figure moves down the dark wet street, the cobblestones glistening like black scales.

A woman in combat boots, fishnets, and a tight fitting soldier's uniform is in the middle of a cheeky number on stage in this smoky burlesque bar. It is a popular place with locals and Fingermen.

	I'll drink to that.

Click. He never loaded it.

There is an awkward moment of silence, then V moves --

Cloak opening, filling the hall like a black tidal wave that envelopes Derek. He chokes a scream as V embraces him, slipping a knife above his floating rib.

Finch nods.

	We found this on her bureau, sir. It's Dr. Surridge's journal. It covers her years at Larkhill. It might contain the whole story.

Dominic searches for something more to say when Finch does not answer.

	That's the last entry until six months later when Dr. Surridge is back in London. There is no mention of the man in room five again. End of story.

</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
Finch brushes the ashes from his hands and begins repacking his pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone who worked at Larkhill. Everyone who could have identified him. You see there are two possible motives here. Not one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
Susan raises his head.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first is revenge. He escapes from Larkhill and vows to get even with his tormentors. The whole exercise an elaborate, chilling vendetta.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
When he finishes repacking the pipe, he replaces it in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the explanation that I find most reassuring, funnily enough. Because that means he's finished. It's over now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
Finch begins relighting his pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The second motive is more sinister. Like I said, everyone who could have identified him is dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
A flame leaps into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if he's just been clearing the ground?

Another burst.

	What if he's planning something else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
The lighter slips back into his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, the diary we found was in full view. We didn't have to search for it. He left it there. He wanted us to find it. He wanted us to know the story. Or...

</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
Finch returns to his chair, letting out a huge cloud.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For all we know, the diary could be a complete and utter fake. Codename V could have written it himself.

Finch leans forward.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>

And punches it again until his fist hurts.

Tentative fingers search the hole, pulling out a length of toilet paper. Over every inch of it is a delicately scrawled message.

She listens as his footsteps fade down the hall, the door hanging weirdly open.

Evey takes a few tentative steps toward the door and sticks her head out into the empty hall, peering down both ways.

Slowly, she emerges from her cell, retracing her path down the hall that her blindfold never allowed her to see.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quietly inching along the wall, Evey peeks around a corner, gasping at the rigid guard standing off to the side. There is something about the man's frozen stare that keeps her from running.

Evey straightens and crosses to the guard.

Her finger brushes lightly against the plastic hand, then Evey raps a knuckle on his hollow wooden head. Around his neck a small speaker hangs from a cord.

Evey drifts uneasily into a back room where a discarded prison guard's uniform hangs on a rack. On a table next to a wig and pair of gloves, the rat looks up at her through the bars of its tiny cage.

She moves through another door, the wind suddenly knocked from her chest as she finally sees where her prison was built --

</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
He squeezes her shuddering body.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh god, V, I'm so scared. What's happening to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The door of the cage is open, Evey. All that you feel is the wind from outside. Don't be afraid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
Gently, he lifts her.
</DIRECTION>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try to walk. The lift will take us to the roof.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The roof? Outside?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
He helps her to an open elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I -- I don't want to be blindfolded.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Evey. No more blindfolds.

<DIRECTION>
The cage in the elevator rattles shut.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOF - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two figures stand in the door of the roof access, a raging tempest oozing from a split sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something draws Evey out into the storm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, she walks beneath it, the wind and rain pounding against her thin frame. Evey lets the coarse slipover fall to the ground and stares straight up into the storm, naked, the elements soaking into her very being.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
V moves up behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you feel it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything's so -- different.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. Five years ago, I too stared beneath a night like this. Naked under a roaring sky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
A low rumble of thunder washes over London.
</DIRECTION>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The night is yours, Evey. Seize it. Encircle it within your arms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
His words buffet against her with the sheets of rain.
</DIRECTION>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bury it in your heart up to the hilt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
She raises her arms to embrace the raging torrent.
</DIRECTION>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Become transfixed and transfigured --
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
A jagged bolt of lightning shatters the sky.
</DIRECTION>

	Forever.

EXT. NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING

Finch gets out of a police car and looks up the black face of the modern building. He sighs and taps his pipe against the heel of his shoe.

Finch chews on his pipe.

<LEADER>

He glares at Finch.

	Now Adam, there is no one better than Finch and you know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DASCOMBE>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Mr. Dascombe, I do know it. It is that very fact that keeps me awake at night, wondering if perhaps there is a reason that Mr. Finch has failed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<LEADER>

	I'm saying that perhaps I don't know you as well as I thought I did.

<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's over, is it? He's gone. Vanished, you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
The Leader grabs a large box from the floor and hurls reams of computer printout across the table.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Transcripts recorded over the last thirty days in which the terrorist was talked about or mentioned in a positive context. This is only thirty days!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
He punches a "play" button and a wall of monitors blink on. It is a recording of a television variety show.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A character that is made to look like Adam Susan is giving a speech. A woman is dressed like V except that the only thing she is wearing under her cloak is a garter belt, stockings and high heels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
V sneaks up behind Susan and yanks his pants down. Susan is outraged but when he gives chase he trips over his pants. The audience hoots and howls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Leader kills the tape.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this what you consider, "disappeared?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DASCOMBE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For god's sake, Adam, it's a stupid variety show.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DASCOMBE>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Creedy, I want the producers, writers, and actors of that "stupid variety show" arrested and charged with sedition.

<CREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.

	Push me, Roger, push me and you'll find out how serious I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
He stares each of them to silence.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This, this V is still out there. I can feel him like a sickness worming its way into the hearts and minds of the public. Something must be done, and done quickly, to exorcise this demon for the very soul of this country is at stake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is why I am compelled to give each and every one of you notice that if by the fifth of November you are still giving me nothing more than excuses, I will have to revoke your party status and terminate your positions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is stunned.

</LEADER>
<CREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I, uh, appreciate your faith in me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREEDY>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your predecessor, Mr. Almond, was a good man, a man who understood what strength in unity meant, a man who, above all, loved his country. I need to know if you are such a man.
	</DIALOGUE>

His eyes bore into him.

EXT. ALLEYWAY

A police car is parked in a dark alley. It is raining and the windows of the car are completely steamed.
</DIRECTION>
<CREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh god, yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
He is sweating, his knuckles white as he squeezes the steering wheel, panting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a noise like a very wet kiss and then a woman's voice.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The most important member of my cabinet." Yes it is, isn't it, dear?

Helen lifts her head out of his lap. Her lipstick is smeared about her mouth.

<CREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, don't stop.

</CREEDY>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</HELEN>
<CREEDY>

	I can't --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
She whispers in his ear while playing with his lap.

	Come on, Peter, what are you afraid of? Almond used to tell me everything and you're twice the man he was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<CREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He asked me... if I loved my country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREEDY>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes, I can tell you do love your country, almost as much as you love this...

	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<CREEDY>

<DIRECTION>
INT. FINCH'S APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finch sits alone in his modest apartment, reading a book. The book is Koesterler's, "The Roots of Coincidence."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old CD player is playing music, a Bach piano concerto.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHADOW GALLERY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
V is playing the exact same concerto on his piano, his gloved fingers gracefully flitting across the keys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evey enters the gallery. Her hair has grown out but is still short. She projects a kind of strength that comes from a deep inner peace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
V coaxes the final delicate notes and lets them softly fade.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
She walks up to him and takes the smiling face in her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've wanted to do this for a long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
She bends and gently kisses the frozen lips.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, V. Thank you for everything you've done for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did it all yourself, Evey. I just provided the backdrop but the drama was all your own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a good backdrop. I believed it. I really did. It's still a bit hard for me to accept that it wasn't real. That it was just you. Especially the letter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the letter from her pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is a beautiful letter, V. Every time I read it I could feel Valerie, almost like she was holding me. I believed in her most of all. I believed that she loved me and I loved her back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel a bit foolish telling you this. I know that you must have written it and thought you should have it back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I didn't write that letter, Evey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VALERIE'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a shrine. The walls are covered with movie posters and reviews and pictures of an actresses named Valerie Page. We recognize her as the woman chosen for the medical block just before V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everywhere there are flower boxes filled with blooming roses; violet carsons.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Valerie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Valerie Page. She was the woman in room four.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wrote the letter just before she died. I delivered it to you as it was delivered to me. The words you wept over were the same words that transformed me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
Evey smiles and bends to smell the roses.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roses. You grew them for her.

</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</V>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two days before the first day we met.

</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You remembered.

</EVEY>
<V>

<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do?

</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to fulfill an old promise.

Evey cocks an eyebrow.

INT. UNDERGROUND STAIRWELL
</DIRECTION>

Carrying a lantern, V leads Evey down a dark stone staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never been here before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. It is the deepest part of my home. Once you know it, I should think you'll know everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes a button and a secret passage opens in a heavy stone wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a small narrow series of passageways that he guides her through, leading to another door. Evey steps out into an underground subway station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VICTORIA STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parked beside the concrete platform is a beautiful antique train car.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, V, it's lovely. Where on earth did you find it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a way, I suppose it really found me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
Evey steps into the train car and finds it filled with little packages wrapped in wax paper.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's in these packages?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gelignite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
She screams and almost drops one.
</DIRECTION>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do with all of it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you. I'm going to finish what was started four hundred years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where does this train go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the old Victoria line but it is blocked, blocked somewhere between Whitehall and St. James.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whitehall... V, that's the New Government Building.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>

V nods.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the underground has been shut down for years. How are you going to make it run without any power?

	Hey, what the -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
They all turn and find a smiling V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They go for their weapons. V goes for them. It is brutal and quick, knives slicing in bloody arcs, bodies kicked and thrown with superhuman power.
</DIRECTION>

The TV crashes to the ground and we move in at it as Storm Saxon stands triumphant beside his buxom lass.

Finch shakes his head, reaching for his pipe. He realizes he is out of tobacco. He slides open the bottom desk drawer and his eyes almost pop out of his head.

He stares into the drawer like someone staring at his own tombstone.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finch? Finch, what's wrong?

Slowly, he lifts something from the drawer. On his desk, he lays out several knives, a cloak, a hat, and a smiling mask.

He grabs the machine gun, aiming it just as V kicks open the door.

	Freeze!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
V stops. At least five guards have trained their weapons on him. He is surrounded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, he lifts his arms as though surrendering. His cloak opens, revealing enough TNT to level the entire building. In his hand is the plunger detonator.

V follows Roger Dascombe into the main control booth. The door shuts behind them and they are alone.

V puts his hand into his cloak and pulls out a videotape. He hands it to Dascombe.

A man sits on his couch, mesmerized by V.

The Leader seethes, staring at three television monitors in his limo which are all filled with V.

The bar is almost completely soundless except for the voice of V. People stare at the television as if the moment were somehow suspended in time.

	I have come to offer you a deal. If you accept, I will give you a different world. A world without curfews, without soldiers and surveillance systems. A world that is not run by other men but that is run by you. I am offering you a second chance.

INT. CONTROL BOOTH

The door explodes open. V is standing alone, almost as if waiting for them.

Before he can even move, they shoot. Machine gun fire lights up the room. V's body dances and jerks backward, smashing through an observation window --
</DIRECTION>

Falling to the television stage below.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A path is cleared for the Leader. As he heads into the television studio, an armed soldier is heading in the opposite direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is impossible to tell because of the dark face plate but it looks like the soldier is smiling.
</DIRECTION>

The Leader shoves his way onto the main stage. A group of soldiers is gathered around the body.

	Who was it? Who was he?

The mask is pried off, revealing the lifeless face of Roger Dascombe. To the Leader, it is an obvious revelation.

	Roger Dascombe! Of course. Of course! It makes such perfect sense.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who? Who are these people? They must be detained immediately. Whatever they saw or whatever they think they saw is subordinate to the truth and that truth is that Roger Dascombe is the terrorist and the terrorist is dead!

	Finch, what are you doing here?

	Since I'm not in jail and since you have another, even more convenient suspect. I'm guessing the charges have been dropped.

	Be careful, Finch.

</FINCH>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am trying to run a country! When I tell you, Mr. Finch, the terrorist is dead, then the terrorist is dead! If you continue to suggest otherwise then you will leave me no choice but to have you arrested on charges of sedition. Do I make myself clear?

</LEADER>

He eyes the room. Everyone is silent.

	Now listen to me, Conrad. This is the most important moment of our lives. Everything I've worked and hoped for comes to this. Susan is a very dangerous man, especially now, that's why I need you, Conrad. I need you to be stronger than him. I need you to be the better man. Understand?

With a red pen, he begins absently drawing red circles around any V he sees on any piece of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victims. Vectors. Values. Victory. Words from quotes and lists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, he stops. Carefully, as if reaching to touch a butterfly, he slips a single sheet out from the sheaves covering his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The paper has a long list: the names of all the Queens of England. He has circled in red the V in Victoria.

In his car, Finch races to a corner and slams on the brakes. He gets out, staring at a shadow on the ground: a "V" in a circle.

	I've never danced before. I've thought about it many times, here in this room, listening to the music. But I've always been alone.

</V>
<DIRECTION>
Evey smiles and crosses to him.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would be my pleasure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
He opens his arms and she steps into them. They dance, standing very close, his gloved hand holding tightly to hers, her smile against his.

EXT. CITY STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dozens of military vehicles swarm around the entrance to Victoria Station while heavily armed men pour through the gates of the underground.

The song ends.

<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Evey. You are an excellent dancer.

</V>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All it takes is a little practice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alas, I have run out of time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
He bows, pressing his frozen lips to her hand. Evey is suddenly nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	V? What are you going to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you remember? I have a date tonight, Evey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're coming back though, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
She seizes hold of his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	V, I won't let you leave unless you promise me that you will come back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, I'll be back. You don't think you can be rid of me now, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just promise.

</EVEY>

She lets him go.

INT. TRAIN STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soldiers swarm through the station. Susan stares in shock, outraged by the mere presence of the train.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark my words, Mr. Finch, this man is going to become an example so that every man, woman, and child in this country will remember what happens to those who would ever think to stand against the state.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to the Captain.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain, I need a gas unit down here with enough nerve gas to fill every rat-hole in these tunnels.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the lights go out.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think that will be necessary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
The Leader smiles.

	There are over one hundred of the best trained soldiers in this country down here. Let him come.

INT. TRAIN TUNNELS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Five soldiers creep forward in a tight formation, their flashlights probing every nook and cranny.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them, a secret passage opens and V steps out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is among them with frightful speed, a grinning dervish with blades like metal fangs ripping and rending flesh, slashing bright in the flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Other soldiers rush towards the screams and gunfire but they find only five bodies and warm blood running down the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain, what's happening?

</RADIO>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They lost him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
From the opposite end, there is another series of screams and machine gun fire that lights up the dark tunnel for a moment. Then, nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This... this is a mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell me you're a coward, Mr. Finch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
Back in the tunnels, V drops from above, his cloak a swirling cloud of squid ink that hides him in the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again, quicksilver knives lash out, drawing fonts of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finch can feel the panic that is spreading through the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leader, we have to get out of here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was your idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a mistake. This is what he wants. He knows us, Leader. He knows us too well. We have to get out of here before it's too late --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
A voice rings out from hidden speakers, echoing through the tunnels.
</DIRECTION>
<V>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening citizens of London. This is the voice of Fate. Your fate...
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What trick is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<V>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tonight, the face of London is going to change and I am going to offer you the chance to change with her. Your Leader is finished. He will not leave these tunnels alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
The Leader screams to be heard over the resonant voice of V.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is an outrage! I order you not to listen to this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<V>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At midnight tonight, the Head will be destroyed and a new era will begin. You must now decide if you are going to be a part of that era.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
Everywhere, terrified soldiers listen to the voice.
</DIRECTION>
<V>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can choose to stay here and die with your Leader or you can choose to be free. The decision is yours and yours alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain, order all your men to fall back and secure this position!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<V>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some of you have wives. Some of you have families. All of you have lives. Consider each of them as you ask yourself, are they a part of the past, or are they a part of the future?
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fall back. Fall back and secure the central platform.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Deep in the tunnel, two soldiers look at each other. Simultaneously, they drop their guns and run.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any man that disobeys this order will be court marshaled!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
Groups of solders drop their weapons and disappear into the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain! Captain, where are your men?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
The station fills with the sound of boots running wildly away.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddammit, I will not tolerate this insubordination! I want those deserters shot, Captain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
Finch slowly draws back away from the Leader.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shot on sight!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
The few men on the platform are soon the only men left.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You! You! Point position. We're getting out of here! Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
A knife sings through the air and buries itself in the Captain's chest. With a tiny rasp, he falls to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The remaining men bolt.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Traitors! You cowards!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs for the Captain's machine gun.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know who you are! I'll see you hang! Every last one of you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
"You" echoes down the dark empty throat of the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Leader looks around, his flashlight sweeping in big arcs as he realizes that he is alone.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finch? Finch! Finch, goddammit, you can't leave me! Don't leave me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are going to die as you ruled --
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
The Leader screams, whipping around towards the voice.
</DIRECTION>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
The smile is as cold and as sharp as the knife that flicks from his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Leader raises his gun just when the knife sinks into his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Howling in pain, he drops the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn you! Damn you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
V smiles into the spot of his flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Conrad? Is that you? You're working with Finch, aren't you? And Creedy! You're all in this together!
	</DIALOGUE>

V closes in.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You, most of all, should know, Leader. You created me. Without you, I would never be. More than life, Leader, you gave me purpose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
V draws his final blade.
</DIRECTION>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"He that killeth with the sword, shall be killed with the sword."
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
V raises the knife.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Noooo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
V and the Leader turn to find Finch aiming a machine gun at V.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Finch! Oh god, Mr. Finch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop the knife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
V does and Susan begins an almost hysterical laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I knew it, Mr. Finch. I knew you wouldn't desert me. You're a good man, Finch. A damn good man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Mr. Susan. No, I'm not. I'm a man who does his job and does what he's told. For twenty seven years, that's all I've been.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
He steps toward V, staring into his smiling black eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful, Mr. Finch. He's quick as the devil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
Finch ignores the Leader.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've read Delia's diary over and over all year. It sickens me but I am unable to judge her. I am as guilty as she.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Finch, what are you doing? Shoot him. Kill the bastard, Finch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no excuse. I did what I was told to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finch, I order you to shoot him! Finch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My job was to find you and catch you. I've done my job. I've done it for the last time. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of it all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
He tosses the gun to the Leader.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill him yourself if you can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
The Leader seethes, his eyes boring into Finch.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, V. And goodbye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Mr. Finch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
The machine gun burst shatters the quiet concrete silence. Finch falls dead at V's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I warned you, Finch, the penalty for treason is death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
He aims the gun at V.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you ready to die?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The real question is, are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
The Leader laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you really believe you can pick up that knife before I pull this trigger?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. But I don't have to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
Almost casually, V bends down to pick up the knife --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Leader screams and fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bullets knock V back a bit but he continues, grabbing the knife and standing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eyes widening with disbelief, the Leader fires another blast as V begins walking towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The machine gun roars, bullets shredding out through the back of V's cloak as he continues with short deliberate steps until --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hammer clicks against the pin. The gun is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
V stands before him.
</DIRECTION>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see? You cannot kill me. There is no flesh and blood within this cloak to kill. There is only an idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
V smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And ideas are bulletproof.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
The Leader screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
V drives the knife into his heart, killing him instantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
V stands alone amidst the carnage and seeping pools of red.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His body wavers. He takes his hands out from beneath his cloak and reveals his gloves, wet with blood.
</DIRECTION>

He crawls toward her, slipping on the wet carpet.

<CONRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been through a bad patch, Helen. But now, he's gone... There's nothing to come between us...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONRAD>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches for her foot, his hand gloved with wet red.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't touch me! You stupid piece of shit! You've ruined it! I had it all planned perfectly and you've ruined it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>

She checks her watch; two hours to midnight.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to get out of here! I have to get away!

Conrad seizes hold of her ankle.

</CONRAD>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Let go! Now!

</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
The look in his eyes frightens her. She tries to kick free of him but he won't let go. Twisting, she reaches for the door but slips on the carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Conrad, damn you! Let me go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<CONRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Helen, you're not leaving me... not this time... not ever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONRAD>

He crawls up her body still clutching the bloody knife.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, please! Oh god, no! Oh god, please help me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>

Conrad raises the knife.

Scarlet footprints trail behind V as he struggles down the stairs.

He nods and then collapses, rolling down the rest of the stairs.

	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
Trembling, Evey holds him.
</DIRECTION>
<V>

	But the world, the world is not saved... Do not think that, when the fires die and the smoke clears, there is no miracle... there is only a path... upon which they must learn to rule themselves.

	Yes, they need you, V.

	I began to try to imagine his face. Of course, I had long pictured my father behind that smile but I knew in my heart that V was not my father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Evey stares into the eyes, the dark, empty eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet every time I pictured another face, any face, something was lost, something important was somehow diminished. V was more than a face. V was V.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Her expression changes.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then, quite suddenly, quite naturally, I realized whose face must be beneath that mask. It was the only face that mattered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't let you die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you won't... I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
A small smile creeps across her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Midnight approaches and the crowd feels it. Spilling everywhere, they fill the streets like a flood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evey sets a final violet carson on the chest of V. He is lying on a bed made of gelignite, covered in roses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Touching his mask, she bends over him.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, my love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Tenderly, she presses her lips to the smile, her eyes closing, her final tears blinking free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She backs away and V smiles, his lips wet with her kiss, his cheek wet with her tears.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Ave Atque vale."
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
On the train platform, Evey reaches through the window and starts the train.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I looked it up the next morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
The wheels churn as the train lurches forward.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Hail and farewell."
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<V>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Make them remember..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
She watches the train disappear into the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They will, my love. They will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd surges against a barricade when a voice cries out across the city echoing through the megaphone on every corner.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Remember, remember, the fifth of November!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
High above the gathered mass, a masked figure steps out onto a roof parapet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd explodes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train barrels along, screaming against its rusted rails.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOFTOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dressed as V, Evey stands on the roof's edge, speaking into a microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have come here tonight to keep a promise. A promise that is over four hundred years old. Tonight I am here to give you your freedom!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Again, the crowd bursts into a frenzy.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since mankind's dawn a handful of oppressors have accepted the responsibility over our lives, responsibility that we should have accepted ourselves. By doing so, they took our power. By doing nothing, we gave it away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
The voice booms over the mesmerized crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tonight, our world will change. Our leaders will be gone and we must choose what comes next. A return to the chains of others or lives of our own. A world of the past or one of the future.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
She feels the sea of humanity beneath her, almost channeling their energy.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let us choose carefully, London, and when we do, let us mark well and remember, remember this fifth of November!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd screams as one and their scream becomes --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train hurling like a bullet through a gun barrel. Ahead the tracks end, buried beneath the rubble of the collapsed tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the rattling train, V lays in perfect repose.
</DIRECTION>
<V>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me be there, Evey, when it begins...
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOFTOPS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hidden and alone, Evey pulls the mask from her face.
</DIRECTION>
<V>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please let me hear the music... one last time... my music.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
Almost unconsciously, Evey raises her hand and coaxes the first soft notes as he had once done.
</DIRECTION>
<V>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At first, you have to listen carefully.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
The violins of the 1812 overture steadily rise.
</DIRECTION>
<V>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, yes. There it is. Beautiful, is it not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</V>
<DIRECTION>
Evey smiles, her hand still gently conducting.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, my love. Yes it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the clash of cymbals, the train crashes into the wall of rubble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire building opens like a time-lapsed rose blooming with brilliant orange petals of flame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd is awash in the baptismal glow of erupting flame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOFTOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evey watches the explosion, a star-burst of flaming debris searing against the night sky like fireworks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The masses burst through the barricades with a euphoric frenzy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOFTOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The explosion begins to slowly die.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that there is only one way to repay him for what he did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks down at the mask.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I know that that way is going to take a lot of hard work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know this like I know the sun will rise tomorrow and beneath that new sun, our work will begin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVEY>
<DIRECTION>
The fire fades and Evey turns, cradling the mask, and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
