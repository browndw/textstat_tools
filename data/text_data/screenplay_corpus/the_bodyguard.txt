In the darkness we hear dripping water, the echoing approach of two sets of footsteps. There is the sound of a sudden, quick scuffle, a heavy fall of bodies. THREE BOOMING GUNSHOTS. Two from one gun, one from another. So fast and close, they're barely distinguish- able. The sound of the SHOTS ECHOES against concrete walls and dies away. Silence. SLOW, SLOW, FADE IN:

<DIRECTION>
FRANK FARMER'S FACE - mid to late 30s, peers intently over a smoking gun. He is The Bodyguard. ANGLE - HIT MAN dead on his feet, leans against a car. A gun drops heavily from his hand. His life ebbs as he slides slowly down the car door to his knees then falls forward, face down on the cement floor. A SLOW PULL BACK reveals that FRANK is lying on top of KLINGMAN. Protectively pressed body to body on the filthy cement floor of the garage. Klingman, a handsome, 50-year-old arbitrageur, gasps in barely controlled fear as his Armani suit soaks up a black pool of oil. There is no movement. The two men are lying near the right front fender of a black limousine. Blood spreads from the body of the hit man, a few yards away. Klingman starts to raise himself up but Farmer keeps him pressed to the floor, still alert for any further threat. MAIN TITLES BEGIN. A beat, and VOICES are heard O.S. Farmer wheels, snub- nosed .357 aimed at them.

:SC: EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Passing traffic reveals the storefront of a TV showroom. Inside, behind the reflections of the city lights, all the TV sets are showing the same picture, the glittering image of a woman singing. (We will recognize the woman as Rachel Marron.) We cut tighter and tighter on the image until it is almost broken up into its scanning lines. Through the city noise comes the sound of her song "I have Nothing."

:SC: INT. DAN'S APARTMENT - DESK TOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A battered old desk. Scattered across the top -- a pile of blank white paper, a jar of glue, a stack of magazines, a pair of scissors, a TV remote control, softly in the b.g., a TV is playing the same image we saw in the store window, the same song. Hands appear. Male hands. They open a drawer and remove a pair of translucent rubber gloves. Carefully they put the gloves on. The SNAPPING of the rubber is the only sound. The hands pick a magazine off the stack: Screen Stars. They put the magazine down and pick up the scissors. A headline on the cover reads: "RACHEL MARRON'S GREATEST TRIUMPH!" The scissors start to cut. Meticulously they excise the name "RACHEL MARRON" from the page. With the care of a surgeon.

A tumultuous crash of screaming, pushing bodies. Arms stretch out, cameras flash, sunguns flare, microphones are thrust forward. A deafening cacophony of "Rachel! Rachel! Rachel! Over here! Over here! This way, Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!" We cannot see the object of this frenzy. We catch a brief glimpse of an attractive, well-dressed young woman (NICKI), exiting with the other celebrities, as she is pushed and casually jostled aside by the mass of surging fans and media. Her face is calm and impassive as she watches from the sidelines.

SLAM of a CAR DOOR. Frank gets out of a cab with two suitcases. His house is a modest stucco affair on a small lot. He goes up the walk and puts down his suit- cases. He looks at rampant foliage and overgrown grass. Supermarket circulars cover his doorstep. He picks up a few and fishes a bunch of keys from his pocket. A curious neighbor peers from behind a net curtain. As the door opens, we are aware of a further pile of mail inside. Frank's feet push the letters aside and go inside. The door shuts.

Farmer has carefully set a place for himself at the table in a breakfast nook. A bottle of red wine is open with a glass beside it. At the stove he stirs and flavors a Boeuf Bourgignon and reads a Time magazine. He adds a splash of wine. He lifts the pot from the stove and tries a piece of meat. At the table, he looks at the place setting and absently eats another piece of meat. Finally he sets the pot on the plate and eats from it directly while glancing through the magazine.

Lots of people are schmoozing in the dressing room. There's a loud buzz of excited chatter. Hands are stack- ing flowers, good luck messages, cards and cables by the mirror. Through the blur and bustle, we glimpse the doll with its embroidered ribbon message "RACHEL, WE LOVE YOU." Hands casually move it to one side, among the flowers resting on the small portable TV set. On the screen is an image of Rachel performing on stage, acknowledging applause, bowing. The doll EXPLODES, SHATTERING the TV, the MIRROR and the LIGHT BULBS. The SCREEN GOES BLACK, amid SHOUTS, SCREAMS and CONFUSION. TITLES END.

Frank lounges in his shorts under the single tree, sun- glasses on, a glass of iced tea by his side. Strains of "DON'T WALK AWAY RENEE" come from a beat-up transistor RADIO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old-fashioned lawn sprinkler lazily waves water back and forth over the freshly cut grass. Throwing knives lay scattered nearby. A wooden post is sticking out of the ground in front of the fence at the back of the yard. BILL DEVANEY, fiftyish, a distinguished-looking black gentleman, stands nearby trying to engage Frank in a conversation that up to this point hasn't been going well. He's Rachel's personal manager.

Frank says nothing. His eyes are closed behind the sun- glasses. Devaney picks up one of the throwing knives. He holds it carefully by the blade and throws it. It misses the post by three feet and clatters against the fence. Frank opens his eyes, sees what's going on and closes his eyes again.

Frank is now about twenty feet from the wooden post. He throws one of the knives. It misses the post and clatters against the fence.

	Sorry.

Frank raises his hand to throw again, then stops and motions Devaney off to the side.

	Better not stand right behind me.

Devaney smiles weakly. Frank lets the third knife go with one smooth motion. The knife sinks an inch into the center of the post. THUMP. Frank's hand arching again. Throwing the remaining knives. Both knives stick in the post forming a straight vertical line with the first one.

Frank stops his nondescript Chevy across the quiet street from the closed, unmanned gate at the bottom of the Marron driveway. FRANK'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he looks over the gate, the wall, the heavy vegetation and the rising grounds beyond. (NOTE: The use of the term FRANK'S POV, is not to be taken simply as a camera direction. Rather, it re- presents a recurring attempt to make the audience see in the special way Frank sees. Frank lives by constant vigilance, heightened awareness. It is his genius and his burden. The audience must be put in the position of looking, searching, scanning with him.) He has a curious sense of being watched, a kind of prick- ling on the back of his neck. As he looks around, a black Toyota 4X4, parked some way down the road, drives rapidly off -- too fast to get a clear look. He watches it go. Frank pulls up to the gate and gets out of his car. He grabs a bar of the gate and pulls. The whole gate rattles. Frank gets back in his car and pushes a button on the intercom box at the side of the gate. A MAN'S VOICE CRACKLES out of the BOX. Transmission is terrible.

She leads Frank into a large, unused formal parlor. There are dustsheets over the furniture and the walls are being repainted.

Frank steps into a tiled room that overlooks the pool area. One wall is all glass. On the opposite wall are shelves containing the trophies of Rachel Marron's career: A Tony award, three Grammy's, gold and platinum records, other statuettes and plaques. Among the framed photo- graphs of Rachel accepting awards etc., is one of her and

her small son, FLETCHER, dressed in a tuxedo. Both are goofing off for the camera with obvious affection. Frank looks down at the pool. FRANK'S POV Dwarfed by the pool, the only person in sight is seven- year old Fletcher, the little boy from the photograph, dark-haired and fragile. He is crouched at the side of the pool with the remote control unit for a foot-long speedboat which is cutting across the water. A nanny sits, some way off, embroidering. Frank's attention is distracted. A heavier BASS MUSICAL BEAT comes from somewhere nearby in the house, another Rachel Marron number, but this time up-tempo and bouncy. Frank follows the sound.

:SC: INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank walks into the rear of the room that the noise is coming from. It is large and comfortable with plenty of seating, a bar, a wall of stereo gear and a projection booth. It is packed with people, props and video equipment. There is lots of activity, a general air of barely-organized chaos. MUSIC BLARES out. A group of six dancers, is rehearsing an energetic dance number for a music video, directed by their choreographer RORY. Sunlight throws them in a silhouette against the glass wall at the end of the room. A video cameraman circles them, taping the rehearsal, which appears on a large-screen TV behind them. In one corner, a pretty black girl is being pinned into a proposed costume for the video. Several people are stand- ing around, tending to the video and playback gear. All the chairs face the far end of the room and it isn't immediately apparent how many more people are hidden among the big cushions. As Frank sits on the barstool at the back, a large swivel chair turns to reveal Devaney. He waves to Frank and makes his way over to him. On the other side of the room, a brawny, heavyset man in his late thirties rises to look at Frank. He has a twenty inch neck. Devaney signals to him that everything is all right. The brawny man looks at Frank a moment more, then sits down. Frank looks around the room. A shelf laden with vitamins. Guitars of various makes. A flute. A gold record being used as a coaster. People smoking and chatting through the rehearsal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In one of the chairs, a pretty woman in her mid-thirties (NICKI, the woman we saw at the premiere) is knitting. She glances occasionally at the dancers. A man sits next to a phone busily discussing a contract with someone at the other end of the line.
</DIRECTION>

The music climaxes and abruptly stops. The dancers hold their dramatic final poses for a second, then relax again. APPLAUSE. The CLAPPING from the front sofa is loudest. Then LAUGHTER. From elsewhere in the room comes the voice of the VIDEO DIRECTOR.

RACHEL MARRON finally rises from the sofa. It's a bit of
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a shock to see that she is only about thirty years old. A young woman. Not beautiful, not ugly. Unique only in that she is immediately interesting. A Superstar.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>

Rachel and Frank look across the room at each other. Frank comes forward.

Rory gets up, and goes over to his dancers at the big screen video.

<RACHEL>

</SPECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel stands and starts to wander over to Rory and the dancers. Frank looks at Devaney. Devaney doesn't like the tone this is taking.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'm safe when I'm here at the house so I guess the main thing will be when I go out. Tony will be able to fill you in on all that. You two will have to work something out. I don't want both of you falling all over me everywhere I go. The most important thing is this -- I will not allow Fletcher to be affected by this thing...

Rory puts his arm around her waist and stands behind her, starting to run through her steps with her in slow motion.

</SPECTOR>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want him to think he's in prison. So the house and grounds must not be altered in any way. He shouldn't be aware that you're here. Is that clear?

Frank looks at her a long time, glancing up at Devaney once.

Frank's on his way. Someone brings a silver headpiece on a stand to Rachel. She ignores it, still looking at Frank.

Frank is walking rapidly away from the window wall, down the slope. Devaney is scurrying to keep up.
</DIRECTION>
<DEVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Farmer, will you wait a minute? I should have told you more. I'm sorry but I was afraid she wouldn't go through with it. I thought I'd let the two of you work it out... come to an understanding.

Frank starts to walk off. Devaney is grasping at straws.

Fletcher, happy to have someone to talk to, walks up to Frank with his remote-control speed boat. Frank would like to walk away, but Fletcher blocks his way. Frank looks at Fletcher's frail little, nut-brown figure. The watching nanny continues her embroidering, some way off.

Fletcher nods.

Frank is surprised.

Devaney trots into the pool area, out of breath. He is holding a bulging manila file. As he sees Fletcher, he holds the file casually at his side. Frank sees Fletcher looking at the file.
</DIRECTION>
<DEVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you, Fletch?

Fletcher looks after them silently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PATIO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Devaney slides the file across the table at Frank, open- ing it. Inside are letters of every size and condition. Repeatedly throughout this scene Frank's gaze is drawn to Fletcher, who has started his boat again.
</DIRECTION>
<DEVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is just in the last six months.

</DEVANEY>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at the pile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever tried having these professionally assessed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Devaney shakes his head no. Frank begins to look through the letters, flipping them by the corner of the page. From many different sources, some are scrawled, some typed, some assembled from cutouts. Many are soiled and torn, others immaculate. Occasionally, one will have a photo of Rachel with crude markings on it. Spector enters sucking on a popsicle. He comes to stand over Frank's shoulder, peering nonchalantly at the piles of letters.
</DIRECTION>
<SPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Devaney says you were in the Secret Service.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Frank nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank goes through them quickly, with an expert eye. He sometimes pauses to read one more carefully. A few he removes from the stack and places in the center of the table.
</DIRECTION>
<SPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever guard the main man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPECTOR>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was two years with Carter and four years with Reagan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank sets another letter in the center pile. He stops, smiling at it.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a little old lady in Akron. She's written to everybody I've ever worked for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He continues to turn until something stops him. Several letters are paper-clipped together. They are the pasted- up type we saw being assembled on the desk top.
</DIRECTION>
<SPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reagan got shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
His chatter is beginning to annoy Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not on my shift.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Spector emits a gratuitous laugh, acknowledges the joke.
</DIRECTION>
<SPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Frank goes back to his letters. He taps the stack in the center of the table.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At first glance, these don't bother me. But keep them. You never know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He separates one letter from the others.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This could be something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Devaney searches Frank's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DEVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think it could be the same guy? The one who rigged the doll?

</DEVANEY>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Did you tell Miss Marron about it? Does she know about the doll?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Devaney and Spector exchange looks. This is evidently a sore point between them.
</DIRECTION>
<SPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We said there'd been some electrical problem while she was on stage. Short circuit. Look, she doesn't need that kind of worry right now. It would upset her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPECTOR>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the police?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was no reason for the police. No one got hurt.

</SPECTOR>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the chauffeur?

</FRANK>
<SPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was nothing. It was just our people there.

Frank turns and watches Fletcher by the pool. Devaney's eyes are still on Frank's face.

Henry Dupres is leaning against the doorjamb. The room is comfortable, a guest bedroom. Frank flops one battered suitcase onto the bed and opens it. He pulls open some drawers in the dresser and starts putting away his clothes.

The fortification of the estate begins as Frank and Henry walk the grounds. Frank talks and points, Henry takes notes on a pad. Frank gestures at the stonework of the gate, points at the top of the stone wall along Waverly Lane. At the tall hedges which separate the estate from its neighbors, Frank gestures to take in the entire length of the hedged border. Henry stops in amazement. Frank keeps walking.

A small room at one end of the pool house has been fitted with a wall mirror and ballet exercise barre. A STEREO plays exercising MUSIC. Nicki, dressed in leotards, is doing pre-aerobic stretch- ing exercises. Frank appears outside the window. Nicki waves him in. Unseen by Frank, a huge St. Bernard lays in the front of the door. He muscles his way in, the dog never moves, just slides along the floor as Frank pushes the door open. Frank looks the room over.

The girl's mother, close behind her, hands a small camera casually to Nicki to be photographed as she and her daughter pose with Rachel. Frank watches Nicki quietly comply. Rachel, Spector and Frank all reach the front entrance together, and Frank slips out first, glancing around. Rachel comes out and passes within inches of him.

As Frank comes through some bushes, he suddenly catches a glimpse of the 4 X 4 through the trees. It starts to accelerate. As it pulls away (it is too far to record the license number), he breaks into a full run toward the other end of the property. Leaping hedges, Frank crashes through tropical vegetation. CRASHING through a bamboo forest, he scurries down a steep wooded slope toward the road below. The 4 X 4 can be glimpsed through the trees as he runs to head it off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A retaining wall about 14 feet high rises from the road to the slope. Without a pause, as the car speeds beneath, Frank leaps and drops the full distance to the road. The 4 X 4 ROARS PAST just missing him and turns a corner. Hitting hard, Frank allows his knees to take the force of the fall, deliberately rolling once before he springs into a crouched upright position. But the 4 X 4 speeds around a corner and is gone.

Rachel's limousine is parked opposite the shop. It's a decidedly downscale area. A little way off, a group of unemployed youths hang around, eyeing the limo with interest. Henry sits at the wheel. Tony stands by the open window, leaning against the car.

We see a man's hands remove a video cassette from its sleeve. The cover reads "RACHEL MARRON - THE #1 HITS." The CASSETTE is gently eased into the slot of the video player.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel's image appears on the screen, singing softly, intensely, passionately into the camera. WE TRACK INTO the image, as if a little hypnotized by it. ANGLE FRANK Frank sits alone in his room, lit by the glow of the TV, dressed in a business-style blue suit and tie. He's watching Rachel's videos. Scattered around the video player are a collection of other Rachel Marron CD's, tapes and videos. Frank has been noting down lyrics on the yellow legal pad on his lap. Some of the phrases are circled. As he watches, we see a subtle change in his expression. It is as if he really were looking at Rachel for the first time, here, watching her sing. For a second, she seems to be singing to him alone, passionate and vulnerable. He opens a small box and removes a tiny enamelled Russian Orthodox-type cross. He fastens the clasp, checking that it holds, then looks back to the screen.

The room is surprisingly bare and simple, almost empty apart from Rachel's collection of old and faded dolls on the shelves and on the bed. Rachel is getting dressed for the evening. A hairdresser stands behind her, fussing with her hair. Rachel hears the MUSIC coming from outside and moves to the window. (The hairdresser moves with her, still busy with the brush.) Gazing across the garden, she sees the light in Frank's room and hears her own voice singing out from there too.

The mob reacts to the sight of the approaching limo which turns into the parking area and heads for the backstage. Faces of the fans are at the windows leering at Rachel. Many are grotesquely painted. Some go into a wild frenzy as Rachel's limo pulls up. There is a punch-up and a man is beaten back. Someone has a video camera. Its quartz light shines in through the limo windows. Everybody squints at the glare.

Others join in as the mob presses forward. The instant she exits the car, her expression goes public -- a wide, show-biz smile. Sandwiched between Spector and Devaney, with Tony in front and Frank at the rear, Rachel makes her entrance. A young man breaks the barrier moving toward Rachel. Frank grabs him by one of his belt loops, gracefully guides him all the way across and slips him under the opposite cordon into the arms of a security guard.

If she doesn't get out there, she's dead. Forget about crazy death threats, if she doesn't sing, she's dead anyway... Look, handled properly, this thing could be good for a million dollars' worth of free publicity.

Rachel scans the crowd, spread before her like a surreal mural. Camera flashbulbs explode like crazy through the glare. The thundering adoration is like a stimulant. She darts a look to Frank and gives him a fierce "naughty girl" smile.

	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
She skitters to the other side of the stage, baiting her fans. Her new video explodes across the video wall behind her. The crowd surges forward. Two security guards nervously tense up, watching the crowd. When one fan tries to climb onstage, Frank reaches out and unbalances him, so that the man falls back into the audience. Another man climbs the stage on the other side. One of the guards darts out like a ballboy at a tennis match, pushes the fan back and scurries to the far side to resume his vigilance. The crowd is getting even more excited, pressing closer, trying to touch Rachel. The security guards move in, but Rachel gestures for them to back off. ANGLE - FRANK Frank's task has suddenly become impossible. A forest of hands and faces start to engulf Rachel. Anyone could be the killer. Frank's eyes dart over them all, his gaze intense, as if trying to hold them off by sheer willpower. RACHEL'S POV Looking offstage at Frank. His frustration is almost intoxicating to her. She struts over the lip of the stage. A man leaps up from audience to join her. Frank starts forward. Rachel gestures to him to hold back, waving him off.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel dances erotically with the man -- bumping and grinding, sinking to her knees. The crowd roars approval. Frank quickly sizes up the scene. He speaks into a SURV KIT microphone in his sleeve. Across the room we see Henry listening, pushing an earpiece to his ear. Henry quickly scurries to an exit. Frank starts moving toward the stage. At that moment, the lucky man Rachel's dancing with grabs her around the waist and spins her gleefully, like the dance partner she has been pretending to be. One of security guards rushes forward to extri- cate her. The spinning man inadvertently bumps hard into the guard and the man loses his grip on Rachel. She flies out of his grasp and tumbles off the front of the stage -- into the adoring arms of a half dozen fans. The audience goes wild. This is the kind of thing Rachel was famous for when she was starting out. The scene resembles a rugby scrum... with Rachel the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank sees Rachel being passed over the heads of fans -- deeper into the audience. Her dress is ripped and torn apart. The silver headpiece is dislodged and disappears into the crowd. CLOSE ON RACHEL Fear fills her face. She's gone over the edge, literally and figuratively. She's lost control. Tony and the security guards are fighting to get to her, slamming bodies out of the way. In the b.g., the video continues on its serene, uninterrupted way. FRANK'S POV He spots a fire extinguisher in the wings. BACK TO SCENE Frank grabs it and heads to center stage. He aims the extinguisher at the crowd between Rachel and the stage. The chemical foam does its job, scattering fans. Frank leaps onto the floor, kicking a wild-eyed young blond man in the chest as he fights his way to Rachel, taking her in his arms. Tony runs ahead of Frank, knocks a fan off the stage and waves for Frank to follow.

A burly street regular gets a shove from Tony and comes back hard. The crowd immediately sides with him, yells encouragement. But Tony is the better man and sends him sprawling. The rest of the way to the curb opens up. At the parking area Tony discovers there is no limo and turns in bewilderment to Rachel. But she is not there. A couple of people laugh.

Frank turns and looks at Rachel. She is diminutive, doll-like, alone in the center of the large limousine seat. Her hands rise to her face and her body begins to shake with sobs as she sits there alone in the tattered remains of her dress. Frank turns away to avoid staring at her, but he feels

The crowd is thinning out. A dim worklight is burning somewhere backstage. The auditorium is a mess; the cleaning crew has begun to work on the debris from the riot. FOOTSTEPS APPROACH, walking, pausing, as if looking for something. Lying on the floor in big CLOSEUP we see a small fragment of Rachel's dress. The FOOTSTEPS STOP by it. A hand picks it up gently and lifts it OUT OF FRAME. We hear the sound of a deep lingering INHALATION of breath. The feet move on.

Frank moves quickly into the room, checking the window and French door. Rachel waits silently by the door. All is clear. He steps back to the door. As he approaches her she begins to tremble. He gently reaches out and takes her in his arms. Slowly holding her he leads her to bed, moving aside some of Rachel's dolls, laid out on the pillows. Her hands go automatically to her dress but they are shaking so badly she cannot undo it. Frank gently does it for her. She willingly allows him to undress her and not a word is spoken between them. As she sits naked still trembling, he pulls down the covers and guides her gently into bed. As he adjusts the covers she reaches up and takes hold of his hand. He looks down, stroking her forehead like a child's.

:SC: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank sits alone at a table in the huge kitchen, care- fully cutting and eating a peach. The door at the other end of the room slams open and Tony stalks in, soaking wet. He has just made his way home from the MAYAN and he is boiling. He sights on Frank and moves toward him fast. Frank just watches until Tony is almost upon him. As Tony reaches out to lift him by his shirt, Frank spins low out of his seat. Tony's legs are knocked out from under him. He lands hard on his back and finds himself looking up at Frank, who holds him down with the chair he was sitting on, like a lion tamer, a leg strut pressed against Tony's throat. Frank looks down at him question- ingly, as if to ask, "Had enough?" Tony scowls and nods. Frank lifts the chair away. Tony stands up and faces him. Frank turns away and Tony throws a punch at his head, barely catching him as Frank ducks and moves in under it. He hits Tony twice and throws him against a cabinet. Tony gets up slowly, looks around and grabs a carving knife from a hook on the wall. He holds it in front of him threateningly. Frank shakes his head. He's getting irritated. He picks up the knife he's been using on the peach and flips it in his hand so he's holding it by the blade. With the same fluid motion we've seen earlier, he throws it at Tony. It sticks in the wall an inch from Tony's ear. Tony does a slow take and then lowers his blade. Frank picks up his dirty dish and takes it to the sink. He glances at Tony.

Frank has been talking to the uniformed guard in the gate house and now begins walking up the drive toward the man- sion. The grounds are quiet, beautiful, misty. We see him from behind some foliage, as if he's being covertly observed, stalked. A twig snaps and he turns sharply. It's Rachel. She's dressed in a soft jumpsuit and starts jogging out from behind the bushes towards him.
</DIRECTION>

The suit softens her appearance; she looks lovely. Her manner, too, has altered; she is charming -- friendly and very girlish.

DAY The SOUND is DEAFENING. A wet car comes out of the tunnel of machinery. In the distance, glimpsed through the spinning brushes, Henry talks to a couple of workers as he waits for the limo to be cleaned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hands appear with a large chamois cloth, moving easily and fast over the hood and windshield. A black in his early twenties is finishing the exterior of the car. A second pair of hands appear. White hands in rubber gloves. They open the driver's door and push a vacuum suction hose inside. The hands switch ON the car RADIO, loud. Loud enough to hear over the din outside the car. The hose works its way over the front seats.

Tight, shabby facilities. Dan opens the combination padlock to his locker and deposits the crumpled photo inside. As the hands remove the rubber gloves, the inside of the locker is revealed. Pasted over every inch of the locker are pictures of Rachel Marron. One tabloid shot of her dancing with the word "whore" scrawled across it. Taped to a single sheet of white paper in the center, like a holy relic, is the torn scrap of Rachel's dress from the MAYAN. The hands pin up the newly-acquired photo next to it.

Frank hangs back, drink in hand, as Rachel explores the basement. Frank has fitted it out as a combination gym/ target range/weapons workshop. The place has a kind of unfussy order about it, a simplicity.

Rachel puts down her drink and moves toward a samurai sword that is mounted in its scabbard on the wall. She looks at it, peering closely.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You some kind of a samurai, too?

Frank smiles.

Rachel looks around at Frank's modest home.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can see your tastes are extravagant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at Frank and then back at the sword. She reaches out to touch it.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Frank nods. Rachel takes it off its mount carefully, unhooks the scabbard and begins to slide it off.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel slides the scabbard off. The naked blade is breathtaking. Rachel holds the sword out before her. She walks toward Frank, then stops and looks over the blade at him.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a hard one to figure, Frank Farmer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at her. She steps closer, so the blade is only about a foot from his face.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It seems to me a bodyguard must know little peace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stands up so that the point of the sword is only about an inch from his chest. He reaches out over the blade to Rachel's neck and unties the silk scarf she is wearing there. One hand draws the scarf away. The other hand lingers for a moment on her neck, then lifts away.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He has raised the scarf over his head, in the space between them. With two hands he spreads it out and then lets it go. Slowly, billowing, the scarf floats down over the blade and is cut in two. These two pieces float slowly to the floor. Frank takes Rachel's wrist and moves the sword away to the side. They are both holding it as Rachel presses her body against Frank's and they begin to kiss.

Rachel laughs, kisses him and buries her head down into his shoulder. Frank stares across the bed at the samurai sword lying on the floor. Some of Rachel's clothing is draped in a heap across it. The torn pieces of her scarf lie nearby. HOLD ON Frank's look.

:SC: EXT. MARRON ESTATE - POOLSIDE - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A nanny sits in the early morning mist, embroidering. Frank is kneeling with Fletcher beside the pool. He's putting new batteries into Fletcher's boat. Fletcher watches him as he tears off the wrapping from the batteries, much preoccupied.
</DIRECTION>
<FLETCHER>
<DIRECTION>
(watching him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's real mad at you, isn't she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLETCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stops what he's doing and just looks blankly at the batteries in his hands. There's a beat of silence.
</DIRECTION>
<FLETCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She told me she doesn't understand why you're so shitty to her...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLETCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Frank's shoulders droop and he lets out an imperceptible sigh. He gently resumes fitting the batteries, still not looking at Fletcher. In the quiet of early morning, it's almost like a confessional.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've spent a lot of time learning not to react to things like other people do. It's my job. But it doesn't always work, Fletcher... it doesn't always work.

	I'm an old man compared to you, pal, and I don't understand either. And I'm starting to get the feeling I never will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
There's a crunch of footsteps behind him. He looks around. With a big flourish, a copy of Daily Variety is put down in front of us, front page upwards.
</DIRECTION>
<NICKI>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ta Da!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKI>
<DIRECTION>
Frank takes in that it's Nicki then glances at Variety, lying on the concrete beside him. Splashed across the top, the headlines announce the day's news of the Academy Award nominations. Rachel's name is among the Best Actress nominees. The Hollywood Reporter follows. Frank picks up Variety and stares at it. Nicki stands beside him with the morning's mail under her arm.
</DIRECTION>
<NICKI>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thought you'd like to know. Everyone said she was a sure thing. Of course, you know all about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKI>
<DIRECTION>
She raises an eyebrow, gives him a look. Frank looks steadily back at her. She drops a small pile of mail beside the magazines... several letters and a small packet. She's embarrassed by Frank's gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<NICKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. That was out of line. It's none of my business... Here's today's question marks for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKI>

She turns and walks briskly back to the house. Frank watches her go, then looks slowly down to the pile. From across the pool, Fletcher watches silently, then pushes his boat out into the deep water.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SQUIRREL HILL PRODUCTIONS - JANITOR'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank is investigating the small packet, with a surgeon's precision, checking it with a stethoscope and a metal detector, sniffing at it. It has been addressed in the normal way, except that Rachel's name has been cut out of a magazine and pasted above the address. He begins carefully slicing away the wrapping. Inside is a cardboard box. The contents are still hidden by packing paper. He picks it away with tweezers. Suddenly there is a LOUD BUZZING from the box and movement in the paper. Frank drops the box into a bed of sand in a sink surrounded by sandbags. The movement slows and stops. Frank extracts the item -- it is a wind-up mechanical beaver with a hand-painted sign hung around its neck:
</DIRECTION>
<WE_LOVE_YOU_RACHEL YOUR_FANS_IN_BEAVER_PA SALLY_AND_KATE>
<DIRECTION>
The beaver's TEETH CLICK in Frank's hand. We see Frank's face. This may just have taken years off his life. He holds his hand out straight, palm downwards,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and looks at it. No tremor. Just checking. Spector's voice suddenly shouts from the next door office.

Spector confronts Frank across his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<SPECTOR>

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you ever say what's on your mind?

Spector cannot believe he's being so addressed -- especially in front the staff. The assistants stop in their tracks and look.
</DIRECTION>
<SPECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(almost shouts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's on my mind is that you're fired, Frank. She missed all her interviews yesterday because of your little date. Do you realize she stood up Barbara Walters? First you fuck up her career...

Behind Spector, out of his line of sight, Rachel and Devaney appear in the doorway with more cards. They also stop and listen.

Spector looks round, sees that Devaney and Rachel have been listening. Rachel is silent. With a curt nod of his head, Spector gestures to the assistants to leave the room. Devaney weighs in.
</DIRECTION>
<DEVANEY>

	With this high a profile, Rachel needs protection now more than ever. If he goes, you can forget Miami...

Rachel is watching them both.

Frank increases his pace to keep by Rachel's side, gently easing a path for her. Schiller scurries behind in Frank's wake. Rachel turns suddenly as a tall good-looking lifeguard appears in the throng. She eyes him appreciatively.

Schiller nods. Rachel glances at Frank, making sure he gets the point, and then she's off again. The throng gets tighter. Frank's having to work harder, steering her towards the door back into the hotel. The familiar chant starts up: "Rachel, Rachel." It's starting to resemble the frenzy of the opening scene. This time, amid the thrusting hands and clamoring faces, a few bewildered elderly guests look dazed as they are shoved forward. A child starts crying, lost in the mess of legs and Bermuda shorts. A distraught mother tries to reach him. Someone is jostled into the pool as the crowd surges again. Amid the chaos, whistles and scattered applause. Rachel drinks it all in.

Thuringer has set up a checkpoint through which all guests are passing. As they get off the elevator, they walk up to a desk manned by one of Thuringer's uniformed guards. When their names have been checked off a master list, they walk past another guard wielding a metal detector. No one likes it, but they all do it. Most of the local TV stations have sent camera crews. The handheld cameras move among the guests, their bright lights flaring. FLASHBULBS POP. It's a local media event. Frank squints as a quartz light shines straight in his face. A tall, fit, athletic-looking man raises his arms; is cleared by the metal detector. He is GREG PORTMAN.

Frank has had enough for one afternoon. He hits the Cuban low and hard. The man crumples forward, hurt, but manages to enfold Frank in an awesome bear hug. His weight carries them backward in Frank's direction. The Cuban continues moving in that direction, but Frank is no longer in his grasp. Instead, incredibly, Frank seems to have passed through the man's body and flicked him into the corner of the stairwell. The Cuban hits the wall hard. Jarred but not lost, he comes up and out wielding a long mop as if it were a baseball bat. Frank steps in and under the man's long arms and hits him four times around the chest and jaw. Each of Frank's hands lands twice, their movement is barely visible. The solid THUDDING tells the story. Frank strikes both

He senses another presence and looks to his right. Rachel sits huddled in a balcony chair. The bright moon- light illuminates her as she looks out to sea. She is wearing one of her spectacular show gowns, her hair has been brushed, and her stage makeup has been applied. But tonight it hasn't come together. It doesn't work.

A large, old, two-story house sits at the top of a slight rise, surrounded on three sides by thick, rolling woods. Sloping gently down from the house to the lake fifty yards away is a broad expanse of lawn. Snow lies on the ground and in the trees. At the edge of the lake, a dock and boathouse. An entrance road cuts out of the trees. A little TERRIER skitters to the edge of the drive BARKING. A van emerges from the trees, tires CRUNCHING through the snow. Frank's father, HERB, steps onto the front porch. He's in his mid-60's, lean, tan and fit. He's wearing a plaid shirt, jeans and cowboy boots. The van stops in front of the house. Frank steps out from the driver's seat and eyes his dad.

Rachel, munching on a raw carrot, browses a row of family photographs. The sounds of dinner being prepared come from the kitchen. We see the history of the family in the pictures; Frank as a ten-year-old baseball player with a younger Herb; Herb as Police Chief of Bend, Oregon, being given a civic award; Frank as a college football wide receiver; Herb and Katherine Farmer, all dressed up and being introduced to Jimmy Carter by Frank; the picture-perfect family home in Oregon with Katherine tending flowers. Rachel notices a photo of a smiling Henry Kissinger, talking to some female reporters. There standing shoulder-to-shoulder with him, are Frank and Portman. Portman's also smiling at the women, flirting. Frank is in a familiar pose, alert, unsmiling, vigilant. Rachel looks at the two of them for a second. Frank steps from the kitchen with an orange juice and a drink for Rachel in his hand. He watches her for a moment as she studies the photo. She turns and sees him. They lock eyes for several seconds. She smiles as he hands her the drink.

	The figure peers into the fog, gun up. He's ready, confident. He waits. Nothing. Frank, from his crouch, does something brand-new. He raises his gun into the fog in a two-handed grip, ready to fire. He holds it easily. And then he does something really strange: Frank closes his eyes. After a beat, we hear MOVEMENT. Frank, eyes still closed, swings his gun 15 degrees and FIRES TWO BLASTS. The man jumps away from a small tree that has splintered six inches from his shoulder. His eyes are wild behind his ski mask. Frightened, he suddenly crashes away in the opposite direction.

At first she doesn't see Frank; when she does she hesitates a moment, then continues down. They meet and try to sidestep each other, but twice they go in the same direction, unable to get around. Rachel, already emotionally ravaged, cracks. She begins slapping Frank hard about the face and torso. One of the first blows knocks the GLASS from his hand; it SMASHES loudly against the wall. He raises his arms in a half-hearted attempt to protect himself from the onslaught. She cries as she hits him.

As she loses the strength and the will to hit him, her blows become sloppy, weak. She sinks to the steps, sitting on them, sobbing.

Frank looks at her, shakes his head "no." Rachel puts her head in her hands and is silent for a few moments; her crying slows.

	It's bright sunshine. Fletcher is splashing noisily in the pool with a few other kids. His nanny waits patiently at the side, towels at the ready. At one side of the pool, Rachel sits, lost in thought, mourning her sister. At the other side sits Frank, also thoughtful. He, too, is trying to adjust to the tragedy for which he bears some of the responsibility.

	The guardhouse at the main gate is brilliantly illumi- nated in the distance. The guard patrols at his station. Inside, the T.V. screens flicker and glow. Perched on the top of a slight hill, Frank sits alone and motionless under a big tree. He gazes down at the gate- house, his face lit softly by the glow from its lamps. All around him the rest of the estate is quiet and tranquil in the moonlight. After a moment, another silhouetted figure slowly ap- proaches and stands beside him. It's Rachel.

	I guess you've heard what's happening. Frank nods.

In the back a spectacularly-gowned Rachel sits flanked by Devaney and Spector, both of whom, like Frank, are wearing tuxedos. Up ahead, they can all see the hubbub at the entrance: TV cameras, lights, photographers, arriving guests, two bleachers full of fans. The glare from the arc lights is almost blinding.

Rachel's smile is convincing, lovely, professional. Spector, Devaney and Tony look strained. As they enter, a WIDE SHOT from across the street shows their limo pulling ahead as the next car pulls up.

On it, the Academy Awards continue. An elaborate dance number is just concluding. The audience applauds. Beside the monitor, a large clock with a ticking second hand.

	First, I want to thank Rachel Marron. Without her support, encouragement and determination to help get an unknown songwriter heard, I wouldn't be standing here.

Tony cries out, his hands flying to his face. Portman's hand moves swiftly again, jabbing to a nerve behind Tony's ear, Tony drops like a sack. Glancing rapidly around, Portman sees all other eyes on the auditorium. He pulls the curtain around Tony's body - obscuring it.

Dozens more helpers pour onto the stage around Frank and Rachel. Rachel starts to rise on all fours and sees, as hands reach out to help her, the blood on Frank's shirt. He has taken the hits for her. But he's still on the job, gaze alert. Without taking his eyes from the audi- torium, his left arm stretches out, with some pain, to push Rachel back down. The right arm, gun in hand, sweeps the auditorium. Where is Portman? Frank can't see past the mob. Ushers fall on Frank in a heap, trying to disarm him. Security men try to pull them off.

PORTMAN Frank's bullets hit home. The first slams Portman in the chest, knocking him against the wall. The second hits the CAMERA on his shoulder, EXPLODING it around his face.

A roadie has her luggage removed from the limo and loaded aboard the plane. Devaney is trying to hurry her on board. Spector is conspicuous by his absence. As Rachel and the others prepare to get onto the plane, Tony, wearing a dark leather eyepatch, reacts to something O.S. Frank approaches from the nearby parking area. He is pale.

	There, I said it.

(looks at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll never forget what it felt like to be under your eye. Never.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't be forgetting you either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
She presses something into Frank's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here... I want you to keep this. If you ever need me, you just put this on and no matter where you are I will find you. I promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him a quick kiss and walks back toward the plane, her eyes holding Frank's. Frank opens his palm to reveal the little enamel cross. ON FRANK as the engines roar and the plane turns to taxi out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ROAR of the plane becomes APPLAUSE.

:SC: EXT. CONCERT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel's face in FULL FRAME, bathed in light and the applause of a huge audience.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you... Thank you... Now I want to sing you an old song, but it's a new favorite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
As the music begins, Rachel stands alone in front of the band, mike in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, this song used to make me feel sad... But it doesn't anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel pauses. The audience is still.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now it just reminds me of someone very special... This is for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel begins to sing the song 'WHAT BECOMES OF THE BROKEN HEARTED' - slow and sweet. It's the song she and Frank danced to. As a VERSE TRAILS OFF --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CLERMONT HOTEL (IOWA CITY) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a Rotary Dinner. The CAMERA TRACKS ALONG the front of the head table which runs from one side of the room to the other.
</DIRECTION>
<ROTARY_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our speaker this evening, the honorable congressman from the fifth district, Galen Windsor, has been a lone, courageous, voice... he alone has challenged those who have linked organized crime with legitimate business throughout our state.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROTARY_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
STILL TRACKING, we see the Rotary President as he nods to a distinguished-looking gentleman one seat to his right. On the wall a sign identifying the hotel and a club banner which reads -- "THE ROTARY CLUB OF IOWA CITY." The CAMERA CONTINUES to TRACK and the Rotary President goes OUT OF FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<ROTARY_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But first our benediction will be delivered by Reverend Phillip Hardy of the First Presbyterian Church.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROTARY_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
STILL TRACKING we see the Reverend get up as the men around him bow their heads.
</DIRECTION>
<REVEREND_HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heavenly Father, please bless us today as we meet in friendship and duty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVEREND_HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
STILL TRACKING as we REACH the end of the table.
</DIRECTION>
<REVEREND_HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Lord, whatever dangerous endeavors those among us may take, let them never be without your sanctuary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVEREND_HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA STOPS. Standing against the wall behind the table is Frank. As the Reverend's prayer goes on, all heads are bowed to receive the benediction. All heads but Frank's. The CAMERA MOVES IN TIGHT ON his face.
</DIRECTION>
<REVEREND_HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... For all we know in our hearts that even though we may walk through the valley of the shadow of death, you are with us... guiding and protecting us. Amen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVEREND_HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
The Reverend's final words segue into Rachel's song. Frank's searching gaze around the room is arrested for a moment as though reacting to Rachel's voice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CONCERT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel ends a phrase. She dabs at the corner of her eye as she continues the song that still binds them together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ROTARY CLUB DINNER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERY CLOSE ON FRANK His expression, so intense in the opening scene of the film, is softer now. Rachel's voice continues as Frank carefully scans the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:

<DIRECTION>
THE END
