:SC: SUPER 8
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER BLACK WE HEAR THE DULL SOUNDS OF INDUSTRY; A MUFFLED MASS OF MACHINES, GEARS, STEAM. FADE IN ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SIGN. Twelve feet across. Painted decades earlier, grim- covered black, white and red. It reads in large 40's era, hand-painted type, "SAFETY IS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN!" Then: "DAYS SINCE LAST ACCIDENT" and below that, NUMBERS, painted on hanging metal cards. Four possible digits can hang here, but there are currently three: "784."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOWLY PUSH IN on this sign as a MAN APPEARS, rising on a forklift, in a greasy, monochromatic work jumpsuit. Removes the "4" from its hooks. Then removes the "8." Then the "7."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, he hangs up a number. "1."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man LOWERS out of frame as we creep even closer to the hanging single digit, wondering about the accident... and how bad it was and the FACTORY SOUNDS GROW DEAFENING -- AND AS IT BUILDS TO A CRESCENDO, WE CUT TO SILENT BLACKNESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - PORCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shiny black loafers. Black pants, three inches too long. We BOOM UP, stopping at a boy's hand reaching into the black suit jacket pocket. Pulls out a WOMAN'S GOLD NECKLACE with a LOCKET. He holds the locket. Rubs it gently with his thumb. CONTINUE TO BOOM UP. We now SEE THE BOY'S FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is JOE LAMB, 14. On the precarious edge of adulthood. He looks out at the horizon with stricken eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves forward and we PAN, so we're BEHIND HIM NOW. In the frosty distance, past countless leafless trees and modest homes, is a STEEL MILL. Smokestacks and structures. The lifeblood of this late 70's town.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAMB LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on CHARLES' MOTHER AND FATHER, funeral attire. She looks out of the window sadly; heartsick and concerned. Behind her, he picks at his plate of food.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so worried for that boy.

Then, BOYS' HUSHED VOICES:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAMB DINING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLES (we'll see him in a moment) LEANS FORWARD, reaching for food on a buffet table. Charles' leaning has revealed CARY, a blonde kid in a dark blue sport jacket and tie, and PRESTON, pale and smart, in a DARK SWEATER:
</DIRECTION>
<CARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think was in the coffin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARY>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, shut up.

</CARY>
<PRESTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm eating macaroni salad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESTON>
<DIRECTION>
We now see CHARLES, big and in an ill-fitting BLACK SUIT, and MARTIN, good looking, in a shirt and tie, at the buffet:
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was thinking that, about the coffin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how you guys can eat.

</MARTIN>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try a Goddamn turkey roll and you'll discover how. They're delicious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
CUT WIDE TO REVEAL that we are in a modest Ohio house in the year 1979. At a wake. Forty-odd friends and neighbors, darkly dressed. Quiet discussions. Some crying.
</DIRECTION>
<CARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Either nothing was in there, or like whatever they scraped up--

</CHARLES_MARTIN>
<PRESTON_CHARLES>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey-- Lucy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
They look up -- in the other room, a dog (mutt, Lucy) has jumped on a guest, for food. JACKSON LAMB, Joe's father, 42, black suit, moves to the dog, walks her out of shot.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bet Joe's not gonna wanna do my movie anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<CARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARY>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you think why? The story. It's about the living dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<PRESTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His mother's not a zombie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESTON>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But she's dead, shithead.

<CARY>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WIDE SHOT. A grey, snow-covered, early February day here in LILLIAN, OHIO. Many cars are parked outside the house, notably a SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SQUAD CAR in the driveway. Joe, a vision of black on white in his too-big black suit, now sits on a small swing set he hasn't used in years.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He solemnly looks down at the LOCKET he still holds. No doubt trying to reconcile the fact that it no longer hangs around his mother's neck. Then a SOUND. Joe looks up. A CAR has arrived -- a distinct 1968 BUICK GSX -- a YELLOW MUSCLE CAR with a BLACK RACING STRIPE down its center. Joe watches as the car sits there for a moment. Then a MAN gets out. Someone Joe has seen before, but doesn't know personally. A man in his early 40's, in jeans and a work shirt. He's not exactly sloppy, but if you look closely, you could tell he's been drinking. This is LOUIS DAINARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe watches Louis carefully as he moves to the house, to the porch and inside the house. Joe's eyes glued on the house for a while. Then he looks back to the locket. He OPENS IT, and stares at the picture inside (which we do not see). And as he stares, TEARS come to his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment broken by the SOUND OF RAISED VOICES -- Joe turns toward the house. After a beat, the SOUND of something BREAKING -- something glass. Then the house BACK DOOR bursts open -- Joe cranes his neck -- and what he sees he'll never forget: his father, Jack, leading an in-pain and HAND-CUFFED Louis Dainard from the house and into the rear of the squad car. When he slams the back door, he sees Joe. Sort of freezes as their eyes lock. But Jack's more uncomfortable THAN COMFORTING:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be home soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
And Jack gets into the car and drives away. Joe watches them drive off. And after a beat, he looks down at the locket again. Mom's just gone. Finally he CLOSES IT -- and we hear an oddly LOUD SNAP and our SCREEN GOES BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over darkness: APPLAUSE -- then a LONE VOICE: "I want you... to want me!" DRUMS kick in, CHEAP TRICK BLASTS. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hundreds of KIDS eagerly leave their last day of school for the year, winter a memory. GIRLS emphatically embrace each other good-bye. BOYS run off, just happy to be out. Lots of "Have a great summer!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOLLY WITH Joe, who walks through the crowd alone, backpack on shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Charles is there, red-faced -- he hands Joe PAGES:
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was the longest day ever-- here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this?

<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>

<JOE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hear Martin barfed in the hall?

<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, does that guy ever not barf? Keep reading.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<JOE_CHARLES>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it might help make my movie better. I need two things: a better story and production value.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
They head across the street to the 7-Eleven. Suddenly Cary is there, a BURN WRAP on his right arm now:
</DIRECTION>
<CARY_CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
Martin booted all over his locker, it was the grossest one yet-- Let Joe focus, he's reading.
</DIRECTION>
<CARY_CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
After he ate two boxes of Mike and Ikes-- never seen so many colors in my life. Will you shut up a minute?
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's gonna play the wife, Jen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way -- did I tell you what she did with my top hat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah, that was bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CARY>
	<DIALOGUE>

As they head to the doors:

<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was returning that book on codes and ciphers-- she was in the silent reading section -- I thought, "Screw it." So I asked her if she'd play Hathaway's wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You talked to Alice Dainard really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not supposed to talk at all in the silent reading section--

</CARY>
<CHARLES_CARY>

Shut up. It's for "silent reading."

<CHARLES_JOE>

	Maybe she just wants to be in a good movie, y'ever think of that?

CHARLES' SUPER 8 MOVIE BEING PROJECTED ON A MOVIE SCREEN. SLOWLY PUSH IN ON THE SCREEN: kids earnestly playing adults:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUILDING 47 - DAY (SUPER 8)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DARKNESS. Then a DOOR OPENS. It's DETECTIVE HATHAWAY (played by MARTIN), in silhouette. He enters. It's an old WAREHOUSE, dirty, cobwebbed, crowded with CRATES, old MACHINERY, CHEMICAL BARRELS and JUNK. The Detective turns on his FLASHLIGHT -- aims it -- sweeps it across the space -- the light HITTING THE LENS for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Detective walks through the spooky, dark space. A low, growling industrial DRONE makes the whole place oddly creepy. Then: A SOUND -- quick but strange -- slithering -- and the Detective aims his flashlight -- tense. He watches. Waits. We see where he's aiming the light, which cuts through THICK DUST in the air. It's an old office door, ajar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hathaway is still. Nervous. Watching the door -- waiting for it to open... and then -- from the darkness BEHIND HIM -- a terrifying open-mouthed ZOMBIE APPEARS -- ATTACKS -- and the Detective TURNS -- his flashlight KNOCKED TO THE GROUND -- and Hathaway falls too -- the wild-eyed gaping-mouthed Zombie DROOLING as it tries to bite Hathaway's flesh -- we recognize that the Zombie is CARY. Actually, not a bad performance. The Detective pulls out his GUN -- but the Zombie grabs his wrist -- they wrestle with the gun -- the Zombie wanting to rip into Hathaway's neck -- but Hathaway sees three SHARP-TIPPED NAILS sticking out of an old piece of WOODEN CRATE -- and after a significant struggle, Hathaway PUSHES THE ZOMBIE BACK so his head is IMPALED BY THE NAILS -- which we see ENTER HIS SKULL!!! The Zombie (stuck to the crate via the nails) SCREAMS AND DIES and just at Hathaway catches his breath THE IMAGE DIMS AND FREEZES; the projector has just been STOPPED. We are in:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHARLES' ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Board games, books, records, a stereo, toys, and magic. Super 8 film equipment and paraphernalia. Movie ONE SHEETS hang: CARRIE, HALLOWEEN, EARTHQUAKE and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. No sports memorabilia. Charles turns on the lights, looks anxiously at Joe:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a good zombie murder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but it's not a st-- thank you for that-- it's not a story yet. Older kids enter this film festival -- I'm competing with fifteen- and sixteen-year-olds, who have better stories and cars and production value, I've got nothing!

	Jesus, that's what I've been explaining: in the scene we're filming tonight, the wife telling the detecting she's scared for him, that she loves him-- Charles! -- I'M COMING!!! -- so when he investigates the zombie stuff you'll be scares -- you'll feel something -- because you don't want him to die because they love each other!

INT. CHARLES' KITCHEN - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hectic FAMILY: Charles' mother cooks. JEN, his smoking hot 17-year-old sister, ANGRILY sets the table where his father pays bills. Pale 15-year-old sister PEG does a PUZZLE. Twin 9- YEAR-OLD BOYS bicker over an action figure. TV in the living room plays a MATCH GAME. Joe and Charles enter.

Joe leaves; Charles' parents share a look of pity for Joe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHARLES' HOUSE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An anomalous moment in this small steel town: the sun sets through the distant trees and it's beautiful, despite the distant belching SMOKESTACKS. Joe leaves Charles' house and CROSSES THE STREET to his own. SQUAD CAR in the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOE'S HOUSE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe comes into the kitchen through the BACK DOOR. Lucy the dog greets him. A TV is head somewhere. NIGHTLY NEWS reports on the ONGOING CLEAN-UP OF THREE MILE ISLAND. A half-empty BEER BOTTLE on the table. Joe peeks into the living room -- but no one's there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe looks around for his father. Heads down the hallway. Stops when he sees something off camera. We HOLD on Joe's face, sort of quietly stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we se his POV: Jack, Joe's father, in uniform pants and T- shirt, sits on the edge of the bathtub, head in his hands, quietly CRYING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe is stunned, staring at his dad. But he can't look away. And when he finally starts to head off, Jack looks up. Joe's mind scrambles for something to say, but Jack sniffles, gets it together, quick. Puts on a strong face.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey -- I'll be out in a minute--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Joe nods as Jack forces a smile and closes the bathroom door. HOLD ON JOE. Stunned and heartsick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAROL'S DINER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Commodores quietly sing "EASY" on the PA. Joe and his father, in civvies, sit beside each other at the counter. Jack eats a beef stew and reviews office paperwork, not looking at his son. Joe eats a grilled cheese, deeply lonely and not even knowing it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack pulls out a PAMPHLET, and places it on the table:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a six-week program, hands-on training with college coaches.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll like it. I know I did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Joe looks at the pamphlet for HEWITT SPORTS CAMP. Images of happy, smiling, healthy ATHLETIC KIDS. Not his thing.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I was going to have the summer for myself--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Things have obviously changed for us. And it'd be good for you to spend some time with kids who don't run around with-- cameras and MONSTER MAKE-UP--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta help Charles finish his movie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have nothing against your friends. I like your friends. Except Cary, who can't stop lighting things on fire. You'll like it there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(FINALLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's what we both need.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Joe looks back at the pamphlet -- his other hand coming up from under the table -- and Jack sees that Joe is HOLDING HIS MOTHER'S LOCKET. Jack wants to cry again. He wants to throw that locket away, out of sight. But he just turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe stares at the pamphlet. PUSH IN on the photo of beaming 15-year-old KIDS. Then CUT TO THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON QUASIMODO; a plastic, painted AURORA model. RACK FOCUS to the paintbrush that comes into frame -- FOLLOW IT TO JOE, holding the brush, at his desk, making a model. A boy's room recently devoid of a mother's oversight; a mess. COMIC BOOKS and other PLASTIC MODELS, all built and painted by Joe. CARS and CREATURES and a TRAIN. His bedside CLOCK RADIO (11:56 PM) quietly plays "BAKER STREET." Then a RADIO SQUAWK - - Joe grabs a KID'S WALKIE-TALKIE:

Alice drives. The boys shoved in the back with the gear -- in front Charles struggles with his backpack and camera bags as he pulls out PAGES, arranging them. With her driving, there's an unusual, electric energy in the air. Joe eats his Twizzlers in the back, trying not to stare at Alice.

<CHARLES>

	Martin, I have a new line for you.

</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up to reveal Joe putting make-up on Alice. He walks over to Martin, Cary and Preston. Charles and Martin AD LIB.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON JOE'S TACKLE BOX, which opens. Inside is an assortment of MAKE-UPS, sponges, cotton balls, brushes, derma wax, spirit gum, and a large jar of FAKE BLOOD. Joe is preparing to make up Alice, who sits in front of him, watching carefully as Joe prepares BASE MAKE-UP on a sponge. He looks to her. A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Alice shakes her head: nope. Joe starts stippling the make-up onto her face. He is now, via sponge, touching the face of a girl he's admired for some time. After a beat:
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My dad works at the mill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
And she looks at him. Almost as if she were looking for something. Joe stops stippling. The tension is almost too much for him to bear.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Close you eyes. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He indicates the sponge: it's for the make-up. She does. Joe starts applying the make-up to her eyelids. There's something provocative for Joe, being so close to Alice, with her eyes closed. Then, PRE-LAP:

Charles is stunned -- almost crying -- can't talk -- and as he searches, behind him, a LIGHT --

Charles watches, beaming with excitement. Joe holds the boom, looks to Charles to make sure it sounds okay; this is when he notices something in the distance. HEADLIGHTS. A quarter mile away, a vehicle drives along the horizon. A beat. But the train is APPROACHING -- GETTING LOUDER -- which makes Joe turn back toward the train -- the thing almost upon them -- LOUDER AND LOUDER, so the actors begin to YELL over the GROWING DIN:

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IT'S OVER. Just the odd, dying CHUGS and SCREECH-SCREECH- SCREECH of TRAIN WHEELS running out of momentum, HISSES of STEAM, the unnatural bending of steel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the DUST, JOE lies frightened on the ground, eyes tightly shut. His mind races, his heart pounds -- and then: A LOUD METAL BANG! Joe stands up fast, faces a MOUNTAIN of twisted STEEL -- UPSIDE-DOWN TRAIN CARS PILED FRIGHTENINGLY around him. Just another few feet and he would've been crushed. But what was that sound? Something metal? Then again: SLAM! Joe BACKS UP, afraid -- it was almost a LABORED GROAN -- MECHANICAL or ANIMAL?! A crazy SCREECH, another BANG, then AGAIN and AGAIN!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Joe TIGHTLY GRIPPING HIS NECKLACE LOCKET IN HIS HAND -- THEN: CRASH! -- AWFUL-LOUD -- and a TWISTED TEN-FOOT SQUARE SHEET OF METAL EXPLODES FROM BEHIND THE OVERTURNED TRAIN CARS -- Joe covers his head as the metal STABS THE GROUND, twenty feet away: a TRAIN SLIDING DOOR. Joe turns to see it -- stunned -- then back to the direction of the NOISE -- but it is GONE. Nothing.

</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
Through the debris, steel and dust. Joe moves forward -- Charles, shaken, eyes wide, appears through the thick dust --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe moves forward, looking at, under a train WHEEL ASSEMBLY... BLOOD. A PUDDLE OF BLOOD and Joe's heart sinks as he moves toward it -- another woman he loves, crushed?! Charles and Preston and Cary see the blood --

Martin, still sick, calls out:
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN_CARY>
<DIRECTION>
-- what? Guys, what is it? ... shit...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe moves closer to the blood -- heartsick -- on the verge of DEEP, REAL TEARS -- everything stops -- but then:
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- what's all that blood?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe WHIPS AROUND -- standing in the dusty mess is ALICE -- shaken, but absolutely alive. Joe just BEAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the blood? -- did someone get hurt--?

</DIRECTION>
<KIDS>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe, wait -- maybe you shouldn't touch -- what are you-- careful!
	</DIALOGUE>

Joe pulls out his CRUSHED MAKE-UP KIT. He brightens:
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my fake blood. It's fake!

</JOE>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this stuff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE NOTICES THAT HE'S HOLDING THE NECKLACE. Joe notices this and POCKETS IT self-consciously. PRESTON calls out:
</DIRECTION>
<PRESTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guys, what are these things?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESTON>
<DIRECTION>
Joe looks -- they all move to Preston (except Cary, who heads off): CRATES have spilled from a nearby split car; many shattered, revealing THOUSANDS OF SMALL WHITE-METAL CUBES which now litter the ground. Joe kneels, picks one up:
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, don't touch it, what are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They look like white Rubik's cubes or something. They're heavy like metal or something. There's like a billion of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
It's just a few inches per side, an UNUSUAL DESIGN. Behind them, having walked up the ANGLED SIDES of overturned train cars, Cary calls out:
</DIRECTION>
<CARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guys, get up here. You can see everything from up here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARY>
<DIRECTION>
They move up the mass of metal, revealing a VAST VIEW OF THE WRECK. It seems to stretch on forever. It is SOBERING.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES_CARY>

Oh my God. ... Look at that...
</DIRECTION>
<PRESTON>

<DIRECTION>
Joe's seen it. He points. Chilled.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Thrown fifty yards from the main wreckage is THE PICK-UP TRUCK. SHEARED IN HALF UPON IMPACT and lying in the overgrown grass.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can a pick-up truck derail a train? That's impossible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<PRESTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Obviously it isn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESTON>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM UP from behind the SHATTERED PICK-UP as the kids approach from the wreckage. PUSH IN ON THEM as they arrive at the truck and STOP; what they see makes Joe's heart pound -- they're stunned -- all of them. They just stop. Finally:

WE SEE NOW: it's DR. WOODWARD -- 75, seat-belted, bloody and unconscious, stuck inside the crushed wreckage. Alice moves closer -- scared and sad for him --

Joe moves next to Alice, who reaches out and gently NUDGES him -- you keep expecting him to suddenly grab her --
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Dr. Woodward?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
But he's apparently dead; when she nudges him, he LEANS, his arm drops limp from the steering wheel, where he was HOLDING A PAPER, that has now fallen onto the ground. Joe picks it up. UNFOLDS IT: it's an OLD MAP -- thin, off-white paper. They hold it up, the map now backlit and obscuring Woodward. We see MARKER WRITING ON IT -- a BLACK LINE, from Nevada to Dayton -- and NUMBERS written along the way.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESTON_JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Map of the contiguous United States... -- what's the writing?
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>

-- dates and times. -- what's that line across?
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a schedule for the train.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
But a SHADOW has appeared: A TREMBLING HAND -- before they can react, it RIPS THE MAP AWAY -- THEY ALL SCREAM AS OLD DR. WOODWARD IS REVEALED, BLOODY EYES OPEN, in a DAZE:
</DIRECTION>
<DR_WOODWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- who-- who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_WOODWARD>
<DIRECTION>
They're all speechless for a moment. Finally, too loudly:
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Woodward! It's Charles Kaznyk! From fourth period! You've been in an accident!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
BUT WOODWARD HAS REACHED INTO HIS JACKET AND PULLED OUT A GUN -- THE KIDS JUMP BACK, STUNNED --
</DIRECTION>
<DR_WOODWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They will kill you. Do not speak of this -- or you -- and your parents - - will die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_WOODWARD>
<DIRECTION>
We're on Joe's stunned face -- but DISTANT VOICES make him turn his head: hundreds of yards away, through the wreck, FIGURES WITH FLASHLIGHTS APPROACH FAST --
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- guys, look --

The rest turn to look -- their minds are racing, all of them:

My dad will de-ball me! Let's get out of here!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now they're SPRINTING -- FLASHLIGHT MEN getting closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charles arrives on the platform, grabs his camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice hurries past, hunting for her keys in that big purse -- she eyes the FLASHLIGHT MEN getting closer:
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MOVE YOUR ASS, WE GOTTA GO!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe grabs his make-up kit -- another duffel -- runs for the car, past a whining Charles.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GET IN THE CAR!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
As the FLASHLIGHT MEN APPROACH, Joe runs and gets in the front seat, the other boys in back -- Alice SLAMS the car into REVERSE, SCREECH-BACKS UP, narrowly avoids debris, then RIDES OFF -- the FLASHLIGHT MEN arrive -- SOLDIERS -- their adrenaline pumping. One man who WALKS UP TO THE CAMERA, eyeing the vanishing car with intense suspicion: COLONEL NELEC. He then looks to the ground in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON A FRESH, EMPTY YELLOW SUPER 8 FILM BOX. Nelec steps to it, picks it up. Looks at it. Then back up at the disappearing car. We PUSH IN ON HIS BURNING EYES AND --

EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

CRANE DOWN as the Buick pulls up. The dusty boys pile out. They all kind of look at each other. What a night. Charles, who looks at Joe for a beat, holds up his defunct camera on the tripod. Joe nods.

Alice finds something on the passenger seat and holds it out.

<DIRECTION>
Pull back WIDE to see Joe's room -- while in the FOREGROUND is his desk, crowded with stuff. In focus, however, is the CUBED OBJECT he took from the crash site. As the shot progresses, you may notice that THE CUBE HAS CHANGED SHAPE; THE VOLUME IS THE SAME, BUT THE CORNERS HAVE EXTENDED.

The condition of Woodward, who has taught at Lillian Middle School for the past six years, remains unknown.

KEEP MOVING OVER THEM, to Martin and Alice, who were on camera. Beyond them, in the valley, the TRAIN CRASH seems to go forever. MILITARY TRUCKS, TENTS and SOLDIERS. HELICOPTERS buzz in the distant sky. Joe moves over to Alice, who looks out at the crash. During all this:

A community CORKBOARD. Joe posts up a piece of paper; we SEE IT NOW IN CLOSE-UP. It's a MISSING DOG SIGN FOR LUCY. We're on Joe's face as he finishes pinning it up -- when something he sees makes him stop. He slowly takes a step back. Then another... his eyes glued to the board.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then we see the REVERSE -- SLOWLY PULLING BACK -- REVEALING THAT THERE ARE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF BRAND NEW "DOG MISSING" SIGNS POSTED ON THE BOARD. It's COVERED in them. Joe is so stunned, he doesn't notice the MILITARY TRUCKS that pass in the background behind him.

Joe has heard this and DROPPED HIS FLASHLIGHT -- the men all turn, silent. Joe, on the spot:

</ROONEY>
<DIRECTION>
In the cherry picker bucket, Rooney works the controls. He begins LIFTING; a WIDE SHOT shows him rising to the bare utility pole STEPDOWN TRANSFORMER. When Rooney finally gets to the top, with gloves hands, he inspects the transformer. After a moment, though, he stops. HEARS something else, past the sound of electricity. He looks over toward the SALVAGE YARD. Except it's mostly hidden by the trees. From here, Rooney can only see the tops of the JUNK PILES. A small METALLIC CRASH. Then ANOTHER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooney cranes his neck to get a view. Another METALLIC CRASH, this time GLASS BREAKING, too. Then, in the distance, at the middle of the salvage yard, SOMETHING FLIES INTO THE AIR, FALLING AND LANDING WITH A CLANG-THUNK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooney strains his eyes to see -- what the hell was that? A tin can? A piece of a fender? Hard to tell from here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, thrown into the air: A CAR TIRE. It lands with a THUD. Rooney then uses the bucket controls -- MOVES BACKWARD AND UP -- a touch higher toward the transformer -- not exactly watching how close he is getting. He stops. Watches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ENTIRE JUNKED MOTORCYCLE flies into the air, discarded, twirling, and CRASH LANDS, out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooney is stunned. As the METALLIC RUMMAGING SOUNDS CONTINUE, Rooney moves the bucket EVEN HIGHER -- when suddenly his bucket BEEP-BEEPS LOUDLY -- a warning he's too high -- and he suddenly stops it and the BEEPING STOPS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But so do the rummaging sounds. SILENCE, save for the eerie HUM OF POWER. He waits. Nothing. Wants a better view, so he begins to LOWER THE BUCKET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're in a WIDE SHOT, seeing his DESCEND, PAINFULLY SLOWLY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then we're in a LONG LENS CLOSE UP of Rooney as he SLOWLY DROPS -- TIGHT ON HIM as he's looking over toward the salvage yard -- and it takes us a minute to realize there's fucking SOMETHING BEHIND HIM -- SO BIG WE DIDN'T SEE IT -- COMING OUT OF THE SHADOWS -- IT'S GOT MUSCLE AND FLESH AND IT MAKES AN UNGODLY SOUND AND IT INSTANTLY GRABS HIM -- THE TRUCK ROCKS AS WE CUT INSIDE THE CAB OF THE TRUCK, LOOKING OUT THE WINDSHIELD -- KEEEEEEESH!!! IT SPIDERS AS ROONEY'S LEGS IMPACT THE GLASS AND SUDDENLY WE'RE IN A WIDE SHOT OF THE CHERRY PICKER, ROCKING BACK AND FORTH IN INCREASINGLY SMALLER MOVEMENTS, UNTIL THE TRUCK IS MOTIONLESS. Empty. Alone.

INT. JOE'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens of his messy, motherless room. Joe and Alice enter. He could not be more self-conscious. He moves stacks of comic, tosses some dirty clothes behind the bed -- pair of underwear and socks. He closes the closet and hangs a bath towel on his desk chair. She looks around sa she enters. The light dim, intimate.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh gawd, I didn't clean up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe quickly moves a pile of papers and books from the desk to the floor; NOTEBOOKS AND SCHOOL WORK spill out and we get a GLIMPSE of some "B-MINUSES" and other "C-PLUSES" in RED.

Joe, embarrassed, hides them, then moves to his MODELS:

<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Euro Gray...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are so many different grays, it's crazy. And you pour a little onto like a paper plate. Then you take a dry brush and you just dip it in, then you brush on the paper, so the paint's barely on the brush. Then you make small brush strokes on the model. Little ones, like where the wear and tear would be. Around the wheels. Or where the doors would slide. Then you do it again, like with Camouflage Gray-- or here, I used Insignia Red to make it look like there was another coat of paint on there before. Like they painted over it, but you could see it scratched off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Lost in thought, he looks at her. Suddenly self-conscious.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that necklace?

	My dad gave it to her the day I was born. She wears it all the time. Used to.

INT. WOODWARD'S HOUSE - DAY

A dozen OFFICERS go through HUNDREDS OF CARDBOARD BOXES of documents. Books and personal belongings are put into boxes, taken from the house. Overmyer enters, crosses to Nelec, who reviews a folder.

Behind them, a WINDOW, showing the street, where Jack insists Joe get into the car. Nelec looks out -- sees Jack take Joe by the arm, grab the tripod and head to his squad car.

EXT. WOORWARD'S HOUSE - DAY

As Jack gets out, he sees the kids and isn't happy. He moves toward Joe and his friends:

<DIRECTION>
(TO JACK)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Mr. Lamb!

Joe spins around as Jack arrives, grabs his camera from Charles and saying firmly, to Joe:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in the car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Joe is stunned -- instantly humiliated in front of Alice -- he's taken back to the squad car --
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-- Mr. Lamb? That's your camera, but technically, that's my film--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack OPENS the car's back door -- Joe gets in -- Jack SLAMS it shut, then throws the camera and tripod into the passenger seat and SLAMS that door, heading to the house, leaving Joe in the back. Nelec heads outside -- Jack moves to him:
</DIRECTION>
<NELEC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would like to help you out deputy. I really would. But we operate on a need to know basis.

INT. SQUAD CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe, his breathing heavying, sits in the car, heart pounding, watching his father move over to talk to Nelec, close again. Then he looks over at his friends -- Charles giving him a "WHAT THE FUCK?!" Look. Alice watches him sympathetically. She mouths to him a guilty, "...is it me...?" And Joe shakes his head: "No." But we -- and she -- know better.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY

The squad car pulls up. Jack gets out, Joe follows -- THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL THAT WE ARE:

INT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Door opens. Jack enters, then lets Joe pass him. Joe closes the door hard and says, angrily, but restrained:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is new. All this. For the both of us. Dealing with-- all this, just us. So I'm going to make this as clear and simple as I can: You're not friends with Alice Dainard. When I say no, I don't mean maybe. I don't mean yes. I mean no. I've known Louis Dainard for alotta years-- he's been nothing but trouble. Your mother used to say he's not a bad guy, he just needs a chance, he's just sad - - well I tried to be good to him, but I can't. Not anymore. I will not allow him or his daughter in this house. I will not allow you spending time with her, doing projects or whatever it is that you're doing. THAT'S IT. I hope we're clear.

Jack turns to leave -- but Joe, enraged, says:
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>

	We're not clear.

Jack stops -- stunned -- Joe's heart pounds --

Jack moves CLOSE to Joe -- intimidating -- Joe steps back -- Jack is fucking intense:

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You listen to me, I've got twelve thousand people in this town that are scared out of their minds-- they've got one person they can rely on -- it used to be someone else, but now it's just me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack suddenly stops himself, realizing what he's saying. And to whom he's saying it. But somehow, in this moment, he can't be a better father than law officer. Not yet. More upset at himself than Joe, he heads out.

Joe rides UP A HILL -- BOOM UP -- REVEAL THE TOWN CEMETERY.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe sits, his back against his mother's grave. Holds her OPEN LOCKET, staring at it. He's just come here for comfort. But then -- a SOUND -- and Joe turns. Deep and low, in the distance. Joe is motionless. HEARS IT AGAIN. He stands, pulls out his flashlight -- aims the beam down ROWS OF GRAVES, toward the big CARETAKER'S SHED in the distance. Another INTENSE, LOW SOUND -- then a high pitch HIT, like METAL ON WOOD and Joe backs up, nervous. Another odd sound -- then ANOTHER -- which TRANSITIONS US TO:

Jack's squad car arrives at the abandoned airfield.

Jack's car pulls up. He gets out of the car. Suddenly the three large MILITARY TRUCKS' HEADLIGHTS COME ON -- all aimed at Jack -- he is blinded -- tries to see --
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello--?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>

And now BODIES are seen of SOLDIERS, holding and aiming WEAPONS. Then, a VOICE over a TRUCK PA:

<DIRECTION>
INT. MILITARY MEDICAL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON NELEC. Past an IV and medical machinery. He's looking at someone we don't yet see. In the background, Overmyer stands, watching. Nelec is quiet, simple:
</DIRECTION>
<NELEC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want any more trouble. Do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NELEC>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see who he's talking to. IT'S DR. WOODWARD. Battered and scraped, he lies in a medical bed, afraid, but defiant.
</DIRECTION>
<NELEC>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been going through your belongings, looking for evidence. Of what you knew, how you knew it... and who else might know.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember you. In the lab. And I recall we didn't see eye to eye, but that's no excuse for doing what you did here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NELEC>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Woodward swallows. Feels that his time on Earth is coming to an end no matter what he does here. By the door, Overmyer is quietly putting on his BLACK GLOVES.
</DIRECTION>
<NELEC>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So in the spirit of moving forward and avoiding more trouble, tell us where you put your research. I know you had someone document the crash that night. Tell me who that was and I'll help you, I swear to God. On my mother's life -- if you help us now, we will take care of you.

<DIRECTION>
Nelec offers a vague, searching smile. But Woodward will not - - not ever -- relent. So. Nelec moves to the door, he remains FACING CAMERA, his back to Woodward, as Overmyer moves to the bed. PUSH IN ON NELEC'S FACE, UNDERSTANDING HIS TRUE NATURE AS WE CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
INT. JOE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe sleeps, power still out. Then, a KNOCK. He wakes up. Another KNOCK. His window. He moves to it. Opens it. It's Alice. Joe is half asleep, but also stunned. Very quietly:
</DIRECTION>
<ALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- are you-- were you sleeping?

</ALIE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before, earlier, b-- no, you okay?

And Alice climbs in. Joe sits on the floor. Alice does too. It's odd and silent for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Power's still out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Room's still messy.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thinking. I wanted to tell you something, before tomorrow -- Don't let Charles blow up your train.

Joe stares, amazed at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>

	I don't think it's right, do you? I know he's your friend, but he's so BOSSY--

</ALICE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He can be sorta li-- I've known him since Kindergarten, though--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He shouldn't always get what he wants. I mean, who always gets what they want? -- I know I don't know you at all. Even though... it sort of feels like I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you not... feel like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- no, I totally do, I'm just... sort of in shock at this whole CONVERSATION--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
And the POWER RETURNS -- Joe's CLOCK LIGHT goes on behind him -- but more chilling, the PROJECTOR comes back on; the SILENT HOME MOVIE OF HIS MOTHER PLAYS. Joe crawls to the projector to stop it -- but:
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- no, keep it-- please --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Alice moves closer to the screen. Joe sits behind her. She watches the film. Can't take her eyes away.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... is that her?

</ALICE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>

And as Alice watches, we GENTLY PUSH IN... as tears start to fill her eyes. Behind her, at a near WHISPER:
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... it's so weird watching her like this, like she's still here...
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... she used to look at me, this way... like really look. And I just... knew I was there. That I existed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
A tear drops down Alice's face, though Joe can't see that. Finally, quietly:
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He drank that morning. My dad.

<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mom took it for him. The day of the accident.

<DIRECTION>
Watching his mother, Joe is quietly stunned. Finally, eyes wet, Alice turns to Joe.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I know he wishes it was him. Instead of her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(HARD BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and sometimes I wish it was, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe just stares at her... heartsick and speechless. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't say that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's your dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, the SUPER 8 movie ENDS: the film FLIPFLIPFLIPS. Joe turns off the projector -- but a SOUND REMAINS. A sort of SHUDDER-HUM. Joe unplugs the projector, but the sound remains. Then they look: THE SHUDDERING IS COMING FROM THE CUBE HE TOOK FROM THE CRASH SITE, sitting on his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe and Alice move to it. He turns on his desk lamp. The cube VIBRATES, almost imperceptibly.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE_JOE>
<DIRECTION>
-- has this--? -- no.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe opens a drawer, grabs a paintbrush -- he touches the cube -- the thing SHUDDERS ON ITS OWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are amazed. They get LOW -- eyes at desk level -- the SHUDDERING INCREASES IN PITCH AND VOLUME -- he reaches out to touch it with his finger, but suddenly the cube BULLETS AWAY - - ACROSS THE ROOM -- AND BLASTS THROUGH THE WALL, LEAVING A FIVE-INCH HOLE IN THE WALL! She screams -- they both fall to the floor, STUNNED -- PUSH IN ON Joe, his heart pounding. He moves to the wall -- looks through the hole: in the distance, trees and the TOWN WATER TOWER.

They watch for a moment as the TRAIN CRASH HAPPENS -- but it's SO SUDDEN, SO FAST, the camera picks up almost nothing. Within a moment, the camera is on its side, filming the SETTLING DEBRIS. Charles moves forward, so the film is now partially BEING PROJECTED ON HIM.

But Joe has slapped Charles' arm, his eyes locked to the screen -- Charles looks too -- AND NOW WE SEE IT: through the BROKEN CAMERA LENS -- SOMETHING MOVES -- SOMETHING BIG -- FROM THE TRAIN CAR, THROUGH THE WRECKAGE -- what the hell is it?

Windows SHATTER -- Charles and Cary -- seatbelts removed -- LAND ON JOE AND MARTIN! The THREE SOLDIERS hit the window- floor painfully -- Hernandez so hard he's INSTANTLY UNCONSCIOUS! THE BUS IS NOW MOTIONLESS ON ITS SIDE, OPEN DOOR UP. Nelec rises. Scared, but pissed.

The REAR WHEELS of the bus SCREAM in rotation -- we COUNTERMOVE with the creature as it COMES AROUND the other side, CLIMBS onto the exposed side -- METAL AND WINDOW CRUNCHES --

Joe moves to the locked bulletproof glass door -- tries the handle -- but it's never gonna open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the OTHER side of the glass, Nelec rights himself, momentarily disoriented -- breathing heavily, he moves away from the bus door to the locked glass separating him from the kids; he tries the handle, but it won't open for him either.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And there is Joe and Nelec, face-to-face -- Joe seeing the fear in Nelec's eyes -- his understanding that this is his fate. Somehow Nelec takes this moment to look into Joe's face -- to silently -- in a look -- repent. Instantly, Joe knows he's about to watch this man's life end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH! Nelec turns -- the creature is BUSTING the bus door -- SMASHING AT IT -- to make it BIGGER. So it can get inside. The Driver's LEG IS CAUGHT -- he's trying to get out, but cannot -- is PANICKING -- as SSSSTAB!!! The creature KILLS HIM INSTANTLY and SMASH as again it tries to WIDEN the door. Nelec WINCES -- the only conscious man on this side of the glass; the boys COWER on their side, with each monstrous hit, all their eyes on Nelec -- except Joe, who only wants to get to Alice. He sees the SHATTERED BULLETPROOF WINDOW -- above them, on what has become the "roof" of the bus.

The boys struggle to get Joe onto Martin's shoulders as, on the other side of the glass, Nelec scrambles for Hernandez's fallen SEMI-AUTO RIFLE. He grabs it and scampers back to the glass as SMASH!!! Pieces of metal and glass BURST like ice chips as the creature violently WIDENS the bus door opening--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On Charles' shoulders, Joe can reach the shattered-but-thick window -- which he must HIT -- BREAK OPEN to get out -- essentially exactly what the creature is doing, in reverse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using both fists, Joe POUNDS the window. No give.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN_CARY>
<DIRECTION>
Harder! Come on, you PUSSY!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With all his might, Joe hits the window again -- the SLIGHTEST sound of glass adjusting -- meanwhile, SLAM!!! The creature BUSTING the bus door -- PRYING it wider like a sardine can -- NELEC SITS AGAINST THE GLASS AND OPENS FIRE, FUTILELY, ON THE CREATURE. He makes a CALL on his walkie:
</DIRECTION>
<NELEC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Nelec -- use the big guns. Whatever happens to me, you take it down, you kill him --
	</DIALOGUE>
</NELEC>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can do it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
Joe hits again -- so does the creature -- as Nelec RUNS OUT OF AMMO. That was never really hope anyway. Joe hits again and CRASH! The window SHATTERS! Glass chunks RAIN DOWN on the boys -- all covering their face -- Cary seeing the CREATURE STARTING TO ENTER THE BUS --
</DIRECTION>
<CARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go! Joe, move!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARY>
<DIRECTION>
With all the boys helping, Joe pulls himself up -- outside the bus, Joe peeks out -- the fucking creature -- its back to Joe -- just fifteen feet away, focused on the door -- and Joe strains to climb out here, onto the top-side of the bus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And as the boys climb out, the creature climbs in -- first Joe, then Charles (AD LIB DIALOGUE WITH CARY AND MARTIN: "You gotta lose some weight --" "I know!!!"), Then Cary, and Martin last -- they all jump down to the dirt -- they hear SCREAMS and turn back for a moment --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the bus, Nelec watches as the creature ENTERS THE TIGHT-FITTING BUS, SMASHING BENCHES, MAKING ITS WAY TERRIFYINGLY DOWN THE AISLE TOWARD HIM. And as the creature descends upon him, in the silence before the final lunge -- Nelec says, eerily quietly, terrified:
</DIRECTION>
<NELEC>
	<DIALOGUE>

</NELEC>
<DIRECTION>
Before he can finish, the creature fucking ATTACKS -- and it would be horrible and brutal, if the BLOOD DIDN'T SPRAY UPON THE BULLETPROOF GLASS -- WHICH OUR CAMERA IS SAFELY BEHIND -- OBSCURING THE NIGHTMARISH VIEW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the field, a distance away, the boys watch the bus SHUDDER and SHAKE. Then... silence. They see the creature burst out of the bus -- then RUN OFF -- fast and stealthy, away from them in the overgrown grass, like a native hunter. Which, of course, is partly what it is. They're sort of stunned.

Louis stares off, lost. Two AIR FORCE SOLDIERS arrive:

<SOLDIER>

Standing is hard for heartsick Louis, his legs so hurt -- suddenly JACK IS THERE, acting the role of Air Force:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey fellas, I've got orders from Colonel Nelec to personally transport this man to base.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's all yours, Staff Sergeant.

As the two Soldiers head off, Jack wraps Louis' arm over his shoulders, heads off in the other direction, as Louis looks him over, confused:

	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<JACK>

Moments later, TIGHT on a POCKET -- Joe pulls out his MOTHER'S NECKLACE. WIDEN to see that he's taken the necklace from Overmyer's dead body. Cary holds up his backpack.

The car ARRIVES: It's DONNY. He gets out of his car, wild- and red-eyed, incredibly happy to see them:

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

Joe in the lead - they turn and look back -- a massive shot of the neighborhood under fire -- houses getting BLOWN TO SHIT in collateral damage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An EXPLOSION HITS TOO CLOSE -- the boys SCREAM as they run BETWEEN HOUSES -- and WE TRACK WITH THEM -- four boys racing through a neighborhood under siege -- power GOES OUT -- and some explosions are much closer than others -- another BIG HIT and they go to a back door of a house -- and go inside --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Another CRAZY LOUD AND BRIGHT EXPLOSION -- the light fixtures sway. Charles grabs a coke on the counter.

	Charles-- that's not yours-- -- what?! I'm thirsty and I'm in a war zone!

</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Another fucking LOUD BLAST -- sound of GLASS BREAKING -- and the creature ROARING --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And there it is, in silhouette, moving past the bay window -- Joe realizes: where the creature is, so are the blasts:
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, guys, let's go. Come on!
	</DIALOGUE>

Joe runs -- the others follow --

</CARY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To the cemetery--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
But as they get to the living room a HUGE EXPLOSION BLOWS OUT A WALL! They all go down -- but Martin is in agony all of a sudden -- his leg RIPPED by concrete. If there's good news here, the creature has left this area -- the explosions getting further away. But there's blood and Martin is in real pain.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to my leg? It hurts.

Charles wants the tie around the curtains, still hanging on the wall that now has a HOLE in it; MILITARY VEHICLES can be seen driving past outside. Joe hands Charles the thick fabric tie -- which Charles fashion into a tourniquet, wraps it around Martin's leg, tight --
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna go find Alice-- you have to stay with Martin.

Joe nods, determined, and he and Cary head off --

Martin screams.

Joe and Cary run through the semi-demolished neighborhood, many houses shattered, some cars obliterated. The only lone figures in town.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

EXT./INT. CEMETERY CARETAKER'S SHED - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

They're out of breath -- they try ONE garage door, windows CAKED WITH DIRT. Stuck. The SECOND door. Dirt-caked windows. Stuck. The third is a barn door -- they try it: locked.

<DIRECTION>
The two begin KICKING the door together -- on three -- one -- two -- CRASH! Again and again, until finally the door KICKS OPEN -- and they almost FALL INSIDE -- and thank goodness they didn't -- because -- and now we're looking STRAIGHT DOWN FROM INSIDE THE SHED -- the entire floor of the shed has been DUG OUT -- DROPPING FORTY FEET STRAIGHT DOWN, dirt PILED, caked along the sides of the structure. The boys catch their breath.
</DIRECTION>
<CARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa. This is scary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</CARY>
<DIRECTION>
Cary opens his backpack, whips out a Fourth of July SPARKLER. LIGHTS it with a lighter and DROPS IT IN. The thing falls far enough to tell them it's too far to jump.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But burning on the dirt floor of the nearly-dug hole, it lights up a TUNNEL at the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>

INT. JEEP - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Jack drives fast. Louis sits beside him. It's awkward. But not angry. Finally, vulnerable, scared and sad:
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came to your house that day. To tell you that I never meant to hurt anyone. Swear to God.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat, respectful tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Jack. About what happened to your wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks at him for a moment, then back to the road. A beat. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... It was an accident. It was an accident.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack glances at him. A small nod of forgiveness and gratitude. Louis wants to cry again, but just accepts it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHED - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe begins CLIMBING DOWN the ROPE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CEMETERY SHED HOLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe lands on the bottom. Dark as hell -- looks up -- at Cary climbing down into the hole -- the barn roof looming above him. Now Cry lands too. There are THREE POSSIBLE WAYS TO GO. Joe's mind races about which way to go.
</DIRECTION>
<CARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe, I don't understand--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARY>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR a DISTANT RUMBLING -- like something far off, but MECHANICAL. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhh. This way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
They begin their walk into the dirt tunnel, a TALL OVAL TUNNEL, TWENTY FEET TALL --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL #1 (W/FURNIURE) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're SO FAR AWAY, that the screen is mostly black, with a small speck of SPARKLY LIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They come to an area LITTERED WITH THE STUFF OF A LIVING ROOM. They look up: ANOTHER HOLE LEADING DOWN, DUG STRAIGHT THROUGH A HOUSE. They continue, coming to an INTERSECTION -- where a NEW TUNNEL branches off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's DIM LIGHT from up ahead, where the tunnel BENDS. The RUMBLING/MECHANICAL SOUND LOUDER now. Joe and Cary slowly move forward -- seeing something off-camera that scares and amazes them all at once.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IT'S A HUNDRED-FOOT DIAMETER, FORTY-FOOT TALL UNDERGROUND SPACE, FILLED WITH A MECHANICAL MARVEL -- A MASSIVE, BIZARRE CONTRAPTION COMBINING THOUSANDS OF MECHANICAL PIECES, FROM THE MISSING MICROWAVES, CAR ENGINES, ANTENNAS, AND COUNTLESS OTHER DEVICES -- WIRES AND CABLES HANG AND CONNECT EVERYWHERE, ALL LEADING TO THE DIRT CEILING, HEADING UP, TO SOMEWHERE ABOVE GROUND. THE THICK-WITH-FUMES SPACE CHUGS AND HUMS WITH A SLOWLY INCREASING PITCH, AS IT IT'S WARMING UP, GETTING READY TO FINALLY, ACTUALLY WORK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They cross to the other side. Cary bumps into a HANGING SHERIFF PRUITT. Cary is about to scream, but Joe puts a hand on his mouth and leads him away from Pruitt.
</DIRECTION>
<CARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Sheriff Pruitt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. Cary look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Makeshift HANGING BULBS provide some light; a number of other TUNNELS are visible from here, too. Joe and Cary look at the space in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<CARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're under the water tower.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Then Joe sees something that makes him grab at Cary's shirt. Cary looks: THROUGH THE MASS OF METAL AND MACHINERY AND DANGLING CABLES, AT THE OTHER END OF THIS UNDERGROUND EXPERIMENT, IS THE CREATURE. HUNCHED OVER. BACK TO THE BOYS. AND IT'S SAVAGELY EATING SOMETHING. IT MOVES A BIT: WE SEE IT'S A HUMAN LEG. Joe and Cary would SCREAM if they didn't need to stay quiet. In a panicked WHISPER:
</DIRECTION>
<CARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's eating a person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARY>
<DIRECTION>
Joe moves away from Cary to get a better view of the other side of the machinery -- and there he sees, in an INSET section of the rock-wall, THREE HUMAN BODIES, HANGING LIFELESS FROM THEIR FEET, WRAPPED IN SOME KIND OF THIN SHELLAC. TIGHT ON JOE as he sees, among them, ALICE. His heart POUNDS, his resolve quadruples. Cary sees her too --
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's here. We're going to use your firecrackers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think it's going to hurt it, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are other tunnels.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need you to make noise. Lots of it, right here, in two minutes. Make it loud and make it last-- gimme some sparklers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CARY>
<DIRECTION>
(goes through his bag)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- why-- what are you gonna do--?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARY>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(takes SPARKLERS and a LIGHTER from Cary)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make sure you're gone by the time it blows: you can't be here, you gotta run.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARY>
<DIRECTION>
But Joe's already gone. Stay with Cary, who opens his backpack, starts pulling out his amazing array of EXPLOSIVES, glancing up to make sure he's out of the creature's view --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL #3 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE FAST with Joe as he races, a LIT SPARKLER giving him his light -- the MECHANICAL RUMBLING all but gone now. Joe runs, looking for another way into the creature's massive space -- he finally finds another INTERSECTION -- he turns into it -- he disappears down the tunnel --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cary's made a long, insane pile of FIRECRACKERS -- he uses an OPEN M-80 and begins laying a SQUIGGLY, LONG LINE OF GUN POWDER back, away from the firecrackers -- away from the entrance to the creature's CONTRAPTION space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe races down the dirt tunnel, the SOUND OF THE MECHANICAL RUMBLING -- and its INCREASING PITCH -- getting LOUDER. The SPARKLER DIES as LIGHT BEGINS TO REVEAL JOE, who slows -- peers around the dirt tunnel bend -- he is now on the OTHER SIDE of the space. He sees the creature -- then looks across to the lifeless body of Alice. His heart sinks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cary's done laying out the charges -- he pulls out his lighter -- FFFT! FFFT! The damn thing won't light --

Joe watches as the creature FINISHES WITH ITS MEAL AND HEADS FOR THE OTHER HANGING BODIES -- PUSH IN ON JOE, DESPERATE --

	-- damnit!!!

</CARY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up -- watches the creature GRAB AND PULL ALICE'S LIFELESS BODY DOWN FROM HER HANGING POSITION -- it moves with her to where he was eating the teacher -- Cary SHAKES THE LIGHTER, STARTING TO CRY AND HE FLICKS IT AND FFFFFTH!!! IT LIGHTS! HE TOUCHES IT ON THE GUN POWDER AND RUNS OFF --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MECHANICAL CONTRAPTION SPACE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature PULLS AWAY the fibrous covering over Alice -- its TENTACLES SLITHER OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watching this is horror, Joe's about to run in just as BABABABABABABABAM!!! The creature JERKS UP from its almost- meal of Alice, looks toward the EXPLOSIVE SOUNDS, then LEAVES HER, quickly moving for the tunnel --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT

The creature arrives in the SMOKE-FILLED TUNNEL, as the FIREWORKS FILL the tunnel with BRIGHT, MULTI-COLORED LIGHTS --

	Follow me. I can get us out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_PRUITT>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheriff, we came that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SHERIFF_PRUITT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't argue with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_PRUITT>
<TINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, kids, let's go with the sheriff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TINA>
<DIRECTION>
Joe and Alice follow. They run into a tunnel. We PUSH IN ON THE MECHANICAL DEVICE -- the PITCH INCREASING MORE NOW -- AS IF IT'S ABOUT TO "FUNCTION" -- The creature returns and sees that the humans are gone. He takes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sparkler lighting the way, we're with Joe and Alice -- Pruitt and Tina behind them:
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheriff, I really think we're going the wrong way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<PRUITT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll talk about it when we get up top.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRUITT>
<DIRECTION>
They continue following Pruitt.
</DIRECTION>
<CARY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you to get out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought this was the way out. I tried! Hey, Alice, welcome back--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARY>
<PRUITT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kids, come on, we gotta go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRUITT>
<DIRECTION>
BUT HE'S LOOKING BACK AND HIS SPARKLER ILLUMINATES THE CREATURE THAT IS RIGHT UP AHEAD AND TINA SCREAMS -- THEY ALL DO AS PRUITT TURNS AND IS TAKEN, LIFTED HIGH, KILLED IN THE DARK AS THEY ALL TURN AND RUN -- PRUITT'S HORRIBLE SCREAMS terrifying as the foursome sprint in the opposite direction! After RUNNING HARD for a beat:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They haul ass, but after a long moment TINA IS GRABBED AWAY INTO THE DARKNESS!!! HER SCREAMS CONTINUE behind them --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They run and run and run, but then BOOM: they hit a DEAD END. A DIRT WALL. No more tunnels. No options. Out of breath, they turn -- but dare not go back toward the horrifying blackness. The only SOUND the sparkler, their erratic breathing and the DISTANT INCREASING PITCH OF THE CREATURE'S MECHANICAL DEVICE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE IS THERE -- FORTY FEET FROM THEM, -- APPROACHING! ALICE SCREAMS -- SHE AND CARY MORE BACK AGAINST THE WALL -- AND THE CREATURE MOVES FOR THEM, BUT JOE YELLS AS THE THING PASSES THE FIREWORKS:
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GO! YOU DON'T WANNA BE HERE, GO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe, what are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARY>
<DIRECTION>
IT KEEPS COMING -- PAST THE FIREWORKS, AMAZINGLY BACKLIT AS IT LUMBERS TOWARD JOE, DESPERATELY TRYING TO STAND GROUND:
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WE UNDERSTAND! WE KNOW HOW HARD IT'S BEEN! BUT NOT EVERYONE IS HORRIBLE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe, shut up, it's gonna kill you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY NOW!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
AND IT GRABS JOE AND LIFTS HIM -- Alice and Cary SCREAM AS JOE IS BEING SQUEEZED -- HE LOOKS INTO THE GLOSSY BLACK EYES OF THIS BEAST, WHICH COULD KILL HIM AT ANY TIME -- but in this moment of fear comes something else. Simple truth -- he WHISPERS, SHAKILY:
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I know bad things happen-- bad things happen, but you can still live. You can still live, you can still live, you're gonna be okay--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
JUST AS WE THINK THE CREATURE'S GONNA KILL HIM: A DISTANT MECHANICAL TONE -- THE CREATURE TURNS, ACKNOWLEDGING THAT SOUND -- THEN TO JOE AGAIN. IT CONSIDERS HIM. ITS EYES' COVERING PEELS AWAY -- REVEALING HUGE, WET, VULNERABLE EYES. AND THE THING LOOKS AT HIM. REALLY LOOKS AT HIM. In a way, as you imagine his mother once had. And Joe feels this too. AND AFTER A LONG, SCARY BEAT, THE CREATURE SETS HIM DOWN. Joe backs up as the creature TURNS FAST AND SPEEDS AWAY. JOE IS STUNNED. SHOCKED RELIEF. ALICE AND CARY, TOO --
</DIRECTION>
<CARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, wait a minute, WHAT?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARY>
<DIRECTION>
Then, over the HIGH-PITCHED MECHANICAL SOUND comes RUMBLINGS - - like THUNDER from above -- and the three LOOK UP --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - MAIN STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kids round a corner -- ON MAIN STREET, COUNTLESS METALLIC OBJECTS -- ANYTHING METAL AND LOOSE -- has been INVISIBLY DRAGGED -- FLOATING -- toward the WATER TOWER -- at different speeds and with different personalities, metal objects BULLET TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER AND STICK THERE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, THE DINER WINDOW SHATTERS as a STOVE RIPS THROUGH IT -- we PAN WITH IT as it TUMBLES TOWARD AND UP THE WATER TOWER! HUNDREDS OF OBJECTS move past them -- from bicycles to silverware and sinks! DISHWASHERS AND TVS SMASH THROUGH THE TOWN'S APPLIANCE STORE WINDOW -- A TV FLOATS, UNPLUGGED, PAST THE KIDS -- AND IT IS ON -- AND SHOWS AN EPISODE FROM THE TWILIGHT ZONE -- all things eventually SLAMMING into the WATER TOWER, the objects BEGINNING TO CRUSH TOGETHER, FORMING ONE DENSE METALLIC MASS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM! BAMBAM! Sounds like GUN BLASTS -- the KIDS TURN: behind them are the RED CARGO CONTAINERS -- ONE BY ONE those cubes BURST THROUGH THE CONTAINERS: BAM! BAMBAMBAM! BAMBAM! And they SLAM INTO THE WATER TOWER -- AND THEY BEGIN TO FORM AN ODD, HUGE CRESCENT SHAPE ABOVE THE TOWER! Alice is cry- laughing at seeing it work --
</DIRECTION>
<CARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- what's he doing...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... he's making a model.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
AGAIN and AGAIN, pieces FLY OVERHEAD, beginning to FORM WHAT IS CLEARLY AN ALIEN CRAFT -- LIGHTS BEGINNING TO ILLUMINATE FROM INSIDE as it continues -- ONE OF THE SPOTLIGHTS ILLUMINATING A JEEP THAT HAS JUST ARRIVED: JACK GETS OUT. HE SEES JOE. JOE IS SURPRISED TO SEE HIM -- ALICE CONCERNED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUT THEN THE KIDS ARE BOTH INCREDULOUS TO SEE JACK HELP LOUIS OUT OF THE JEEP -- THE TWO MEN MOVE THROUGH THE DEBRIS IN THE STREETS, STUNNED AT THE ACTIVITY SURROUNDING THEM, BUT FOCUSED ON THEIR CHILDREN; A TUMBLING TYPEWRITER ALMOST TAKES OUT JACK, BUT HE AVOIDS IT AS IT SHOOTS UP TO THE WATER TOWER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK GETS TO HIS SON -- HOLDS HIS SHOULDERS -- LOOKS DEEPLY INTO HIS EYES, TOUCHES HIS FACE AND EMBRACES HIM --
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I got you. I got you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
LOUIS, CRYING, DESPERATELY SORRY -- AND SHE SEES THIS IN HIS SAD, WOUNDED FACE -- SHE HOLDS OUT A HAND -- HE TAKES IT AND PULLS HER INTO AN EMBRACE, HUGGING HIS DAUGHTER DESPERATELY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND THEM, THE SHIP CONTINUES TO TAKE SHAPE, ALMOST FULLY- FORMED -- but here, as he is being hugged by his father, Joe LOOKS DOWN: SOMETHING IN HIS POCKET Is MOVING -- he considers it, confused for a moment -- but he reaches in and pulls it out. HIS MOTHER'S NECKLACE -- and he holds the chain, but the LOCKET PULLS TOWARD THE WATER TOWER -- wanting to go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe knows what this means. He looks up at his father, who also understand. AND THIS IS WHEN WE GO INTO SLOW MOTION -- FROM HERE UNTIL THE END. After a long beat, Joe HOLDS THE NECKLACE UP, toward the tower -- the thing PULLING... TEARS in Joe's eyes as he looks up at it -- not wanting to let go, but knowing he must. Jack, heartsick, watches his son, on the verge of letting go. Alice watches Joe, on the verge of tears -- except Joe just can't bring himself to do it, not now, not ever. But then something happens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulled by the invisible force, THE LOCKET POPS OPEN. And we see what's inside. A PHOTOGRAPH of Joe's MOTHER. A young woman, HOLDING HER ONE SMALL BABY. And Joe looks at his mother -- and in this moment, she at him and Jack's eyes suddenly WELL WITH TEARS -- Alice, too, tears streaming down her face and finally Jack reaches out -- and puts his hand on his son's shoulder -- which was all Joe needed, really.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And finally... after all... JOE LETS GO. OUR SCORE SOARS AS, IN SLOW MOTION, the necklace SHOOTS ACROSS THE MAIN STREET UP TO THE WATER TOWER!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND WHEN IT HITS, THE ENTIRE TOWER IMPLODES FROM PRESSURE -- A FIREWORKS-LIKE EXPLOSION OF WATER BURSTS AND SHOWERS THE STREET AS THE MAJESTIC SHIP COMPLETES ITS FORMATION -- and that's when Joe sees the CREATURE, LEAVING -- CLIMBING UP THE WATER TOWER AND ENTERS HIS SHIP -- AND IT BEGINS TO LIFT. AS IT TAKES OFF, THE WEIGHT OF THE TOWER IS TOO MUCH: IT COLLAPSES INTO MAIN STREET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHIP RISES SLOWLY INTO THE SKY -- ITS PURE WHITE SPOTLIGHTS FINALLY SCANNING THE GROUND BENEATH IT -- LILLIAN, OHIO -- EARTH -- A PLANET IT IS FINALLY LEAVING --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we PUSH IN on Charles and Marin, who watch, amazed, as the distant light RISES INTO THE SKY --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we PUSH IN as DONNY SLEEPS, the REFLECTION OF THE RISING SHIP seen in his windshield --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - MAIN STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe and Alice, Jack, Louis and Cary watch, amazed, as the ship disappears into the night sky, we are TIGHT ON JOE'S HAND, as it takes ALICE'S.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And looking skyward, Joe smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As our SCORE SWELLS, we finally...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
