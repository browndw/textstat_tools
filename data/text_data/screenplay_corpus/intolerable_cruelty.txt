:SC: INTOLERABLE CRUELTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEVERLY HILLS STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is late night, and deserted. Engine noise approaches; headlights appear; as the car draws closer we hear singing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a Mercedes convertible and as it roars by, the singing -- a sloppy baritone and a giggling soprano -- whooshes by with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hold as another car approaches. This one is a conservative sedan, whose occupant does not sing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The middle-aged driver is in a tuxedo with a rumpled shirt and cocked bow tie. He is flushed, a Rogue forelock bouncing over his forehead, and he merrily sings "Casey Jones" along with the passenger, a young woman in a party dress who squeals, rocks with the motion of the car, and enthusiastically pipes in on the chorus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER EMPTY STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The convertible makes a hot turn onto the street and approaches with its singing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car enters and roars away. After a beat of quiet, the conservative sedan enters and recedes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEACH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are at the Malibu Guest Quarters Motel. The singing, squealing Mercedes screeches into the lot and rocks to a halt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The young woman staggers out still giggling, and holding a half-empty bottle of champagne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man tosses her a key with a large plastic tag.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Number Seven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
She trots away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man twists his rear-view mirror to look at himself. He straightens his bow tie. He puffs his bounding forelock with one finger, nods his head to make it bounce, grins approvingly, and cocks a pistol-finger at his own reflection.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zing!

MOTEL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man enters and looks around. The young woman's dress is tossed onto the bed but she is nowhere to be seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man pulls an imaginary train whistle.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Choo! Choo!...

He looks around, in a closet, under the bed.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
He is reacting to a long leg which pokes out from behind the window curtain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A salacious smiles spreads across his lips. He pulls on the cord to draw back the curtain and reveal the young woman in red panties and a bra and a saucily cocked conductor's cap.
</DIRECTION>

<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pull in your ears, Rexie -- you're comin' to a tunnel!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Rex lunges at the young woman and they tumble onto the bed just as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH -- the door is kicked open and a short stocky black man built like a bulldog and wearing a porkpie hat rushes into the room with a video camera glued to his eye. He looks like Clarence Thomas with a mustache.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna nail your ass!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The young woman screams, clutching the sheets to her naked bosom. Rex leaps from the bed, still clad only in his chemindefer boxers, and darts around the room seeking egress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man with the video charges around the room following Rex
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Rex is stumbling around the room in a panic, looking for his clothing. The camera swish-pans back to the young woman still screaming in the bed.

TRACKING SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All from the perspective of a moving automobile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The moving shots show mansions, palm trees, boutiques; we pass joggers, strolling businessmen holding cellular phones to their ears, male models working as waiters at sidewalk cafes, young women on roller blades who turn, smile, and wave at the camera. It is la dolce vita Los Angeles style.

If the cruise goes all the way around the lake, she left the state and she's in breach. She can't leave the state. Tell Wrigley to prepare a filing to attach everything. Primary residence, autos, stocks...

<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are. And it's winding down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.

	Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?

INT. MASSEY MEYERSON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles addresses a group of young Attorneys at the firm.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The problem is that everyone is willing to compromise. That's the problem with the institution of marriage -- it's based on compromise. Even through its dissolution. One attorney will try to score some points, the opposition will try to impeach. The process will find an equilibrium point determined by the skill of the opposing lawyers, and then each party will walk away with their portion of the "goodies." Some say, "Life is compromise." But at Massey Myerson we believe life is struggle and the ultimate destruction of your opponent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
The Receptionist pokes her head into the conference room.

MILES MASSEY'S OFFICE

You may have seen it in the issue before last of "World of Interiors." There's a Rothko on the wall, an Elle Bleu humidor on the desk, peonies in the vase, and the diploma is from Yale.

He leans back in the leather executive chair behind his desk, makes a steeple of his fingers, and dons his look of deepest concern.

Rex, nervous, laughs ruefully.
</DIRECTION>
<REX>

	Jeez. Where do I start?

Miles gives an encouraging, rueful smile in return.

	...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's her job. You have to respect that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<REX>

Quietly.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Time marches on. Ardor cools.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I mean when I say "it."

<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.

</MILES>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I can assume...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Video.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Rex hangs his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles sighs sympathetically.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- is that possible?

WAITING ROOM - MASSEY MEYSERSON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The receptionist leans over her partition to chirp at Marylin and her attorney Ruth Rabinow. Ruth is a sturdy woman in her late 60's. If Mrs. Guttman had gone to law school...
</DIRECTION>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Massey will see you now.

CONFERENCE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the middle of the Massy Meyerson conference table is a large fruit and pastry plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door swings open. Miles rises.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Ruth!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
They shake hands.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you must be Mr. Massey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<DIRECTION>
They appraise each other for a beat. They are impressed and, they are impressive. As they settle in:
</DIRECTION>
<MARYLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(Sadly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Rex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marylin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you alright? You lost weight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My whole metabolism is -- off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX>
<DIRECTION>
Miles has been staring at Marylin. She notices this, and smiles shyly. He snaps out of it.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Ruth. How's Sam?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A yert.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(To Rex)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's a yert?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX>
<RUTH>
<DIRECTION>
(Dryly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ran into your mother at the radiologist last week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<DIRECTION>
A tight, terse smile from Miles.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX>
<DIRECTION>
They drift for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My client has ruled that out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's delusional.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha Ha.

</RUTH>
<MILES>

	Heh heh.

</MILES>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's so goddamn funny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX>
<DIRECTION>
Miles lays a hand on his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please -- let me handle this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the clipboard away and looks carefully at Ruth.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh brother. Here we go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<DIRECTION>
Rex winces. Rubs his stomach. Marylin leans forward and whispers to him.
</DIRECTION>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you need a Tagamet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have some?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX>
<DIRECTION>
She removes a pack of the tablets from her purse, along with several vials of prescription drugs.
</DIRECTION>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
She hands the pills to a grateful Rex. Their hands touch for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<REX>
<DIRECTION>
(Contrite)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes I forget.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him like a concerned parent. Miles and Ruth watch the interaction.
</DIRECTION>
<MARYLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(To the attorneys)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. Where were we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you familiar with Kirshner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's Kirshner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The primary residence and FORTY percent of the remaining assets. You're becoming tedious Miles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't we going in the wrong direction?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhh. Please. Let me do my job.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(To Ruth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buy a clue, Ruthie. Have you forgotten about Kirshner?

</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Ruth stands and closes her attaché case.
</DIRECTION>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you at the preliminary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<DIRECTION>
Miles calls to Ruth's retreating back.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. We'll eat all the pastry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Going through the door, Ruth doesn't react, but Marylin following, glances back -- bemused, but with a trace of a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rex swallows two more tablets. He sits, looking despondent.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think that went as well as could be expected.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She always looked out for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she had private investigators assisting her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<REX>
<DIRECTION>
(Sentimental)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She brought my digestive enzymes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In anticipation of making you sick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I should reconsider my...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX>
<DIRECTION>
Miles looks at him. Shakes his head, sadly.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A superficial display of marital solicitude, and you lose your resolve? Rex. I underestimated you. But I'm your attorney, and if you choose to reward her for that mediocre charade of spousal concern...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
He shrugs, helplessly.
</DIRECTION>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. Screw her.

INT. GYM - CLOSE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A woman walking across a gymnasium floor. Suddenly, she's assaulted by a huge, grotesquely garbed assailant. His sweats barely cover his massive, overdeveloped musculature. On his head, a ski mask stretches over a padded football helmet. He grabs the woman, yanks her back towards him. She reacts swiftly. With a ferocious "NO," she stomps on his foot, and smashes him in the face. The mugger raises his hands in a gesture of submission.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
APPLAUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pull back and see that we are in a Self Defense Class. Two instructors, two "muggers" and ten women students all wearing T-shirts with the words IMPACT-Personal Safety. Marylin and Sarah sit against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well what does he want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has a reputation for being tough.

Marylin watches as a new "victim" begin her walk across the gym.

</MARYLIN>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
The mugger emerges from his station and makes his way toward the "victim." She glances over her shoulder, and at the sight of the monster bearing down on her, screams and runs to the exit. Marylin and Sarah giggle, but reproachful looks from the other students force them to affect concerned looks.
</DIRECTION>
<MARYLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(Whispers)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Every week --

</MARYLIN>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm dying.

</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
The two Instructors and the Mugger try to coax the sobbing woman back into the room. They clasp her in an empathic group hug.
</DIRECTION>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So where are you now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.

</MARYLIN>
<SARAH>

Marylin gets up and coolly walks to center stage, passing the traumatized Lilly.

<SARAH>

	That's completely odd.

Marylin begins the Victim walk. The Mugger quickly moves up from the rear.

<MARYLIN>

(To Sarah)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. That's why I accepted. Find out what's up with this clown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<DIRECTION>
The Mugger is upon her. He grabs her hair. She stomps his foot, and smoothly wheels around SMASHING him in the nose with her elbow, while KNEEING HIM in the groin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The women Cheer.
</DIRECTION>
<INSTRUCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was excellent, Marylin. But you forgot to yell "no."

	Bordeaux? Hmmm. Chateau Margaux '57.

Miles nods at the maitre d' who returns the nod and withdraws.

A waiter appears and pour a taste of wine which Miles sips and -- He nods at the waiter who pours two glasses.

<MILES>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
She regards him for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants a reconciliation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.

</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotcha.

	Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.

LATER

<DIRECTION>
We are on a close lateral track of the jurors faces as they sit, with earphones on, in the darkened courtroom, illuminated by a flickering TV monitor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leaking tinnily through the headsets we hear a very faint:

<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna nail your ass.

The track ends over at Marylin's table, where Marylin also wearing headphones, looks on with studied stoicism. Ruth lays a consoling hand on her shoulder.

Marylin Rexroth now struggles to maintain her composure on the witness stand. She is modestly dressed and her attitude is one of shocked, wounded innocence.

He paces, hands clasped behind his back, affecting to be lost in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marylin watches him.

Finally Miles, still pacing, declaims:

<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>

Marylin looks up from her handkerchief with a look of startled irritation. Miles stops pacing and turns to face her with a faint smile.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know those lines, Mrs. Rexroth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>

	You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...

Miles flashes Marylin a "you are KIDDING" look, but she assiduously avoids eye contact.

<MARYLIN>

	Howard and I are here, Miles, because I have learned through bitter experience that when it comes to matrimonial law, you are the very best.

</MARYLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Miles acknowledges this with a curt nod.
</DIRECTION>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.

	You did good, Massey!

<MARYLIN>

	And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.

<MARYLIN>

	That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?

</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
He eyes Marylin.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>

	Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme. Ingredients. Spices. Spicy ingredients for the banquet we call -- life. Marriage is like a Great Feast. Courtship is the Appetizer.

Or perhaps a light pasta -- a tortellini stuffed with cheese and hope.

Marylin sits in the den. She's had some coffee and, although teary and disheveled, is no longer psychotic.
</DIRECTION>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just cried when I got home. Somehow, your disdain for me -- I'm pretty tough Miles, but I'm human. All my life people have been ascribing these terrible motives to me. I used to think they were jealous, or they didn't understand, but... I dunno. Maybe others see something in me. Something I'm not even aware of. Anyway, thank you for letting me come here. I guess I was a little drunk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>

She takes the coffee cup and has a sip. She looks like a lost waif.

Marylin looks at a photograph Miles has on a side table.

A WOMAN AND TWO SMALL BOYS.

The Woman has her arm around one of them. The other stands close to her. Smiling, but awkward and tentative.

<MARYLIN>

	Is that you?

</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me. Yes.

	Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.

Miles walks over to look at the picture.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmm...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She never particularly cared for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She didn't love you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She held that against you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apparently she was very disappointed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy. Boy, oh boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Marylin looks at the picture again. And yes -- you can see how hesitant Miles was. Marylin is moved. A flash of something genuine crosses her face.
</DIRECTION>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And here I thought my mother was...

</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we're not!

</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you just propose to me?

</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MASSEY HOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles and Marylin asleep in bed. The ALARM RINGS. Miles wakes, turns to his beautiful wife -- kisses her good morning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him a sleepy Smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles dressing for work. Marylin, in a Sabia Rosa bathrobe places a tray with coffee next to him. He holds up two ties for her-approval. She selects one. He puts it on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles and Marylin reading Newspapers while eating breakfast. She serves him a bowl of fruit and indicates Wrigley's berry spoons. They laugh heartily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marylin waves good bye as Miles backs drives to the office. She waves at the gardeners who blow palm fronds around the lawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILES OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has managed to fill his credenza with pictures of married life. Due to its brevity -- these pictures are uneventful, the Massey's wear the same outfit in most of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles works. He is interrupted by the voice of his SECRETARY.
</DIRECTION>
<SECRETARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have Mrs. Massey on line one for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRETARY>
<DIRECTION>
Miles picks up.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs and laughs. We hear Marylin's laughter coming through the receiver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles exits a flower store with a bouquet of tulips. Marylin at the doorway, greets Miles as he arrives home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Miles changes into his casual after work outfit, (khakis?) Marylin sits at the edge of the bed. He's telling her about his day, and she is rapt with attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Massey's have a candlelit dinner of fish and pasta. The tulips are in the middle of the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles and Marylin snuggle on a couch and watch Seinfeld. Miles in bed on the new Frette Linen. A few too many pillows, but he's making it work. Marylin enters the bedroom in a nightshirt that is the perfect combination of innocence and nastiness. He puts down his book as she gets into bed with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They gaze at one another -- the picture of contentment and impending lust.

EXT. MASSEY MYERSON - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles is addressing the young associates.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the first time in my life, I stand before you naked... vulnerable... and in love. Love. A word matrimonial lawyers shy away from. Ironic isn't it -- that I have been frightened of this emotion which is, in a sense, the seed of my livelihood. But today, I am here to tell you: Love should cause us no fear. Love should cause us no shame. Love... is good.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He lets it sink in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me ask you a question. When our clients come to us confused, angry, hurting because their flame of love is fluttering and threatens to die -- should we seek to extinguish that flame, so that we can sift through the smoldering wreckage for our paltry reward? Or should we seek to fan this precious flame -- this most precious flame -- back to loving, roaring life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
The young associates look confused. Wrigley raises his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<WRIGLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Extinguish?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WRIGLEY>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?

He surveys his surroundings with a critical eye.
</DIRECTION>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, I could sit...

</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hardly. You have six bedrooms
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
He hands her a credit card.

	But you're going through with it?

</MARYLIN>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what?

<SARAH>

	Well, that's about to change big time.

	<DIALOGUE>
	He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --

	Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.

</RUTH>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?

</MARYLIN>
<MILES>

	I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."

</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe you have "things."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.

	Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.

</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm reporting you to the IRS.

</MILES>

She reaches into her purse. Pulls out a Dunhill and expertly lights the cigar.
</DIRECTION>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arty Farty stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Pointing to the Hockney)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.

<MILES>

	Those are gifts.

</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't prove anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?

	You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(She stands to leave)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Meaning my house.

<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.

	Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.

We pull back from the milky yellowish bag of fluid to show that a nurse is unhooking and removing it from under Herb Meyerson's wheelchair where it collects drainage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She now places it up on the IV gantry and connects, and swaps the now empty drip under the wheelchair to collect drainage. We are once again in Herb Meyerson's gloomy office, its venetians blocking most of the light and making Herb a dark, enigmatic figure.

CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An edgy looking gangster, JOE. He is perspiring heavily. He breathes through his mouth with the rasping wheeze of an asthmatic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His labored breath rattles as he stares across the table at someone off. At length, a voice:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Are you Joe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Still staring, but perhaps by way of answer, the gangster raises an inhaler, sticks it in his mouth, and squeezes. WHUSH.
</DIRECTION>
<GANGSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Dumbarton?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GANGSTER>
<DIRECTION>
A reverse shows Miles seated across a small round table in a seedy low-lit clam house. Photos of Ted Kennedy and the Pope adorn the walls..

	Here's her picture...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
He is shoving an envelope across the table.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and the address where she's staying. It's the residence of a Mr. Massey. Uh, Dumbarton. Massey. Uh, it's not Mr. Dumbarton's house. Though he's not involved. And because of an impending legal action this needs to happen within a certain... time frame. Uh... on an expedited basis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
The gangster stares expressionlessly. He raises the inhaler again and, with his eyes still on Miles, squeezes. WHUSH.
</DIRECTION>
<GANGSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're in a rush.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GANGSTER>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.

A long beat. Finally, Miles explodes
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She won't suffer, will she?

He bites a knuckle, gazing fearfully at the gangster. The gangster stares impassively back.

	...not unless you pay extra.

On the bed, Rex is surrounded by three naked beauties, smeared in cola dust and wearing conductor caps.

INT. KENNETH'S HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A guest room. Dark, dirty and filled with empty bottles of expensive French wine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a phone ringing in a different room. It rings several times.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure on the bed stirs, rolls over, moans, clamps a pillow over his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ring of the distant telephone is interrupted and we hear a muffled voice:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello. Yes, he's here. Just a minute --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
We hear approaching footsteps and Kenneth enters the background, knotting a bathrobe. He turns on the light in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miles. It's for you.

</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello. Yes -- what?! Yes -- I see --

After another listening beat he drops the phone away. He remains staring dully out into space.

Miles paces with the telephone. He punches numbers with the thumb of the hand holding the phone; his other hand holds a coffee cup from which he takes trembling slurps.

She walks slowly around the room, pausing at the mantelpiece to pick up a framed picture of Miles, which she contemplatively regards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pan with her continued walk to bring Joe into frame. He stands with his back pressed to the wall. She's started for a moment, but quickly recoups:

<DIRECTION>
Miles is exasperated. Suddenly -- Marylin appears.
</DIRECTION>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a no go, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marylin!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Joe glances at both of them with barely concealed contempt.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! He works for YOU?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now. But first, he worked for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were going to have this thug...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MARYLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(To Joe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(To Miles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was fifty for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(To Miles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's cause you're a lawyer. I gave her the lawyer discount.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Looks at Marylin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I shouldn't of. Cause you're a whore. A whore who worships the dollar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were you with a firm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kaplan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kaplan? I know Kaplan. Wait. You're Joe Gittelson? I knew you looked -- You were great -- we studied you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty years in "matrimonial law" and it made me sick.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He wheezes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I broke up homes and families, never givin' it a second thought. Till one day. I had an epiphany. You know what that is?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(They nod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Came with a damn stigmata if you can believe that! I said to myself -- Joe -- everyone you see wants blood. Everyone wants their ex's dead. So why jerk around with rest. You wanna best serve your clients? Kill em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe is raising the gun at Miles. Miles sprays him with Mace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG -- Joe fires blindly, scrunching his eyes against the chemical, sucking for breath like a jet engine revving for a take-off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLAM -- Marylin elbows him in the face, breaking his nose. She finishes with a solid groin kick. It slows him down, but doesn't stop him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe stumbles a bit, but regains his footing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG -- Joe is rampaging around the room, still firing, thumping at his chest with his free hand for his inhaler. Marylin runs to Miles. He takes her hand and they run toward the door, seeking egress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG -- still firing, he pulls out the inhaler but blindly bobbles it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe reaches with his gun hand to keep the inhaler from falling. He momentarily bobbles both gun and inhaler.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles pops up in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Joe recovers and raises the gun to his mouth as he points the inhaler at Miles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He squeezes -- WHUSH -- Miles squints against the asthma mist and lets out a horrified:
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! The off-screen gunshot is followed by the sound of a body dropping heavily to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marylin runs over to Miles. They look sadly down at the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WE told him it was no go...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASSEY MYERSON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wrigley sits bouncing the steepled fingers of one hand against the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles sits gazing sadly out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is the whir of ventilation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The click of the door attracts both their attention and brings them to their feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marylin walks in, chic and beautiful as ever, followed by Ruth, who sits next to her, places her attaché case on the table top, and snaps its clasps.
</DIRECTION>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<WRIGLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ruth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WRIGLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Miles and Marylin are looking at each other. Quietly:
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello Marylin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello Miles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not something I wanted either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you both wait a minute. Nobody hired anyone to kill anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<WRIGLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hear, hear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WRIGLEY>
<DIRECTION>
There is an uncomfortable shifting in seats. Wrigley looks at Miles.
</DIRECTION>
<WRIGLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apparently, from what I can gather, a burglar broke into your house -- became despondent over his lifestyle and shot himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WRIGLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Miles is still looking at Marylin.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where does that leave us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've outlined a settlement...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes a piece of paper across the table.
</DIRECTION>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We think it's more than generous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<DIRECTION>
Miles ignores the paper, which lies unclaimed on the middle of the table. He looks at Marylin.
</DIRECTION>
<WRIGLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My client is prepared to consider a reconciliation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WRIGLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Marylin looks a Miles.
</DIRECTION>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could I trust you, after... after all of this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Miles, staring at Marylin, cuts in:
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wounded me first, Marylin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgery? Fraud?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Income tax evasion?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Murder?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Murder!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Miles, with his eyes still on Marylin, reaches into his suit coat. He withdraws a piece of paper, spreads it flat on the table in front of him and, still gazing at her:
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know... there's nothing in the Massey pre-nup that says it can't be executed after the parties wed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
He decisively clicks the button on a ballpoint pen, looks down at the paper in front of him and scribbles his name.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes the paper across the table toward Marylin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gazing at him, seeking the truth in his eyes, she absently picks up the paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a long silence. We hear only the hum of ventilation, and Wrigley's quiet snuffling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ruth is looking down her nose through her glasses -- over Marylin's shoulder -- at the sheet of paper. Marylin however, looks only at Miles.
</DIRECTION>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the Massey pre-nup --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<DIRECTION>
Marylin rips the paper in half.
</DIRECTION>
<RUTH>
<DIRECTION>
(bored)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O-kay. I'm going back to the office
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<DIRECTION>
Wrigley sobs openly.
</DIRECTION>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on Wrigley, I'll buy you a drink and an anti depressant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<WRIGLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one will ever love me that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WRIGLEY>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not if you're lucky. No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<DIRECTION>
Miles rises slowly to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his knuckles on the tabletop and leans forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marylin rises slowly to her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leans forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MASSEY HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a SMASHING -- BREAKING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gardeners look up briefly from the leaf blowing -- but quickly prioritize and continue blasting sycamore leaves from one end of the yard to the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACK THROUGH HOUSE TO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASSEY BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The smashing is becoming louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN AXE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Breaks the beautiful wood panelling in the room next to the master suite.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. Just wait for one minute. Sweet Jesus, are you crazy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
CONSTRUCTION WORKER LOOKS UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
he's the one wielding the axe. His co-worker casts a look in our direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reaches under the rubble and removes one box of Cohiba Especials.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTRUCTION_WORKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, Mr. Massey. Thought you cleared that shit out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTRUCTION_WORKER>
<CONSTRUCTION_WORKER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, man... those things'll kill ya. I know all you old boomer potheads like em. They're illegal, and you get to put em in fancy boxes -- but -- shit man! It's still tobacco.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTRUCTION_WORKER_2>
<DIRECTION>
ON MARYLIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mightily pregnant.
</DIRECTION>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, sweets, he's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Miles casts a rueful look at the cigars.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pre-Castro.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Placing a protective hand on her BIG belly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Miles looks at the box, then at his wife. He tosses the box to the concerned construction worker.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, buddy. These are for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
The construction worker gives him a very hostile look.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTRUCTION_WORKER>
<DIRECTION>
(Mumbles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. Now I can die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTRUCTION_WORKER>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. You'd say "they devoted a whole semester at Harvard to your Dad. But your Mom was the one that ever only nailed his ass."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MARYLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARYLIN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
