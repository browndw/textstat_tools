:SC: BLACK RAIN

<DIRECTION>
A BLACK SCREEN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Various voices: "Big six"... "That's six the hard way"... "Seven or eleven"... "Play two"...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE - NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the pristine blocks of brownstones where even the garbage seems gift wrapped. The VOICES continue over as we move in on a particular building where a DOORMAN is holding open the door for a dowager and her poodle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The voices continue: "Hit me"... "Double down"... "Let it ride"... "Hit me"... "Anymore for the come out"... "Card"...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In contrast to the outside of this sedate, quiet brownstone, we go inside to find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BROWNSTONE APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... a miniature Las Vegas, complete with music, drinks, tuxedoed dealers and croupiers: roulette, craps, Black Jack. Wall to wall people. The fact that casino gambling happens to be illegal in New York doesn't stop these Connecticut slummers, hollow-cheek nightlifers, and junior wiseguys from having a good time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE CARD TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK CONKLIN, holding a dollar cigar, is trying to pull a winning hand. In his late thirties, Nick has the sort of quiet good looks that takes an extra glance to appreciate. His Moe Ginsburg rent-a-tux is too tight, his ruffled shirt, out of date; Nick could care less.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two other players are still in the game. One of them is a lithe DEBUTANTE surrounded by an entourage of giggling friends and tuxedoed men. The pot is huge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick flips two one hundred dollar chips onto the pot.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One, and one on top.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLAYER_ONE>
<DIRECTION>
Disgusted, he throws down his cards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's down to Nick and the debutante. The cocky deb gives Nick a long look, confident she can win.
</DIRECTION>
<DEBUTANTE>
<DIRECTION>
(her eyes still on Nick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see the deuce, and one to chase them home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBUTANTE>
<DIRECTION>
She throws her chips on the pot. Nick hesitates, then decides to match it.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call.

</NICK>
<DEBUTANTE>
<DIRECTION>
(showing her hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies, aces wired. Sorry sport.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBUTANTE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick turns over his cards, Jacks and tens, not good enough to win. Elated, the deb gets up from the table and joins her giggling friends. Nick walks over to her.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very nice, Barbie.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing toward her boyfriend)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, I'd take Ken over there and go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DEBUTANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why's that?

</DEBUTANTE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's time. That's all.

</NICK>
<BOYFRIEND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is not Ken --

</BOYFRIEND>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I'm offering you the benefit of my experience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DEBUTANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like you have a lot of experience in places like this. It was nice of them to relax the dress code for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBUTANTE>
<DIRECTION>
That draws a laugh from her friends. The entourage heads for the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE SKLOARIS, twenty-three, steps in front of the debutante, blocking her path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steps to the side. Charlie steps with her. Charlie's pushing it, he's always pushing it. She's not amused. Finally, Charlie lets her pass. He comes up to Nick.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Typical New York woman, big attitude, small apartment, no tits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Only two things count to Charlie: his job and his women, but not necessarily in that order.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think she got to you, pappy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(checking his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor. And don't call me 'pappy.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing at the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick, wary, eyes this kid. Charlie shrugs, spreads his arms defensively. The SOUND of pounding on the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
splinters. The bouncer steps back as four helmeted emergency service officers -- the first members of the raiding party -- rush in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pandemonium. People rush for the exit -- any exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick and Charlie hold up their glasses.

<NICK>

</NICK>

They down their drinks, then set them down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie pulls out the Binaca, offering Nick a spritz, but Nick is already pulling out his POLICE BADGE and hanging it around his neck. Charlie quickly follows suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HALF DOZEN COPS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
line the patrons up against the wall. The Asst. D.A., PATTY ZACHARA, climbs onto the crap table. A petite, nervous woman, Patty has dressed in a Channel suit for the occasion.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACHARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Settle down. Hey, quiet... Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACHARA>
<DIRECTION>
Not a prayer.

<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SHUT THE HELL UP, GODDAMNIT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
That quiets them.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Conklin. Let's do this fast so I can go home.

Zachara, annoyed, looks at Nick.

</ZACHARA>
<DIRECTION>
NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
catches the Debutante's eye across the room. She smiles at him, he was right. He shrugs, spreads his hands. That's life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A well groomed middle aged man, who we'll come to know as CAVELLO, suddenly bolts from the crowd lined up against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie spins around to stop him --
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa -- where do you think you're going, hotdog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Cavello butts him with his head, sending Charlie to the floor. Then, crosses his arms in front of his face and plunges through the WINDOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick, not missing a beat, gives a small sigh as he follows.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fabulous...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
He takes off after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET UPPER EAST SIDE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick, short of breath, chases Cavello down the residential street, past the dog-walkers, past the doormen, past the fur-coated women climbing out of taxies... Unfortunately, Cavello has a good half block on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From nowhere, Charlie blasts past leaving Nick a half block behind, silently cursing his age.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE CORNER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a limo jerks to a halt, and Cavello jumps in. The limo streaks away.

Now in their street clothes, Charlie and Nick stand in front of the mirrors. Charlie is working his brush and hair dryer as if his life depended on it. Nick, in contrast, shoves his hair back with his fingers and glowers at himself in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>

EXT. POLICE PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Nick strides out the door. Charlie hurries after him.

	Wait up. You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Cavello. Ronnie Cavello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie trails Nick to his motorcycle: a Harley hog complete with wide gleaming fenders and twin tanks. The bike is held together with tape and baling wire.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick tries to kick-start this behemoth, but it's not easy.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City. Casinos.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie puts his foot up on Nick's fender to tie his shoe. Nick, spotting an ankle holster peeking from Charlie's sock, grabs Charlie's foot. Charlie teeters.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let go...

Nick pulls out a Beretta 32.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Get rid of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not regulation. And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at Nick's bike)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The Harley comes to life spitting a cloud of blue smoke. Nick puts on his paint-flecked helmet, slides down some ski goggles.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick, let's go hunting. Bag Cavello.

</CHARLIE>

Nick pops the bike into gear.

Nick rolls out and disappears in a haze of blue smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BELT PARKWAY - VERRAZANO BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE FIND Nick, a lonely, solitary figure bobbing in and out of the lights and shadows. The SOUND of wind whips through his helmet; cold air stings his cheeks... The tail lights of Nick's bike disappear into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - STATEN ISLAND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Civil service heaven. Nick hits the cut switch and glides past the manicured lawns and well kept houses of this development. A basketball net in every driveway, a Buick or Chrysler in every garage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One house sticks out. The lawn is brown, paint is peeling off the garage door and newspapers are scattered on the driveway. Nick glides once around the cul de sac looking at the house. His house. It's as inviting as an open grave. He shoots away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EL GRECO DINER - STATEN ISLAND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hanger sized roadhouse, wall to wall red velvet.

Nick's the sole figure at the counter, coffee and the Daily News in front of him. A NURSE walks in and sits down a half dozen seats away. Nick look up.

	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you give me one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick kisses her. The first suggestion of real affection. The SOUND of someone KNOCKING on the door. Reluctantly, they stop. Connie gets up and puts on her robe.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you expecting anyone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't expecting you.

She disappears down the hallway. We HEAR the door open, then telling someone to wait.

</NICK>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa, I knew you were going to say that. I absolutely anticipated that, Nick. But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --

</CHARLIE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.

Charlie looks away momentarily, letting it slide. He knows he's on sensitive ground.

<DIRECTION>
The bedroom door opens. Connie enters, dumps Nick's clothes on the couch, tosses his gun on top of the pile. Without a word, she goes back inside and slams the door behind her.

Nick, pissed, slowly turns to face Charlie. Charlie shrugs. Nick's got nothing better to do than go.

INT. LIME HOUSE - CHINATOWN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lime House is a little piece of Italy in the heart of Chinatown, and tonight, it's packed. Any selection on the jukebox that isn't Frank Sinatra is Jerry Vale. Behind the bar are two fat BROTHERS. One pours drinks, the other dishes out Scungilli. It's three a.m. It's always three a.m. at the Lime House.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BACK TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our man CAVELLO is unloading steaming Scungilli onto an already heaping plate in front of an imperious looking JAPANESE MAN. The Japanese Man, in his mid-fifties, wears a gray suit, and not a strand of his jet black hair is out of place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Japanese TRANSLATOR, doing his best to translate Cavello's heavily accented English, sits between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie is looking straight ahead, afraid Cavello might peg him. Nick is at ease.

</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT THEY SEE: TWO BODYGUARDS are making a quick sweep of the bar. FRANK ABOLOFIA, s stocky man with silver grey hair, sweeps in behind them. Abolofia has mitts like a meat packer and a fifty dollar manicure. A heavyweight Mafioso.

NICK'S POV IN THE MIRROR BEHIND THE BAR: two new Japanese men step in the door. Early twenties, spiky hair, dark Versace suits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NUMBER ONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
wears tortoise shell shades. He coolly checks out the room then nods to --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NUMBER TWO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who pulls a Spas 12, automatic shotgun from under his coat, and spits out three rounds. A window shatters. Everyone hits the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NUMBER ONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slowly walks toward Cavello's table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NUMBER TWO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
covers the floor. Abolofia's bodyguards show their empty hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK AND CHARLIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
on the floor. They don't have the artillery for this guy either.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our Japanese businessman knows these people. He eyes them contemptuously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abolofia has put enough people in this situation to be philosophical about it. He stops chewing. A tiny hand motion to his bodyguards is enough to stop any precipitous action.
</DIRECTION>
<NUMBER_ONE>
<DIRECTION>
(in Japanese)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give it to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NUMBER_ONE>

The Japanese businessman looking straight ahead. A long, silent pause... Then, still not facing him:
</DIRECTION>
<BUSINESSMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(in Japanese)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go to hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUSINESSMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Number One slips his fingers beneath his shades, massaging his eyes. IN A FLASH, he pulls a shuto from under his coat. The 18 inch blade gleams like a neon tube.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He presses the tip of the blade against the businessman's throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
his hand close around the grip of the Beretta. He unsnaps the ankle holster. The SNAP can be heard across the room. Nick's hand closes around Charlie's and squeezes till the knuckles turn white.

NUMBER TWO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
levels the scattergun at Nick and Charlie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE TABLE - NUMBER ONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
calmly holds the blade at the man's throat as he reaches into the man's jacket and removes a small, rectangular, plastic-wrapped parcel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He feels its weight, then flips it to NUMBER TWO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abolofia, realizing that whatever is going on doesn't affect him or his, resumes eating.
</DIRECTION>
<ABOLOFIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You people are wild... Wild.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABOLOFIA>
<DIRECTION>
NUMBER ONE backs the blade off. The man raises his napkin to the small wound. A droplet of blood has stained his shirt collar. NUMBER ONE turns around as if to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What happens next could be a whim, an after thought. Number One spins around and THRUSTS the blade deep into the man's chest. He withdraws it with a half twist, and in the same motion fatally slashes the translator's throat before the old man's body hits the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood pours from the businessman's mouth onto his Scungilli, spreading across the white cloth and onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAVELLO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reaches for a gun under his coat. But NUMBER TWO pumps two rounds into his face. At this range, there's not much left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The killers slowly back out the door, covering the room with the scattergun. The minute the door shuts, Nick leaps up, pulling his shield and revolver.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>

(shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Police officers. Everybody stay put.

	Get back up.

Abolofia's eyebrows rise at this development.

Nick bolts out the door leaving Charlie in charge. He's never been in charge before.

Number Two pumps out shells as fast as he can squeeze the trigger. He's wild. The front windows of the Lime House shatter.

The LIMO DRIVER jerks to a halt. Number Two tosses the package to him.

Nick empties his revolver. Number Two goes down.

Suddenly Charlie feels something wet at his feet. He looks down to see that he's standing in a pool of blood from the massacre. So much for his new shoes.

He wheels around, then quickly backs out the door.

EXT. STREET - DOWN THE BLOCK FROM THE LIME HOUSE

Deserted. The wail of police sirens in the distance. Charlie has his gun out. He's drenched in sweat. Where is his partner?

ANOTHER STREET - ALLEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick, gun drawn, slowly rounds the corner to the alley: it's the ad hoc drugstore for the night. Drugs going up and down in pails, two dozen junkies buying, shooting, slumped on the ground. Everyone scatters -- the one's that can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ABANDONED PAIL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
swings slowly back and forth from three stories up. Nick cautiously moves down the alley, holding the gun in both hands. A Junkie steps out of a doorway, Nick swings his gun and nearly blows him away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NUMBER ONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see his eyes first as he steps out of the darkness at the back of the alley. From now on we'll call him KOBO. His sunglasses are on his forehead; his hands dropped casually at his side. A very cool character.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo slowly raises his hand, and making a gun with his finger, slowly points and "shoots" at Nick... He lowers his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On the ground, man. NOW!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo cups his hands around his ear. He doesn't understand English. Nick, keeping his gun fixed, comes up to him and kicks out his legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo falls flat on his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick pulls out his cuffs. But Kobo lunges for Nick's ankle and yanks it toward him. Nick stumbles backward; Kobo's on his feet. Before Nick can stand, Kobo lands a brutal kick to the side of Nick's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick gets up, barrels into him. Kobo knees Nick in the solar plexus, then lands two more well placed kicks in Nick's back. It's not that Nick's a bad fighter, it's that this kid is so damn fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick slowly gets to his feet. KOBO lands two more brutal shots to the side of Nick's head. He's a bloody mess.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO POLICE CARS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stop at the end of the alley. FOUR OFFICERS climb out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE
</DIRECTION>

joins the cops as they run down the alley to find Nick getting pummeled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie shoots at Kobo. Misses. Kobo turns to see the five cops, guns drawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick, on one knee, spits out blood and a few teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo calmly slips the shuto out of his coat pocket and drops it next to Nick. The blade gleams in the light. That was next. Nick got lucky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo towers imperiously above Nick. Their eyes lock. We hold then...

FADE TO BLACK.

NICK'S LIVING ROOM - STATEN ISLAND - MORNING
</DIRECTION>

There isn't a stick of furniture, but that's not the half of it. In the middle of the room is a motorcycle on a centerstand. A drop cloth is spread around it, tools neatly aligned. It's a Harley -- but this one is in perfect condition.

A phone RINGS insistently from off screen, then stops.

Reluctantly they head towards the door, passing long rows of bureaucrats, telephones ringing off the hook. Nick stops at the door, spots a fuse box nearby. He glances back to make sure no one is looking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick pulls out his handcuffs. Charlie can't figure out what the hell he's doing. Nick attaches one cuff to the main lever then yanks it down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights go out. The fan's stop; so do the typewriters; so does the air conditioning. Dead silence.

Nick attaches the other cuff to a pipe, snaps it shut. Now it's impossible to left the main lever.

<DIRECTION>
Charlie slaps Ich on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK smiles at Charlie's remark. He can't help but like this wide-eyed goofy kid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something makes Nick's smile fade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KOBO, their escaped prisoner, hurrying in the opposite direction. His Kamali suit looks like it just came from the cleaners.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie spots him. In a flash, the two men jump the railing and charge after him, leaving Ich in their wake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ich can't possibly make it over the side. He furiously shoves his way through the Salarymen, trying to get to the end of the walkway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHASE SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Nick barreling through the mass of faceless Salarymen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Kobo, hurrying ahead, occasionally glancing back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Charlie catching up to Nick. They've lost him. They spin around. A half dozen tunnels spin out in all directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Nick and Charlie spotting Kobo. He's waiting for them near the turnstile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick suddenly realizes it's a set-up. Before he can say anything, Charlie sprints ahead, recklessly shoving people out of the way.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(calling after him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a set-up...! Charlie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie hasn't heard him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE TURNSTILE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo hands a ticket to the turnstile guard and disappears onto the platform. Charlie doesn't have a ticket. The guard points to the automatic ticket machine. Screw it. Charlie leaps over the turnstile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GUARD blows his shrill whistle to signal the subway police.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PLATFORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie pushes through the crowd -- a wall of blank faces. Kobo is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shoving through the crowd. He spots Charlie. Shouts at him to wait. Charlie can't hear his partner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SUBWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulls in. An immaculately uniformed CONDUCTOR blows his whistle and waves his white-gloved hands to keep the crowd back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LEATHER JACKETED BOY shoves Charlie from behind; he stumbles forward toward the track. Someone catches him at the last moment. Charlie turns around to see it's Kobo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo smiles, it's all a big joke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What follows happens in a flash:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON NICK
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick is close enough to see, too far to do anything. He's blocked by TWO MORE LEATHER BOYS. He tries to shove past, but they grab him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KOBO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
holding Charlie by his coat lapels. An express train tears into the station. Kobo casually glances at
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
trying to struggle free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KOBO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
his eyes still on Nick, drops Charlie in front of the speeding express as if he were a sack of laundry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
A woman SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train barrels through the station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo starts toward Nick. He's next.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pair of SUBWAY POLICEMEN burst through the crowd searching for Charlie because he vaulted the turnstile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
manages to break free of the leatherboys holding him. They flee into the crowd as the police close in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS THE PLATFORM - KOBO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slips into the wave of commuters being shoved into a train by white-gloved MEN. It's their job to shove commuters into the already packed cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick goes for Kobo, but the crowd closes in front of him. He can't get through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SUBWAY DOORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slam shut. The train pulls out leaving Nick standing on the empty platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LAST CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
streaks past him. Kobo stands in the rear window, getting smaller and smaller until the train disappears down the tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<ICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICH>
<DIRECTION>
Ich, out of breath, is standing on the platform. Nick looks at him with disgust -- where the hell was he.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STAY on Nick, his head bowed, being surrounded by the sea of blue-suited commuters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO WHITE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:

NICK'S FACE against a white wall. That's all we see. Ohashi's voice OFF SCREEN.

<OHASHI>

INT. CENTRAL SECTION - TOKYO POLICE H.Q. - DAY

Again, the fifty desks, fifty faceless men working. Typewriters CLACKING, phones RINGING. We MOVE down the rows to find Nick sitting behind one of the desks. He's on the phone to New York.

Oliver hangs up. A moment of long distance hum cross talk. Nick doesn't move. Pull back through the rows of cops busily working... SOUND FADES.

Charlie Parker's alto sax FADE UP as we --

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHINJUKU - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC continues. The sax screams as the melody is abandoned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick is drunk. Roaring angry drunk. He doesn't know where he is. He doesn't care. He plows down the street, occasionally grabbing a passerby, then letting them go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick begins to laugh. A couple is staring at him, Nick yells at them, but we DON'T HEAR HIM. He stumbles on... drop back to find.
</DIRECTION>

ICH

Nick is thrown onto the street. He tries to reenter and is thrown out again. We spot JOYCE inside watching; she turns back to her customers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GINZA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick is hassling a news vendor who pointedly ignores him and continues selling his papers. Ich appears and apologizes to the news vendor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - TWO A.M.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick's sitting on the curb, his head in his hands. People step around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the street, out of Nick's sight, Ich is watching his partner, feeling every barb of Nick's shame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie Parker continues over the slow...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
asleep, the futon tangled around him. He opens his eyes. A woman is making tea in the kitchenette. This is the kimonoed woman who led Nick and Charlie to Ich the other night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RADIO is on softly in the background. The Charlie Parker tune we've been listening to over the previous cuts ends, and the announcer comes on:
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... That was the Bird, from the Blue Note years. 1230 hours and 72 degrees in central Osaka. This is specialist Doug Dale, Tapestries in Jazz, on the Far East Network, armed forces radio...

<DIRECTION>
Nick slowly sits up to see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ICH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
seated at a low table looking at him from across the room.
</DIRECTION>

Nick spots his clothes and luggage stacked in the corner. Nick now realizes he's in Ich's apartment. It's spotless. Everything is now in its proper place.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>

Nick's eyes fall on Charlie's things: his sports clothes, his tour book, his shoes which Ich has stacked on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<ICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...

INT. PUBLIC BATH - DAY

The neighborhood bathhouse. Thick with steam and neighborhood kids.
</DIRECTION>

Nick walks toward the huge pool of water. Ich is beside him. Nick's about to climb in when Ich stops him, hands him a pail and a washcloth and points to the faucets along the wall where a dozen men squat on small stools as they wash themselves.

</ICH>

Nick looks at this thick bellied, alcoholic cop. Not a very reassuring thought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO MEN carrying plastic pails cross in front of the tub. Young, muscular Yakuza, their bodies covered with exquisite tattoos. They stare openly at Nick. One makes a joke. Both laugh obscenely as they slip into the hot tub.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yakuza?

Ich nods. Nick eyes them for a long beat, then climbs out of the tub.

When he turns back, Nick's taxi has disappeared.

Ich bumps into a table; slaps a stranger on the shoulder; then starts singing along with Frank Sinatra on the stereo. He's a little too loud, a little off key.

The bodyguards eye Ich suspiciously. He stumbles past them, then grabs the sliding door and yanks it open.

A low table. Kobo is at one end. An older, distinguished, sliver-haired man in his seventies whom we will come to know as SUGAI is at the other. Ich can't believe his eyes: Sugai is the head of the largest Yakuza syndicate in Japan.

SUGAI AND KOBO

</KOBO>
<DIRECTION>
From across the street, a dozen bodyguards appear from various doorways and alleys.
</DIRECTION>
<KOBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie was a rookie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KOBO>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo traces his finger across the spot where he cut Nick in New York.
</DIRECTION>
<KOBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... But you can take care of yourself. You're 'the biggest thing to hit this town since Godzilla.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</KOBO>
<DIRECTION>
Nick glances at the guards, then back at Kobo. He is unarmed. To make a move would be suicide. More POLICE SIRENS in the b.g. closing in.
</DIRECTION>
<KOBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter. I'm right in front of you, Nick.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(takes a step closer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I was right in front of you when you let Charlie die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KOBO>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo takes a step forward. His face is inches from Nick's.
</DIRECTION>
<KOBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walk away again. Maybe you'll get used to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KOBO>
<DIRECTION>
Nick doesn't budge.

A LONG BEAT, then... Nick turns and slowly walk off. After a dozen yards Nick looks back.

The street is empty, except for a street sweeper pushing his wet broom down the block.

EXT. HOSTESS CLUB - NIGHT

A half dozen bodyguards are being frisked, then shoved into police cars.

</NICK>
<OHASHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your visa has expired. Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.

</NICK>
<OHASHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OHASHI>
<DIRECTION>
Ohashi directs Nick's attention across the street where a SURVEILLANCE VAN is parked. The rear doors are open revealing a van full of surveillance equipment and cops.
</DIRECTION>
<OHASHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ruined an on-going investigation that could have gotten us more than one runner.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ich, in Japanese)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want a full report in the morning, officer.

Ich bows as Ohashi walks off.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe if you'd work with us --

</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Ohashi ignores him, continues walking toward his waiting car.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey...!

Ohashi slips into his car. Nick storms up to the car and slams his fist on the window.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ohashi!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Ohashi faces straight ahead, ignoring Nick. Nick takes the extradition paper and spikes it on the car antenna.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ich grabs Nick by his arm, pulling him back from the car. The car pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<ICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick, stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICH>
<DIRECTION>
Nick whirls, and before he realizes what he's doing, punches Ich below his left eye. Ich stumbles back over the curb and lands on his ass.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damnit, Ichiro, I'm tired of people telling me what I can and can't do. No one ever solved anything sitting on their ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick, beside himself with frustration, watches Ohashi's car disappear down the block.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ICH

INT. ICH'S APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ich, holding an ice pack to his face, is lying on a tatami mat against the wall looking up at the ceiling. An open bottle of Seagrams beside him.
</DIRECTION>

Nick stretches out on another tatami on the opposite side of the room and looks up at the ceiling, too.

<ICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What...? Why?

</ICH>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because he knows how to get to our man.

</NICK>
<ICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICH>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick gets up and goes to the closet. He slides open the door. All of his and Charlie's clothes have been neatly hung up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shoves Charlie's jacket aside. Something's wrong with the way it hangs. He pulls the jacket out, runs his hand over the coat, feeling something heavy in the lining.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick rips the lining open. Charlie's .32 Beretta and a spare clip tumble out.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The little bastard. God bless him.

Nick picks up the liquor cap which rolled across the floor. He tosses it to Ich. Ich reaches for it, but misses.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, pal. You've got better things to do.

We find Joyce and Nick at a corner table having a drink.
</DIRECTION>

Before Nick can respond, something catches his eye: What he sees --

<DIRECTION>
A MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
partially shadowed, standing in the alley.

Nick grabs his gun. The man steps out zipping up his trousers. It's a drunken Salaryman. Nick lowers his gun. The Salaryman staggers down the street singing to himself.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A door slides open at the far end of the room. Sugai, wearing a kimono over western style suit, walks in. Nick stands up to shake his hand. Sugai ignores it, and sits in the traditional position: feet tucked beneath him.

</DIRECTION>

Nick steps out of the house. He now has one end of a wire coat hanger loosely wrapped around Sugai's neck, the other end around his wrist. His gun is pressed just beneath Sugai's ear. If nick gets shot, so does Sugai.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A handful of guards stand in the courtyard, one is polishing Sugai's Debonnaire car. They spot Nick and Sugai coming, and immediately pull their guns.

<NICK>

INT. HOTEL ROOM

<DIRECTION>
Western style. Plastic five foot cacti in front of the western vista on the walls. A hitching post at the head of the bed. Cowboy hats and boots at the other end.

Sugai hangs up the phone and turns to Nick and Joyce who are sitting nearby. Ich hangs up the extension.

Fifties theme. The front end of a pink chevy curves around the bed. A "Drive-In" movie screen along one wall.

A YOUNG GIGGLING COUPLE step out of a door, arm in arm, and disappear down the hall. STAR WARS MUSIC from one room. HAWAIIAN MUSIC from another.

THE CAMERA FINDS the closed elevator door. It opens, Kobo steps out, followed by a half-dozen more men all carrying Sig-Saur assault rifles -- very heavy artillery.

THE ROOM BENEATH HIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A couple are making love in the Hawaiian theme room.

The door burst open. Two men, cradling Sig-Saur rifles in their arms, step in. They aim at the ceiling, blasting into Sugai's room above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GIRL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
starts screaming. The men ignore her and continue to pump bullets into the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KOBO AND HIS MEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stop in front of every door long enough to blast into the room. They make their way down the hall.
</DIRECTION>

A naked man steps into the hallway and is matter-of-factly gunned down.

Kobo and his men stop in front of Sugai's room.

<DIRECTION>
Kobo signals the men. All six open-up through the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door, what's left of it, is kicked open. The six men step in, shooting in all directions: into the bathroom door, into the closet... Windows shatter, mirrors fall, total destruction. They stop. SILENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo walks up to Sugai who is slumped on the couch. He lifts up his hat. It's a cowboy mannequin wearing Sugai's clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ELEVATOR DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
opens. A DOZEN of Sugai's men carrying machine pistols come out.

Nick and Ich lie on their bellies, guns out.

Kobo's men turn. Sugai's men open-up. Three of Kobo's hitters go down. The others try to flee into the adjoining room.

Kobo goes for the balcony.

NICK

who slams the side of Kobo's head with the butt of his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Nick and Ich drag Kobo in by his jacket collar. Sugai, very much alive, walks in from the hallway. Nothing is said. Sugai looks at Kobo for a long beat, then walks out.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUGAI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
wearing a western suit, is asking Kobo questions in Japanese. Sugai barks at him again. Kobo refuses to answer. Sugai pulls up a shuto -- an 18 inch knife -- from it's scabbard.

	You have betrayed the syndicate and personally dishonored me. I would rather the deal fell through than...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAI>

The guards walk over and turn Kobo around. His back is to Sugai. Sugai runs the sword across the nape of Kobo's neck drawing blood. The guards tighten their grip on Kobo's arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
can't believe Sugai's going to kill him. Nick starts to get up, Ich stops him.

Kobo realizes Sugai isn't just threatening him.

	No... I'll arrange it.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo is led back into the room by two guards. The guards shove him down to the floor. His hands are still bound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick walks over and stands above him. He doesn't say a word. Just stands above him. Then, Nick pulls spare change from his pocket and slowly drops the coins, one by one, in front of Kobo's face, like Kobo did to him. He walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sugai steps in.
</DIRECTION>
<SUGAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Abolofia's person has received the plate. It's done.

A door opens at the far end of the room. It's Kobo's girlfriend, the one Nick and Ich had been following.

<DIRECTION>
She starts toward Kobo; a lieutenant intercepts her.

	<DIALOGUE>

</SUGAI>
<DIRECTION>
Sugai turns away and picks up the sword. The guards clutch Kobo. Sugai's going to kill Kobo after all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girl screams at him to stop. Sugai's oblivious.

<NICK>

	After a court convicts him. He belongs to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
There's a long pause. Then, something unusual happens. Sugai tells the lieutenant to unfasten Kobo's wrist. When he does, Sugai hands Kobo the sword and demands that he cut off his finger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is Yubitsume: the ritual act within the Yakuza of slicing the joint of the little finger to atone for a mistake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo, not believing in this ancient tradition, refuses. Sugai nods to a guard who places Kobo's finger on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KOBO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stares defiantly at Sugai. He doesn't even wince as the blade slices off his finger. The guard hands Sugai the finger in a handkerchief.

A police car rolls through the service gate. We see Nick inside the car along with two police guards.

INT. HOLDING ROOM - NARITA AIRPORT

A white room. No chairs. Jet engines can be HEARD through the walls. Nick is sitting on the floor, defeated. He doesn't look up when he hears someone enter.

Nick looks up. Ich is in uniform. A revolver and batton hang from his white web gear. His undershirt bulges through his khaki shirt. He looks ridiculous. Nick has never seen a more beautiful sight.

INT. POLICE CAR

Ich is driving. Nick is seated behind a cage in the back seat. His hands are cuffed. Ich is driving through the freight area towards a perimeter guard.

<NICK>

	You know, Ichiro, you just burned your bridges.

WHAT THEY SEE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large crowd gathered outside of Sugai's estate. Police have cordoned off the area. An empty ambulance is parked out front with various other cars: Debonnaire's, Cadillac's... A boy in shorts is endlessly bouncing a ball against the compound wall. Whatever happened is long over.
</DIRECTION>

Ich flips off the radio.

Nick is at the wheel. He rubs the sleep from his eyes. Ich is slumped down in the seat watching the road.

Ich pulls out a cigarette. Nick lights it for him.

<DIRECTION>
ON NICK AND ICH
</DIRECTION>

sitting in the car watching from a hillside turnoff. There's no easy way in.

<DIRECTION>
NICK AND ICH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
making their way through the waist high water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO WORKERS

<DIRECTION>
with their hoes make their way into the water. They don't see our cops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUR COPS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
making their way along the edge of the road. The SOUND of a motorcycle coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MOTORCYCLE RIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slows and drops a gear as he turns off the main road and onto the dirt berm toward the house. He's one of Kobo's Bosozoku -- a long way from the streets of Tokyo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rider comes around the bend to see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A COP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
standing in a uniform. Ich. For a moment he doesn't know what to do. Then, he draws a pistol from his belt and accelerates toward Ich.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ICH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stands his ground as the bike closes in. The biker takes aim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ich drops off to the side as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rises from a ditch and swings a hoe at the rider as he passes, catching the man across the face. The rider drops like a swatted fly. The biker's momentum carries it a few yards before it falls and skids to a halt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick hurries to the bike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ich drags the biker off the road, then catches up to his partner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK AND ICH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
raise the heavy bike. Nick mounts. He takes the riders helmet and goggles from Ich, and puts them on.
</DIRECTION>
<ICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICH>
<DIRECTION>
Nick doesn't know exactly. He taps the bike into gear, it torques like a mule. There's a lot more juice here than he's used to.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick fishtails for a minute, then gets the hang of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ich heads off taking another route.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KOBO AND SUGAI'S DAUGHTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
are putting the last of their belongings into a suitcase. She hands him the plate -- Sugai's plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo kisses her as he slips it into his breast pocket. The SOUND of a motorcycle approaching from outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo steps out, and not recognizing Nick, raises his hand to greet what he thinks is one of his men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
bearing down on Kobo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON KOBO
</DIRECTION>

as Nick keeps coming. He is unable to see clearly until Nick is almost on top of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
dumps the bike at the foot of the stairs and leaps on Kobo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick and Kobo roll off the narrow porch. Nick breaks free. He isn't fighting fair this time. He slams his foot into Kobo's face and ribs. Kobo tries to get up, but Nick knees him in the chin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A woman cries out in Japanese. Nick turns to see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOYCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
standing at the top of the steps. A biker is pressing the muzzle of a Sig-Saur assault rifle on her. Kobo's girl is beside them holding a small pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KOBO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gets to his feet. The biker tosses Kobo the rifle. Kobo works the charging lever and holds the weapon at his side. He has all the time in the world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo whirls and kicks Nick in the groin. Nick falls to his knees in agony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo towers above Nick as he did in the alley in New York.
</DIRECTION>
<KOBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still on your knees, Nick?

</KOBO>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo walks off, his back to Nick.

	There's nothing you can do for me anymore. I have the plate. Sugai's dead. No there is something.

He walks up to the steps to Joyce.
</DIRECTION>
<KOBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can tell me who I should shoot first.

Nick struggles to get to his feet. Kobo turns and faces Nick at the foot of the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ICH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
appears behind Kobo and takes him down with an amazing display of baton work that shows a lifetime of training.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs the gun. A biker bursts out of the door. Ich fires, hitting him in the thigh. He drops his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUGAI'S DAUGHTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
grabs the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
tackles her, and wrestles the gun away. She grabs for it. Nick slugs her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GUN BLAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ich is hit in the back of his shoulder, falls onto the porch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KOBO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the shooter, is holding a pistol -- a Glock 17 automatic. He fires at
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK AND JOYCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who scramble for cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KOBO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
continues firing as he climbs onto a motorcycle. He pops the clutch and flies off down the road. Nick fires after him, but Kobo's gone.

Nick mounts the other bike, and puts the turbo charged rocket into gear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rain pours down as Kobo turns onto the main road. He opens up the throttle, and in less than a second, he's a screaming dot in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
comes around the same corner. His bike fishtails and slides out from under him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo tears past a police car. The police car takes off after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FOOTHILLS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A series of steep switchbacks traverse the steep, densely forested hills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo's bike flies up the road. The police car can't keep up, begins losing ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE POLICE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
going flat out, falling further and further behind. Kobo's going to escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick, bent low, shoots past the cop car. His left arm is scraped and bloody.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON KOBO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
glancing back, to see Nick gaining on him. Kobo's pleased. He gives it more gas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulling eight-five... ninety... one hundred. The rain stings his face. It's hard to keep his eye open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FOOTHILLS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo leaning into one of the steep turns, climbing higher and higher toward the clouds clinging to the top of the peak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is gaining on him. He HEARS something coming up behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BOSOZOKU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the one Ich shot in the leg, is closing fast on his tail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the biker draws even.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BIKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulls out his long knife and slashes at Nick's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick drops back causing him to miss. The biker drops back. Nick tries to speed up, but the biker sticks with him. He's a good rider, this boy. Very, very good.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The biker moves in again, blade drawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK SEES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
something the biker doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
coming around the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
swerves to avoid it at the last moment. The biker reacts too late and runs --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTO THE GLEAMING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
radiator of the two ton truck, and disappears beneath its wheels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON KOBO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
around the bend, glancing back. Empty road. He eases up on the throttle -- a free man... He circles back only to see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
burst around the corner charging toward him at a hundred- and-twenty miles per hour, in the driving rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KOBO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
waits and waits. Nick draws closer. Then, Kobo tears off back down the mountain, shooting past Nick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick brakes... He slows down, and starts to turn, but the wheels whirl on the gravel and the bike goes into a skid, heading right for the edge of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
NICK'S MOTORCYCLE

<DIRECTION>
flying over the edge of the road, and down the cliff.

CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
THE EDGE OF THE ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick, lying on his stomach at the edge of the cliff, his arm is probably broken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to get up with a one arm push up. It's hopeless. His head falls into a puddle of water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WHINE of an approaching motorcycle. Kobo has come back for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick, in excruciating pain, struggles for his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KOBO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
bearing down on Nick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
struggling to get his gun. Finally he does. But it's caked in mud. If the barrel is stuffed it will explode. Nick has to take the chance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON KOBO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Closer and closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
aims as best he can and fires. The mud caked gun explodes in his hand. Nick screams in agony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KOBO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulls his bike up inches in front of Nick's head. Nick seems to be bleeding everywhere: his hand, his nose, his mouth, the side of his head...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kobo's face and neck is caked in blood from when Nick beat him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rain pours down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up the gun. Points it at Nick, squeezes the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<KOBO>

Kobo guns the engine. He gain speed... thirty, thirty- five.

NICK

reaches into his coat and pulls Ich's 18 inch shuto out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rolls away at the last moment, slashing Kobo's ankle as he races past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KOBO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
screams in pain. He tries to stop too suddenly. The bike flips over. Kobo flies into the air then hits the pavement on his side and rolls a few yards down the road. He stops on his back. It's lucky he's alive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUND of fast approaching police SIRENS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PLATE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has fallen out of Kobo's jacket. It rests in the road, halfway between the two men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KOBO
</DIRECTION>

crawls toward it on his belly.

KOBO'S FINGERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they reach for the plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
grabs Kobo's wrist forcing him to drop the plate. Nick picks up a rock. It looks as if he's going to smash Kobo's head. Instead, he brings it down on the plate, shattering it in a half-dozen pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick tosses the pieces in front of Kobo's face.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep the change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick, exhausted, slowly falls onto his back. He looks over at Kobo, their faces are inches apart. Nick makes a slashing mark with his index finger above his eyebrows. The same gesture Kobo made to Nick through the two-way mirror in New York.

<DIRECTION>
Nick passes out. His eyes shut... the screen...
</DIRECTION>

	You know, Nick, if you'd held on to that plate, you could've been a very rich man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Oliver turns to face Nick. Nick just looks at him, then:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never crossed my mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Oliver nods; he believes him.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be careful on the run.

INT. SQUAD BAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In contrast to the Japanese police station -- it's chaos. Cops are in every imaginable kind of dress, trash cans over flow, a handcuffed prisoner screams abuse to anyone who will listen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RAIDING PARTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a dozen men in all, are donning flak jackets and windbreakers with POLICE and TREASURY stenciled on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
walks in with two heavy bullet proof vests slung over his shoulder. He squeezes past the raiding party to find
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ICH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sitting at a desk, thumbing through a Frommer's guide to New York City. Nick drops one of the vests on the desk. It lands like a ton of bricks. Ich continues to read.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Sergeant walks in.
</DIRECTION>
<SERGEANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Saddle up. Hard team in the first unit. Conklin, your RMP awaits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGEANT>
<DIRECTION>
The cops and treasury men, grabbing their gear, head for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick is struggling to get into his vest using one arm.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure you want to come? Probably better than the Greyline Tour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Ich stands up, shoves the guidebook in his back pocket. He helps Nick fasten the strap in back.
</DIRECTION>
<ICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wouldn't make it without me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICH>
<DIRECTION>
Nick smiles, takes the Frommer's out of Ich's pocket and tosses it into the trash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick hands him a shotgun, takes another one off the rack for himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We watch from behind as the two men head down the long hallway toward the exit.
</DIRECTION>
<ICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think we'll get him, Nick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICH>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't lose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you be so sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICH>
<DIRECTION>
Nick opens the door at the far end of the hallway. They step out into the sunlit rain.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cause you're the biggest thing to hit this town since...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Before Nick can finish his line, the door SLAMS SHUT behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
