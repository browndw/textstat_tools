FIGURE IN A SANTA CLAUS SUIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lies face-down in a nighttime expanse of snow. One of the body's red-sleeved arms is twisted at a sickening angle. The white snow beneath the figure is spreading with red.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SNOWY ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure in the suit lies motionless. Snowflakes drift.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark, rustic wood, an office with broken windows and whistling winter beyond. A second BODY in a Santa Claus suit lies dead in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a man with a large build. The suit is riddled with holes. His face is missing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More snow falling. A handful of cars in the lot. A third BODY in the same red-and-white outfit lies atop the hood of an old Pontiac. His head is not visible, having smashed through the windshield. His suit is charred and blackened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A halo of broken glass outlines him. His black boots hang off the front bumper. The parking lot is silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A floor scattered with shiny silver quarters. Reflections of neon. There's a fourth SANTA here, face-down in a red pool. The suit is far too big for him. Not that it matters now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SNOW-FILLED RAVINE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where the fifth and final Santa lies at the edge of a ravine, which plummets a hundred feet down. The man rests precariously atop the slope, upside-down, eyes closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His burned suit is smoldering. He has a sly but tired face, late-20's, sandy hair, cold and scarred. This is RUDY DUNCAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens his eyes.

CUT TO BLACK:

<DIRECTION>
THE SOUND OF A WINTER WIND

rises, as a TITLE appears: "SEVEN DAYS BEFORE..."

<DIRECTION>
And then, to complete the sentence: "...XMAS."

EXT. IRON MOUNTAIN STATE PRISON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snow drifts down onto the stone walls and wire fences of the Iron Mountain, Michigan S.I.C. Winter's been here awhile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRISON CELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy Duncan lies in his top bunk, staring at his ceiling -- where a handful of paper-cut snowflakes have been pasted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sounds of YELLING INMATES and GATES slamming shut echo through the fortress. Rudy watches a spider scurry across the paper snow. It's his excitement for the day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to the wall, where there's a photo of his teenage self with some co-workers at an auto body shop. And a family photo, cheery Midwesterners, with Rudy a scowling Artful Dodger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WALL CALENDAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shows the dates have been crossed off up to December 18th.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
December 22nd is circled again and again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy muses at the calendar, then hops out of his bunk. Drops to the floor, crosses to a desk, finds a chewed-on pen. Turning back to the beds we reveal --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LOWER BUNK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where Rudy's cellmate, NICK MASON (32), rugged, mustached and well-built, sleeps soundly. In contrast, his bed-wall is a COLLAGE OF PHOTOGRAPHS, twenty, maybe thirty of them. Almost a mural.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All of them photos of A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL, mid-twenties, smiling out from beaches, parties and snowy scenes. Gorgeous brown hair, heartbreaking smile. Effortlessly sexy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stares at the pictures for a moment, wistful. Nick snores, turns over. Rudy climbs atop his bunk again, with the pen this time. And crosses December 18th off the calendar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

The two of them, Nick and Rudy, shivering by the fence. Nick absently whistles some "Silver Bells," then digs for a smoke.

Dozens of uniformed INMATES wander the yard, stamping feet, hands tucked away, breath frosting. Nick tries to light his cig, but the wind plays havoc. Nick curses, tosses it.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>

	Hot chocolate.

</NICK>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.

Nick grins. They stand there, shivering. It's freezing, but the time they get outside is too precious to give up.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All those pictures she's sent... y'know... you sure they're all of her, Nick? You hear sometimes they don't send their real pictures. Could be her cousin or something.

Nick studies him.

They trail off in silence. Nick looks out at the prison road again. A snowy wasteland.

	Hey, hey, listen here. "I've made my list and I've checked it twice, and as long as you're naughty, it's gonna be nice. These cold winter weeks have been killing me, Nick, as I lie here alone. It's not enough to have your warmth in my heart anymore; I need your warmth next to me. Work at Penney's has been busy because it's Christmas and that's when we do almost half of our business for the whole year -- ", okay, whatever, whatever --

	Here we go. "And all that gets me through the day is to close my eyes and imagine holding you, and kissing you, and touching you, and tasting you everywhere because I know at that moment, I'll feel I've found the reason for my whole entire life."
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy still stares at the stone ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick's doing pushups on the floor below, smoking a cig, reading sheets of pink stationery. With a new photo: of the same GIRL, in a bikini by a lake. Vamping a childish pose.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure as hell don't make me miss Millie Bobek. Guess I owe Millie, though. If I hadn't been rollin, her, I woulda never ended up here. And I woulda never met Ashley.

Nick climbs off the floor, paces back to the bunks, marvelling at the latest letter.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.

Nick drops the page on his stomach. Rudy sighs, picks it up, brings it to his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's using a new perfume.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<NICK>

<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.

<NICK>

Nick drops back to his bunk, pasting the new lakeside photo among his collage of pictures. Admiring his pen pal:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoulda got yourself a girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Above, Rudy peruses the page Nick gave him. Some lipstick marks pressed to the paper. He passes it back, closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.

There's the echo of CRASHING metal gates. Prisoners YELLING. Nick smiles, still staring at his girl.

<NICK>

	Well, man. Me and Ashley. We'll be thinking about you.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN PRISON FLOOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUARDS monitor PRISONERS as they file out of their cells for the afternoon meal. Rudy and Nick are motioned out by a MEAN GUARD, his bitter world etched in his face. They join the line.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. Alamo's back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Across Broadway, a parallel line is forming. A tall, tattooed Native American, THE ALAMO, steps out of his cell. His hands are the size of a man's skull.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, Rudy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment, Alamo glances over. Finds Rudy's eyes. Rudy swiftly looks away --
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Count me outta mealtime --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
He slaps Nick an the back, heads back for their cell --
</DIRECTION>
<MEAN_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GET BACK IN LINE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEAN_GUARD>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not hungry, I'm gonna --

</RUDY>
<MEAN_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SHOULDA STAYED IN YOUR HOLE! GET BACK IN FUCKING LINE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEAN_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
The mean guard pulls his blackjack. Another guard's ready behind him. They want Rudy to give them trouble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy stops. Slides back into the line of prisoners. Looks across Broadway. The Alamo's walked on up ahead. Rudy swallows, heads toward the mess hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MESS HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GLOOPY SPOON of CHUNKY RED AND GREEN JELLO gets splooshed on Rudy's plate. Same with Nick. It's the cafeteria line.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck is this?

</NICK>
<UGLY_STAFFER>

<UGLY_STAFFER>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</UGLY_STAFFER>
<DIRECTION>
The ugly staffer grins from under his plastic hairnet. Nick looks to Rudy, then turns back to the help:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just so you know, this man and I are outta here in two days. So while we're inhaling London broil and lobster bisque, you're gonna still be standing here smelling up the mystery creamfuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's in prison now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
The ugly staffer curls his lip. Nick smiles. Rudy moves on, taking his tray off the rail and turning --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- right into the chest of The Alamo. He looks up -- into the most scarred and vengeful face a man could ever dread to see. The Alamo's a lifer. Many times over.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_ALAMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you don't expect it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_ALAMO>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't me, Alamo --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<THE_ALAMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's when.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_ALAMO>
<DIRECTION>
The Alamo strides into the cafeteria line. Rudy finally takes a breath, as if he's dodged death. Nick's at his shoulder. They share a grave and worried look. Trying to help:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MESS HALL - TABLES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy and Nick sit at a cafeteria table. Beside Rudy is a frail, nervous, fiftyish inmate, ZOOK. Zook sits alone, talks to no one, always has the shakes.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, working security?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, I've seen the business world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business. Chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy shrugs. He checks across the room, on the whereabouts of The Alamo. The big Indian has his back turned.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ashley's talking about maybe we can start something up together...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Next to Rudy, Zook has stopped eating. He is still as stone, staring at his tray.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatsa matter, Zook?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
They both watch Zook put down his utensils and reach into his red-and-green jello with his bare hand.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hell you doing, Zookerman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Gloppy gelatin drips from his hand, as the frail man lifts a large black cockroach out. Zook's shaking.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a roach, Zook.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<RUDY>

Zook stands up, holding jello aloft:

	THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN! THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!

A GRUMBLING MURMUR sweeps through the cafeteria as inmates sift through their jello, searching for --
</DIRECTION>
<DISTANT_INMATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sonofabitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DISTANT_INMATE>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls something bug-like out of his dessert, holds it aloft, and then HURLS it at the cafeteria line. A STAFFER ducks away. The inmates LAUGH and suddenly they're all on their feet --
</DIRECTION>
<ZOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOOK>
<DIRECTION>
-- grabbing handfuls of jello and throwing it at the cafeteria line. Inmates get errantly SPLASHED, and respond by wheeling on their fellow inmates -- red and green globs flying to and fro!
</DIRECTION>
<GUARDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SIT DOWN! SIT THE FUCK BACK DOWN!
	</DIALOGUE>

As GUARDS immediately rush in to restore order --

</NICK>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
An INMATE at the end of their table picks up their table and overturns it, sending food flying. Rudy and Nick stand back, hands raised in surrender. Jello HITS Rudy in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move, Rudy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Standing right here, man!

</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Zook is still SHOUTING until a GUARD clubs him senseless with a blackjack. WHISTLES are blowing. Guards SCREAM for order.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(as a GUARD eyes them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ate the jello, jello was fine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
The guard leaves them alone, runs on. The melee's still out of control. As Rudy turns --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and suddenly sees The Alamo charging across the room, with murderous eyes, a metal shank in his hand! Five feet away!
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	RUDY, LOOK OUT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick grabs him, trying to push him out of the way --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and The Alamo's shank plunges deep into Nick's stomach burying between his ribs. Blood splashes. Nick slumps.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NICK!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
The Alamo pulls the blade out with a ferocious YELL, pushes Nick to the floor and spins on Rudy! Rudy blocks with a chair, stumbling back, cartwheeling over a table as The Alamo roars over him for the kill --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and two GUARDS tackle the big Indian out of nowhere! Knocking the knife away, hammering him with blackjacks. It takes another three guards to keep The Alamo down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy scrambles across the floor. Nick's on his back, blood pumping freely from his gut --

	YOU TELL HER!

<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>

</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Blood spills out Nick's mouth. His eyes go vacant.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...for Christmas...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NICK!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
And Rudy's suddenly hauled backwards. A trio of GUARDS descend, grabbing Nick's body as his life fades away. Dragging his figure out of the melee. WHISTLES are blowing.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GET HIM OUT OF HERE! LOCK DOWN!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARDS>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NICK!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy struggles, enraged, and gets blackjacked across the skull for his trouble. He hits the jello-covered floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the world goes dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darkness and shadows. Rudy sits in a corner, holding his head. The cell block silent for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bootsteps from down the row. A SHADOW falls across Rudy's somber figure. It's the Mean Guard. He stares at Rudy with distinct pleasure.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The man had two days...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<MEAN_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. Least he won't be coming back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEAN_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
The guard grins a gold tooth. Rudy looks at him --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and then springs to his feet, charges the room, grabbing through the bars. The guard takes a calm step back. Keeps the cruel smile.
</DIRECTION>
<MEAN_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need company tonight, Rudy... you just give a holler.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEAN_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
He puckers a kiss and walks on. Starts whistling "Are You Lonesome Tonight?" Several shadowed VOICES request that he shut the fuck up. The bootsteps and melody drift down the row.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
turns back, starts toward his bunk. And stops. His eyes on Nick's empty bed. And the wall behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PICTURES OF ASHLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiling, laughing, playing kissy-face. Hearts drawn on the photos. All colors of stationery taped to the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
takes a seat on Nick's bed. There's a shoebox at the foot of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy opens it. It's filled with Ashley's letters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He trails a finger along them, must be over a hundred pages. He selects the one nearest the front. Surveys it.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rudy, man, here we go, here, what she wrote here: "The car's waiting. The motel's waiting. And I'm waiting. I've waited for so long. I'm burning for you, Nick. My whole body. My whole heart. I'm burning for you..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy turns to the wall. To the lakeside picture of Ashley, a swimsuit siren. Rudy stares sadly.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was burning for you too...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
And puts the letter away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON RUDY'S CALENDAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As his hand slashes through December 21st. Prison's over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. IRON MOUNTAIN PRISON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snow swirls. Near blizzard conditions. A heavy steel door BANGS open, held by an EXIT GUARD. And FIFTEEN CONVICTS, make that EX-CONVICTS, trudge onto a fenced drive, covered in snow.
</DIRECTION>
<EXIT_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your world and welcome to it, dumbfucks! Don't be a stranger now! We'll keep the lights on for ya!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXIT_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy stumbles out with the group, shivering in a Goodwill hand-me-down coat. Thin canvas, wouldn't keep him warm in summer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Secondhand shoes. No possessions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He clutches his sides with his hands, hunched over. All fifteen huddle and herd toward the gate at the end of the fenceway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEYOND THE GATE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are a dozen FRIENDS and RELATIVES waiting. A few MEN, several WOMEN, a couple KIDS. Bundled in winter coats, hats and hoods. A prison shuttle bus is parked behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The released cons reach the gate, where a GATE GUARD unlocks the fence to the outside world. Fifteen men are free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ex-cons and relatives scan each other's faces. Wives rush over to embrace their men. Pals nod to ex-cons and trade slaps on backs. Reunion time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The snow batters them, wind whipping. Rudy keeps his head down, leaning forward, keeps walking. Toward the bus. But he can't help himself -- he glances up --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TO SEE A YOUNG WOMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
bundled in a silver ski jacket, pink wool hat with a poofball on top, scarf and mittens. Scanning the released prisoners.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
drops his head, looks away. Climbs onto the shuttle bus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy shakes his arms, basking in the vehicle's warmth. Takes a seat at the back. A couple other lone ex-cons climb aboard. Then the cons with relatives start to pile in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy's window is steamed against the cold. He stares into his lap, then reaches for his coat pocket. Takes out the picture of Ashley, in her bikini by the lake. Stares at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rubs his window with his sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, the woman in the silver coat turns this way and that, troubled. She's watching the other ex-cons climbing onto the bus with their loved ones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman looks back to the prison. The guard closing the gate. The steel door has been shut. No one else is coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy watches her sadly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aboard the bus, the seats fill up. Ex-cons are feeling up their wives, kids are climbing on their absent daddies, buddies are jawing loudly 'bout how the neighborhood's changed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman outside is now alone. Silver coat, pink poofball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy looks at the bikini picture again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then at the shivering bundle.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do it, Rudy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
The bus ENGINE starts up. In the seat beside Rudy, an EX-CON makes out with his WIFE while his bratty KID punches his leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out the window, the young woman is scanning the bus windows. Then the prison again. She turns in a worried circle. Rudy looks swiftly away. Closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do it ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
The bus door closes. It REVS and starts forward. Rudy sighs with relief. The photo of Ashley falls to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRISON RELEASE GATE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The young woman watches the bus pull away, down the snowy road. But it doesn't get fifty feet before it suddenly stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens. And Rudy steps out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bus REVS up again and GROANS OFF into the winter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The young woman pushes her poofball hat out of her eyes. We get a look at her face for the first time. Skin pale, lips turning blue, but it's the girl from the pictures. It's Ashley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She watches Rudy's figure trudge back toward her. Snow obscuring him until he's right in front of her. Both of them shivering. Both of them standing there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And finally:
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You Ashley?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley nods. And Rudy sadly smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Nick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRUCK STOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy and Ashley sit at a coffee shop booth. Coats still on. Big rigs bluster by on the highway outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two untouched cups of coffee sit before them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's watching him in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like your coat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley says nothing. Rudy looks at his own:
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This -- this is just something they gave me at the door. Wasn't snowing when we signed up, y'know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley nods.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's your coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley looks at it, like she's just realizing it's there. She lifts the cup, takes a sip. Puts it down.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy nods. Silence again.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotta be ten degrees out there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Radio said negative five.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Negative five?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think it's negative five.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Radio said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wind chill. That's probably what they meant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley nods. Rudy bites his lip.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was scared. Scared you were gonna take one look at me and change your mind. Scared I was walking into heartache. All those words... you put a picture in your mind of where they come from and when you see where maybe it's not the same as your picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
He trails off.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, hey, I like your coat --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Saw me --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy goes silent. Whoa. Ashley considers.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Another awkward pause. Rudy picks up a milk dispenser beside the coffee, puts it to his lips. It gives him a wide white mustache. He stares straight-faced.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley gives a bashful smile, covers it.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do that again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley smiles again, blushing now.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One more. Smile. One more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(trying not to)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, c'mon --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
They stare across the table, drifting into one another's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're better than the picture in my mind, Nick...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, another truck rumbles by, whipping up snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INTERSTATE MOTEL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Rudy and Ashley SLAM inside, kissing passionately, limbs intertwined, pawing at each other's coats. Rudy kicks the door closed. Mouths devouring, hands lost in snowy hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They collide with a side table, knocking over a lamp, tumbling onto the lumpy bed. Rudy tears at her silver coat and sweater and turtleneck and capilene and whatever else's she got on, as Ashley's lips explore his neck and body. Writhing and wrestling and rolling off the bed. Bang.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy and Ashley fuck like lovers in R-rated movies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bed sheets lie tangled on the floor. Rudy and Ashley rest naked amidst them. Her pretty young head on his chest, all their inhibitions gone. Rudy strokes her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not that, no...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs, kisses her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Me too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(considers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley studies his face, smiles in reflection.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you, Nick. Remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not bad. Just regular.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to him, kisses his chest --
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes it was all you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then he shoulda signed his name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns over playfully, eases herself back atop him. Ready to make up for lost time. With a kiss:
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he'd be here right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley runs through an Xmas-decorated megamall, dragging Rudy behind her. Both of them laughing, as she hauls him over to some cookie bakery company:
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where the hell are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>

<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.

<DIRECTION>
INT. J.C. PENNEY'S DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Teddy bears with nightcaps, green bows, red ribbons. Ashley's tearing through men's clothing racks, all love and confidence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy's got a bunch of purchase bags weighing him down:
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need a COAT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ash, you've gotten me enough --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>

She pulls out a hellacious black leather fringe number.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>

She puts the jacket against his chest, smiling. Rudy sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's two hundred dollars, Ash --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
She whips a Penney's card from her purse, grins wickedly:
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You forget where I work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>

<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
She runs off with the jacket. Rudy turns to a dressing mirror, left to stare at his reflection. An ex-con in rags, with a half-dozen holiday shopping bags. To himself:
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just for the holidays, Nick. Then we'll tell her. We'll let her... have her holidays...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy nods till he convinces himself. Can't help but smile.

INT. TOY STORE - DAY

Puzzles, Barbies and dinosaurs. KIDS scurrying, PARENTS chasing. Rudy and Ashley with a scared TEEN CLERK:

As bottles of wine, vodka and rum, cartons of egg nog and orange juice, and countless prepackaged sandwiches come scrolling past.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I was thinking, after our holiday hideaway? Instead of going back to Detroit, maybe we could go gambling. Y'know? Drive up to that Indian place you worked at. Wouldn't that be fun? I haven't gone gambling in forever!

EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - DUSK

Light snow falls. Rudy, in his new black fringe eyesore, and Ashley carry grocery bags across the icy asphalt:

<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't know about that --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>

	Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --

	We'll have more fun in Detroit.

</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could live it up and --

</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
It comes out too harsh. Ashley stops, a little hurt.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just... I thought you'd have friends there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy softens, touches her arms:
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. I been in prison for two years, Ash. Believe me. Those guys wouldn't want to see me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her. She nods, dismisses it, kisses back.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, they don't know what the hell they're missing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley's Chevy Nova pulls back into the lot of the roadside joint. There's an artificial (silver) Christmas tree tied to the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She and Rudy climb out; she heads for the office:
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see what I can do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, lover. I'll see what you can do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, sashays sexily away. Rudy watches her go, admiring his good fortune. Then pops the trunk, collects some of their shopping score. Gifts and goodies.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(sings, sotto)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no gifts to bring, parum-pum- pum-pum. No treasures for the king, pa-rum-pum-pum-pum...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Loaded down, he struggles to the motel room, balances bags on his knee, gets the key in the door, and heads inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pitch dark. Rudy fumbles his way in:
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<MERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Nick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy drops the shopping bags, whirls around, as a stocky black shadow, MERLIN, all 280 pounds of him, KICKS the door shut --
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
-- and SWINGS a baseball bat toward Rudy's chest. Rudy gets an arm down to deflect the blow, but it still stings like a mother. Rudy HOWLS. Merlin comes at him again --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and this time Rudy slips by. Merlin's bat SHATTERS a dresser.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy grabs him by the neck, kicks out his knees and wrests him to the ground. Grabs the bat --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and gets DECKED from behind by another shadow, PUG, a little white guy with a snarl. They go CRASHING onto the bed, grappling for leverage, and then to the floor --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- where Rudy grabs a champagne bottle from the groceries and BASHES it backwards, shattering it over Pug's head!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pug lets go, as Rudy scrambles up, and Merlin's got him again in a bear hug. Rudy's struggling, whirling with him, crashing into one wall, then another, YELLING for help --
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HEYYY!!! IN HERE!!! HEYYY!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
-- until he hears the PUMP-LOAD SNAP of a shotgun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy stops still. A lamp clicks on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing in silhouette, a figure in a leather duster holds a sawed-off on him.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome home, Nick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Another lamp comes on. Rudy, still in Merlin's choke-hold, gets a look at the gunman, GABRIEL. Weathered face, stringy hair, early 30's. Handsome in a scuzzy way. He's seen a lot of road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy stares, totally thrown. Pug, the little guy, bad teeth, bad hair, bad skin, gets up spitting blood and champagne.
</DIRECTION>
<PUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I owe ya a drink, ya fuck --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUG>
<DIRECTION>
-- and slugs Rudy in the gut. Merlin yanks him back up. Merlin's a black widebody, wears a goatee and brass knuckles. Behind Merlin stands a fourth intruder, a stone-faced Indian in a Grateful Dead longsleeve. JUMPY. Guarding the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel's studying Rudy, up and down. Nods. Merlin relaxes his choke-hold so Rudy can breathe.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You... you don't know me --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you can't --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hell I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
As the room's door gets kicked open --
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch out, baby! I'm bringing in the fucking tree!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
and the silver fake evergreen fills the doorway, getting forced through with Ashley's grunts and groans --
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ASHLEY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Merlin traps his jaw shut. The tree comes squeezing through, followed by Ashley, face in branches --
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm telling you, we got the best one in the store... I don't know why people want their houses smelling like the stupid woods...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
She's GRABBED from behind by Jumpy. Ashley screams, but he slams her against the wall. The tree hits the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NICK!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy fights to help her, but Merlin's got him. Pug locks Ashley's arms. She fights, muffled cries, but Jumpy and Pug have her held firmly. Her face to the wall --
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(re: the silver tree)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hope her taste in men's better than her taste in Christmas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley's turned to face him. Her eyes widen. Gabriel nods.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, sis. Happy holidays.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy's jaw drops. He looks to Ashley. Then to Gabriel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley YELLS, enraged, kicking and clawing. Jumpy slams her back against the wall for her trouble --
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jumpy, don't hurt her, now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel steps to Rudy. Studies him.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gabriel -- !

</ASHLEY>
<GABRIEL>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gabriel, what are you doing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel raises the sawed-off to Rudy's chest. Rudy flinches, but Merlin's got him.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GABRIEL!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel fixes her with a stare. She shuts up. To Rudy:
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gabriel, let him go --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Read a lot about you, Nick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing here?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Read you're a man of some knowledge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gabriel!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A man of some travels.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy's trying to speak, voice CHOKED. Gabriel nods to Merlin, who again eases his hold. Rudy coughs.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm... not... Nick...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel frowns. Rudy turns to Ashley.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not him. I...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then to Gabriel)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.

</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(hurt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel looks from her to him, then lowers his sawed-off, and SWINGS it into Rudy's stomach. Rudy buckles. Panicked.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put him in the truck.

<RUDY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You what...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ashley)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I -- I just wanted to be --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
A glance of regret amidst his desperation. Ashley stares back, confused, searching his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not Nick Mason...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shared his cell!

</RUDY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you were saying you were...

</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes!

</RUDY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you could get with my sister.

</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you could get down her chimney.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you think telling me that's gonna help your cause.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel RATCHETS him across the chin with the gun butt. Rudy hits the floor. Gabriel spins on Ashley, enraged:
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this him!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(reaches for Rudy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

(reaches for Rudy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Gabriel, don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel puts the gun to Rudy's head.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YES!!!

</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel doesn't shoot. Studies Rudy.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, he's gonna have to learn to give you some respect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel KICKS Rudy in the jaw. Ashley screams. Gabriel motions to his boys: Jumpy and Pug drag her outside. Gabriel KICKS Rudy again. Rudy lies there and takes it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merlin lights a cig, examines Rudy and Ashley's grocery bags:
</DIRECTION>
<MERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERLIN>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take 'em.

</GABRIEL>
<MERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERLIN>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave the tree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Merlin nods, tucks the bags under his arms, leaves the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel drops beside Rudy, with a sick smile:
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've read your letters, motherfucker. Don't play no reindeer games with me.

EXT. INTERSTATE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we SWOOP DOWN onto a four-lane stretch of winter highway, arcing into the blackness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSING ON an 18-wheel tractor trailer, RUMBLING onward, emblazoned with "Great Lakes Trucking." There's an airbrush painting on the door to the cab, of a skeleton looking thru a flaming radial tire, and the legend "Motor City Monster."

Gabriel at the wheel, Merlin smoking, Jumpy eating cookies. A TRUCK passes; Gabriel waves. A moment later, the CB crackles:

eyes closed, dried blood, head rocking side to side. He winces, waking, with the headache to end all headaches.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shh, Nick, shh. They won't hurt you now. You're okay...

</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Her hand strokes his face. Rudy's eyes struggle open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON FULL SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're in the back of the truck. There's some packing mats, rope, two tall storage lockers, and Ashley's Chevy Nova.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy's head is in her lap. He struggles to sit up, finds his wrists tied with cord. He looks at Ashley, follows her gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a corner, Pug sits guard in a beanbag chair. He's dipping chewing tobacco, reading Road & Track, headphones on. Gives Rudy a bored glance, then back to his magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.

<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not gonna hurt him anymore!

</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Pug doesn't even look up. Still stroking Rudy's face:
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --

</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick, what are you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>

She reaches out for him; Rudy scrambles to his knees, tumbles against the opposite wall of the trailer.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'M NOT NICK!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

Rudy stops fighting. She has a terrified look in her eye. Checks to Pug: he's watching them now, chewing slower. Ashley turns them away from the little guy's view
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>

<ASHLEY>

Rudy gives her a stone cold stare. Ashley crumbles, touching his face, shaking her head, tears. Devastated.

	"Someday I'm gonna take you up by Lake S. Before I went in, before goddamn Millie, 'fore I had my situation, I used to work up at this casino, working security. Used to watch for people stealing chips, counting cards, getting piss-drunk, that kinda shit. Indian place, they hired this reject outta Vegas to run it, got about as much business sense as a buffalo patty. Anyways, it's a fun place to run some numbers and play."

Rudy steps out of her hold and stalks forward:
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the guy I was in with, I did my last ten months with him. He rode a two-year bit for manslaughter -- split a guy's skull open at a bar for harassing his girl. That's Nick Mason. He worked at that casino. He's the one who wrote her letters. Me, I'm a damn mechanic, my last job was a Quickie Lube, I did five for lifting cars. I don't know shit about blackjack, I don't know shit about Indians. I'm not him.

Merlin and Jumpy grab Rudy and THROW him from the truck. He HITS the snowy parking lot on his side, hands bound.

She charges at her brother. Gabriel grabs her, spins her into control and PUNCHES her in the jaw. She goes flying out of the truck. HITS the ground hard. In shock.

Merlin and Jumpy march Rudy across the lot. A stand of dark and snowy woods ahead...

Rudy struggles, desperate but held firm. Jumpy loads a handgun, as he muses for the very first time:
</DIRECTION>
<JUMPY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The problem with prison... is that it is founded on the fundamentally flawed perception of rehabilitation through punishment. A society can't hope to create a "changed man" by surrounding him with the worst in his fellow man; what it "rehabilitates" is solely a conviction that if he can survive the inhumanity of prison, what then, can he not withstand? He has seen man's darkest soul and kept his sight: what is left for such a man? What faith? What fear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUMPY>

At the woods' edge, Jumpy gives the gun to Merlin --
</DIRECTION>
<JUMPY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get no blood on my boots --

The gun goes to Rudy's head. A bullet fills the chamber. Ashley SCREAMS. Rudy shuts his eyes tight and --

Merlin and Jumpy stop. Ashley stops screaming. Gabriel turns.

His guards look to Gabriel. Rudy nods, sweating.

Merlin and Jumpy wrench Rudy backward. Ashley reaches out to him, starts to speak. He looks right through her. She goes silent, casts her eyes to the snow.

<DIRECTION>
It hits Merlin's boots. Merlin growls.
</DIRECTION>
<PUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whole time you were driving, he was telling her he's not the guy, he's not the guy. I know why he'd tell us he's not the guy. why's he telling her he's not the guy? What if he's not the guy?

Gabriel considers, jumps off the truck. Walks to Rudy:

Rudy raises a finger sharply. Silence. He continues eating. Scrapes the last of his pie crumbs.

Jumpy regards the garlands painted on the windows beside:
</DIRECTION>
<JUMPY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've read where the retail industry does fifty percent of its business between December 1st and December 25th. Half the year's business, in one month's time. It seems to me an intelligent society would legislate a second such gift-giving holiday, create, say, a Christmas Two -- late May, early June -- to further stimulate growth and prosperity. For who would protest such a holiday? Taking the fifty percent model, a Christmas Two would grow this country's annual per capita income by close to one-third.

Rudy crouches behind the door, a piece of iron pipe in his grip, ready to strike. Listening... listening...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS the door SLAMS open, swinging fast and BASHING him in the head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy tags the floor, drops the pipe, knocked out.

Merlin and Pug gaze down on him, shaking their heads. Pug spits tobacco. Hits Merlin's boots again.

<DIRECTION>
INT. TRUCK STOP - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy's back, with a new facial bruise. Ashley reaches for his hand; he pulls it away. Gabriel unfolds a piece of paper -- it's a crude map.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.

Faux stonemasonry and torches. "Regal" purple carpets. Gabriel and his crew escort Rudy into --

Rudy sits up, sees her.

</RUDY>

She approaches instead. Sits beside. Gently:
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --

	Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?

<ASHLEY>

Rudy looks at her with new interest.

Ashley pulls away, walks to the door. Turns back, wanting to say something, but Rudy's not even looking her way.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I'd told you what he wanted, you'd have been gone. You'd have gotten on that bus and stayed on it. And if that's selfish, I am. If that's lying, I'm a liar. But I been dealing with fucked-up brother and his fucked-up friends for a long time, and I was stronger than him then and I'm stronger than him now. 'Cause he showed up for money. I showed up for love.

	And if you're so ready to make me your enemy... then what did you show up for, Nick. What did you really want... with me...

</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
With a fiery look, she strides from the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy stands, can't get far cuffed to the bed. Checks the end table, finds a Bible and a deck of cards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out his second-floor window is a view of the rear parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy watches as a Chevy Blazer parks and two drunk FISHERMEN get out. The truck's bumper sticker reads "Ice Fishermen Do It All Year Long."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy watches the good ol' boys stumble toward the hotel. He turns back, surveys his new prison cell

INT. GAME ROOM - MORNING

Pug empties a shopping bag on a pinball machine. Cowboy boots, spurs, a black cowboy hat, a black rhinestone jacket and a longhaired wig tumbles out.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.

<DIRECTION>
INT. NOVA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy's in "disguise": paste-on goatee, tinted shades and black cowboy gear. Very Nashville Network.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's wedged between Jumpy and Merlin, wearing handcuffs. Gabriel, Ashley and Pug in the back.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --

<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tip.

</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together. I can't walk in there looking like the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You don't want me getting noticed, right? Not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel glares, turns to his crew. Mutters, rubs his fingers together. Merlin, Pug and Jumpy reach for their wallets, grumbling. Gabriel takes a few twenties from each.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy nods thanks as Gabriel hands him the cash --
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>

INT. TOMAHAWK CASINO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cascade of JINGLING and JANGLING COINS fills the brightly lit, horrendously-carpeted space. Wooden-beamed ceilings suggest a rustic theme, but the neon slots, lush green tables and red wheels of fortune are pure Midwest Vegas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Tomahawk is tiny by Nevada standards, about the size of a large bingo hall. This morning, about FIFTY GAMBLERS mill about.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Skimpily-dressed COCKTAIL WAITRESSES, most of them Powahachee Indians, pimp drinks. Bored DEALERS deal.

As the sound of slot machine payoffs suddenly go silent --

<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK BANGS' OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON STEREO SYSTEM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And some scattered cassettes, labeled "Big Winners," "Little Winners," and "Medium Cash." A HAND pops the tape currently in the system -- "Big, BIG Winners" and flips it over. Presses play. The sounds of JINGLING and JANGLING return.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON FULL SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An office overlooking the casino floor through smoked glass. JACK BANGS, late 50's, silver-hair, capped teeth, shark suit and high blood pressure, paces his office. He's got the air of a washed-up gameshow host, Wink Martindale, Peter Tommarkin, one of those hacks. Right now he's all caffeine.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_BANGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's an S-word I'd really like to throw in the discussion here, guys, cause it's a big part of what's going on. Big element, 'kay? S-word.

A BLACKJACK TABLE
</DIRECTION>

where a trio of COLLEGE KIDS are forking over chips. One of them's dark-haired with a goatee, a sweatshirt and jeans. Rudy studies this kid for moment.

<DIRECTION>
Rudy darts among barren oaks and brush pines, crunching deeper into snowdrifts, slowing him down. Stumbling forward, shivering, breath frosting --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug reach the treeline. Gaining but struggling too. With guns held.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy keeps battling through the drifts --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- as GUNSHOTS start to ring out. Rudy glances back to rest; the truckers are a hundred yards distant. But as he turns to struggle on, treebark SPLITS apart beside him.

Rudy keeps running.

Rudy takes a breath, crashes onward --

<DIRECTION>
-- then stops at the sound of a RUMBLING. Getting louder. Closer. It's a car's engine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy spins for the source, focuses, and manages to make out a snow-covered dirt road fifty yards away, down a swale. Another BULLET smashes treebark. Rudy runs for it.

EXT. WOODED ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Rudy leaps out to wave down the car, as around the corner comes a Chevy Nova --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- with Gabriel and Ashley inside. Gabriel's eyes widen, he floors the gas, RACING right for Rudy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy scampers toward the opposite roadside, a steep wooded slope cradling a meadow and frozen river --
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
-- as Ashley grabs Gabriel's steering wheel, swerving the other way. Gabriel fights her for control --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- as the Nova just misses Rudy, who dives off the road, hits the slope and tumbles head-over-heels toward its bottom, a hundred feet down, kicking up geysers of snow!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the road, the Nova skids to a stop. Ashley and Gabriel leap out, as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug reach the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE SLOPE'S BOTTOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy pops to his feet, a dazed snowball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK UP AT THE ROAD

Gabriel grabs a rifle from the Nova, steps to the slope-top edge and takes aim --

<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	RUN!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
-- as Ashley suddenly slams into him from behind --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sending the both of them tumbling down the slope! Sliding and tangled, the rifle flying from Gabriel's grasp --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TO THE BOTTOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- where they come to a tangled, snowy halt. Gabriel struggles to clear the ice from his face --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- as the butt of his rifle cracks him in the jaw.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's for reading her mail.

<DIRECTION>
He extends a hand to Ashley --
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
-- and hauls her to her feet. Ashley beams. As Gabriel howls, the two of them scramble away from the woods, Rudy with the rifle, toward the meadow and its frozen pond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More GUNSHOTS ring as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug slide their way down the ravine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FROZEN RIVER - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy and Ashley race out across the ice. The traction's slippery, but there's no way around. There's a highway bridge two hundred yards away, with sparse truck traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>

	We get to the bridge, we're all right!

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
He grips her hand tighter, as SHOTS crash into the ice at their feet. Suddenly, the ground splinters and gives way --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Ashley goes plummeting through to the river! She vanishes from sight in an instant!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy scrambles back, onto sturdy ice. He stares, stunned, at the ripples in the freezing water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley's not coming up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks to the truckers in pursuit. Coming down the ridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the highway. Safety within sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he can't run. Cursing himself, he grips the rifle tightly and LEAPS into the ice-hole --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVER BENEATH THE ICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- plummeting underwater, the temperature hitting his body like needles. He writhes, spinning around --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and sees Ashley ten yards away, desperately pounding at the ice above her. Strength giving out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy struggles to her, wrapping an arm around her. She fights, panicked, clawing at the ice, both of them pulled further away from the opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With Ashley safely in hand, Rudy raises his rifle-arm, pressing the barrel against the ice above them --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and FIRES. A HOLE blasts a shaft of light into the gray- blue. Rudy FIRES again. Another HOLE caves in. Ashley reaches for a sheath of ice, splashing --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TO THE SURFACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- clutching frozen ground, treading water. Rudy surfaces beside her, the both of them gasping, facing the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instinctively, they spin around --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TO FIND GABRIEL, MERLIN, JUMPY AND PUG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- standing right behind them. Guns trained.

Merlin and Jumpy haul Rudy in. He collapses at Gabriel's feet, unable to stand. Still trembling.

A couple KIDS scamper into the doorway --

<MERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Game room's closed.

	You land closer, you get Ashley. And you guys get to go free. I land closer... and we start getting your help.

He lifts Rudy's shaking hand, puts a dart in it. Rudy's fingers are half-frozen, they don't bend. Gabriel has to wedge it in.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May the best sportsman win.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel turns to the board, ten feet away, and tosses his dart. It thunks in the "13" wedge of the outermost ring.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
He steps aside for Rudy. Rudy struggles to raise his hand, trembling badly. He focuses on the board, teeth chattering, tries to reposition his fingers, rears back and throws --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- except the dart remains in his frozen grip. He brings his icy hand back, tries to move his fingers. And the dart finally tumbles out and hits the floor at his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel smiles, steps close.

Gabriel spins to the dartboard, pulls out a fistful and wheels. He whistles a dart at Rudy's head. it SMACKS the wall beside his ear.

He whistles another. It TRUNKS right above his head. A third HITS the wall by his chin.

Rudy howls in pain, his body too numb to defend itself. Five darts protrude from his chest, colorful plastic feathering and spreading rivulets of blood.

INT. RUDY'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy gets hurled inside by Merlin and Jumpy. He hits the floor beside the bed, where Ashley sits prisoner. Pug sits guard, watching "How The Grinch Stole Christmas" on TV.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick! Jesus, Nick --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
She falls to his side. Merlin cuffs Rudy's ankle again to the bedframe. He and Jumpy head out --
</DIRECTION>
<MERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pug.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Pug's engrossed in the cartoon. They're singing in Whoville.
</DIRECTION>
<MERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PUG!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Pug snaps to. Shuts off the TV, spits some chaw on the floor and gone. Rudy and Ashley are left alone.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick, oh my God, what'd he do to you? What'd he do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
She touches his bloodied chest. Rudy winces badly.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He had some points to make...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley helps pull his shirt off, sees the wounds:
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(near-delirium)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley has leapt to the bathroom. She brings wet washcloths back to clean and dress --
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. You haven't had cranberry buns in two years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him softly. Rudy meets her eyes. Staring to get his bearings back...
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You saved my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You saved me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saved you because I love you, Nick.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why'd you save me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy studies her hopeful face, attending to his wounds. still weak and distant:
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guy I was in with... car thief... I used to read your letters to him. I know they were private... I know, but... you spend twenty-four hours a day with somebody, you gotta talk, y'know? You gotta share. Or the room gets even smaller.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And sometimes, I'd be reading them, and he'd close his eyes, get a smile on his face... and I'd know somewhere inside he was pretending you were writing to him -- He'd see your face, your pictures on the wall...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some nights I think he fell in love with you, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy touches a hand to her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gave a couple guys hope, Ashley. And with hope, there ain't nothing you can't survive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley stares, touched, still kneading the cloth into his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy struggles up, his face level with hers. She kisses him tenderly. Lingering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And this time Rudy responds, mouth seeking, working down her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes flutter closed.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't say my name...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, Nick...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley hesitates. Carefully strokes his chest. He's still kissing her, softly, still somewhat delirious.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(a small frown)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
As he returns to her lips, mouths joining. Ashley's eyes close again, as they fold into each other...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and move slowly, tenderly, back to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KNIGHTS INN HOTEL - DUSK

A bitter cold sunset. Through a room's window, Rudy and Ashley lie tangled in sheets on the carpet.

INT. RUDY'S ROOM

Ashley nestles against him. Rudy stares skyward. Hard.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>

	They'll have guns.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.

<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley frowns. There's a new look in Rudy's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick, what are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need to find a way to make me part of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Part of... with them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy meets her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we're helping them with their robbery, we're gonna be doing more than just walking away. Like that's some Christmas bonus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
He nods, scheming the way he's always known.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want him outta your life? You want a real New Year to look forward to?
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. KNIGHTS INN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A medieval-themed biergarten. A happy FAMILY of five sits at a booth, singing along to "Good King Wencelas."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the booth beside, Merlin and Pug are holding court. Merlin's puffing smoke rings. Pug watches dully, chewing:
</DIRECTION>
<PUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUG>
<MERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
The Happy Family stops singing. Pug considers, spits a wad.
</DIRECTION>
<PUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell. The guy from Joliet, those black-ass lungs were the least of his problems. Got so much smoke in him his lungs couldn't even hold it. Got into his system, man. Into his blood. Coming out his ears, man, coming out his eyes. Guy'd be walking the row, smoke'd be puffing out his skin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUG>
<DIRECTION>
The Happy Family trade discomfited looks. Merlin shrugs, takes another drag.
</DIRECTION>
<MERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERLIN>
<PUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUG>
<MERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
The Happy Family flees their booth. Pug and Merlin glance over. And grab their leftovers. Rifling the grub:
</DIRECTION>
<MERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(with disgust)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vegetarians...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them, Gabriel and Jumpy file into the biergarten, leading Rudy and Ashley to the booth. Meeting commenced.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy, battered and freezer-burnt, gets shoved in first. Gabriel throws down the casino map:
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Start singing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sing it in pictures, Nick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy takes the map, glances at Ashley, and then takes charge. For the first time, he's giving the orders:
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<MERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do we take them out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERLIN>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta get someone upstairs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<MERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do we do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy takes the map, points to the gaming tables area:
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the code?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<PUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Without having them hit the alarms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUG>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<MERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERLIN>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<JUMPY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the Powwow Safe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUMPY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<JUMPY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUMPY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
His confident manner wavers. Gabriel notices, narrows his eyes. Rudy quickly grabs the map again:
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need six.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need six.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>

Gabriel eyes him darkly.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Six is me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. What're you gonna do about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
She puts an arm around Rudy, smiles. That's her man.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Six men means six guns.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm no threat without a gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you're not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter, Gabriel? This is what you wanted him for, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel's eyes don't leave Rudy's.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?

INT. RUDY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

CLOSE ON SKETCH

<DIRECTION>
WIDEN TO REVEAL RUDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
still cuffed to the bedframe, pulled close to a desk. He's sitting, working on the security level map.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens; Ashley enters, looking worried:
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants to see your map.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm almost done.

	If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
	</DIALOGUE>

Ashley walks over, puts her arms around his neck. Whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are we gonna do this, Nick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.

</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>

Rudy studies his map, then quickly pencils in the "Security Video Room," in a totally different place than he drew it before. Hands the paper to her.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
	</DIALOGUE>

(nods, thinks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep 'em there for a little while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley takes the map, frowns. Rudy kisses her gently.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're gonna get you out of Detroit, Ash. Get you out of beauty and fragrances.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember that. After all this is over, when you know me, when you really know me... remember it was me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
She searches his eyes, not quite understanding. But smiles. Rudy smiles back, nods toward the door. Ashley slips out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she's gone, Rudy stands and turns to the window. Outside, the Blazer with the "Ice Fishermen Do It All Year Long" bumper sticker still sits parked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy reaches for his jeans pocket, and pulls out-one of the game room darts, flecked with blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE GIVES IT A SOLEMN STARE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUDYS ROOM - MOMENTS L&TER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy lies on his back, under the bed frame, dart in hand. He tears off the plastic feathering, to get at the cross-shaped end, furthest-from the tip. Four protruding metal edges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finds the Phillips screws on the bedframe, and tries to work the dart-end into the grooves. It scrapes and jags, but with pressure he's able to do a quarter-turn at a time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screw starts spiraling out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON BEDFRAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As two metal pieces split apart, and Rudy wriggles his ankle handcuff off the frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON CLOSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Rudy's hand grabs a paper-covered wire hanger and rips the paper off, untwisting the wire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON ROOM'S WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Rudy slides it open, and climbs outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KNIGHTS INN PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Light snow falling. Rudy drops from the second floor window into some snowy shrubs and an empty parking space. He stealthily darts ahead to the ice fishermen's Blazer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE FISHERMEN'S BLAZER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy peers in the windows, spotting fishing rods, tackle and gear boxes in the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes his wire coat hanger, now stretched straight, and slips it between the driver's window and moulding, jamming it around until it trips the door lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lock pops up; Rudy pops in --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BLAZER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and raids the gear box. Bait, reels, fishing wire. Boning knives. A compass. A first aid kit. A switchblade.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gun, gun, c'mon, boys like you gotta be keeping a gun...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
He rustles around in the backseat. Ice cooler, open bag of pork rinds, another gear box. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some HEADLIGHTS sweep past the Blazer. Rudy ducks down, pockets the switchblade. Munches some pork rinds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy scrambles out, heads to try another car, a pickup truck. And then suddenly drops to the ground, seeing
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERLIN AND JUMPY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stride outside, talking casually, kicking snow on their way toward the Nova. Voices too low to hear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy crouches behind the pickup, slips around the other side. Merlin and Jumpy walk right by him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy criss-crosses through the parking lot, hidden by cars, heading away from his room's window. His window. Rudy glances back to see if the truckers notice that, but they don't seem to. They stand at the Nova, talking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy shivers, waiting. They're not leaving. When their backs turn, Rudy dashes twenty feet to the cover of the building. He slips around the corner, out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AROUND THE SIDE OF THE HOTEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy hops through snowdrifts, pressed to the wall, moving toward a side entry --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- when he stops, hearing a woman's LAUGHTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above his head are a row of windows. Reflections of rippling water on the ceiling inside. It's the hotel pool behind this wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sounds of SPLASHES. Murmured VOICES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy stands absolutely still. His breaths stop frosting. Because his breathing has stopped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLLWAY TO INDOOR POOL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy creeps down the darkened hall, past a sign that reads "Pool CLOSED. Open 9 am to 9 pm, No Lifeguard on Duty."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy steps closer, back to a wall, standing in shadow. The small pool becomes visible, flickering blue water. From an unseen end, a figure splashes backwards into view --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Ashley. Hair wet, naked beneath the surface. Smiling and splashing someone offscreen --
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and he's saying "We're not gonna help him just to walk away. If we're gonna help him... we're gonna get it all...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
She splashes again. Taunting --
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...he wants to help now, he wants to rob it now we could probably stay right here, he'd go on and rob it by himself --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
As Gabriel steps into view, also undressed, moving toward her in the pool.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants the money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, baby. He wants me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel reaches her, puts his arms around her. She smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants... your "sister"...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...whoever she is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
And they kiss, entwining together, reflections and ripples. A steamy embrace.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick Mason's gonna help us more than we ever dreamed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON RUDY
</DIRECTION>

in the shadows, hearing them. Staring into darkness.

Gabriel turns with Ashley, wrapped together. Moving slow.

	Searching for a money man...

</GABRIEL>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --

</ASHLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- till he fucked his parole --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?

</ASHLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a book, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(presses closer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a book of love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss again. Gabriel strokes her wet hair:
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been doing good, though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.

</GABRIEL>
<ASHLEY>

	What, he should see me help you catch him?

</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
ON RUDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
still in the shadows, welling with betrayal.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll be dead when he does.

</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
BACK IN THE POOL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel and Ashley rock slowly, coupled, in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
And as their words turn to moans and murmurs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE SHADOWS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy strides a corridor, eyes dead ahead, passing a stairwell on his way toward the "Exit" sign posted above a door. He's almost there, marching fast --
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's my present to you, truck drivers --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
AS THE EXIT DOOR OPENS
</DIRECTION>
<MERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where the hell's Gabriel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Rudy dives to the stairwell, out of sight just as Merlin and Jumpy stride back inside.
</DIRECTION>
<JUMPY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With his girlfriend. Making up for "Nick" time. I'm going down to the bar, you want something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUMPY>
<MERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get me a brew. I'm gonna check on our convict.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
They separate, Jumpy down the hall, Merlin to the stairs --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merlin trudges upward, while Rudy steps from hiding one flight down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Checks the hall for Jumpy, then races out --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy slams out the side door, scrambling straight for the same Blazer. He jimmies the lock again, leaps in, tears free the engine panel and searches for ignition wires like a pro. Stripping the plastic, trying to spark contact --
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Catch, dammit, catch! Like riding a bike, it's like riding a bike!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
But there's nothing. The engine won't start.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merlin reaches the second floor, steps into the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy jumps from the Blazer, looks at the lot, the highway, the woods. His own footprints in the dusting snow.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How far you gonna get, Rudy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Realizing the answer, Rudy looks to his room's window. Forced to race back. He tries clambering the wall, standing an shrubbery, but he can't reach. He whirls, desperate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And his eyes find the Blazer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merlin ambles the corridor. Approaching Rudy's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy flings open the Blazer door, slams the emergency brake down. Forces the gearshift into "Reverse."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merlin reaches Rudy's door. Searches his pockets for the key.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy darts to the front of the Blazer, slipping and sliding on asphalt ice. He drops to his knees, pushing on the front bumper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wheels start to move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merlin finds a room key. Puts it in the lock. Turns the handle but the door won't open. Merlin checks the key.
</DIRECTION>
<MERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Blazer starts to roll backwards, toward the snowy shrubs ringing the building. Headed for the empty parking space below Rudy's window. Rudy keeps pushing. The Blazer picks up speed, rolling on its own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merlin searches his pockets again, finds the right key.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Blazer rolls toward the building. Rudy scrambles to his feet, runs after it, leaps his left foot onto the bumper, the right foot onto the hood, then onto the roof --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- getting two roof-steps worth of running start --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- as the Blazer slows to a rest against the snowy shrubs --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Rudy dives into the air, torpedoing himself right through the window to his room --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUDY'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- where he crashes headlong to the floor, turning a somersault and landing sprawled across the carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The key in the lock, Merlin hears the crash --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUDY'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and as Merlin opens the door, he finds Rudy sitting calmly on the floor, ankle-cuff locked once again to the bedframe. Spreading a deck of cards out before him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Starting a game of solitaire. He looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Merlin frowns, takes a suspicious look around the room. The window's open. Rudy continues his card game.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merlin watches him for a long time. Then pulls the door shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once he's gone, Rudy collapses to the floor. Breathing hard, heart pounding. The cards go flying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUDY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The LIGHTS go out. Rudy creeps back to the window, checks outside... and stops still. In parking lot...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...a cigarette glow burns inside the Nova. From the driver's seat. It's Merlin. Now watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy steps back into the shadows. Closing window and watches the falling snow. Caged again, after all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUDY'S ROOM - NIGHT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pitch dark. Rudy asleep on the floor, as Ashley creeps back in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing he's asleep, she lies beside him, pulls a blanket over them both, nestles into his body and kisses him.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merry Christmas-Eve, my love. My love, my love. Merry Christmas-Eve...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley closes her eyes. With a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later, Rudy's eyes open. Turning to look at her smiling, sleeping face... with a convict's vengeful stare...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KNIGHTS INN LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON DESK CLERK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a elfin cap, smiling cheerfully:
</DIRECTION>
<SMILING_DESK_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, gentlemen. And how can we help you on this holiday morning?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMILING_DESK_CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON GABRIEL, MERLIN AND PUG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three grim faces.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Checking out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KNIGHTS INN PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three truckers stride to the Nova, where Jumpy guards Rudy and Ashley. In the b.g., the Ice Fishermen are by their car, wondering how the hell it switched parking spaces overnight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel marches straight to Rudy and SLUGS him in the gut. Rudy hits the snow --
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gabriel!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then KICKS him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(chokes, pained)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys were paying for the room, I just figured --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel KICKS him again, then pulls a handgun, points it at Rudy's head. Ashley screams, rushes him --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- as Gabriel's gun SHOOTS a thin stream of water into Rudy's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a forty-five caliber squirt gun.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(cruel smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanted a weapon, convict? You got one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel tosses the water pistol onto Rudy's chest. Jumpy and Pug haul him up. With venom:
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merry Christmas-Eve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Motor City Monster cruises the snowy landscape, with Lake Superior beyond. Pug drives the Nova in convoy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GABRIEL'S RIG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel hands copies of Rudy's sketched map to Merlin and Jumpy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy and Ashley are in the sleeper.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Commit this thing to memory. Every guard, every exit... don't tape it to your fuckin, wrist: remember it. That's the Gospel right there. The Gospel. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy watches them studying his made-up map. Ashley strokes his arm, gives a loving smile. Rudy stares at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles right back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rig and the Nova blow by a roadsign: "Now Entering Powahachee Indian Reservation Lands."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. TRAILER DAY - PREPARATION MONTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The storage locker with the Santa suits SLAMS open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merlin's hands PULL automatics and shotguns from the weapons chest. Pug's hands UNLOAD ammo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A red-and-white Santa coat gets PULLED ON and BUTTONED UP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jumpy's hands apportion GUNS and AMMO on a picnic table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Black Santa boots STAMP TIGHT in the snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shoulder-strap ASSAULT RIFLE gets hidden under a Santa coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AMMO CLIPS are taped inside a fat black buckle-belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HANDGUN gets tucked under a Santa hat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the rig's trailer doors come CRASHING SHUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LAKESIDE REST AREA - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lake Superior shimmers in the dying light. The rig's in the empty rest area lot. On a nearby bank, four men in Santa Claus suits and one woman without sit scattered at picnic tables, guns at their sides. Staring out at the lake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUDY AND ASHLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sit apart from the rest. Rudy in a red suit, black boots, cap in hand. Ashley's head is in his lap, watching the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where should we go, Nick? When we're gone from here... where should we go...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
The Nova drives into the lot. Pug gets out, carrying several fast-food bags. Hurrying to stay warm:
</DIRECTION>
<PUG>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, who had the cheeseburger with bacon; what about a roast beef, I've got two roast beefs here --

	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody better give me something with some goddamn bacon --
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
As they continue chow dispersal, Rudy stares over the lake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Distant. Not even aware Ashley's there.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This time right now... Dad's stacking wood out back, getting ready for tomorrow. Little blaze in the fireplace. Mom's setting out the good silver, hanging her cinammon sticks, up in the doorways. Getting out her scratchy old records... singing along...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy smiles to himself. He's got a faraway look.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>

</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
GABRIEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sits by the water, staring over the lake too. With a white cotton Santa beard resting on his chin. He unwraps his roast beef sandwich, pulls his beard down to his neck, and takes a savage bite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Munches away, stares to Rudy and Ashley. She meets his eyes. Gabriel smiles. And looks again to the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON FULL SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The snowy rest stop, the glistening lake. And the six figures scattered, watching day turn to night...

CUT TO:

EXT. TOMAHAWK CASINO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

The neon axe lit up in full regalia, with Christmas lights now strung along the building's roof. There are fewer than a dozen cars in the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOMAHAWK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Filled with the JINGLING, JANGLING slots, but there's only two FAT WOMEN sitting at them. Three INDIANS at a poker table. An OLD TIMER in his 90's playing blackjack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECURITY LEVEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ragged headquarters, looking down to the casino level through smoked glass. Desks, file cabinets, pin-up centerfolds. A room with video monitors to one side. Stairs to a camera catwalk that rings the casino.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack Bangs is at a table of wassail and cookies. He opens a battle of brandy, pours a bit into the punch, and takes the bottle for himself. Walks over to his HEAD OF SECURITY, watching the lack of activity below:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_BANGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And all through the house... not a creature was stirring...

The boss smiles, heads off. Jack Bangs swigs his brandy, eyes his high-tech security gear glumly:

EXT. TOMAHAWK - NIGHT

The Nova pulls into the lot and parks. Merlin, Pug and Ashley inside. On the road, the Motor City Monster slows to an idling stop. In the cab, Gabriel turns to Rudy and Jumpy:
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go.

Rudy gives Gabriel a withering look. He and Jumpy climb out.

<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Jumpy, I want to ask you something. You have any problem with the fact that we're on our way to take millions of dollars from an Indian casino?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
The Native American considers. As they walk:
</DIRECTION>
<JUMPY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick. It's true that Indian gaming's gone a long way toward restoring wealth and pride to communities who've been economically isolated and enslaved for centuries. Stronger infrastructure, better schools, higher employment... they're all the results of reservation casino success stories. Still, many natives believe that these are temples to a godless materialism and greed that will only infect the souls of indigenous peoples until their love of money has destroyed the spiritual values their ancestors died to protect and their homelands have become no different from any United States suburb, satellite city or industrial park. Destroying the Indian legacy once and for all and leaving behind a nation of selfish, angry natives, of which I, it's true, am one --

INT. TOKAHAWK - NIGHT

</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey-hey, egg nog for everybody!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy spreads his Santa arms wide and whoops. Jumpy laughs with him, steadying his balance. Drunken and slurred:
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's win some MONEY! MONEY-MONEY- MONEY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
The few gamblers inside look up at the commotion. Bear the Bartender. Two CASHIERS and one WAITRESS. Ed the Security Boss strides over, smiling tightly:

Merlin spins from hiding behind the slots. He and Pug both OPEN FIRE, blowing away the two remaining men from both sides.

One of the guards falls in front of Rudy, gun in hand --

The car SLAMS inside, crashing into slot machines. The slots send SPARKS showering into the air. Which set off the casino floor's SPRINKLERS. The room fills with watery spray.

He pulls him off the desk. Jack Bangs wavers, struggling. He looks at Gabriel. Then at Rudy.

Jack Bangs steps to the safe. Spins the lock. Spins back. Spins forward. Click. Jack Bangs looks at Rudy.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pow. Wow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
And Jack Bangs opens it --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- reaching inside in the same swift motion, so that as the safe swings open to reveal it's a rack of WEAPONS that lies inside, Jack Bangs already has an Uzi in hand --
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_BANGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	VEEEEGGGGAAAASSSS!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_BANGS>
<DIRECTION>
BULLETS as he turns back to the room --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- sending Gabriel, Ashley, and Merlin diving for the floor! Jumpy can't get down, as BULLETS riddle him dead --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and BLOW OUT the smoked windows overlooking the casino --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack Bangs keeps turning in a madman's circle --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- BLOWING OUT the windows to the parking lot, shattering the liquor, sending Rudy scrambling under his desk --
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_BANGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_BANGS>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GO!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
He and Ashley both scramble for the windows, jumping out with two of the money sacks --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TO THE CASINO FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and landing on poker tables below, overturning them --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack Bangs keeps FIRING, into the casino, SHREDDING the tables but missing Gabriel and Ashley -- as he JUMPS right after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK IN BANGS' OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merlin scrambles to his feet, whirling with his gun, looking for Rudy --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- just as Rudy slams into him. Merlin's SHOT hits the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two of them CRASH down, wrestling and rolling toward the parking lot window. Two guns spill to the floor. Rudy grabs one, just as Merlin kicks out, leaping up --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and freezes, seeing Rudy's got a pistol on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before Merlin can make a move, Rudy fires --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and a thin stream of water shoots out. Leaving a stain on his shirt. It's the water pistol. Rudy stares blankly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Merlin swiftly snatches the second gun, a real gun, off the floor. Rudy's dead to rights.
</DIRECTION>
<MERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell. I'm gonna take pleasure in this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
With the gun on Rudy, Merlin finds a cigarette in his pockets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pops it between his lips, raises a lighter's flame --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and hesitates. Sniffing the air. Looking down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the stain on his shirt. His lighter still lit --
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Rudy fires the water pistol again, this time catching Merlin's lighter, which turns the stream into a ARC OF FIRE! He's filled alcohol in the gun!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLAMING LIQUOR shoots into Merlin's face and eyes. He drops the handgun. Rudy keeps squeezing the squirt gun, spreading the fire down his neck and chest. Merlin howls wildly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and staggers back, blind and helpless, pinwheeling himself --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUT THE PARKING LOT WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and CRASHING down on the hood of a Pontiac, head through the windshield, boots on the bumper, dead. Flames flickering.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smoke 'em if you got 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CASINO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel and Ashley have scrambled to the Nova, tumbling in with the money sacks. Jack Bangs gets up, stalking toward them, still FIRING and babbling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel FIRES back, hitting Bangs in the chest. He staggers, but stays upright. His bullets RIDDLE the car, shattering the windshield, but Gabriel and Ashley keep their heads down, slamming it into reverse --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and burning rubber backwards out the casino entrance, into the parking lot, and speeding out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack Bangs stops shooting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He staggers back toward the bar, totters there, and turns, gun still raised.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy stands at the base of the stairs to the security level. He puts his hands up, until he sees the dying look in Bangs, face. The uzi drops to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A silence. Even the slots have stopped.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Jack Bangs stares blankly. Surveys the wreckage of his poor man's empire. And gives a small shrug.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_BANGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why they call it gambling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_BANGS>
<DIRECTION>
He slumps against the bar and hits the floor. Dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy ambles out into the snowy night. The lot is quiet. He takes a few wary steps toward the road --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and hears a CLICK. He turns to see Ashley standing behind him, with a gun. Shaking her pretty head.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your turn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy shuts his eyes for the end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RESERVATION ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Nova drives up a ramp into the back of the truck, in reverse. Gabriel gets out, pulls shut the trailer. Ashley collects the hazard triangles. They hurry to the cab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MICHIGAN HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Motor City monster storms through the night, passing a couple POLICE CARS, sirens wailing, speeding the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GABRIEL'S RIG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel and Ashley inside, with the money sacks:
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With the wrong fucking guy! We took the place down with the wrong fucking guy! Is that Christmas?! Huh?! Is that Christmas?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs Ashley, kisses her wildly. Then turns back --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TO THE SLEEPER COMPARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where Rudy lies sideways, hands bound with his Santa belt.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God bless us every one...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIDGESIDE ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A winding two-lane road, overlooking a small ravine at a grassy overlook. The road is dusted with snow; there's been no traffic here for awhile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Motor City Monster steams to a stop beyond the overlook. Then starts backing up, such that the gate of the trailer is fifteen feet from the edge of the ridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hundred-foot drop into the ravine below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel and Ashley pile out of the cab. They lift the trailer gate, extend the tire ramps. The ramps run from the trailer to five feet away from, the ravine drop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel pulls Rudy out of the sleeper. Marches him back --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TO THE RAVINE'S EDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and gives him a look. Forces him to his knees. Ashley is in the truck trailer, splashing the inside of the Nova with a can of gasoline.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You almost got away with it, Santa. Got outta the Tomahawk, got to your car, got halfway to Canada till you caught some ice in the road. By the time you hit bottom down there, whole car was burning like a comet. Musta burned up all that money too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy glances to the trailer. Ashley tosses a couple handfuls of bills into the car.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel smiles at him.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She told me 'bout the convict magazines. Had to figure there'd be some boys in the pen with some useful knowledge. With nobody to talk to. Nobody to listen. So we stocked up on stationery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley hops down. Gabriel puts an arm around her.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hard life being a trucker's girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy eyes Ashley. She stares darkly back.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saved your life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shouldn't have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who wouldn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
So cold. But Rudy doesn't pause.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe this is where you wanted him, Ashley. At the bottom of a ravine, dead as ice with a burnt-up heart. Maybe. But it didn't happen. 'Cause what you did for him was make him the happiest held ever been. You showed him hope and taught him mercy. And he died a peaceful man. You wanted to destroy some convict... and all you did was save his soul. Remember that. Love your money and remember that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley shivers, a touch shaken. But steels herself:
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merry Christmas, Rudy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad it was me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merry Christmas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in the car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel hauls him up. Marches him to the trailer. Rudy stops at the ramp. Gabriel pushes. Rudy doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in the CAR!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you know my name...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back to Ashley.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rudy. How'd you know my name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy looks at Gabriel. He's frowning. To Ashley:
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I never said Rudy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said it a million times!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never told you my name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
He stares her down. Then stares at Gabriel.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ash?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you know my name was Rudy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ash?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you know my name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley stares daggers. Shakes her head ruefully --
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Men.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
-- and pulls a handgun, SHOOTING Gabriel in the heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel falls to his knees in the snow, his mouth a ring of shock. Blood spurts through his red coat. He stares at Ashley, incredulous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steps forward and PUTS another bullet in his neck. Gabriel falls still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley's breath frosts in the cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy watches her. Finally, she meets Rudy's eyes. They stare each other down for a long moment, before:
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is he.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
A silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one moves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And finally, the CRUNCH of footsteps from around the side of the trailer. And WHISTLING. "Silver Bells."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shadow moves across the snow behind the trailer, and soon steps into Rudy and Ashley's view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Nick Mason.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alive and well.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merry Christmas, Rudy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley smiles. Her muscles-and-mustache man pen pal is here.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I missed you, beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I missed you too, Nicky baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
They share a passionate kiss. Ashley malts at the sight of him, embracing happily. Then turns to Rudy:
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For your information. I never fuck the wrong guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy just stands there, his mind playing catch-up.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hey. Have you two been properly introduced? Sweetness, this is Rudy Duncan, I did almost a year with him in the Mountain. Read him all your letters, talked about you all the time, made him feel like he really knew you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns to Rudy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My friend... wantcha to meet Millie Bobek. 'Member Millie Bobek, dontcha? My girlfriend fore I went in? Worked at that bar in Motor City, where I manslaughtered that guy? Hell. Didn't talk about her much once the Ashley letters started coming, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy doesn't notice it's started to snow.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She set them up. All of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you set me up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick shrugs. Prods Rudy up the ramp. Into the trailer:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(notes cash-sacks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you know I'd do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Nick looks back at Ashley.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because every time I read her letters, Rudy... you listened.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ashley)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep your gun on him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick forces Rudy inside, unties the belt from his wrists and lashes them to the bottom of the steering wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five Santas walked into that Tomahawk, Rudy. That's what the witnesses'll say. So we gotta have five Santas not walk out. Gotta have five...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(working)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This'll burn right away... in the fire...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick gets Rudy's wrists locked to the wheel. He laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick slams the car door, locking Rudy in.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gave them me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gave them me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs, smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick reaches across him, releases the brake. Puts the car into "Drive." Turns to Ashley:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweetness! Let's light up the tree!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley steps toward the ramp, taking out a matchbook. Nick steps further into the trailer, to the back of the Nova.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy immediately wriggles his hands, trying to touch his wrists together. Trying to press together the white cuffs of his Santa suit. Trying to get the right pressure point --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- as a BLADE suddenly springs out of the cuff! The switchblade he'd stolen from the Blazer -- it's lashed to his right wrist!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy starts sawing his wrist back and forth, cutting through the Santa belt --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- his hands at the bottom of the wheel, too low for either Ashley or Nick to see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE TRAILER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley is at the hood of the car, LIGHTING her match. Nick is at the back bumper, ready to push it down the ramp --
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Rudy! Nice spending time with you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The belt breaks! Rudy snaps his hands free! But instead of trying to escape, he reaches under the steering column, RIPPING its panel away and pulling wires free!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Ashley tosses her match onto the hood, and FIRE races over the body of the car, TONGUES racing inside, over the dash, over the seats, lapping at Rudy --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- who ducks his head beneath the wheel, frantic to locate the right leads --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE TRAILER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley jumps out of the way, to the snow. Nick pushes the flaming car to the trailer's edge --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- starting on down the ramp, the ravine ahead --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and as gravity starts to take the metal bonfire --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy sparks two wires together, FLAMES eating at him --
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LIKE RIDING A BIKE, LIKE RIDING A BIKE, LIKE RIDING A BIIIIIKE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
-- and the ENGINE IGNITES!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy slams the gearshift into "Reverse", grabs the wheel and looks over his shoulder at shocked Nick behind him --
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	RULE ONE! NEVER PUT A CAR THIEF BEHIND THE WHEEL!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
-- and SLAMS the accelerator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON FULL SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the burning Nova races backwards up the ramp, and back into the trailer --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terrified Nick turns to run but there's nowhere to go --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and the car SLAMS into the trailer's back, CRUSHING Nick's legs between metal and metal!
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NOOOOOOO!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Then Rudy faces front, pounds the shift into "Drive."
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	RULE TWO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley stands at the bottom of the ramp, vengeance and rage. She grabs her handgun, OPENS FIRE --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Rudy SLAMS the gas again, shooting down the ramp --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- as he flings open the car door, dives and rolls --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- while the burning Nova COLLIDES with Ashley, throwing her onto the hood, and sending the tandem inferno speeding off the ridgetop --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- arcing slowly as it PLUMMETS into the ravine, a smoking, blazing shooting star with a woman's figure hanging on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shooting star hits Earth and explodes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO/EXT. SNOWY ROAD - MONTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same four shots that opened the film. The Santa on the floor of the cage (Pug), the Santa on the hood of the car (Merlin), the Santa in the hallway (Jumpy).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the Santa lying face-down on the snowy road. Gabriel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RAVINE'S EDGE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last of the opening images. Rudy's motionless Santa figure, upside-down on the snowy incline, bits of his suit still aflame. He opens his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SNOWY ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy staggers to his feet. Battered and dazed. Looks at Gabriel's body. Then looks to the trailer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, Nick is still alive, bones broken from the waist down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's mumbling madly, staring at the ceiling:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Rudy... help me... Rudy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy climbs the tire ramp. And pulls the trailer gate shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs into the rig's cab. Starts the engine. Puts the truck in reverse, taps the accelerator and hops out.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Rudy! Rudy! HELP ME!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
The truck rolls backwards. And into the ravine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy listens to its TUMBLING SOUNDS all the way to the bottom. He then looks up the road one way. Then the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And notices the two money sacks sitting in the snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUDY'S JOURNEY - MONTAGE - NIGHT/DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In his burnt and battered Santa suit, Rudy's figure trudges the snowy night. Two sacks over his shoulder. walking empty roads and highways. And passing a roadsign that reads "Sidnaw -- 35 Miles."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He passes rural roads and driveways, and every time he comes across a mailbox... he puts a stack of cash inside. On the soundtrack, the STRINGS and RUM-PUM-PUM-PUMS of "The Little Drummer Boy" start to rise --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With snow falling, he passes a new sign: "Sidnaw -- 27 Miles."

With the sun rising, a PAIR OF CHILDREN huddle at a window, seeing the man in the Santa suit at the end of their driveway. Giving them something from his sack and ambling on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and we follow Rudy's march, stuffing presents into mailboxes. At every-stop on the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cul-de-sac of Norman Rockwell Michigan homes. Graced with pines and a pristine snowfall. Christmas trees in windows, lights on inside, figures of FAMILIES in holiday gear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one noticing the man in the Santa suit, his sacks long gone, walking up the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. FIFTIES-ERA HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At cul-de-sac's end. Where a blackened red cuff KNOCKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, the door opens to reveal a smiling MOTHER and FATHER in their sixties. There's a party going on inside; a dining table visible beyond them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mother and Father's smiles disappear. Shock. Concern.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rudy...? Rudy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son? Is... is that you...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
The Santa Claus shuffles inside, right past them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Santa Claus sleepwalks straight for the dining room, finding a dozen RELATIVES, laughing and eating. A table laden with turkey and stuffing, gravy and cranberry, wassail and wine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The relatives stop still. The room goes silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Santa Claus sits down at the head of the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yes, it's Rudy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without a word, he stares at the food before him. And takes a plate. He stacks it with meat and dressing and trimmings, and sets it in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And digs in. Stuffing his face in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His Mother and Father return to the dining room, gaping. The other relatives look likewise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All staring at Rudy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, while he eats, without another sound...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the Mother takes her seat at the table...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and the Father pulls up another chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They touch hands privately, and turn back to their plates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a CLANK of silverware, a SCRAPE of china, a CLINK of glass, and one-by-one, the relatives resume their meals. CONVERSATION picks up where it left off, SMILES return to the table, LAUGHTER slowly rises in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is Mr. Duncan and Mrs. Duncan, Aunt Lisbeth and Uncle Ray, Aunt Mary and Uncle Pete, toddler Sasha and teenage Sam, brother Mike and his girlfriend Jill, sister Stacy and her husband Bill, Grandpa Walter, little Wendy Sue...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and at the head of the table...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy Duncan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Home for Christmas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
