One silent SPECTATOR, in overcoat, slacks and scarf, stands out in the crowd, unmoved by the din. He is:

CONNER MACLEOD

An aura of power and charisma sets him apart. His hypnotic eyes watch Ranger defenders slam Gretsky into the wall, punching and kicking him.

Suddenly, a MAN's silhouette appears in a tunnel, blocking his path, breath steaming in the artic air.

<MAN>

A huge sword appears in the Man's hands. He swings. MacLeod sidesteps, drawing a weapon from inside his coat.

A Samurai sword, carved handguard, razor-sharp, feather-light.

The Man's overhead slams onto concrete, ripping up hunks of stone. MacLeod fans his blade.

His opponent is outmatched. Surging forward:

CONNER MACLEOD

<DIRECTION>
The ice hockey spectator, 466 years earlier. The same age but rough-hewn, not yet possessing the quiet strength of later years. Eyes alight, huge claymore sword strapped to his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carved into the blade, the single word:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACLEOD.

Riding with him, two older clansmen: DUGAL, his cousin, short, arms like trees, and ANGUS, bulky and bearded. Dugal shouts over the din.

A pretty girl, KATE, races down the column holding high a bouquet.

MacLeod sweeps her up. She plants the flowers in his hat. She jumps down excitedly.

MacLeods and Frazers collide in fury. Raging carnage. Fog slowly moving in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod, Dugal and Angus in the thick of it. MacLeod tries to engage the enemy. Each time they avoid him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dugal's helpless beneath three Frazers. Flying from the saddle, Angus kills two of them. The third bolts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gradually, the fog makes it impossible to see more than a few yards. Each man's battle is his own, hopelessly separated from the battling clansmen around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wild-eyed, MacLeod leaps off his horse, hauling Dugal up.

Suddenly, they see:

A HULKING GIANT ON A BLACK STALLION

<MACLEOD>

	Mother of God -- !

</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
He feels dizzy. The Kurgan knocks Dugal senseless, disintegrating MacLeod's shield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snarling, he vaults from his horse, driving his blade deep into MacLeod's stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mortally wounded, MacLeod drops to his knees, vainly swinging at the ghastly specter. The Kurgan swats away his sword as though it were a toothpick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Relishing the moment, he raises his blade high, voice grating in triumph
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There can be only one.

</KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod is helpless. Time hangs suspended. Lost in the blackness of the Kurgan's eyes, he prepares to meet his maker.

At the last second, Dugal, Angus and others appear, pile-driving the Kurgan back over dying clansmen.

Raving singer, pounding drums, shrieking guitars. In the headlights, a sign:

Hungry and tired, Bedsoe trudges past bums, porno-pits and neon signs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod descends stairs to a subway. Picking up speed:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEDSOE
</DIRECTION>

races down after him. Reaching the tracks, he can't believe his eyes.

The platform's deserted.

She turns west, arriving at Madison Square Garden. Parking on the street, she gets out, carrying a bag.

MACLEOD'S FACE IN THE FLARE OF THE LIGHTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the underground garage. Reaching into the roof-duct hidden by tiles, he pulls out his Samurai sword.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Noting the chipped edge and missing pieces, he slides it into a sheath inside his coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOOTSTEPS. He snuffs the lighter
</DIRECTION>

CUT TO:

BRENDA

Guiding a metal-detector across the floor. Chalk out- lines where Fasil's corpse used to be. Near a column, a red light blinks on her detector.

Cradling the flash, she removes SHARDS with a scalpel, dropping them into a plastic bag.

</BRENDA>

Silence. Something's down here. She can feel it.

Trying to control her panic, she heads for the exit. She starts running, faster and faster.

CUT TO:

</PHIL>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vodka. Lots of it.

He leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Removing the plastic bag from her purse, she opens it, tipping a metal shard into her trembling hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACLEOD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
enters and looks around. Spotting her, he sits in a nearby booth. Phil re-appears with a bottle of vodka.

</PHIL>
<BRENDA>

Leaning forward, she sees a dim profile.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank him and tell him no.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Phil delivers the message. Brenda gulps vodka, mind in turmoil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, MacLeod sits by her side. She jumps like a cat.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think you're doing?

<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joining you. I'd like to buy you a drink.

Brenda drains her vodka, setting down the glass.

<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't drink

About to tell him to get lost, she looks into his eyes for the first time. Unexpectedly, she's overcome by feelings of warmth and safety.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
His voice caresses her. She's mesmerized by his gaze. Adrift, she hears herself answer.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brenda.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
The silence between them is electric. Phil RINGS the register. The spell is broken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's got to get away from this guy. Shouldering her bag, she rises, heading for the door. He doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you get over to Madison Square Garden much?

Eyes that were comforting 10 seconds ago are now cold, drilling into her brain.

<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come you're asking me about Madison Square Garden? Did you follow me in here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. He smiles. Her blood turns to ice.

<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the hell are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MACLEOD>

</MACLEOD>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it. I can take care of myself.
	</DIALOGUE>

He shrugs, sitting down. She walks out, pausing to look back at him in the gloom. He raises his glass to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: :SC: OUTSIDE THE BAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brenda waits in shadows, watching MacLeod leave. He stands for a moment, looking up and down 55th Street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulling up his collar, he moves off into the night, turning down a dark alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Making a fateful decision, she follows him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: :SC: MACLEOD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
walking briskly near the East River. Cold wind blowing. 4:00 A.M. Deserted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steam rises from vents. Cars line the curb. Cats YOWL. It's spooky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hearing FOOTSTEPS, he stops every few yards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the corner of 46th, his eyes rake the street. Nothing. Without warning, he sprints off, disappearing into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHADOWY CONSTRUCTION SITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUNNING FOOTSTEPS. He grasps the Samurai hilt inside his coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FIGURE hurtles round the corner. Springing forward, MacLeod
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
grabs handfuls of hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOUTING in panic, Brenda fights to get free.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get your hands off me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
Pumping with adrenalin, MacLeod shakes her, pulling her into the dark, against a brick wall. She SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A light goes on in a nearby apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be quiet. I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
He breaks off, listening to the night, eyes flashing. Instinctively MacLeod ducks, yanking her with him to the dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next second:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GLEAMING SWORD SHATTERS BRICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
inches above their heads. He rolls away from her, struggling to avoid a slashing blade. Dumbstruck, Brenda stares up at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HOWLING GIANT WITH A SCAR ACROSS HIS NECK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
wielding a huge sword. It's the Kurgan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod grabs a steel pipe, blocking the Kurgan's murderous blows. The Kurgan's so fast, MacLeod can't draw his sword.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In desperation, he side-steps and charges, tackling him. Locked together, they topple down an embankment into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHALLOW PIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Untangling himself, sword in hand, the Kurgan attacks. MacLeod defends himself with the pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Good to see you again, MacLeod. 400 years is a long time.

SOUNDS of DISTANT SIRENS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP THE EMBANKMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brenda peers through the murk. Straining to see what's going on, she loses her footing. CRYING OUT, she falls:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTO THE PIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cannoning into MacLeod's back.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ!

<DIRECTION>
(yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the hell out of here!

Bellowing, the giant charges again. MacLeod shoves Brenda out of the path of sudden death.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(rasping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There can only be one, Highlander.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
The 2 men battle through the skeleton of a building. The Kurgan's murderous blade misses MacLeod by inches, slicing through solid iron.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sky ERUPTS. THRASHING ROTORS. ROARING down-blast. Blinding clouds of dirt and debris.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IT'S A POLICE CHOPPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Searchlight beams probe swirling dust. From the sky, an AMPLIFIED VOICE:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_V_O>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You, on the ground! Stay where you are!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_V_O>
<DIRECTION>
Brenda CHOKES, blinded. From nowhere, MacLeod grabs her. His arms are like steel.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN_S_VOICE>

(SHOUTING out of the dark)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some other time, Highlander. There can be only one.

MacLeod hauls Brenda up the embankment, away from the light, melting into the dark. SIRENS CLOSER.

</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
They halt under a street-light. She gasps for breath.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who in the name of God was that? He called you Highlander. What did he mean, "There can be only one?" Only one what?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MACLEOD>

	Shut up!

</MACLEOD>

He pulls her close, eyes like bullet-holes.

	Listen, lady. You almost got yourself killed.

He shakes her, trying to scare her away.

<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you ever follow me again

He strides off. A garbage can CRASHES in an alley. Brenda jumps.

KENNY, a chain-smoking greaser, checks the name the Kurgan's written in the register, handing him a key.

<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Mr. Victor Kruger. Room 315. And I'm gonna hit you for 20 in advance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>

The Kurgan pulls out a thick roll of bills, dropping a 20. Kenny eyes the roll greedily.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>

	Listen, you want anything. Broads, blow. Just dial 0.

Picking up a black, oblong case, the Kurgan heads for the elevator.

CUT TO: :SC: THE KURGAN

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shirtless, heavily-scarred, he munches tacos, watching Yosemite Sam on T.V., digging the violence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens his black case. Laid out in velvet slots:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COMPONENTS OF A LARGE SWORD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meaty fingers caress quillions, pommel, hilt and blade. Getting up, he moves to the window. Below, junkies shiver in Needle Park.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At last... the Gathering.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
He chuckles, an unnerving sound. KNOCK on the door.

A blonde HOOKER in hot-pants and boots, breasts burst- ing from a tight sweater, leans on the jamb, cracking gum.

Dragging her in, he flings her on the bed. Fearfully, she watches him unbuckle his belt. He slams the door.

Angry villagers pack the place, only one thing on their minds -- MacLeod's strange delivery from the jaws of death.

A villager belts MacLeod with a jug. Struggling, he disappears under a shouting heap of clansmen.

Arms bound to it with ropes, face battered, on his knees in the dirt.

Stumbling along the loch, MacLeod heads for the moun- tains.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
MACLEOD'S HOME - 1182 HUDSON STREET, SOHO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Surrounded by Irish bars, art galleries, rubble-filled lots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod heads for a run-down shop next to a dilapidated ten-story glass-and-iron warehouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the shop door:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
R. NASH -- ANTIQUES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rummaging for keys, he unlocks the door and goes in- side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: :SC: MACLEOD IN A RISING FREIGHT ELEVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors open. Before him:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HUGE, OPEN, NEW YORK LOFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The change from drab outside to sumptuous inside is stunning. Exotic fish swim in a huge aquarium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod descends the stairs to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SUNKEN LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
filled with modern art. High veilings, comfortable sofas, Adam fireplace, spectacular views of the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving past speakers and TVs, he drops his keys on a table beside an intercom and answering machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a silver frame on the mantle: a photo of MacLeod with a young girl, 1952. MacLeod moves through:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GEORGIAN DINING AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Queen Anne table, silver candlesticks, tapestries on the wall. He enters:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ULTRA-MODERN KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loosening his tie, he fixes a drink and walks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACLEOD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
entering his silver room. Elegant and oval. Fabric walls. Sofas, tables, displays of ancient artifacts:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On one wall, like spokes of a wheel: 13 broad swords.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beside them, a bronze shield, claymore and cloak -- the black-and-yellow tartan of the Clan MacLeod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sipping his drink, he sinks into a sofa, eyeing a glass case lit by pin-spots. Inside:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ancient sheepskin doll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A 16th century catalan feathered hat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rusty anvil and tongs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod stares at the anvil and tons, remembering:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: :SC: RED-HOT IRON IN TONGS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
crashing onto an anvil in a sweltering blacksmith's forge. It's 1541. Wielding a hammer, streaked with grime and sweat, MacLeod pounds out a horsehoe, plunging it into water. HISSING STEAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the five years since his banishment, he's filled out -- although he's lost none of his wide-eyed, youthful exuberance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: :SC: MACLEOD

shoeing a mare outside. The forge clings to a crag. Miles down a precarious trail, the town of Jedburgh.

Up the hill, a 3-story stone house. From the house:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEATHER MACLEOD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
appears in sheepskins, bonnet and boots, carrying a basket.

<DIRECTION>
Full-breasted, lusty and apple-cheeked, she feeds geese, watching him.

Silence. Gliding past silent offices, he spots:

Swinging, he slices off the figure's head. It rolls into the light. He stares down at it. It's plastic. He has destroyed a mannequin.

Covered in duck-weed and slime, he draws his claymore, creeping silently to within feet of the Spaniard's back.

Slowly he raises his sword in both hands high over Ramirez's head. He's going to cut the bastard in half.
</DIRECTION>

With all his might, he brings the sword down. Something incredible happens.

Like lightning, without looking back, Ramirez grabs his Samurai, parries the blow and is up and facing him in one blind motion.

Wearily, MacLeod rises. The Spaniard advances, pounding MacLeod backwards.

Various locations and times.

Slowly, MacLeod improves, gaining control -- his blows, stronger, his coordination surer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ramirez is pleased.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
bartering for a flapping chicken in Jedburgh Market. In a group of SHOUTING WOMEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bright sunshine. FLAGS and BANNERS CRACK in the wind off the sea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Farmers sell cows and sheep. Crowds mill around. Open fires, Musicians and Hawkers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod and Ramirez watch Heather. Ramirez holds onto his hat. He buys an apple, bitting into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Far up the valley, MacLeod's forge is a dot on the craggy mountainside.
</DIRECTION>
<RAMIREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will have no family. We cannot have children.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAMIREZ>
<DIRECTION>
A BAND PLAYS. Girls dance around a maypole. MacLeod lovingly watches Heather bag a SQUAWKING BIRD.

<MACLEOD>

	That won't please Heather. I'll tell you that for nothing.

They watch a Juggler.

<RAMIREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must leave her, brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAMIREZ>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod scowls. The Juggler drops his balls in the swirling wind. The CROWD WHISTLES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They arrive at a grassy arena. Huge men in kilts toss 40-foot cabers to the CHEERS of the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<RAMIREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was born 2,437 years ago. In that time, I have had three wives.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod tries to figure the man's age.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Whore sashays past, skirts billowing, ogling Ramirez. Graciously, he bows to her.
</DIRECTION>
<RAMIREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The last was Shakiko, a Japanese princess.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating Samurai)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her father, Kamakura, a genius, made this for me in 593 B.C. It is the only one of its kind.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(remembering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like his daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Drawing the Samurai, he tosses it to MacLeod, who catches it, testing its weight.
</DIRECTION>
<RAMIREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When Shakiko died, I was shattered. I would save you that pain. Please -- let Heather go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's my wife, man. I love her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
He sees her, gaily pushing through the crowd, ablaze with colored silks.
</DIRECTION>
<RAMIREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you will cause yourself great anguish. I buried Shakiko with my own hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(emotionally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had to go on, never again to hear the sound of her voice, her laughter. She left behind such a silence.

Heather flies into MacLeod's arms, kissing him, showing him the cloth.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, on the shore:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GIANT STAG WITH SHINING ANTLERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rears up in the gorse. Head high, still, it watches:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAMIREZ AND MACLEOD WALKING ON THE BEACH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod's freezing to death.
</DIRECTION>
<RAMIREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now for the last of our training.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAMIREZ>
<DIRECTION>
The Spaniard points to the stag, shouting above the surf.
</DIRECTION>
<RAMIREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trust me. Let your mind feel the stag. His blood. Coursing. His heart. Beating.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUNDS OF THE TWO HEARTS POUND in his brain.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
(enthralled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<RAMIREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is the Quickening. We are at one with all living things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAMIREZ>
<DIRECTION>
The stag bolts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod's perception is forever changed. The high- lands, the sea, the trees -- they're like old friends he'll never see the same way again.
</DIRECTION>
<RAMIREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When we first met, you felt ill. Remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Shivering, MacLeod nods.
</DIRECTION>
<RAMIREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you ever feel that way before?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. When the MacLeods fought the Frazers, and a black knight ran me through. Only it was different, more painful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
Herons swoop low over the waves.
</DIRECTION>
<RAMIREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That black knight was the Kurgan. It is because of him that I sought you out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(MacLeod blinks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is great power in the Quickening. But Nature has not given us equal shares. Some, like you and the Kurgan, have more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAMIREZ>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod's ears are freezing.
</DIRECTION>
<RAMIREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And when one of us takes another's head, the victor becomes stronger.

They clamber through rocks, away from the angry sea.

</DIRECTION>

silent and old, under a dome of fir trees.

MacLeod and Ramirez sit on the bank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shedding his boots, yanking up his pantaloons, Ramirez steps gingerly into the pool, reacting to the cold.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is the Kurgan? Where does he come from?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<RAMIREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Kurgans were an ancient people from the steppes of Russia. For amusement, they tossed children into pits with hungry dogs to fight for meat.

In the trees above, a blue jay arrives home with food for hungry mouths.

	The last time, I was lucky to get away with my head.

	The Kurgan is the strongest of all immortals. He is the perfect warrior.

MacLeod shudders.
</DIRECTION>
<RAMIREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He cares about nothing or no-one. He is completely evil.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(intensely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If he wins the Prize, mortal men will suffer an eternity of darkness and slavery beneath his boot.

Above them, sunset changes green to gold. Ramirez draws his Samurai.

<RAMIREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now. Let us see what kind of swordsman you have become. On guard, pendejo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAMIREZ>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod's already moving, claymore spinning. He feints. Ramirez ducks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Off-balance, the Spaniard retreats, warding off deadly thrusts.
</DIRECTION>
<RAMIREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the end, there can be only one.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(swinging)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is the Prize for which we all struggle. The Kurgan must never win it. Alone, I cannot stop him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You may have a chance.

<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it came down to just us two, would you take my head?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
Ramirez doesn't answer. MacLeod leaps forward, clay- more a WHISTLING RAZOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ramirez parries, but it's no good. The student has become the master.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Losing his balance, Ramirez topples into a gully. MacLeod's on him in a second, blade against his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Breath rasping, they hold each other's gaze in green twilight. An eternity passes, then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod throws his sword away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaching out.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me your hand, brother.

Ahead in the trees. MacLeod sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUNDA KASTAGIR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An elegant black African in blue-gold robes, head crowned with an ermine-trimmed cap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing on a stone bridge over the lake, he feeds bread to the ducks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod joins him, locking eyes with the African. They're both tense, ready for anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unexpectedly, Kastagir grins wall-to-wall teeth, grabbing MacLeod in a huge bear-hug.
</DIRECTION>
<KASTAGIR>

MacLeod sniffs the open flask. It's a head-winder. The African appraises him critically.
</DIRECTION>
<KASTAGIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've become so strong, MacLeod. Surely, you're not afraid of a little Boom-Boom.

	Do you think I'm trying to poison you?

takes a long swig.

Bedsoe folds his paper, gathering his wits.

	If I'm guilty, they'll give me the death penalty.

Unexpectedly, Ramirez's body jolts violently. His face contorts, voice strangled.
</DIRECTION>
<RAMIREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run, Heather --!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAMIREZ>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the front door EXPLODES, splintering in fragments. Sword in hand, eyes burning, the Kurgan surges in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather races back. Ramirez dives for his sword on the table. The Kurgan swings, barely missing Ramirez, chopping the table in two.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ramirez counters, his Samurai slicing the Kurgan's throat, severing his vocal chords.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GARGLING in fury, the Kurgan clutches his neck. Warding off the Spaniard's attack, he reels backward up the stairs.

<DIRECTION>
Despite his wound, the Kurgan fights like a mad dog. Ramirez loses ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stone house is reduced to rubble. All that remains is one wall and the staircase rising to nowhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outmatched, Ramirez retreats up the stairs. Unstoppable, the Kurgan follows.

HEATHER

RAMIREZ AND THE KURGAN

hanging in space at the top of the stairs. Ramirez can retrea

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gasping, the Spaniard sags to his knees, sword falling 3 stori to the ground. Below, Heather SCREAMS.

Ramirez tries to rise. The Kurgan grabs his hair, pulling him

close.

Ramirez SPITS in his face. The Kurgan goes mad, raising his weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There can be only one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
He cuts off Ramirez's head. A SHIMMERING CLOUD engulfs him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He kicks the corpse off the stairs. Turning, he stares down at Heather shivering by the wall. His pitiless eyes burn into her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The next second, the remaining wall gives way, taking the staircase with it. Surprised, the Kurgan disappears under a mass of timber and stone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deathly stillness. Clouds cast a pall over the ruins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cautiously, Heather inches forward, staring down at the debris, trying to comprehend what's happened. Suddenly:

THE KURGAN'S HEAD ROCKETS OUT OF THE RUBBLE

Balancing a cup of coffee, he tries to work an Alka-Seltzer into a container of water, inadvertently hitting the horn with his elbow. It BLARES.

Adjusting her hair, she adds a lizard belt, clinching it tight around her narrow waist.

Satisfied, she walks out into:

Dinner set for two. Agitated, she opens the table- drawer. Inside: A pistol.

Replacing it, she opens a cabinet. A hidden tape- recorder is set to go.

BUZZER. It's the front door.

Beside the altar. Soaring columns, stained-glass win- dows. People pray. Priests glide about.

	For you, my bonnie Heather. Happy birthday.

</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
Moving to an empty pew, he sits silently, lost in the past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front of him, the candles blur. The ceiling starts to spin. Turning, MacLeod see the Kurgan beside him in the pew.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's become a punk-rocker, straightened his hair, dyed it orange, and put on make-up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A line of safety-pins dangle from the scar across his throat. His mocking eyes roam the church.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kastagir is gone. Only you and I remain. Chatting together here on holy ground.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
He leers.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're revolting. What d'you think this is -- Hallowe'en?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am disguised. This way people will not recognize me.

</KURGAN>
<MACLEOD>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod is a coiled spring. 2 MATRONS cross themselves, heading down the aisle.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the Prize.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(the matrons pass by)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy Hallowe'en ladies!

</KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Scared witless, they leave.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel something coming from you. You're trying to conceal it from me. What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I conceal nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod's glittering eyes fix on the Kurgan's safety- pinned throat-scar.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ramirez's blade did not cut deeply enough. He was right about you. You're slime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(harshly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ramirez was an effete snob. He died on his knees.

</KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Gloating, he remembers:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: :SC: THE KURGAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
clutching Heather's neck, rising up from the ruins of MacLeod's 16th century stone house. SCREAMING, she tries to break free of his grip. It's hopeless.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN_V_O>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I took his head and raped his woman before his body was even cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN_V_O>
<DIRECTION>
Throwing Heather down, he rips off her clothes. She CRIES OUT brokenly. There's no one to hear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: :SC: THE KURGAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
eyeballing MacLeod's stricken face in St. Patrick's. Understanding dawns in his lurid eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see. Ramirez lied. The woman was not his. She was yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(leering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she never told you. I wonder why. Perhaps I gave her something you never could, and secretly she yearned for my return.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
On his feet, MacLeod shakes with fury.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sick bastard -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
He lunges for the sword inside his coat. The Kurgan's hands fly up in mock-horror.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy ground, Highlander. Remember what Ramirez taught you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't stay in here forever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<KURGAN>

(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're weak, Highlander. You will always be weaker than I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be out front. Waiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod leaves by the front doors. Metallic laughter rings through the church. Worshippers are outraged. A bald PRIEST confronts the Kurgan.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the house of God. People are trying to pray. You're dis- turbing them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
The Kurgan kisses the Priest's hand noisily, dropping to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me, father. I am a worm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Patting the Priest's head for luck, the Kurgan boogies down the aisle in hobnail boots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Safety-pins jangling at his throat, he heads for the back exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leaps out into the night. The DOOR BANGS. The Priest crosses himself.

</MACLEOD>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looking for a dead guy named Nash. He died at birth in Syracuse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod looks at Brenda. She's done her homework, and she's not going to leave. He makes a decision.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on.

</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: :SC: MACLEOD AND BRENDA ENTERING HIS PRIVATE APARTMENT

She's dumbfounded staring at the opulent surroundings. He moves to the bar.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's 12 years old. Do you want some or not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
She nods. He pours drinks, handing her one. Taking her arm, he leads her down a hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACLEOD AND BRENDA ENTER HIS SILVER ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her expression changes to awe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is filled with suits of armor, Italian statuettes, Persian fetishes, and a thousand other oddities from a hundred eras.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sight is overwhelming.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
Astonished, she strolls around, touching artifacts. He watches her.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that claymore real?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
He lets go. Years of isolation melt in the sound of her voice.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
Brenda runs her hand along the delicate weaving of a Carolingian tapestry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and faces him.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have been alive for four and a half centuries. And I cannot die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
(nervously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. And I'm an Amazon princess sent by Martians to save the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
He's caressing her with his eyes, confushing her again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crossing to a glass table, he picks up an ornate stiletto.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; alarmed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do with that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
He offers her the hilt.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
Reluctantly, her fingers close over the handle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, MacLeod kneels before her, tearing open his shirt, exposing his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In one blurred move, he grabs her fist. She tries to drop the dagger, but his grip is like steel.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am Conner MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod. I was born in 1518, in the village of Glamis, on the shores of Loch Shiel.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(tightening his grip)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I am immortal.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
In a flash, he pulls her fist forward:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plunging the stiletto into his heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Letting go, she screams. He collapses, moaning. Freaking out, Brenda watches:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod pulls the dagger out of his heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wound heals. He stands up. Brenda is lost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: :SC: BRENDA AND MACLEOD AT THE DINNER TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's flushed, excited in the presence of living history. MacLeod pours brandy, getting comfortable. Brenda watches him draw on his cigar.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got a million questions. I don't know what to ask first.

	What was he like?

</BRENDA>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Short. French. Wore his hat sideways.

</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
She spots the silver-frame photo of MacLeod with a 12-year-old girl.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this your daughter?

</BRENDA>
<MACLEOD>

</BRENDA>
<MACLEOD>

Brenda frowns. Slowly realizing, she points (O.S.)

	You mean that Rachel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. She was an orphan. I can't have children. I adopted her.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Over the years, our relationship has gone through qquite a few changes.

Rising, he takes the Samurai from the sheath in his coat, laying it before her.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was forged in 593 B.C. Metal folded over 200 times.

</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
He enjoys her amazement.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like finding a 747 a thousand years before the Wright Brothers flew. Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
She runs her fingers over the blade.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This belonged to Ramirez?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
Reality hits her like a bolt. She's alone with an immortal, holding a sword forged half-a-century before Christ.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many men have you killed with this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<MACLEOD>

	Too many. They're all gone. Except for one.

Head on his chest, she feels his breathing, stroking his muscular chest.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're like the sun, going on for ever and ever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The sun will burn out in ten billion years.

</MACLEOD>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then what'll you do -- walk around in the dark?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>

He kisses her. She touches his cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me more about Heather.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He frowns, sitting up.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In all these years, she was the only one you really loved, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He bounces out of bed stark naked, deciding to go into the bathroom. She SHOUTS after him.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And losing her was too painful to bear -- was that it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(silence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. In every relationship, somebody has to die first.

<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but the survivor doesn't have to go on forever.

He turns on the SHOWER, FULL-BLAST.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not just your body that's covered in scars. D'you know that?

</BRENDA>

The shower STOPS. Towel around his waist, he marches out of the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to talk about this.

</MACLEOD>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't want you to spend 10,000 years in a hair shirt if I was Heather.

</BRENDA>

Doing his best to ignore her, he stacks magazines.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard Christiaan Barnard on TV one time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<BRENDA>

	Oh, yes, you do.

<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, Barnard's patients always wanted to live longer. That's why they came to him. For new hearts. But he wouldn't give any guarantees. All he could promise them was freedom from pain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is your point?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My point is, Ramirez was wrong. Just one year of love. though it ends in death, is better than an eternity alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you making a proposal?

In his mind, Ramirez's VOICE ECHOES down 400 years:

<RAMIREZ_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had to go on, never again to hear the sound of her voice, her laughter. She left behind such a silence.

Brenda looks back at the Kurgan. Crying in fear, she frantically tries to get her keys into the lock of her apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Kurgan is nearly upon her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brenda throws open the door, runs inside, and locks it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE KURGAN hammers his sword deep into the wood of the door.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
(crying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
He strikes again. And again. Splinters smack everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go away! Oh, God, go away!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hysterical, Brenda sinks to the floor against her desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE KURGAN stands back and gives the door a last two- fisted swing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brenda screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door collapses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hellish figure stands over her in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For God's sake...

<KURGAN>

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: :SC: A SPEEDING CAR RACES THROUGH THE CITY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Kurgan takes a cassette from his pocket, slotting it in. DEAFENING MUSIC fills the car:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the KURGAN'S ANTHEM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brenda is trying to get her bearings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC SHRIEKS, her ears burst. Cars rocket past like bullets. Speedometer 90 and climbing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brenda stares at the Mohawk abortion with his foot to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop. Please, stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
The Kurgan erupts in maniacal laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brenda hangs on for dear life. Everything's a blur. Any second, she's going to die.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Engine WHINING, MUSIC POUNDING, eyeballing his captive:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Kurgan runs chicken down the avenue, not stopping for red lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flat-out, stopping for nothing, getting his rocks off, shrieking like a banshee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In his wake, a maelstrom of wreckage and terror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANTHEM BLARING, he flings the Cutlass into the dark mouth of the Mid-Town Tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brenda screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: :SC: MACLEOD SLUMPED ON A COUCH IN HIS LIVING ROOM

replaying a RECORDED message:

<KURGAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She gave me your number. She didn't want to at first. Listen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Brenda sobs.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's hot, Highlander. I think she wants me. What part of her shall I cut off first?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
More CRYING. MacLeod shuts it off. Rachel at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The endless killing has driven him mad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Rising, he puts on his coat and checks his Samurai, holding her face in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rachel, there are some instructions in the desk drawer. I want you to follow them. There's a power-of- attorney for you. You'll have everything you need.

Silence.

<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even if you kill him, you're not coming back. Are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
He sits her down, holding her hands.

MacLeod gives her a handkerchief.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You still have a lot of life to live.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A beautiful woman like you need never be alone or afraid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>

He stands up, smiling down at her.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>

<MACLEOD>

<MACLEOD>

He leaves. Long silence. Tears roll down her cheeks.

	Goodbye, Russell Nash.

CUT TO: :SC: CONEY ISLAND AMUSEMENT PARK AT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bitter cold. A sign reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSED. NO ADMITTANCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Breakers pound the beach. WIND HOWLS through the park.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The roller-coaster's a prehistoric monster. Light flickers from a merry-go-round pavilion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: :SC: THE KURGAN ASSEMBLING HIS SWORD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the pavilion, slotting the blade into place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sprawled in sawdust, Brenda stares at carved wooden horses. Shivering, she sits up, trying to figure out where she is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Kurgan looms over her, blade gleaming.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A nice sleep, yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to rise. He sets his sword-point at her throat.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One move, whore, and I'll slice you to bits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
He forces her back. She's freezing and terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're an animal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am Kurgan. Warrior eternal. I have carved my name in the flesh of Venetian princes, raped the daughters of Attila the Hun, and set ablaze the seven hills of Rome.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(grating)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are nothing. Born and dead in the blink of my eye.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are my slave, and will give me whatever pleasure I demand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You puffed-up turd. You don't have the equipment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
She spits at him. He glares in fury.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. Kill me. You're going to do it anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter? No balls?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
The Kurgan smiles. She's clever, this bitch.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see. You try to anger me, so I kill you before you lover arrives. Then I have no advantage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
(staggers up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm nothing to him. Just a roll in the hay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
Breath billowing, mohawk trembling, he wonders if that's true. Suddenly he freezes, staring out into the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He cares for you. More than you think. I can feel his approach.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My advantage is real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Grabbing a hammer, she hurls it at him. He bats it away with his sword, slapping her across the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod appears, samurai in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Kurgan drags Brenda up by the hair, hand over her mouth, blade resting across her neck. MacLeon starts forward.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop, or I'll cut her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Tense as a cobra, MacLeod stops.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let her go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
He yanks her head farther back, eyes on the Highlander.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you care what happens to her. put down your sword and walk away.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Brenda fights to break his grip. The Kurgan chokes her. MacLeod puts down his sword.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good. Now move.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod moves.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kneel down, neck exposed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let her go first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think thousands of years have made me an idiot?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(barking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kneel -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Boiling, he obeys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hurling Brenda away from him, the Kurgan swings mur- derously at MacLeod's exposed neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like a panther, MacLeod rolls, grabs his samurai, and meets the ROARING BLADE with a THUNDEROUS CLANG and a shower of sparks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod leaps to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So now it ends. Generation upon generation. Millions of miles.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Wielding his sword like a scythe, MacLeod attacks, driving the kurgan back in showers of sparks. BLADES CLANG in the gloom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Kurgan blocks his parries brilliantly. They lock sword-hilts, face to face.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill him! Kill him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
The Kurgan hurls him across the pavilion. He lands on his back, winded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yelling, the Kurgan charges, driving MacLeod out into the night. Brenda follows fearfully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: :SC: A SAVAGE BATTLE RAGING THROUGH THE PARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Between the reptilian day-glo nightmare and the 466- year-old Highlander.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roller-coaster pilings are severed and collapse. Arcades demolished, ferris-wheel chairs hacked to bits. Energy crackles all around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They battle beneath a huge red wooden fruit. Painted on it in lurid colors:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FUN IN THE BIG APPLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Circling, MacLeod's eyes burn into his ancient enemy.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can sense it again. What I felt in the church. What are you hiding?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<KURGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
They grapple like primordial beasts, sweat pouring off their bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's fear. That's what I feel. You're afraid of me. Kurgan, you're afraid of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hurling him back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why you needed the woman. You didn't think you could take me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(hoarsely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lies -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURGAN>
<DIRECTION>
His rabid eyes can't hide the truth. MacLeod charges again, wielding Ramirez's sword full-strength.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Kurgan's arms feel like lead. Gasping, he re- treats to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The icy beach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod beating him back.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All these years, I thought I was running from you. But it was myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(contempuously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not the perfect warrior. You're a coward.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod batters him relentlessly. Each blocked blow saps Kurgan further.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beaten, he stands, gulping for air. MacLeod faces him, samurai poised for another blow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Kurgan can't get it up. Brenda's rooted to the spot.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing, to the Kurgan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For Heather, Ramirez, Kastagir and all the others I never knew. And last, for the Highlander MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his Samurai.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There can be only one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
Blade a WHISTLING blur:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He cuts off the Kurgan's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Transfixed, Brenda watches a sparkling energy leave the corpse and engulf MacLeod. Standing up:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod glows all hues of the rainbow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His hair stands on end. Color erupts from his eyes. He's like a roman candle against the waves. The WIND HOWLS.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; screaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother of God -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
Terrified, she tries to touch him. It's like his skin's on fire.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
Glowing, he falls to his knees in the sand.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Prize. It is the Prize.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, everything's still. His eyes probe the darkness. There's a TERRIFYING EXPLOSION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brenda watches MacLeod's body transform into many different people. His voice ECHOES over the surf.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything's alive. The Quickening overpowers me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(becoming Ramirez)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All resistance is gone. I am generations being born and dying.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(becoming Fasil)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am night air, breathing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(becoming unknown people)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The life-force smothers me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(becoming the Kurgan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am all of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(becoming himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can feel everything
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
She's terrified. His form shifts and changes before her. Waves CRASH on the beach.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can feel your love. The blood in your veins.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches out to her.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your fear of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: :SC: FIRE TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
converging on MacLeod's antique shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIRENS SCREAMING. It's a blazing inferno. Cops hold back crowds. Firemen direct hoses. Tears in her eyes:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel moves through the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's carrying the silver-framed 1952 photo of herself with Nash. Beams split in cascades of sparks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: :SC: MORAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<MORAN>

	I'm sorry. We couldn't get him out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORAN>

	What was his name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<MORAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some guy named Kruger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORAN>
<DIRECTION>
Relieved, she closes her eyes for a moment. MacLeod has won.
</DIRECTION>
<MORAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why d'you ask, Miss Ellenstein?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORAN>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can call me Rachel if you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<MORAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rachel's a nice name
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(seeing photo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORAN>
<DIRECTION>
She shows it him.

<MORAN>

	Nash.

	Who's the pretty young girl?

<RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like to get some coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Puzzled, he looks at the photo, then at her. Taking his arm, she walks him off down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them, the inferno RAGES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: :SC: THREE U.P.S. GUYS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
unloading MacLeod's aquarium off a truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reeling under its weight, they stagger up the steps of a brownstone, ringing the bell repeatedly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After an eternity, Bedsoe appears in striped pajamas, rubbing his eyes.

Pushing past him with the tank, they disappear inside.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BEDSOE>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: :SC: MACLEOD ON THE FAN-TAIL OF A LINER, ALONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bright sun, gulls astern. Passengers bask by a pool. Waiters serve drinks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at the rolling ocean. Everything is different. There's a power and growing confidence in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brenda appears in a summer dress, carrying glasses and an open bottle. She joins him, setting them on the rail, watching him in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A man named Armando Rafael Garcia, right now, is planning a military coup in Honduras. Many people may die.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't explain it. I just do.

<BRENDA>

	You mean like when the phone rings sometimes, and before you answer, you know who's calling?

	Something like that. I'm just learning about it --

	<DIALOGUE>
	In Paris, Jean-Robert Tousche and Sylvie Arnaud live in adjoining houses.

<DIRECTION>
(turning to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're deeply in love, but they never speak to each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
The breeze stirs her hair. The implications of what he's saying astound her.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do with all this power?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I think I can help the people in Honduras, the lovers in paris.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure how yet. I don't fully grasp it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
Gulls hang on the wind. Changing mood, Brenda grins, digging him in the ribs.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before you start saving lives in Honduras and lovers in Paris, will you do something for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
He blinks, focusing on her. His eyes are still magic. She loves him to death.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. What would you like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACLEOD>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you take me to Scotland? I want to see where you were born.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
MacLeod is pleased. After all the years he's lived, the miles he's travelled, the thought of returning to the place where it all started moves him.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
(embracing her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Will you call me Conner MacLeod? It's my real name. I long to hear it again.

<DIRECTION>
She tries not to cry. He holds her tight, looking into her eyes. He knows what she's thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<MACLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ramirez was wrong. Just one year of love is better than an eternity alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Composure regained, she grins.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Now it's time for the ceremony.
