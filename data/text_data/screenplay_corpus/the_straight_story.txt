EXT.--DAY LAURENS, IOWA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a hot day in early September in Laurens, a small rural community in north central Iowa. The main drag, all of four blocks, is bookended by a giant grain elevator and a John Deere dealership. No cars on the road.

EXT.--DAY SMALL HOUSE & NEIGHBORING HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the neighboring house, DOROTHY, a rather large woman, 50ish, with bleached blond, cropped hair is sunbathing in a chaise lounge. She is wearing bermuda shorts, a tank top and eye protectors over her eyes. Next to her is a small table with a plate on it. Out of the other house, which has chipped siding and faded, peeling window frames, comes ROSE (late 30s, brown hair in a pixie cut, stocky, in jeans and a cotton shirt). The door slams and Rose heads down the walk. Dorothy doesn't move a muscle or remove her eye protectors.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Rose.

<DIRECTION>
Rose doesn't break stride but yells over...
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Dorothy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Rose exits and we remain on the two houses and Dorothy sunbathing. After a moment, Dorothy reaches over and feels the plate next to her. She lifts the protectors and checks out the table...sees she's out of treats, gets up, grabs the plate and heads into her house. As the screen door slams shut behind her we slowly move in on the house Rose came from. We might be hearing footsteps as we move closer. The sound leads us slowly toward the rear of the house. As we continue moving closer we hear a short peel of rubber followed by a thudding sound and a sound like a stick dropping. We hold on the house in silence.

A small brick storefront bar. Two windows with neon beer signs are on either side of a red door with a window in the shape of a tilted martini glass. The door opens and BUD, a stocky 70ish man in jeans, a cotton shirt and construction boots emerges. He looks down the street. Not seeing anyone he turns and sticks his head back in the door of the bar and yells in...

Bud, startled, reaches down, opens the door and enters. He stands blinking and flustered, letting his eyes adjust to the darkened room.

Bud's eyes adjust and he follows the sound of Alvin's voice to the kitchen floor right at his feet. ALVIN STRAIGHT is stretched out on the floor. He is in his 70s, a lean man, weathered face, bald with a full, scruffy white beard. He is wearing a plaid cotton shirt, worn jeans and black cowboy boots. There is a wooden cane lying on the floor next to him.

Alvin leans against the examining table as he pulls his pants to a close and fastens his belt. He is shirt- less. His skin hangs loosely off his rib cage. He has a serious farmer's tan: lily white chest and shoulders and arms with nut brown face, neck and hands. A middle-aged DOCTOR GIBBONS is standing looking over some notes.

The doctor nods at this account and writes something in his notes. Alvin sits on the examining table and looks around.

Alvin is approaching the outskirts of the town of West Bend. His reverie is interrupted by a distant, building sound. A huge truck approaches and flies by Alvin with a deafening roar. It completely rattles lawn mower, trailer, and Alvin. Alvin's hat is blown off. He has to stop the mower, get out his canes, do the slow dismount. He struggles down through a ditch into a field. He retrieves the hat, goes back down through the ditch. He climbs back up out of the ditch onto the road and mounts the mower. Real time. Just as he sits down, the tractor dies. Alvin hauls himself off the mower again and pops the hood. Shaking his head he gets back on the mower.

Alvin is moving down the shoulder and slows to a stop. He pulls out his box of Swisher Sweets and lights up.

Alvin slows down as he is passing a small woods on the side of the road. He comes to a stop and considers the woods. He makes his laborious dismount and stretches. He goes around back of the trailer, reaches in and gets his grabber and a tarp. He heads into the woods and begins grabbing some wood. This is no simple task since he's walking with the two canes. After grabbing a large piece of wood while placing it on the tarp, his hand slips off one of his canes. He tries to catch himself but falls face down on the ground. He doesn't move.

He climbs aboard and pulls back onto the shoulder and heads off down the highway.

<DIRECTION>
Alvin pulls off the road onto a dirt track leading into a field. He is in the wide open, no trees, no farm buildings. He takes a look at the surroundings and pulls off the track where the ground is slightly higher. He does the slow dismount off the Deere and stretches, rubbing his lower back. He goes about setting up for the night. He opens the trailer and pulls out an aluminum frame chaise lounge and some of the firewood he had gathered. He slowly gathers twigs & leaves for kindling for the fire. He opens up the food locker at the front of the trailer and pulls out a few items. He puts a few hot dogs and some bread and cheese on a plate. He sits down on the camping chair and proceeds to eat with little ceremony. It is not quite magic hour.

Alvin approaches the figure, sees it's a young, tough- looking girl CRYSTAL. She has dark hair under a baseball cap. Somewhere between 13 and 17 years old. Heavy eye makeup, bad tattoo on her shoulder. She is wearing a tank top, cut-offs, high-top sneakers with tiger-striped laces, and a backpack. Alvin nods in acknowledgment as he passes her.

He points to the fire. She hesitates...looks at Alvin for a bit longer. Alvin just keeps looking at the fire. Finally she looks around, finds a stick and leans toward Alvin to take a hot dog.

The Iowa horizon is a large dark mass. An occasional burst of light races through the black clouds. A breeze blows dirt along the field. Alvin's gaze searches for shelter. There are no farms near. He cannot outrace the storm. He spots a small outbuilding alone in the field. It is an old granary, used by farmers to store corn.

Alvin turns off the highway onto a narrow rutted field road used only by the farmer to get to his crops. It is pot-holed and uneven. Alvin stops at the entry to the road. Moving as quickly as he can, Alvin secures everything that could blow away on the mower and the trailer. Then he mounts the mower and races for shelter. As he's heading to the granary the sky darkens dramatically and the winds hit. He puts his head down into the gust, holds onto his hat and lets out a holler, carrying all the speed a riding mower can. He bounces across the field and closes on the granary. Just as a large crack of lightning, rain and the full gust of wind sweep in, Alvin makes it into the sanctuary of the granary. A smile crosses his face as he revels in the race before the storm and the pleasure of watching the thunderstorm from beneath a strong roof. He shares the granary with a flock of pigeons who have taken shelter as well. Alvin sits looking out on the storm, relaxed and content on his perch aboard the mower.

	Even if you fix your mower there are hills bigger than Clermont's between here and Zion. There's no guarantee that your machine won't break down again. In fact I'll guarantee it will. Alvin, this machine was meant to go across a lawn, not the state of Iowa.

</DANNY_RIORDAN>
<ALVIN>

Danny knows better than to argue with the proud man about money.

The ladies disappear from view. Alvin moves out of the trailer and perches in the open door. Just then a pickup truck pulls into the yard and Verlyn emerges from the cab. As he approaches Alvin, both men watch the women walk into the rear of the Riordan house. Verlyn reaches the trailer with a smile on his face.

Alvin and Verlyn at the bar. The Weather Channel is on the television over the bar. There are some local farmers in the place. There is a cribbage board at a table. Old timers are slapping cards on the table. Verlyn is drinking beer. Alvin is having a glass of milk.
</DIRECTION>
<VERLYN>

	I picked up a mournful taste for liquor in France.

<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I came back I couldn't drink enough of it. I wasn't worth a stick of stove wood. Mean. A preacher helped put some distance between me and the bottle. He helped me see that I was drinkin' because some of the sights I was still seein' from over there.

</ALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Verlyn nods. Takes a sip of beer. Looks straight ahead at the back bar.

<ALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm good thanks.

	There was this one time...We were just ...waiting on our first warm meal in ten days.

Everyone in the unit thought he was taken by a German sniper...everyone all these years. Everyone but me.
