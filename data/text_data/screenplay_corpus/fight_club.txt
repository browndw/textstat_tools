TYLER has the barrel of a HANDGUN lodged in JACK'S MOUTH. They struggle intensely.

They are both around 30; Tyler is blond, handsome, eyes burning with frightening intensity; and JACK, brunette, is appealing in a dry sort of way. They are both sweating and disheveled; Jack seems to be losing his will to fight.

	<DIALOGUE>
	With my tongue, I can feel the silencer holes drilled into the barrel of the gun. Most of the noise a gunshot makes is expanding gases. I totally forgot about Tyler's whole murder-suicide thing for a second and I wondered how clean the gun barrel was.

Jack manages to SHOVE Tyler away. Then, he leaps onto him and they fall onto a table, then roll off onto the floor. The gun falls and slides. They wrestle with each other, then dash for the gun. Tyler gets there first and grabs the gun. DURING THE ABOVE:

SLOWLY PULL BACK from Jack's face. It's pressed against TWO LARGE BREASTS that belong to ... BOB, a big moose of a man, around 35 years old. Jack is engulfed by Bob's arms in an embrace. Bob weeps openly. His shoulders inhale themselves up in a long draw, then drop, drop, drop in jerking sobs. Jack gives Bob some squeezes in return, but his face is stone.

EXT. ENTRANCE OF CAVE (JACK'S IMAGINATION)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack walks up to the entrance and finds MARLA -- smoking a cigarette blowing smoke into his face, rolling her eyes in condescension.

<MARLA>

	Slide.

INT. CHRUCH - RESUMING

Jack's eyes snap open and turn to Marla. He glowers, watching her smoke with her eyes closed.

INT. CHURCH - LATER

<DIRECTION>
The Leader, smiling opens his eyes and looks around the group.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Now. Pair off for the one-on-one. Pick someone special to you tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone stands and mills about, slowly pairing-off. Jack sees the ghastly spectre of Chloe coming towards him. He smiles at her. She smiles back; it takes her some time to amble to him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Cornelius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHLOE>
<DIRECTION>
JACK (V.O.) I never gave my real name at support groups.

	I'm showing signs of improvement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHLOE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone was always getting better. They never said "parasite"; they said "agent".
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles at him with a twisted, dying mouth. Her eyes eerily bright with desperation. Jack's lip trembles as he, in a sincere attempt at levity, chokes out:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ... look ... like a pirate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Chloe laughs, a little too much. Jack squeezes out a laugh. Then, he sees Marla, off by herself. Someone is heading for her. Most people have paired-off. Jack gives a quick nod to Chloe and darts for Marla, grabbing her. Chloe watches in sad surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STAY ON JACK AND MARLA as he drags her off to the periphery. He whispers into her ear.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need to talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
MARLA O - *kay*. Sure.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a faker. You aren't dying. Okay, in the brainy brain-food philosophy way, we're all dying. But you're not dying the way Chloe is dying.

</JACK>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell the other person how you feel.

MARLA I saw you practicing this.

MARLA -- Telling me off. Is it going as well as you thought it would?

Marla puts her head down on Jack's shoulder as if she were crying. Jack pulls her head back up. She deadpans at him.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've put in some serious time on these groups -- I've been coming for a year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must've been tough to pull off.

</MARLA>
<JACK>

	Anyone who might've noticed me in that time has either died or recovered and never come back.

	Why do you do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARLA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. The Leader passes right by Jack and Marla.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open up. share with each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
JACK ... If people think you're dying, they really listen, instead of just waiting for their turn to speak. Everything else about credit card debts and sad radio songs and thinning hair goes out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<MARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It started with a lump. I went to a breast cancer support group. The lump turned out benign. But I still needed my Monday fix. So, I went to lymphoma, just to check it out. Dying people are so *alive*.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARLA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It becomes an addiction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah ...

Jack almost smiles, then turns sullen. He pulls back from her.

	Now, the closing prayer.

Marla gets to the sidewalk, moving quickly along.

<JACK>

</JACK>
<MARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you take tuberculosis. My smoking doesn't go over well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARLA>
<DIRECTION>
JACK I think testicular cancer should be no contest.

<MARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take the parasites.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARLA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't have *both* parasites. You take blood parasites and --

</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
MARLA I want brain parasites.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens another dryer and does the same thing again.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. I'll take blood parasites and I'll take organic brain dementia and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
MARLA I want that.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't have the whole brain!

	So far, you have four and I have two!

	Well, then, take blood parasites. Now, we each have three.

Jack follows, bewildered.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You left half your clothes.

</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
HONK! Jack starts. Marla's led him into the street with traffic barreling down. She defiantly stomps in front of the cars, which screech to a halt and blare their horns. Jack dashes across. Marla heads into a THRIFT STORE. Jack follows.

<DIRECTION>
INT. THRIFT STORE - CONTINUOUS

Marla drops all the clothes on a back counter. An old CLERK sifts through the clothes, marks on a pad.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing? You're selling those clothes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>

Marla steps down hard on Jack's foot. He jerks, wincing in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARLA (for the Clerk to hear) Yes, I'm selling some clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Clerk starts to ring up the various amounts he's assessed.
</DIRECTION>
<MARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day? I want ascending bowel cancer.

The Clerk gives Marla and Jack a strange look as he hands over money to Marla.

<MARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's your favorite, too? Tried to slip it by me, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARLA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll split it. You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Deal.

They shake hands. Jack starts to withdraw his; Marla holds it.

<DIRECTION>
MARLA I guess this is goodbye.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's not make a big deal out of this.

She walks toward the door. Jack watches her go.

He takes out a business card and a pen. He writes his home number on the back and hands it to her. She takes his pen, grabs his hand and writes her number on his palm. She gives him a quick grin, slaps the pen back into his palm, then saunters out into the middle of the street, causing more screeching of tires and honking. She turns back, holding up the card.

	It doesn't have your name on it. Who are you? Cornelius? Any of the stupid names you give at group?

Jack starts to yell, but the traffic noise is too loud. Marla just shakes her head at him, turns, and keeps moving away. A bus moves into view and stops, obscuring her.

<JACK>

Jack turns his attention to the window as the PLANE ASCENDS. The lady's VOICE FADES. Jack sees a PELICAN get SUCKED into the TURBINE. His face remains bland during the following:

	There are three ways to make napalm. One, mix equal parts of gasoline and frozen orange juice.

Jack's eyes snap open and he turns to see *Tyler*, who is staring out the window. Without turning to Jack, he continues:

Jack's smile fades. Tyler turns to him and grins. He reaches down under the seat in front of him and pulls up a briefcase. Jack looks at it with trepidation.

</TYLER>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Supply oxygen?

</JACK>
<TYLER>

	That's a sharp answer. The oxygen gets you high. You're taking in giant, panicked breaths and, suddenly, you become euphoric and docile, and you accept your fate.

Tyler grabs a safety instruction card from the seat pocket and shows Jack the passive faces on the drawn figures. Tyler imitates the face. Jack laughs; he is completely beguiled.

	We have the same briefcase.

Tyler pops the latches on his briefcase. A beat, while Jack's expression turns nervous again about what's inside. Tyler swings the lid up, revealing a full bounty of quaintly-wrapped bars of soap.

TYLER I make and sell soap.

He gives Jack one. Jack takes it, looks it over.

Jack now looks at the bar of soap nervously. He looks at Tyler, slowly smiles and shakes his head.

Tyler takes out a blank BOARDING PASS. He takes out a small stencil, scrapes a pencil over it, creating a seat number which looks printed. Then, he takes out a stamp and ink pad. He stamps the pass.

Utterly empty of baggage, and, except for Jack and a SECURITY TASK FORCE MAN, utterly empty of people; quiet. The Security TFM, smirking, holds a receiver to his ear from an official phone on the wall.

	Nine times out of ten, it's an electric razor. One out of ten, it's a dildo. Sometimes it's even a *man*. It's airline policy not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo. We gotta use the indefinite article: "*A* dildo". Never "*Your* dildo".

</SECURITY_TFM>
<DIRECTION>
JACK (V.O.) I had everything in that bag. Six white shirts, two black trousers, six pair underwear, alarm clock, contact lens stuff, and ... cordless electric razor.

The taxi approaches the intersection.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
The taxi turns a corner and Jack sees the front of the building. A diffuse CLOUD of SMOKE wafts away from a BLOWN-OUT SECTION on the fifteenth floor. FIRETRUCKS, POLICECARS and a MOB are all crowded around the lobby area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK (V.O.) -- Or when a volcanic blast of burning gas and debris that used to be your furniture and personal effects blows out your floor-to-ceiling window and sails down flaming to leave just your condo -- only yours -- a gutted, charred concrete hole in the cliffside of the building.

Jack heads back for the lobby doors. The Doorman follows.

EXT. CONDO BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Jack walks past SMOKING, CHARRED DEBRIS -- a flash of ORANGE from the Yang table, a CLOCK FACE from the hall clock, part of an arm from the GREEN ARMCHAIR. His feet CRUNCH glass. He gets to a payphone. The Doorman stays right with him, watching him. CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rain DRIPS from the ceiling -- some of it from LIGHT FIXTURES. Tyler and Jack enter with LIT CANDLES. They sit down on the decrepit, buckled wood floor. There's not one item of furniture in the room. There are, however, THOUSANDS of MAGAZINES.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The previous occupant collected magazines.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
They each pick up an opened magazine and resume reading, adjusting close to the candles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler lies down next to him, setting his candle next to Jack's. Tyler picks up a magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are your reading?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
JACK "I Am Joe's Lungs". It's written in first person. "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells".
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds fascinating.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a whole series -- "I Am Joe's Prostate".
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
TYLER "I get cancer, and I kill Joe".
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you reading?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soldier of Fortune, National Geographic. New Republic. Forbes.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In near DARKNESS as a SLIDE SHOW progresses, run by a chipper salesman, WALTER. Jack sits, deadpan, with a PUFFY LIP and a BRUISE on his cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thursday morning, my Boss didn't know what to think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Boss blocks him from the rest of the room, gives him a dubious look, turns back to Walter.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And all I could do was think about next week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Walter advances to the next slide, showing a view of a COMPUTER SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The basic premise of microsofting your office is -- make things more efficient.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
As Walter continues, his sales pitched gets drowned out by Jack's narration:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter, the Microsoft account exec, smiled at me with his steam shovel jaw. Walter, with his smooth, soft hands. Here he was, doing his cute little show. Maybe thinking about a free-range potluck he'd been to last weekend, but probably not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Walter moves to Jack and slaps his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WALTER I showed this already to my man here. You liked it, didn't you?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, Jack smiles. His teeth are RED with BLOOD. They GLOW eerily in the dim light.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeez, I'd hate to see what happened to the other guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Jack keeps the smile frozen on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck Walter. His candy ass wouldn't last a second in fight club.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT Out of silent darkness, HEADLIGHTS appear from all directions. A synchronous WAVE of cars PULLS UP and parks in the already-filled lot. Young men get out of the arriving cars and wander into the tavern. We recognize, among them, the GUYS who watched Tyler and Jack's *first fight*.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men enter; the bartender, IRVINE, calls out:
</DIRECTION>
<IRVINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drink up people. We're closing. Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRVINE>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd consists of men and women YUPPIES: blue collar REGULARS dressed in work clothes or like cowboys; floozy barfly WOMEN. MUSIC plays from the jukebox.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The arriving men simply wait. And wait. Tyler and Jack enter. They, too, stand back against he wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The waiting army begins to share secret looks and grins. A certain level of eagerness can be seen among them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irvine looks at Jack and grins. He flips on LIGHTS. The drunken customers squint and get the message. They gulp down their drinks, plop down money and filter out the door. Irvine hits a button and the jukebox loses power -- the record simply turns slower until it stops revolving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, the last of the irritated customers leaves. One guy locks the door. Two other guys pull down blinds. Someone else moves over to the BASEMENT DOOR and opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT STEPS - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The grinning men march down steps; CHATTER begins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TALL GUY I brought my roommate tonight. Phil.
</DIRECTION>
<FAT_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah? Hi, Phil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAT_GUY>
<TALL_GUY>

	He kept seeing what I looked like. Had to check it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALL_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BOMB-SHELTER -- concrete floor, concrete walls. One BARE LIGHT BULB hangs by a wire from the ceiling. Tyler nods to Jack and Jack turns on the light. The guys mill around, finding partners. The whole mood is very friendly. Everyone brims with eagerness, but tries to act cool about it. CHATTER gets LOUDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FAT GUY A mean uppercut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIRY GUY I gotta work on my left.
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	*He's* got a left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_GUY>
<FAT_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you're wiping the floor with dudes who are way out of your weight class.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAT_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
TALL GUY (slapping Wiry Guy's shoulder) Skinny guys. They fight till they're burger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PEAKING CHATTER, then -- Tyler moves into position directly under the light bulb. His face is partially in shadow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone spreads out, forming a circle, the light bulb for a center. Tyler's will WIPES through the room and the CHATTER DIES. A couple of COUGHS, FEET SHUFFLING. Then, SILENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club. The second rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Jack glances over at a short guy, RICKY, with a BLACK EYE.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This kid, Ricky -- supply clerk -- he can't remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black ink ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The third rule in fight club is -- when someone says "stop" or goes limp, the fight is over. The fourth rule is -- only two guys to a fight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Ricky was a god for ten minutes when he trounced an actuary twice his size.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifth rule -- one fight at a time. Sixth rule -- no shirts or shoes. Seventh rule -- fights go on as long as they have to. And the eighth rule of fight club is -- if this is your first night, you *have* to fight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler steps back, and a FAT MAN and a GOATEED MAN take off their shirts and shoes and step into the center. They circle each other, then begin throwing punches. SWEAT flies into the moist air. SHOUTS become DEAFENING.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes you could hear flat, hard packing sounds over all the yelling as someone caught his breath and sprayed:

INT. OFFICE PARK RESTAURANT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, eating lunch, is served a refill soda by the BROKEN-NOSED WAITER with a GOATEE, the man from the above fight.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even if I could tell someone they had a good fight, I wouldn't be talking to the same man. Who you were in fight club is not who you were in the rest of your world. You weren't alive anywhere like you were alive at fight club. But fight club only exists in the hours between when fight club starts and when fight club ends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boss, passing by the doorway, looks in at Jack with irritated wonder. Jack, playing solitaire on his computer, daubs blood from his mouth with a handkerchief.
</DIRECTION>
<BOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you getting yourself into every week?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOSS>
<DIRECTION>
Jack flashes a smile at Boss. Boss shakes his head, walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After a night in fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down. You can deal with anything. All the people who used to have power over you have less and less.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Reflexively, Jack's tongue plays with his teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By this point, I could wiggle most of the teeth in my jaw.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack stands, holding a hand grip. An arrogant MAN in a three-piece suit brushes past him, knockng his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We all started to size people up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack violently knocks the Man's shoulder in return. The Man turns and he and Jack face each other for a brief moment. Jack's face is stone.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd look at some asshole and *know* I could beat him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
The arrogant Man continues down the aisle. Jack notices a GUY with SMASHED LIP. The Guy grins, giving a slight nod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY (FLASHBACK)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack walks past the parking garage. He sees a VALET who has facial bruises.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were all doing it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
The Valet and Jack share a quick smile. A BMW pulls up and HONKS at the Bruised Valet. The bruised Valet has no reaction as a FAT EXEC gets out of his car and tosses the keys. Jack watches the Bruised Valet size up the Exec, then hop into the car and loudly PEEL OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK (V.O.) I would see them all the time -- fight club members looking at other guys, knowing they could kick their asses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack lands a couple of jabs to HIS OPPONENT'S stomach, then brings up a left uppercut that smashes the Opponent's jaw. Tiny spatters of BLOOD adorn the walls, along with sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fight club was not about winning or losing. It wasn't about words.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
The Opponent recovers, throws a headlock on Jack. Jack snakes his arm into a counter headlock. They, wrestling like wild animals. The crowd CHEERS maniacally.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hysterical shouting was in tongues, like at a Pentecostal church.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
The onlookers kneel to stay with the fight, cheering ever louder. The Opponent smashes Jack's head into the floor, over and over.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone moves in as the Opponent steps away. They lift Jack to his feet. On the floor is a BLOOD MASK of Jack's face -- similar to his TEAR MASK on BOB'S SHIRT, seen earlier. Tyler pushes through the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone files out of the bar, sweating, bleeding, smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Afterwards, we all felt saved.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Tyler walk through the pools of light cast by streetlamps. They both drip blood and sport bruises. They each carry a 4x4 piece of WOOD. As they pass parked cars, they SLAM the sticks against the front bumpers, setting off the ALARMS and causing the AIR BAGS to INFLATE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They come to a bus stop that has a large display ad for jeans. It has a photo of a shirtless man.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what a man looks like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler smears blood on the ad. They continue on their way. Tyler comes to a "ROAD WORK" sign. Tyler kicks it into a deep HOLE. He and Jack tightrope-walk on wooden beams over darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guys packing into the gyms, all trying to look like what Calvin Klein says. Fight club isn't about looking good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
As they step back onto solid pavement, Tyler kicks one of the beams, causing it to come loose and fall. The whole temporary work structure falls into the hole. Tyler and Jack continue walking. IN the background, a car SKIDS and FISHTAILS, avoiding the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sound of a SIREN getting closer. Tyler hands Jack the 4x4 and runs, laughing. Jack stands there a moment, then throws the stick and runs after Tyler.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK (V.O.) A guy comes to fight club for the first time, and his ass is a wad of cookie dough. After a few weeks, he looks carved out of wood. He trusts himself to handle anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANOTHER STREET - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Tyler, panting, sweat mixing with blood, slow down and resume walking. Tyler pulls his fingers, popping them -- his knuckles are swollen. He grins at the pain.
</DIRECTION>

	Self-improvement is masturbaation. Self-destruction is the answer.

</MARLA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like that. Look, this is a bad time.

</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
MARLA I started going to debtor's anonymous. You want to see *really* fucked up people?

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I'm going out ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going out of my mind. I got a stomach full of Xanax. I took what was left of the bottle. Might've been too much ... probably was.

</MARLA>

Jack turns TO CAMERA.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Picture yourself watching Marla throw herself around her crummy apartment, saying, "I'm dying. Dying. Dying. It could go on for hours.

	You probably want to die in peace. I'll let you go.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay on the line. I want you to hear me describe death.
	</DIALOGUE>

Jack puts the handset on top of the phone, still off the hook, and walks out of the kitchen.

MARLA'S VOICE I want to see if my spirit can use the telephone.

INT. BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRUNTS of PLEASURE and EXERTION. In dim light, we get glimpses of TORSOS, ASSES, LEGS, ARMS, BREASTS, and BLACK FEMALE HAIR -- all DRENECHED in SWEAT. Sheets RIP. CA-CHUNK! CA-CHUNK! Bodies hit the FLOOR and roll. More insane GRUNTING. And LAUGHING -- CACKLING. A flash of MARLA'S FACE. Then, groans of ecstasy approaching climax. CUT TO:

Jack sits at the table, sipping coffee, reading Reader's Digest. He takes in a long yawn, rubs his eyes. He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not going to believe the dream I had.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Marla walks in, straightening her dress. She looks like she's been raped by a hurricane. Some of her hair is matted against her head, some of it is sticking out wildly. Jack gapes at her in shock. She cracks a coy smile and runs a finger across the back of his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARLA I can hardly believe *anything* about last night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pours herself a cup of coffee. She takes a big gulp, GARGLES and SPITS it out into the sink. She gives Jack a lascivious smile. Then, she sips from the cup. She strokes his hair. He pulls back from her.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck are you doing here?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>

Marla looks at him a beat, then throws the cup into the sink and it SHATTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<MARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you.

She kicks open the door to the backyard and walks out. Jack watches her stomp across the lawn to the sidewalk and down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack turns and -- Tyler is at his shoulder, staring after Marla. He's in his usual sweatpants. He grins at Jack, then moves away, pours himself coffee. Jack, smoldering, slumps at the table and picks up Reader's Digest. Tyler puts his foot on a countertop and begins to do stretching exercises.
</DIRECTION>

	The girl who lives there used to be a charming, lovely girl. But she has no faith in herself.

Tyler yanks on Marla's arm. They continue down the steps, with Marla's speech getting louder.

JACK'S POV - TYLER'S ROOM

Marla moves very close to Jack and props a leg up on a stack of magazines near him. She's not wearing underwear. Jack becomes very aware of his having no pants on, so he pushes up against the counter. Marla lasciviously pulls the hemline further up her leg.

Tyler and Jack have fat stains and rips on their clothes from the waste dump. The pots boil. Tyler stirs. He sticks a spoon into a pot and lifts up a scoop of the glycerin layer. Then, he grabs a can, opens, it.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lye -- the crucial ingredient for making soap. A paste of lye and water can burn through an aluminum pan. A solution of lye and water will dissolve a wooden spoon. Combined with water, lye heats to over two hundred degrees.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler licks his lips until they're gleaming wet. He takes Jack's hand and KISSES the back of it. The saliva shines in the shape of the kiss. Tyler poises the can of lye over Jack's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a chemical burn, and it will hurt more than you've ever been burned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler pours a bit of the flaked lye onto Jack's hand. Jack's whole body JERKS. Tyler holds tight to Jack's hand. Tears well in Jack's eyes; his face tightens.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at your hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks -- the burn is swollen glossy in the shape of Tyler's kiss. Jack's face spasms, but he forces himself to endure it.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tyler's kiss was a bonfire or a branding iron on my hand at the end of a long, long road I pictured miles away from me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack takes his gaze off his hand and his eyes become glazed and detached.

Tyler squeezing Jack's hand. Jack's eyes re-focus on Tyler.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it. Listen. Your father was your model for God. And if your father bails out, what does that tell you about God?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Jack's face spasms in pain. He keeps his attention on Tyler.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you. He hates you. This is not the worst thing that can happen. His hate is better that His indifference.

Jack becomes dazed again. CUT TO:

Tyler tugs at Jack's arm.

Jack does his best to stifle his spasms and quivers of pain. Tears drip from his eyes.

<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someday, you will die. And until you know that, you're useless to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler's eyes fill with tears and he smiles. Suddenly, Jack starts breathing heavily and he shakes his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck, man. This HURTS.

<DIRECTION>
Tyler laughs; Jack, bearing the pain, cracks a weird little crooked smiles, his eyes wide.

<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - SUNRISE

Tyler watches as Jack cuts several perfectly shaped bars of soap. Tyler finishes wrapping one. The wrapper says: "The Paper Street Soap Company" in quaint writing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BARNEY'S - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Tyler, wearing trenchcoats and looking like death-warmed-over, wait by a counter and trendily-dressed and finely-coiffed SALESPEOPLE zip around. Tyler is the picture of cool. Jack looks around as if expecting to get arrested. He looks at his BANDAGED HAND, shakes it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BUYER, a woman, comes to the counter, smiles at Tyler; he smiles back. MOS while Jack's VOICE is OVER the following: the Buyer looks over a sample bar of soap. She nods, smiles and begins to fill out forms.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)

	<DIALOGUE>

EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Tyler march down the sidewalk, full of purpose, like gunfighters heading for a show-down.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at the guys in fight club. The strongest and smartest men who have ever lived -- and they're pumping gas and waiting tables; or they're slaves with white collars. Advertising has them chasing cars and clothes. A whole generation working in jobs they hate, just so they can buy shit they don't really need.

	</DIALOGUE>

Jack punches Bob in the stomach. Bob puts up his hands to block. Jack throws more punches. Finally, Bob punches Jack in the face, knocking him staggering. Jack comes back and they pummel each other. Bob's face gets redder with anger.

Then, Jack steps back, holding out his hands to signal "stop".

EXT. BASEMENT DOOR - ELECTRONICS WAREHOUSE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone quietly sneaks out of the new location -- we've seen none of these guys before -- this is a new chapter. Jack and Bob stagger out last. They are both dripping blood and covered with bruises -- Jack being in worse shape -- and they both grin with religious serenity. Bob hugs Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>

Bob relaxes the hug and Jack drops to the ground like a sack, enervated from the beating he took.

</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're the middle children of history, with no special purpose or place.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. LARGE PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Jack and Bob, armed with a toolbox, change the "Enter" and "Exit" signs around. They walk away. In the background, a car drives into the "entrance" and the front tires EXPLODE from the BLADES in the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack walks toward an intersection, beyond which is a large CITY PARK. A group of people are LEAVING A PUBLIC BUILDING in front of him. Marla is among them -- it's a support group adjourning for the night. Jack catches Marla's eye. He simply smiles and waves. Marla stares at him, deadpan. She turns and walks away, JUST AS ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler STEPS INTO FRAME, looking straight ahead at the park. He signals Jack and they move forward. From out of nowhere, Bob joins them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARK - OUTDOOR BEER FESTIVAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bad BAND plays German music. BANNERS advertising American beer are everywhere. People wear shirts and hats with beer ads. Jack, Bob and Tyler sneak up to the side of a portable TOILET. They shove it until it falls against the next toilet. An ENTIRE ROW of portable toilets falls like dominoes. They dart behind a row of trees, then casually walk away.

INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - ON GROUND - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two AIRPLANE MAINTENANCE MEN -- with bruised faces -- rip open a box from a PRINT SHOP. They dig up handfuls of AIRLINE SAFETY INSTRUCTION CARDS and begin to inset them into each seat back pouch. We MOVE IN and SEE a card -- it shows passengers SCREAMING and FLAILING ABOUT IN TERROR.

JACK (V.O.) I was still half-asleep all the time. I left the original in the copy machine.
</DIRECTION>
<BOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this yours? "The second rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club". Is it yours or not? You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.

	"Abuse" the copy machine. What an image.

	Let's play pretend. You're me. You find *this*. What would you do? Hmm? Make a managerial decision. What would you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOSS>
<DIRECTION>
Jack slowly rises, walks softly to his office door, shuts it and faces the boss.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd be very careful who I talked to about this. It sounds like someone dangerous wrote this, and this buttoned-down psychotic could probably snap at any moment and stalk from office to office with an Armalite AR-180 Carbine gas-operated semiautomatic. He's probably at home every night with a little rattail file, filing a cross into the tip of every one of his bullets. This way, when he pumps a round into ... *someone* ... it will split along the filed grooves and spread open the way a dum dum flowers inside you to blow a load of guts out through *someone's* spine. This is probably somebody you've know for years.

Boss stares at him with a tinge of outrage, a tinge of fear.

INT. MORTUARY - SAME

<DIRECTION>
Jack walks into the dim, dramatically-lit foyer. He sees Marla at a desk. She does not see him. She's wearing a black formal dress -- like a gorgeous angel of death. A VERY FAT MALE CUSTOMER holds an URN the size of an egg cup. Marla studies the urn and the Customer's body with a dreary expression.
</DIRECTION>
<MARLA>

	Sir, you couldn't get the ashes of your *neck* in here.

He stares at her while she wolfs down food. Marla takes a napkin and wipes her mouth.

Boss sits up in his seat, becoming enraged.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's pretend. You're the Department of Transportation. And you knew that our company intentionally left a front seat mounting bracket that never passed collision tests? Did nothing about leather seats -- that were cured in third world countries with a chemical we know causes birth defects? Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles. Turbochargers that blow up and cut off legs at the knees. Fuel injectors that burn people alive. All of these accidents where "cause of failure" is stamped "unknown". I know where the bodies are buried. Call it job security.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<BOSS>

	Just who the fuck do you think you are?! Get out of here! You're fired!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOSS>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got a better idea. You're going to keep me on payroll as an outside consultant. In exchange for my salary, I'll perform the task of not telling anyone what I know. I won't need to come into the office. I can do this job from home. Call it early retirement, with pension.

Jack PUNCHES HIMSELF in the nose. Blood starts to trickle down. He punches himself in the jaw, harder. He throws himself back, acting as if the force of the punch knocked him. His back SLAMS against a framed painting and SHATTERS the glass. He and the frame and the glass and the painting fall to the floor.

Jack climbs up Boss's leg. Boss, aghast, tries to shake him off, and, in doing so, stumbles back in to his desk, knocking off photos, stacks of paper, paperweights.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Under and behind and inside everything this man took for granted, something horrible had been growing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack crawls up high enough to grab Boss's belt and hoist himself up further. He's getting blood all over the Boss's clothes. Jack SMUDGES blood from his face onto the knuckles of both Boss's hands. The horrified man SCREAMS.

	And right then, at our most excellent moment, security guards decided to walk in.

Two SECURITY GUARDS come inside and gape at the sight. Behind them stands a crowd of curious workers, also taking in the sight.

INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - JACK'S ROOM - DUSK

Jack, all bloody, lies in his bed, asleep. He awakens, hearing the BACK DOOR SLAM. He painfully hauls himself out of bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack enters to see Tyler taking beers out of the fridge. Jack waves a PAYCHECK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK I did it.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's fucking great!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Jack sees that Tyler is dressed in combat fatigues. He's splattered with various colors of PAINT. There's a rope and rappelling mechanisms lying on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler nods toward the living room and hands Jack all the beers.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on in. We're celebrating.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, a little bewildered, saunters in, carrying the beers. Tyler does NOT follow him. Bob, Ricky and several fight club guys are in front of the TV. They are all dressed like Tyler, all splattered with paint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack hands them their beer. One of the guys is sixteen year old with an angelic face. He notices the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGEL FACE SHHH! They're back to it!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks at the TV as it shows a LIVE shot of a BUILDING, which is identified at the bottom of the screen as the TRW building. It has a GIANT GRINNING FACE PAINTED on it. The two EYES are broken, charred windows with SMOKE pouring out. Firetrucks spray water into the windows.

<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Police Commissioner Jacobs has come down ... just a second ... excuse me, could you tell us what you think this is?

</REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
The COMMISSIONER JACOBS, a wrinkled man with baleful eyes, turns to camera.
</DIRECTION>
<COMMISSIONER_JACOBS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We believe this is related to the other recent acts of vandalism around the city. It's some kind of organized group. And we're investigating thoroughly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMMISSIONER_JACOBS>
<DIRECTION>
Jack turns back and sees Tyler in the archway, watching the TV. Tyler pulls back, out of sight. Jack turns to the others.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you guys do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
They all BURST INTO LAUGHTER, look at Jack and shake their heads. Jack just stares at them. Suddenly, the guys' faces turn to stone.

INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A loud, luxurious banquet ensues. Commissioner Jacobs guzzles champagne and puffs on a cigar. Jack, in a waiter's uniform, serving another table, stares at Jacobs. Then, Jack looks apprehensively toward certain other waiters: Tyler, Bob, Ricky and Angel Face -- mixed in with the mass of waiters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Commissioner Jacobs enters, puffing the cigar, and walks toward a urinal. Jack, Tyler, Bob and Ricky leap out of the corner and attack him. Jack's heart isn't in it -- he barely helps the others. Tyler knocks the cigar out of Jacob's mouth and slaps a piece of tape over it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - SAME

Jack holds the door while the others drag the struggling Commissioner inside. They hold him down and pull down his pants. Bob snaps a rubber band, then reaches down to Commissioner Jacob's crotch.

Ricky holds a knife to Commissioner Jacob's testicles. Jack, red-faced, keeps his distance. Tyler leans in and whispers in the frightened man's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not going to continue your "rigorous investigation". You're going to publicly state that there is no underground group. Or -- imagine, the rest of your life with your ball sac flapping empty.

Ricky makes a dramatic cut with the knife -- he holds up the severed RUBBER BAND.

EXT. HOTEL - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, Tyler and the others file quickly out the back service entrance. Tyler slaps Angel Face's back. Angel Face smiles at him. Everyone splits up in different directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fight club in full swing. Jack squares off with Angel Face. He BEATS the SHIT out of Angel Face with a viciousness heretofore unseen. The crowd shouts maniacally, save for Tyler, who watches with an inscrutable stone face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Angel Face tries to speak, but Jack pounds him too hard. Blood flies everywhere. The crowd becomes QUIETER. Finally, Angel Face, on the floor, is clearly unconscious. Jack stops, stares at him, numb. The crowd seems a little spooked. Tyler scans the faces, looks at Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler and Jack walk through pools of streetlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK I felt like destroying something beautiful.

An idling car HONKS. Tyler leads Jack toward it. A bruise-faced VALET PARKER throws keys to Tyler.

<DIRECTION>
INT. STOLEN CAR - MOVING - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAIN GUSHES down. Tyler drives. Jack sits slumped in the passenger seat. They are BARRELING down a two-lane HIGHWAY, intermittently illuminated by oncoming headlights. Jack stews in silence. Tyler glances at him.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem"?

</JACK>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You *were* told about it.

	Uh-huh. Yeah. Fine. If you can't talk to me about it ...

</JACK>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the whole point -- you *don't* talk about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, I can't even ask?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want me to say? That Project Mayhem will knock over the pillars of civilization like dominoes? That it's going to bring about a prematurely-induced dark age? Should I E-mail you? Should I put this on your "action item list"?

</JACK>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The front seat mounting bracket never passed collision tests.

Tyler pulls the car into the opposite lane. HEADLIGHTS in the distance get closer very, very quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
The oncoming car gets closer and closer, honking and flashing it's lights. Jack tries to grab the wheel. Tyler uses one arm to pin down Jack's arms. He uses one hand to steer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK TYLER! WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!!
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
JACK I WOULD FEEL NOTHING ABOUT MY LIFE! IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR?!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TYLER I want to hear the truth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car swerves at the last second.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck my life. Fuck fight club! Fuck you and fuck Marla. I'm sick of this shit! How's that? Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have any concept of what it is to hit bottom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
An oncoming TRUCK honks and flashes it's lights. It moves to the other side of the road. Tyler steers there, too. The truck moves back; Tyler moves back. More honking and flashing. The truck moves; Tyler moves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TYLER HITTING BOTTOM ISN'T A WEEKEND RETREAT! IT'S NOT A SEMINAR! ONLY AFTER YOU'VE LOST EVERYTHING ARE YOU FREE TO DO ANYTHING! YOU SEE, YOU LISTEN, BUT YOU DON'T GET IT! YOU HAVE TO FORGET EVERYTHING YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just seconds to impact with the oncoming truck and -- Tyler swerves. Now the car heads straight for a STALLED CAR on the side of the road, surrounded by flares. Jack stops struggling to get his arms free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK I am nothing in the world compared to you. I am helpless. I am stupid and weak and all I do is want and need things. I *am* my little shit job. I *am* my condo and my Swedish furniture. I am SHIT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler lets go of Jack's arms and lets go of the steering wheel. He and Jack look at each other as their car barrels toward the stalled car. Their faces are illuminated by the light of the flares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They SMASH into the stalled car. Both airbags inflate, but the front seat LURCHES forward, loose, causing the men's legs to bang against the dash. Tremendous momentum makes the back of the car whip around and carry it into a ass-over-teakettle ROLL down the hill.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. OVERTURNED CAR

Tyler crawls out and goes around, opening Jack's door. He drags Jack out into the mud. He grabs Jack's face and squeezes it, shaking it.

INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Jack lies in bed, staring at the ceiling. Tyler sits in a chair, next to the bed, speaking softly.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The world I see -- you're stalking elk through the damp canyon forests around the ruins of Rockefeller Center. You wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life. You climb the wrist-thick vines that wrap the Sears Tower. You see tiny figures pounding corn and laying strips of venison on the empty car pool lane of the ruins of a superhighway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack lies in bed, staring at the ceiling. Tyler is gone. Faint sounds of SAWING and HAMMERING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack sits at the table, sipping coffee. He's pale, dazed. He seems broken. He hears the faint sounds of sawing and hammering again; he's unsure of where they're coming from. He glances out the window, sees nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marla walks into the kitchen. Jack looks up at her. She looks at him, unsmiling. There's a bruise on her face and arm. She pours herself a coffee and lights a cigarette. A beat of silence, then:
</DIRECTION>
<MARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be out of your way in a sec.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARLA>
<DIRECTION>
She seems to be as weak as Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ... don't have to ... rush off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sarcastic prick.

</MARLA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, really ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Marla's eyes drift away from his. Jack gets up, tries to move closer to her. She pulls away. He retreats and they wind up on opposite sides of the room. Jack leans against the wall near the BASEMENT DOOR, which is AJAR.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are we both ... caught up like this ... with ...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
JACK (V.O.) I came so close to saying Tyler's name, I could feel it vibrate inside my mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marla looks at him curiously, waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why does a weak person go out and find a strong person to ... hang onto?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a real sick relationship. You don't think I know it?

</JACK>
<MARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>

Faint sound of sawing and hammering. Jack can't quite figure where it's coming from.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hear that?

</JACK>
<MARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hear what?

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That ... sawing and hammering.

<MARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>

JACK I just don't understand what you get out of such a sick relationship.
</DIRECTION>
<MARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell do *you* get out of it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Jack turns and sees, through the slim space of the open door, Tyler, at the bottom of the basement stairs, staring a silent warning. Jack turns back to Marla.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nevermind.

	No. That day you came over to check my breast ...

</JACK>
<MARLA>

</MARLA>

Marla moves slowly toward Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Conversation over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Marla strokes Jack's hair. She sees the kiss-scar on his hand. She grabs his hand and studies it. Jack tries to pull it back, but Marla keeps a tight grip.
</DIRECTION>
<MARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is that?! Who did that?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARLA>
<DIRECTION>
JACK ... A person.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go! Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Marla kisses Jack's hand, putting her lips right onto the scar, leaving an imprint of lipstick. Jack jerks his hand away from her. He tries to wipe off the lipstick and it smears. He unconsciously licks it off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARLA MMMMMMMMMM ... Swallow it.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the hell out of here!

Stung, Marla stomps toward the back door.

<MARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go fuck yourself -- that's probably how you like it best.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARLA>
<DIRECTION>
And out she goes. Jack watches her stomp through the backyard and out to the sidewalk. Tyler comes up from the basement, passes Jack and goes through the archway. Sound of his footsteps going up to the second floor. Jack goes down the basement steps.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack opens the door. Ricky stands on the porch, staring blankly ahead in subordinate military style. He's dressed in black pants, black shirt, black shoes. He holds a brown paper bag. An army surplus mattress sits in a tied-up roll at his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack is about to say something, when Tyler steps past Jack and speaks very softly to Ricky:
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. You're too young to train here.

</TYLER>

Tyler steps back inside and shuts the door.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Train" here?

</JACK>
<TYLER>

	He's not. If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young. Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is how Buddhist temples tested applicants going back for bah-zillion years. If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.

Tyler grins at him.

Jack bursts out the door, faces Ricky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK GET OUT OF HERE! GO! HE TOLD YOU YOU'RE TOO YOUNG! GET OUT!

It's clear there will be no response from Ricky, who's like a statue. Jack goes back inside, closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PORCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ricky stands in the same spot. Jack bursts out with a broom, knocks the brown paper bag out of Ricky's hand, kicks it off the porch. Ricky remains in place, motionless.

JACK ARE YOU STUPID?! I TOLD YOU TO GET OUT OF HERE! YOU'RE NEVER GETTING INSIDE THIS HOUSE!

Ricky's in the same spot. Next to him now is Bob, dressed in black with brown paper bag and Army surplus mattress. Tyler steps out the front door. Jack lights in the doorway, locking eyes on Bob.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TYLER (to Ricky) Get your stuff. (to Bob) You're too old to train here. Sorry.

Tyler and Ricky go inside and Tyler slams the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack stands in the open bathroom doorway, watching Tyler SHAVE off all of Ricky's HAIR. When he's done, Tyler gives the top of Ricky's head a sharp slap.

<DIRECTION>
TYLER A monkey, ready to be shot up into space, ready to sacrifice himself for Project Mayhem.

And, so, all those with shaved heads will henceforth be termed "SPACE MONKEYS".

EXT. PORCH - LATER

Jack looks out the window. Bob continues to stand, motionless. Ricky comes out the front door with the broom.

INT. TYLER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jack enters. Bob reads a book and makes marks on a chart. All along the floor are baskets; each one is labeled with a number in sequence: "1, 2," etc. The first ten are under a sign that says "WILMINGTON". Then, there's a sign over some that says "NEW YORK", then "CHICAGO", and other cities. There are dozens of BOOKS on FINANCE. Jack looks in basket number "1" and sees the word "CITIBANK" at the top of a page. He starts flipping through it; then the next basket.

Bob grabs Jack's hand and leads him away from the baskets.

INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack barges in among the laboring Space Monkeys. They pinch herbs into the soap mix. They also use vodka. Jack grabs a bottle of vodka and takes a long pull off it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK (V.O.) I had to hug the walls, being a mouse trapped inside this clockwork of space monkeys, cooking and working and sleeping in teams. The house became a living thing, wet on the inside from so many people sweating and breathing. So many people moving, the house moved.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PHONE RINGS. Jack snatches it. All the Monkeys stare at him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Be quiet and listen.

Jack reacts with surprise -- did Tyler hear his thoughts?

	"We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world".

The group of four steps off the porch and heads for a VAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A piece of ART adorns the top of a hill: a metal TOWER, wide at the base and a hundred feet high, in design somewhat similar to the Eifel Tower. At the top is a giant GLOBE made of circular poles and wires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, Bob and the other two monkeys attach the explosive packets to the globe; wire the packets together; use sandbags to cover the packets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARK - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The group of four huddle behind some bushes, staring at the globe. Bob holds a small metal electronic box with a button -- a detonator. He presses the button.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RAPID SERIES of EXPLOSIONS runs from the base of the tower to the top, along the four main structural supports. They are contained, shaped blasts. The tower crumbles straight down. Bob turns to smile at Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly the way it was supposed to work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<DIRECTION>
The globe falls free, bangs into the top of the hill and begins to roll. When it gets to the street, it bounces onto the top of a parked LIMO -- and becomes a FLAMING, raised "GUTTERBALL" -- it never hits the street -- it rolls over one parked limo or expensive luxury car after another, crunching the roofs, causing the windows to explode outward. Fifty cars get this treatment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, it arrives at the lobby of a HOTEL, BROADSIDES a couple of limos, CAROMS off them, TURNS and rolls directly into the front of a large (closed) STARBUCKS, SMASHING DOWN the windows and the front door and setting the place ON FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARK - AERIAL VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jack, Bob and the two other Monkeys FLEE, LAUGHING hysterically at their handiwork. They split up and move in different directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE IN ON JACK, sprinting, keeping hidden by bushes. SIRENS can be heard. He's stripping off his ski mask, his gloves, his combat gear -- as he runs. Underneath are street clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In that moment I "clicked". I became what Tyler wanted. I was his limb, his appendage -- an extension of his will, nothing more. And he knew it. I could feel him knowing it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack dumps the wad of clothes into a trashcan and pulls up the surrounding trash to cover them. He breaks into a sprint again, heading for the edge of the park.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUNSHOT. Jack's smile fades. He stops, looks toward the direction from which the sound came. He turns, heads down along a row of hedges. He comes to a
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONCRETE STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And moves to the top step, looking down. A COP is near the bottom, running down to the sidewalk. Next to a STREETLAMP LIES a ONE of the MONKEYS in full combat attire and ski mask. The body is MOTIONLESS, SPRAWLED. In the hand is the DETONATOR -- looking somewhat like a gun. The Cop pulls off the ski mask, revealing the DEAD FACE of Bob, a BULLETHOLE through the head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack flinches backwards as if punched in the stomach. He gasps for breath. The Cop looks up and catches sight of Jack. He lifts his gun and his PB radio. Jack jerks back out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARK - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack hobbles along. Nearby, from beyond a hedge, he hears the crackling of a PB with a VOICE coming from it. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COP'S VOICE (into PB) Yeah. We found some clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, sweating like a pig, picks up his pace and heads for the edge of the park.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, panting, white as a ghost, trembling, approaches from the sidewalk. He sees the front door open and four Space Monkeys come out, carrying LUGGAGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BIG-EARED MONKEY (a solemn chant) We are now the ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OTHER MONKEYS & BIG-EARED (unison) ... right hands of Tyler Durden.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack steps up onto the porch and sees that they are all holding FLIGHT COUPONS. Jack notices that all of them have the KISS-SCAR on their left hands. They ignore him with military demeanor and walk down to the sidewalk and head for the bus stop.

Jack walks inside to see a Space Monkey, BEET-RED but silent, holding out his hands while LYE BURNS the inside of the TOPS of his FINGERS. Other Monkeys sit and await the process.

INT. TYLER'S ROOM

Jack barges into the room, goes to the desk and rifles through drawers. His elbow bangs against the top of an ANSWERING MACHINE. It plays MESSAGES.
</DIRECTION>
<MARLA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, don't get bent, okay? But ... there's a therapist that I think could really help you. Give me a call. Okay?

</DETECTIVE_STERN_S_VOICE>

Jack shivers, snaps OFF the machine, then more furiously continues his search. He finally finds flight coupons -- both used and unused. The used ones have the flight information, including the destination cities. He stuffs all of them into his pocket.

Jack walks in and sits at the bar. The BARTENDER wears a NECK BRACE and has a black eye.

	Oh, shit! No! I'm out of town!

He punches Marla's number like a maniac. Listens ... just ringing and ringing. He turns, sees TYLER -- sitting on the bed, staring at him with an ominous poker face. Jack drops the receiver. The room is only lit by dim moonlight through the window.

JACK I want you to get out of town for awhile. Whether you believe me or not, you're in *real* danger. Is there someplace you can go?

Marla grabs the flight coupon, looks it over.

<MARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's plenty of places I'd like to go.

</MARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Jack digs into his pocket and produces a wad of cash. Marla roughly seizes the cash, checks out the amount.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave as soon as possible. Go to a rural little town, away from any major city. Go now. Okay? Please. Promise?

</JACK>
<MARLA>

	Count on it. And I'm not paying this back -- I consider it "asshole tax".

</MARLA>
<DIRECTION>
JACK I agree. More than you know.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marla's expression of rage becomes muddled with confusion over Jack's almost spiritual tenderness. Jack starts toward the door. A WAVE OF DROWSINESS and FATIGUE hits him. He staggers, eyes closing. He drops onto a chair for a beat and rests his hand over his face.

He SNAPS AWAKE. Marla is GONE. Jack bolts up out of the seat.

Jack punches the first number.

A brief silence while Jack absorbs this and adjusts.

Jack ignores the waiting cabbie and heads for the main road. He's stomping along at a brisk pace. His face hardens into a mask of psychotic determination. He pulls Marla with him onto a run-down side street.

Stern enters and leads Jack to a table. All the other Detectives file inside. The last one closes the door. Dim light from a single bulb overhead creates the tone of a torture chamber. Cigarette smoke becomes thick. Jack sighs with relief. It's finally over. The Detectives all stare harshly at Jack.

Then, they all BURST into HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER. They slap and punch Jack's shoulder.

Jack stalks back toward Tyler, gun raised.

<DIRECTION>
JACK TELL ME WHERE THE CHARGES ARE!
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're all up and down the building. They're not just here. If you tried to stupidly pull a fuse on a charge, you'd just cause it to blow up. The charges are set to go in a specific order -- so that the building will implode and collapse. If you *did* defuse one of the charges, you'd fuck up the sequence, and the building might fall the wrong way. Why don't you just find a television and watch the party?

Jack squeezes harder, then lifts his head -- he's hugging ANOTHER JACK. The real Jack gasps, flinches backwards, landing on the gun. He turns, grabs the gun, and turns back around. Fifty feet away, Tyler, standing, leans against a pillar. He winks.

Jack raises the gun, turns it around and aims it at his own head.

A throng of Space Monkeys -- two of whom drag Marla -- RUSHES into the room. They see Jack, ALONE, holding a gun, bleeding profusely from the side of his face, where he's SHOT A HOLE through HIS CHEEK. He stares at the empty floor in front of him with his weird, little smile.

Jack cracks his weird, little smile; his eyes are wide and half-insane-looking. He winks at Marla and squeezes her hand.

	Tyler's dead.

The Space Monkeys all grab their duffel bags and file out of the room, saluting Jack as they go.

Now, Jack and Marla are completely alone. He struggles to get to his feet. She helps him. They look out the window.

<DIRECTION>
MASSIVE EXPLOSION -- a building a quarter of a mile away. It's destruction is completely visible from here. The glass walls RATTLE LOUDLY from the shock wave. They both stare out the window.

	Listen, you met me at a really weird time in my life ...

<DIRECTION>
Marla looks at Jack, then looks back out the window. He reaches for her hand. She takes his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are SILHOUETTED against BRIGHT FLASHES as ANOTHER BUILDING EXPLODES and COLLAPSES. ANOTHER BUILDING EXPLODES. And ANOTHER BUILDING. And ANOTHER BUILDING.

The FILM SLOWS DOWN, then ADVANCES ONE FRAME at a TIME -- SHOWING the SPROCKET HOLES on the SIDES. It's CAUGHT in the mechanism of the projector's GATE. EACH FRAME is the EXPLODING BUILDINGS -- then, *ONE FRAME is a PENIS*. Then, EXPLODING BUILDINGS again. SPEED UP the frames, LOSE the sprocket holes, RESUME NORMAL SPEED.

<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT

*THE END*
