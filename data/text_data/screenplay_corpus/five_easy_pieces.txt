BACH-VIVALDI OVER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A 7-year-old BOBBY sits in a chair, his feet dangling in absent-minded rhythm to a chamber piece played by his father, his two brothers and his sister.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON a metronome, marking a slow etude rhythm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA MOVES from it to Bobby, on the piano bench beside his mother. As she patiently demonstrates the etude for him, he places a thumb in his mouth and leans against her arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE METRONOME at an andante rhythm. CARL and TITA, now in their teens, are seated side by side on the piano bench, playing four-hands with dazzling virtuosity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA MOVES from them to a framed newspaper article on the music-room wall. Below a photograph of a 20-year-old young man are the words: "Herbert Kreutzer Dupea - Seattle's Youngest Guest Conductor."

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE FAMILY PEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS from NICHOLAS, seated on the aisle, to the four adult children seated next to him and COMES TO REST on Bobby. His gaze is cast down to his lap, as he refuses to look at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pale profile of his mother's face resting within the satin folds of the casket lining, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... as the last of the "family friends" pay their respect: Nicholas steps out into the aisle and, followed by Tita, Carl and HERBERT, moves down toward the casket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby rises from his seat and makes his way toward the aisle, where he hesitates briefly, then turns and walks up the aisle and out the chapel doors.

EXT. SIGNAL HILL OIL FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TAMMY WYNETTE'S "STAND BY YOUR MAN" OVER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The toothed bucket of a back hoe trenches into the earth, then lifts up into the air, revealing Bobby in hard-hat and heavy gloves, operating the levers. As the hoe swings off to the side and deposits a load of earth into the rear of a truck...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... a SERIES OF SHOTS begins, showing Bobby and a fellow hard-hat (ELTON) engaged in the dirty and dangerous task of working "crew" with a team of TOOL-PUSHERS on the derricks of Signal Hill. Functioning as servants of the well and its pumps, the PULL rods, MAKE and BREAK joints on the rig floor, WELD tubing, CARRY pipes, CLIMB the "tour," and PLAY THE DOZENS on beer wagon breaks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOBBY'S CAR - SIGNAL HILL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

The car pulls onto a low-rent residential street and comes to a stop in front of a small bungalow.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RAYETTE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SONG OVER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby, seated on the couch, a can of beer in hand, staring morosely across the room, to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PORTABLE STEREO,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
playing the song:
</DIRECTION>
<WYNETTE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"And if you love him/Oh be proud of him/For after all, he's just a man..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYNETTE>
<DIRECTION>
RAYETTE DIPESTO,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in a waitress's uniform with a bowl of beer nuts. After placing them on the coffee table in front of him, she leans down and kisses him. Challenged by a less than reciprocal response, she kisses him more fervently. As she moves her lips from his ear to his neck, he lifts the can to his mouth and drinks.
</DIRECTION>
<WYNETTE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Stand by your man/And show the world you love him/Keep giving all the love you can/Stand by your man."
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYNETTE>
<DIRECTION>
The song concludes, and setting aside her ardor for the moment:
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
(Arky accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna play it again...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
As she starts for the stereo, he takes hold of her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not going to play it again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, lemme play the other side then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Again, he prevents her from moving to the stereo and pulls her down onto the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, lemme sing the one I picked an' see what you think...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she sings)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"When there's a fire in your heart/Break the glass/Sound the alarm..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up one of the couch pillows and holds it over his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you prick...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls it from his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
She immediately softens and tries to become more "refined."
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sugar, you know how I feel about you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things, an' what I'm tryin' to do with myself...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(bringing her face close to his)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, there id'n anything in the world I wouldn't do for you, baby. I started livin' the day I found you, you know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're playing the other side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Very hurt, she sits up and looks away from him. He finishes the beer and holds the can out to her.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cerveza.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
(grabbing it from him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Serveza yourself!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
(she stands up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, dammit, I would easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
And, as she turns and goes toward the kitchen:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you heal fast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Through the open door to the kitchen, Rayette can be seen opening the refrigerator. She takes out a can of beer and returns to Bobby.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
(over the above)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can play the piano, an' your whole damn family can play on some type a musical instrument. An' all I'm askin' is for you to listen to my singing for one single little second...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him the can and sits back down on the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you think you would? No, you're too damn selfish...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
He gestures at the name tag on her dress, and, as we'll find he often does, speaks in the Okie-Arky accent he's learned from working the rigs:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
She sits down and begins removing the tag.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, I'll holler up Elton an' Stoney...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
She thinks about it, then moves closer to him and begins unbuttoning his workshirt, as:
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go out with you, or I'll stay here, and do anything you'd like for me to do... if you'll just do one thing. If you'll tell me that you love me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can sing the song.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
(annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what, you are never satisfied.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
The response makes her deeply insecure and she immediately lays her body against his...
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, now, baby...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
... and initiates another round of kissing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby lifts his ball from the return rack, moves to the lane and bowls a perfect strike. Making a self congratulatory gesture of triumph, he turns back to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elton, seated at the scoring table. His wife, STONEY, is seated beside Rayette on the horseshoe banquette. As he addresses Rayette, we note that Elton's two front teeth are missing.
</DIRECTION>
<ELTON>
<DIRECTION>
(Okie accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your ball, Ray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELTON>
<RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
(reluctant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this suppose to be fun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on, get up there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
She rises and moves to the rack.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and stay relaxed this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Picking up ball, she moves to the head of the lane and slings it down the alley, watching hopefully as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... it rolls off to the right and takes only one pin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she moves to her second ball.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now don't loft it, just release it like I told you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
ON RAYETTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she bowls the ball down the right-hand rut and comes back to the banquette, apologizing:
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The ball's too heavy for me, honey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks past her to Stoney, about to bowl her ball.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not the damn ball.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
And as Stoney bowls a strike, Rayette hugs his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
And as Elton bowls a strike...
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (mumbling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and passes Elton on his way to the rack.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice ball, El.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Rayette, to Stoney as she watches Bobby prepare to bowl:
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Id'n he somethin' to see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
And as he makes another strike and returns to the banquette, she gets up and throws her arms around him. He returns her embrace, smiling over her shoulder at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two heavily made-up young women (TWINKY and BETTY) taking possession of the adjacent lane. (Note that Betty is of diminutive proportions, while Twinky is Amazonian.)
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it my turn again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
He remains standing, watching as she throws another gutter ball and then comes back toward him, alibi ing:
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did, didn' I, El?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got another ball comin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
She moves to the rack and, concentrating hard, advances down the lane and releases the ball. It rolls slowly down the center, hits at precisely the right spot and clears the pins.
</DIRECTION>
<ELTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Atta boy, Ray!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELTON>
<DIRECTION>
Ecstatic, she comes back to the banquette, seating herself beside Bobby and trying to solicit a response from him.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, great.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(begins removing his bowling shoes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you throw Z's for 19 frames, and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game? Just wonderful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Turning to address the two young women over the back of the banquette.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wasn't it, ladies?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<TWINKY>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing at herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you talking to us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWINKY>
<DIRECTION>
Rayette pulls off her rental shoes and throws them to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna go wait in the car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
He stretches his arms out on the back of the banquette as though he intends to reside there awhile.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, why don't you do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs her sling-back and her purse and as she gets up:
</DIRECTION>
<STONEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait an I'll I go with you, honey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STONEY>
<DIRECTION>
As she picks up her belongings and follows Rayette:
</DIRECTION>
<ELTON>
<DIRECTION>
(changing his shoes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELTON>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hands him the bowling shoes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Elton moves off and Bobby, now full of remorse, slumps into a depressed reverie. Beyond him, Betty and Twinky, can be seen, engaged in some discussion concerning him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WAITRESS with a tray approaches and leans down to him.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I get you anything else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. How much do I owe you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five'll do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
He takes some loose bills from his pocket and lays them on her tray. She thanks him and moves off. As he reaches down and pulls on one of his boots, Twinky approaches behind him and leans down over the back of the banquette.
</DIRECTION>
<TWINKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWINKY>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I on TV?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<TWINKY>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing lo Betty)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWINKY>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Betty appears on the other side of the banquette.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, I told you it was him...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then to Bobby)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your name's Donnie something, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I leave it to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking to Twinky)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twinky?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
(explaining)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking from one to the other)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(touching his hair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A wig?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Twinky)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your little friend's real sharp there...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Betty)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<TWINKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, definitely...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWINKY>
<BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at his hairline)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but I can see a little bitty of the net up there, that's what give it away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<TWINKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's so weird to see you in person, but that's who she says you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWINKY>
<BETTY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is him, he said it's him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Bobby)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you could say it's me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Twinky reaches over to the scoring table, picking up a pencil and a score sheet.
</DIRECTION>
<TWINKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as she writes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWINKY>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you seem very professional...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<TWINKY>
<DIRECTION>
(handing the score sheet to him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always tell everyone the same thing. I got rolled and beat up real bad recently, and since then it's two for one, an' I work strictly in tandem with Betty...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWINKY>
<DIRECTION>
He glances at the dwarfish Betty.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I can see how she'd come in handy.

INT. STUDIO A RECORDING BOOTH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(BACH PARTITA UNDER:)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO RECORDING ENGINEERS glance at him without interest and return to their dials and needles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby looks from them through the glass partition to the recording studio in view beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELIZABETH "TITA" DUPEA is at the piano, intensely into the Bach. She wears a monastic-looking dress, her unruly hair is pinned back from her face, and her glasses lie on the bench beside her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watching her with both affection and appreciation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TITA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is "sounding" as she plays, in tones out-of-key and discordant with the Bach.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There she goes again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby glances over at him, then looks back to Tita.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hunches over the keyboard and plays an arpeggio, humming a long monochromatic note.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My 1-year-old can carry a tune better than that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby is about to defend her, when the engineer flips a toggle switch and addresses the mike feeding into the studio:
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Dupea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
There is no response and she continues playing.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby can be seen in the b.g., having difficulty restraining his irritation under the following:
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_ENGINEER>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?

</TITA>
<SECOND_ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_ENGINEER>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, for pity's sake...

She puts her elbows on top of the piano and drops her head into her bands.

<FIRST_ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she going to cry again?

</FIRST_ENGINEER>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</TITA>
<SECOND_ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would you like in your coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
She makes a mumbled response, her head still in her bands:
</DIRECTION>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Bobby enters the studio and comes toward her, opening his arms. She rushes into his embrace, burying her face in his shoulder.

</TITA>
<BOBBY>

She raises her head to look at him, and verging on tears:

A NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tita sits on the piano bench, crying and searching through her purse for a tissue. Bobby hovers behind her, gently patting her on the back and glancing with some embarrassment toward the recording booth.
</DIRECTION>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just can't look at you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't, then.

</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
As she blows her nose into the tissue, a young man comes into view, hands Bobby a paper cup and leaves. Tita takes another tissue from her purse and dabs at her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<TITA>

(then:)

Bobby laughs.

<BOBBY>

	Sprained his neck?

Tita laughs, then:

<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.

CLOSER ON him as he hesitates, listening briefly to the FAINT SOUND of two pianos coming from within.

<DIRECTION>
Then he opens the door and goes inside.

INT. DUPEA HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(TWO PIANOS OVER:)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby tentatively wanders the first floor of the house, taking in the ghosts of the past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the living room, he pauses at a table to look at several framed photographs. He picks up one of his mother and father, looks closely at it, then gently returns it to its place and resumes wandering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops at the music room and looks in through the half-opened door:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV INTO MUSIC ROOM:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the far side of the room, near windows which give view to a verdant exterior, are two concert grands. His brother CARL is seated at one of the pianos, and a young woman (CATHERINE VAN OOST) is seated at the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looking from Carl, to Catherine. He watches her briefly, then steps out of the doorway...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and moves down a hallway to a closed door. He reaches down and opens it, looking inside to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
grooming the hair of an elderly man (NICHOLAS DUPEA) seated in a wheelchair with his back to Bobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up and, seeing Bobby, smiles happily, then reaches down and turns the wheelchair around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON NICHOLAS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes are half-closed and are cast down to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby moves over to him, bending down and looking into his face. Nicholas opens his eyes slightly and gazes through Bobby into an absolute elsewhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby raises his eyes to Tita.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He doesn't even know who the hell I am.

<DIRECTION>
INT. DUPEA DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicholas Dupea sits at the head of the table, being fed his dinner by a male nurse (SPICER).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby, at the opposite end of the table, is seated next to Tita. Unable to bear looking at his father, he glances over at Catherine, seated next to Carl on his right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She raises her eyes from her plate to ask him something, just as Tita is moved to reminisce:
</DIRECTION>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember, Bobby, what mother used to say when...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Bobby)

<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's all right, you go ahead...

</TITA>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just going to ask Robert how long he's been away from here.

</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four or five years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, the last time was three years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no, it's been much more than that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think that's true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides being very rude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have you been doing since then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you no longer play at all?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby starts to reply and is interrupted by:
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know where you were, penis envy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope I didn't hear that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and I said, "What for?" Whatever the hell he's doing, even if it's a completely wasteful escapade, it's entirely his business. Simple as that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...

She looks at Spicer, pushing a spoon at Nicholas's closed mouth.

<TITA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't force him like that, Spicer.

Spicer lays the spoon down and begins eating his own dinner.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long have you been staying here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A couple of months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to ask another question and is again overridden by:
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck. If I wanted to turn toward Catherine, for instance, I'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(demonstrating)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... like this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
Tita gets up from the table and, taking her plate, exits to the kitchen. And as Carl readjusts himself in his chair and takes a sip from his wine glass, Bobby looks at Catherine to find her looking at him. She quickly alters her gaze to Carl.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't mind doing a little work, if you're finished, and not too tired...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm finished...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(placing a hand on his stomach)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Satiety is my father and mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
Finding he's amused himself and nobody else, he gets up and addresses Bobby.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Catherine stands up and, wanting to change the subject:
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, I don't want to hear this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
She exits and Carl, on his way out, pauses at Bobby's chair.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you feel at home, Robert.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(patting him on the shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm really glad you're here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Carl...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down table to see Spicer stacking his plate onto Nicholas's and his eyes follow him as he, too, moves out of the dining room to the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON BOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in extreme discomfort at being left alone with his father. He looks down at his plate, poking at the remainder of his dinner, then braves a look down the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON NICHOLAS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looking back at him, his eyes devoid of interest or cognition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DUPEA GROUNDS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby and Tita walk away from the house down toward the ocean. Accompanying them is a Borzoi hound belonging to her.
</DIRECTION>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uhm hmm. Some range.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not that bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.

</BOBBY>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A week or two isn't going to ruin your life, for Godsakes.

She stops walking and moves to one of the garden chairs, facing out toward the bay.
</DIRECTION>
<TITA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And anyway, I want you to stay, so I can spend some time with you, and ask you some questions...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<DIRECTION>
He leans his back against a tree.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What questions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes.

She stares at him for a moment, and taking note of it:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?

She laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't really think you're a freak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uhm hmm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...

	Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...

</TITA>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing to say, Tita...

</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
He offers nothing further and looks out over the bay. Then, after a brief silence:

<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?

INT. DUPEA HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby strolls casually about the house - in truth, looking for an opportunity to run into Catherine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves to the music room and looks inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE DOORWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Catherine can be seen, seated at the piano. Carl stands above her and they engage in some exchange about the score resting on the piano's music stand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he moves down the hallway and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spicer descending the staircase, with the brittle Nicholas in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He ducks into the nearest room to avoid them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DEN - DUPEA HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tita, startled in the act of appraising herself in a mirror above the fireplace, turns around to Bobby:
</DIRECTION>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God, don't sneak up on me like that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<DIRECTION>
We see she wears a little make-up and has done something "different" with her hair.

<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.

</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and exits the den.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DUPEA HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby stands on the front porch, looking toward...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Catherine coming up from the ocean. She wears a bathrobe over a wet bathing suit and carries a towel, and as she approaches:
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess you fell in the water.

</BOBBY>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swimming?

</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
She laughs and begins drying her hair with a corner of the towel.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>

	Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.

</BOBBY>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.

INT. DUPEA KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dinner has concluded and Tita moves around the table, distributing cups and saucers. Carl is remote and off his feed. Spicer attends Nicholas, and Catherine looks across the table to Bobby as he drinks from a bottle of beer. After a moment, a loud belch comes from Nicholas and Tita quickly requests:
</DIRECTION>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't laugh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<DIRECTION>
She attempts to stifle her own amusement, as do Bobby and Catherine, then changes the subject:

	What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...

	I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
Catherine begins pouring the coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gave it a second thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Tita seats herself at the table, addressing Spicer:
</DIRECTION>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He looks tired to me, Spicer. I think you should put him to bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<DIRECTION>
He nods, and as he gets up and wheels Nicholas from the room:
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't call that music, though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I do. It's music. You know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
He places his hands on the table and simulates the playing of a rousing production-type show-stopper, simultaneously vocalizing as he does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Though Tita and Catherine are amused, Carl winces disapprovingly and breaks into Bobby's act:
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Robert, do you mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

He takes hold of Catherine's hand and stands up.

</CATHERINE>
<CARL>
<DIRECTION>
(a bit martyred)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, maybe if we put the Thermaphore on me for a while, first...

</CARL>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
And as they move to the door, she glances apologetically back at Bobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deflated and embarrassed, he looks away from Tita's sympathetic gaze. After a brief silence, she reaches to a platter on the table.

Bobby stands in the living room. It is dark and the only light comes from some burning logs in the fireplace. He listens briefly to the sounds of a Beethoven sonata coming from the music room...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... then moves to a chaise near the fireplace and lies down, staring absently into the flames. After a moment, he closes his eyes.

He listens again, his eyes on Catberine, moving around in her room.

<BOBBY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well I'm not having any fun, either, so why don't you...

(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you can't, it's just not convenient, and I have to get off...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray, I really have to go, I have to get off now...

(longer pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another couple of days, maybe. I'll call you and let you --

	All right, if you're gone, you're gone. Now I have to get off, okay?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Bye, Ray...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up and, as he starts down the hall to Catherine's room, the VIOLIN STOPS and Carl steps out into the hall ahead of him. He carries his fiddle and detains Bobby, with:
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only 10 minutes of playing and it's already killing my neck...

</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby looks past him to Catherine as she glances out at them and then closes the door to her room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DUPEA GROUNDS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby and Carl, playing a game of table tennis. Tita stands leaning against a tree, watching them. In the b.g., Spicer can be seen, meticulously oiling and cleaning the wheelchair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they volley the ball back and forth:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure you should be playing, Carl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
Carl hits into the net, and as the ball rebounds to him, he tosses it to Bobby.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(serving)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, there's something wrong with the way you move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>

Carl hits the net again.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not aware of it. Like what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.

Carl serves and as they volley:

<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd hate to see you walk across a concert stage like that.

Carl tries a smash and mis-hits the ball...

<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two -- Nineteen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
... and as he retrieves it:
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
<DIRECTION>
(irritated with Bobby)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I mean...

</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Carl comes back to the table.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any particular humor, I meant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
He angrily serves the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(returning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you should get someone to coach you how to walk. I think it's a substantial problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
He hits a smash and it sails past Carl into some shrubbery several yards away.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
As he moves after the ball, Bobby gestures at him.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you being so mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at Carl, bent over and searching through the shrubs.
</DIRECTION>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(wanting to go on about it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, he's...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
She interrupts him, looking toward Spicer.
</DIRECTION>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby? Do you think Spicer is attractive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over at Spicer, polishing the frame of the wheelchair.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think he's got a terrific personality.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, he was formerly a sailor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby gestures his paddle at Carl, on his way back with the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<DIRECTION>
Carl comes up to the table, asserting:
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At game, Carl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Carl serves and they volley briefly. Then BobbY angles the ball sharply and puts it away.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's three games to none, Carl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, let's have a rematch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you had to go to the mainland today. Aren't you going to miss the ferry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Carl takes a quick glance at his watch, then drops his paddle onto the table.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad. Just when I was hitting my stride.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
He starts away, then turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say goodbye to Catherine for me, will you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
As he moves off in the direction of the cars, Tita comes up beside Bobby.
</DIRECTION>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I play now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<DIRECTION>
Carl calls over to them from his car:
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell her I'll be back sometime tomorrow!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby turns to Tita.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is she, anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<TITA>
<DIRECTION>
(ignoring the question)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My turn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<DIRECTION>
He hands her the paddle...
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you and Spicer play?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
... and moves off toward the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUPEA HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby knocks on Catherine's door and, hearing no response, opens it and steps inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CATHERINE'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wanders about, discreetly touching nothing, but taking in some essence of Catherine from her belongings and from the scent of her that lingers in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His journey brings him into proximity with the windows and he pauses to look out at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITA AND SPICER BELOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
playing table tennis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to move from the windows, when he sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CATHERINE'S CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulling into view and parking near the garage. She gets out, and, carrying a shopping bag and a wrapped bouquet of flowers, pauses on her way to the house to have some exchange with Tita.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUPEA HOME - STAIRCASE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
quickly descending the staircase, and FOLLOWING with him as he moves to the music room and goes inside, leaving the door open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses to one of the grands, seats himself and rubs his hands together to warm them. Then, scanning his mental repertoire, he places his hands on the keyboard and begins to play a Chopin etude.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Presently, Catherine appears in the doorway. She stands listening for a moment, then places the shopping bag and flowers on a settee near the doorway and crosses to a chair near the pianos and sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby glances at her, then returns his eyes to the keyboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON CATHERINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
her features intensely concentrated, as she listens to his playing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
apparently deep into the music. On the wall behind him are the series of photographs seen in the opening and the present ANGLE FAVORS an 8-year-old Bobby in his dress suit, playing a recital.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA MOVES down to his hands...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... then to Catherine, profoundly moved.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INCLUDING BOTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Bobby plays the concluding chords of the etude. He lets his hands linger on the keys until the last overtones fade, then he removes them to his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a brief silence:
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was really very moved by the way you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Unable to keep up the "serious" musician pose, a brief, derisive laugh issues from him.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that funny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't have any.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had no inner feeling?

</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None.

</BOBBY>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I must have been supplying it.

She gets up and crosses toward the settee.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At being a fake.

</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
And as she picks up the flowers and the shopping bag:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Catherine...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
She goes out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby looks down at the keyboard. He closes the cover and softly utters:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CATHERINE'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stands in front of a dresser mirror, pinning up her hair, preparatory to taking a bath. Her attention is drawn to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Bobby entering, and as he crosses to her, she quickly turns back to the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think I'm a fake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's what you think.

</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it isn't what I think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
She moves away from him and he follows her.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(stops and turns to him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think that's accurate...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you... Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
She moves back to the dresser and as she begins searching through an array of bath oils on top of it, Bobby steps in beside her.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some bath oil?

He lifts up one of the bottles.

	<DIALOGUE>
	How about some jasmine?

(knocking the bottles over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing, screwing around with this crap?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
A little intimidated by his aggressivity:
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't find your language that charming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like you to leave now. Is that direct enough?

</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
He makes no move to go.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not a serious person, by your own admission. And that may be interesting, but it doesn't interest me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Needing the safety of distance, she moves over to the windows next to the bed. Again, he follows after her.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Serious, that's what's important to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, that's what's important to me...

He takes her by the shoulders...

<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, let's be serious...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
... and forces her onto the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, don't do that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
He hesitates for a moment, full of things he wants to say and cannot. Catherine looks up at him, uttering a quiet challenge:
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No inner feeling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.

</BOBBY>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe vou.

</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
He leans down to her, begins kissing her. Her arms encircle him and laying back on the bed, she pulls his body onto hers, fervently returning his kisses. And as he responds with an ardor absent of fakery and full of a lifetime of derelict feelings, a FADE OVER BEGINS, to:

INT. CATHERINE'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Catherine and Bobby lie side by side. He watches her as she addresses the ceiling:
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...

</CATHERINE>
<BOBBY>

Bobby and Catherine walk over a path through a thickly wooded area that presently brings them in sight of the Dupea house. He stops and, taking hold of her, leans back against a tree, kissing her. When they break off and resume walking, she takes one of his hands in both of hers and, after looking at the scars and callouses accumulated by his years of manual labor, she lays the hand against her cheek.

She goes on eating and there is a brief silence before she resumes, looking over at Catherine:

He throws his napkin on the table, gets up and leaves the room. There is an awkward silence, followed by Rayette valiantly covering her own feelings:

EXT. FERRY - MORNING

Bobby's car pulls off the ferry and approaches a line of cars waiting to board. He sees Catherine at the wheel of the first car, and pulling abreast of her, stops and rolls down his window.

a friend of Carl's. (Somewhere under the following, the ANGLE ALTERS to include TWO OTHER FRIENDS, as well as Carl, Catherine, Bobby and Rayette, seated around the living room, variously captive to her monologue.)
</DIRECTION>
<SAMIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the point is, man is born into the world with a pre-existent adversary, both real and imaginary, so you'd have to say that aggression was one of his primary, psychic inheritances, which...

JOHN FINCHER, a professorial type, attempts to interject:

<FINCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I may beg to differ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCHER>
<SAMIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beg all you like, John, but the fact remains that man takes enormous delight in aggressive acts, as well as the portrayal of aggressive acts, and to be triumphant over another no matter how, seems fundamental to his having a sense of well being, as well as...

Rayette interrupts, calling across the room to Carl:
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there a TV in the house?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
Carl starts to answer and is pre-empted by Samia:
</DIRECTION>
<SAMIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMIA>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's some good things on it, though.

</RAYETTE>
<SAMIA>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?

</SAMIA>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I wouldn't.

<DIRECTION>
and his reaction as Samia goes on:

She gets up and starts to move away.

She leaves the room, with Bobby's eyes following her, and as Carl moves over to sit beside Rayette, Samia resumes to Fincher while the other friend moves in beside Bobby and tries to engage him in conversation.

Samia gestures toward Rayette as if she were an example to prove her point.

Bobby looks over at Samia.

INT. SPICER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Tita and Spicer. Though both are clothed, they are caught in some stage of intimacy on top of Spicer's bed. Tita sits up immediately, mortally embarrassed, as Bobby steps into the room.

Bobby leaps at him and as their struggle carries them into the kitchen, Tita begins yelling:

Bobby rams Spicer into the refrigerator.

<TITA>

	Stop it! Right now! Just stop it!! Carl!!

And as she runs from the room, Spicer begins violently jerking his forearm up against Bobby's trachea, punctuating each jerk with the repeated command:

	Give up! Give up! Give up! Give up! Give up! Give up!

Catherine and Bobby sit on a low stone wall bordering the Dupea property. Each is staring out at the ocean, and after a moment:

	Just give me a chance, will you?

</BOBBY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, what would it come to? If a person has no love for himself, no respect, no love for his work, his family, his friends, something... How can he ask for love in return? I mean, why should he ask for it?

</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Profoundly wounded, he looks away from her.

</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Needing to distance herself from witnessing his pain, she gets up and moves OUT OF FRAME.
</DIRECTION>

His eyes move from her to look out over the bay and, after a brief silence, he softly utters:

He breaks off again, resuming with evident difficulty.

EXT. DUPEA HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby comes out the front door. He carries his suitcase and, as he descends the steps and moves across the drive...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Tita, wearing gloves and holding a pair of gardening clippers, comes around the side of the house and calls out to him:
</DIRECTION>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby!

</BOBBY>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>

<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

She puts her arms around him and as she embraces him:
</DIRECTION>
<TITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just once in a while, call and tell me where you are, please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<RAYETTE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch the birdie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
They turn to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rayette, standing near the open trunk of Bobby's car, taking a Polaroid shot of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby returns his attention to Tita, kissing her.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>

</BOBBY>
<TITA>
<DIRECTION>
(tearing up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bye, Robert.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITA>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up his suitcase and moves to the trunk, where Rayette is fussing with her camera. He puts the suitcase inside, closes the trunk and takes hold of her arm.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, let's go...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls free of him and, as she moves back toward Tita, Bobby can be seen getting into the driver's seat.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>

She moves back to the car and gets in.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Bobby's car moves over a highway through the northern forests, RAYETTE'S VOICE is heard SINGING:
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>

	"But don't love me/Then act as though we've never kissed/Oh, don't touch me..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>

She leans closer and kisses him, then bringing her lips close to his ear:

<RAYETTE>

</RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
He suddenly pushes her away.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut it out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Grievously hurt by his gesture and expressive of an anger she's heretofore been afraid to reveal:
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son of a bitch, Bobby! You quit pushin' me away like that! I've had enough a that to last me a lifetime!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
She makes a fist of her hand as though she were about to hit him, then changes her mind.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whyn't you just try an' be good to me for a change!?
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	There id'n anyone gonna look after you an' love you better'n I do, you know that.

<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby gets out of the car as the station attendant approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rayette turns back to him as she nears the front of the cafe.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</RAYETTE>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
The attendant moves to the pumps, and as Bobby crosses toward the men's room and disappears inside, a Peterbilt semi can be seen pulling into the station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GAS STATION - MEN'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby removes his jacket and lays it on top of the waste container. He moves to the wash basin and stands a moment, gazing absently down at it, his mind searching for that inward oblivion in which nothing much is demanded, nothing much felt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, leaning over and placing his hands on the rim of the basin...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... he lifts his gaze to the mirror and, after minutely perusing the features of his face, looks into his own eyes as he had into his fathers, silently beseeching them for guidance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MEN'S ROOM - GAS STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(SOUND OF SEMI'S MOTOR OVER:)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REMOTE ANGLE as Bobby comes out of the men's room. He has left his jacket inside and stands for a moment, looking at the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... DRIVER, bending down to check the undercarriage of the semi. As he stands up and circuits the front of the truck, heading for the cab:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(faintly audible)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, wait a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
He moves over to him and after a brief exchange, the driver nods his bead and continues on to the cab, Bobby moves to the passenger door and climbs up into the pass seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SEMI CAB - GAS STATION - DAY

The driver glances over at Bobby:
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>

EXT. SEMI - GAS STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REMOTE ANGLE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The semi pulls out of the station onto the highway, giving view to Bobby's car. The attendant is cleaning the windshield and Rayette can be seen opening the passenger door. As she gets out and surveys the area for some sign of Bobby, the semi MOVES INTO VIEW, going north on the highway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rayette looks over the hood of the car, addressing the attendant. He gestures toward the men's room and as she moves across the station and disappears OFF THE SCREEN...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... the semi recedes in the distance, leaving a black trail of smoke from its exhaust stack, dissipating in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
