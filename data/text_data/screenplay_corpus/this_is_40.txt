	You know, when I started this label, my dream was to work with musicians and bands whose music I just admired so much. The person that I thought, "My god, wouldn't it be incredible to work with" was Graham Parker. Tonight we have him. Solo. Because we couldn't afford to fly in The Rumour.

The crowd applauds as Graham Parker (60's) leaps on stage.

We watch Debbie. Although the music is great, it's a little depressing and not working on her. She quickly gets bored.

"Oh, she's the one sitting in that scooter eating a soft cracker." Kids don't want to have old parents. You know, it would also be nice for us to spend some time apart. Kind of rediscover who we are individually. It would be so great to not see you for like a chunk of time so that I could really just miss you. Remember when we used to miss each other?
