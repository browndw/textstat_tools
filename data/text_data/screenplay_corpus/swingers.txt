The pool of golden light disintegrates into the thousands of points which constitute it as we rapidly draw closer to the city.

We are just above the tops of the highest buildings as we approach Hollywood Boulevard. Below is neon and the icy thrust of search lights rotating on the corner of Hollywood and Vine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We continue west, then quickly north.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is the momentary appearance of the moonlit HOLLYWOOD sign as we pass the blinking red beacon of the Capital Records building and drop into Franklin avenue and over the 101.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Architectural remnants of Hollywood's past whip up. We are heading east at treetop level. A warm glow in the distance quickly grows into a modest commercial strip which includes cafes, bookstores, and a theater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We drop to eye level as we spy through the plate glass showcase window of the "Bourgeois Pig" coffeehouse, which holds the translucent reflection of the full moon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cigarette wedged between knuckles smoulders. MIKE takes the last drag with great effort, then crushes it out. He sits in the window sprawled across a red velvet couch that once perfectly complemented a faux spanish foyer.

</MIKE>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I don't call either way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's the difference?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MIKE>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It sucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right...or more likely the opposite.

</ROB>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right... Wait, what do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call - whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unless she comes back first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ROB>

	Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.

Mike is dressed to the nines in classic vintage threads. He's trying to look at ease as he straightens his cuff links. He approaches Trent who suavely leans against his worn down ride.

</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, I guess I'll start with three hundred in, uh, blacks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Mike tries to hand the DEALER a handful of twenties after counting them twice.
</DIRECTION>
<DEALER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On the table.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEALER>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DEALER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to lay it on the table.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEALER>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
The other players grow impatient.
</DIRECTION>
<DEALER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEALER>
<MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(hastily laying down the bills)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
The dealer lays out the bills such that the amount is visible to the camera encased in the black glass globe overhead. Trent and Mike look up at it open-mouthed like turkeys in the rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DEALER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blacks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEALER>
<DIRECTION>
Mike's attention is recaptured by the dealer, but Trent continues trying to peer through the smoked glass.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DEALER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want this in black chips.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEALER>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, that'll be fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
The dealer chirps out an unintelligible formality and the PIT BOSS chirps the response. Trent's focus whips away from the camera as both he and Mike stare at the pit boss ten feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dealer plunks down the measly THREE CHIPS which represent Mike's entire cash reserve. Not quite the effect he had hoped for.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The swingers stare at the chips. The players stare at the swingers. The dealer stares at the pit boss.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have anything smaller?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DEALER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEALER>
<DIRECTION>
The dealer indicates a FIVE-DOLLAR TABLE across the room where an Hispanic woman deals to a BLUEHAIR, a BIKER, and a COUPLE in matching Siegfried and Roy T-shirts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The swingers look back to the dealer who is now flanked by the pit boss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tense silence is broken by...
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drinks?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then to Trent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about you, Cap'n?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
Trent looks over to see that it's the same WAITRESS who flashed him a smile earlier. At first he begins to smile, then, remembering that he is locked in a high stakes battle of wills, subtly shakes her off. She smirks and starts to leave until she is interrupted by Mike holding up a finger. It's a balsy move, but everyone's watching. The kid's going for broke.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the waitress, but never

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have a vodka martini, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry.

<DIRECTION>
Smooth. Trent is impressed, but masks his pride.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
(under her breath cynically as she writes it down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One "James Bond".
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
Ow. She exits.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(regaining composure)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Blacks will be fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Mike throws a chip in the circle. Trent is shocked. That's a hundred bucks. Mike and Trent share a look. The dealer and the pit boss exchange glances. Bets are all down and the cards are meticulously dealt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dealer has a two showing. Mike has been dealt a five and a six- eleven.
</DIRECTION>
<TRENT>
<DIRECTION>
(hushed tones)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Double down.

<MIKE>

</MIKE>
<TRENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRENT>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<TRENT>

	If we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well...

</TRENT>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone's waiting for them.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
The dealer, the pit boss, and all the players look on as Mike drops ANOTHER BLACK CHIP in the circle with a barely audible, yet deafening, thud.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(with all the nonchalance he can muster)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Double down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
A bead of sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sharp snap of a dealt card.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a seven. Eighteen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Disappointment twists their faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally the dealer flips over his card.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a king! Twelve. Here comes the bust...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flick - four. Sixteen! Here comes the bust...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flick - five. Twenty one. Groans all around, except for the swingers who watch their chips slide away in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike breaks the spell with a plucky smile from the pit of his stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the pit boss)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure could use some dinner about now.

Trent and Mike are wedged between the BLUEHAIR and the BIKER At the FIVE DOLLAR TABLE. They share a pile of red chips.

In the meantime, the Bluehair has been dealt an eleven. This captures the swinger's attention.

<DIRECTION>
Four. Fifteen all together.

Polite applause from around the table which the Bluehair humbly waves off. Mike looks at Trent. Daggers. Trent shrugs.

A different PIT BOSS approaches.

Christy is at the bar wearing acid-washed jeans with a matching denim top. She's sexy in a pathetic mid-eighties sort of way. She's sitting next to a pretty brunette, LISA, dressed in a similar fashion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is something bizarre about her appearance. Her hair is tied into long pig-tails with powder blue ribbons. Her makeup job is almost theatrical, with bright pink/red lips. She can't be that out of it, or can she?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girls have already been flanked by a herd of potential COURTIERS.

The SWINGERS saunter up to the girls in a smooth, SLOW-MOTION SHOT.

The courtiers sense their rejection and part like the Red Sea for the swingers in perfect slow-motion choreography.

Sue brushes back a shock of straight, greasy, dirty blonde hair as not to obscure his view of the screen. His face glows with the reflection of the SEGA HOCKEY game on the set.

Mike crosses back to the swingers' table and, using his body to shield Nikki's view, pretends to rip the napkin. This breaks the guys up.

<DIRECTION>
That's it. Now they're squaring off in the empty parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the bald guy's boys fall in behind him. All the swingers fall in behind Sue. The swingers are not happy with Sue at all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two cliques contrast each other in every way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bald guys all have facial hair and multiple pierced extremities with the odd neck-tattoo thrown in for good measure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Baggy denim and boots. Pot leaves and Pumas. Long, heavy key chains. Vintage 1994 whiteboy faux-gansta. They do, however, look big and mean next to our boys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The early sixties style sweater jackets and blazers over button down shirts and tapered slacks don't quite have the same fear factor, but the boys do look classy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The word "bitch" is growled out by the two of them a half dozen more times until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sue pulls a PISTOL out of his belt.

	Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.

<DIRECTION>
The couple's dance is cut short as there were only a few bars left of the slow ballad. Mike smiles politely in relief and begins to lead Lorraine off the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls him back. He's not getting off that easy. She wants a whole song. He politely holds her, poised for another slow number. They're alone on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Much to Mike's dismay, the song begins with a DRIVING TOM TOM SOLO. This cues every hep cat in the Derby that the big one's coming. They all flood the floor for the last dance of the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike pleadingly shakes his head at Lorraine. It's too fast. Her eyes narrow as her grip tightens. No sympathy here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The band breaks into the full-tilt swing number and the dance floor writhes around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stand motionless for what seems like an eternity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gut check. Fuck it. Sink or swim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike grabs her like a man grabs a woman. It's just a simple six-count swing step, but they're in perfect harmony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike and Lorraine look into each others eyes. It's on, baby.
</DIRECTION>

As Mike's courage grows, the moves start to flow. A spin at first. Then a double twirl. It's not long before he's throwing her through combinations that stand out even among the pros.

The set ends with a flourishing crescendo. They're frozen in a final dip, panting through a glaze of clean sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike and Lorraine smile and look into each other's eyes. The smile slowly disappears. Will they kiss?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Really close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lips almost touching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike tries to muster-up the courage, but it's been so long.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can't do it. He lets her up.

	Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...
