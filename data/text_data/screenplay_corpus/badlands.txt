	My mother died of pneumonia when I was just a kid. My father had kept their wedding cake in the freezer for ten whole years. After the funeral he gave it to the yardman... He tried to act cheerful, but he could never be consoled by the little stranger he found in his house. Then, one day, hoping to begin a new life away from the scene of all his memories, he moved us from Texas to Ft. Dupree, South Dakota.

SERIES OF ANGLES - TREEHOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holly is off somewhere in the forest. putting on lipstick. Kit sits on watch in the crowls nest, a pair of binoculars close at hand. On sound, over the music, we hear voices whispering to them. Kit sees a movement in the brush. A moment later a figure appears, a hunter, carrying a gun. Kit shouts a code word to Holly. She takes off running, as Kit clambers down the planks of the treehouse and collects his shotgun. He tells her to hide, runs through the woods and dives in a hole, under a cover of leaves. She jumps behind a log. Several shots of the still forest follow, then the hunters appear, a shoulder here. pant leg there. The music ends as one of them cocks his gun. They pass right over the hole where Kit is hiding. Kit rises up slowly, gives them a gentlemanly word of warning, then shoots all three in the back. He checks to see if anybody else is with them, then calls weakly out to Holly.

<DIRECTION>
HOLLY (v.o.)Kit felt bad about shooting those men in the backs. but he said they'd come in like that. and they would've played it as down and dirty as they could, and besides, held overheard them whispering about how they were only interested in the reward money. With lawmen it wouldtve been different. They were out there to get a job done and they deserved a fair chance. But not a bounty hunter.

	Kit knew the end was coming. He wondered if he'd hear the doctor pronounce him dead, or if he'd be able to read what the papers would say about him,the next day, from the other side. He dreaded the iea of being shot down alone, he said, without a girl to scream out his name.

</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to.

</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Kit looks at her. surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>

<HOLLY>

</HOLLY>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<DIRECTION>
She shrugs. He stares at her for a moment, then bows his head and walks off a distance.
</DIRECTION>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is wrong with you, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<DIRECTION>
He kicks wildly at dust.
</DIRECTION>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is the matter with you, huh!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, the helicopter continues its approach. Kit walks in closer to Holly.
</DIRECTION>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, I don't know what to make of you. People like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<DIRECTION>
He kicks at the rigs then turns back to face her.
</DIRECTION>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want a second chance, then listen. Twelve noon the Grand Coulee Dam, New Year'ss Day. 1964. You meet me there... Now you got that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<DIRECTION>
She nods, bewildered. The helicopter is landing. He grabs a discarded fender off the truck, hangs it over his arm like a shield and runs to the Cadillac, exchanging shots with a State Trooper who has arrived in the helicopter. The Trooper is hit and falls. Kit jumps in the car and roars off. Holly surrenders herself to the pilot of the helicopter and is taken off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GAS STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kit pulls into a gas station. He gets out of his car and drums on the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, anybody here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<DIRECTION>
An ATTENDANT walks out the door.

<KIT>

</ATTENDANT>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn. I pissed all mine away shooting up bottles... You want to fill her up for me? Please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<DIRECTION>
The Attendant nods. Kit pulls Holly's suitcase out of the back seat and walks over to a trash can at the edge of the apron. Kit throws Holly's things methodically into the trash can. After a while he comes upon a book. He opens the book and looks through it, then turns to find the Attendant staring at him. As he gets to his feet. he nods at the trash can.
</DIRECTION>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you want any of that junk, it's yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, a police car approaches the station. Kit sees it at about the same time the police see him. He throws his book in the car and roars out of the station. The police car goes into a bootlegger's turn and takes off after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHASE - SERIES OF ANGLES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kit heads down the highway. After a while he turns off onto a dirt road. The police keep up with him.. He flips on the radio and fires back at them. The dust is so heavy that they have a hard time just keeping track of him. He checks his own appearance and general demeanor in the rear view mirror, then swerves off the road onto the prairie. The police manage to keep up. Together they roar through a herd of cows and barb wire fence. The police car slams into Kit, trying to slow him down. Kit slams back into the police car. They return to the road. Kit makes a ninety- degree turn but the police car loses traction and rolls onto its side, then back onto four wheels again, stalled. Kit sees that he has lost them. He checks himself out in the mirror again, puts on the rich man's hat and skids to a stop. The police car gets back underway. During these last few moments Holly is heard on VOICE OVER.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(v.o.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Often I've wondered what was going through Kit's head before they got him and why he didn't make a run for it while he still had the chance. Did he figure theyld just catch up with him the next day? Was it despair? He claimed to having a flat tire, but the way he carried on about it, I suspect this is false.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kit shoots a hole in the tire of the Cadillac, then climbs up on the hood. We see how far behind the police are. He checks his pulse and jumps back down. He scurries around collecting rocks from the shoulder as the police approach from the distance. He makes a stack of the rocks to mark the site of his capture for posterity, finishing just as the police car skids to a stop. Kit throws up his hands and walks forward to meet them. Their guns are drawn.

The Sheriff sticks his pistol in Kit's ear and leads him off toward the police car.

The plane that will take them back to South Dakota, a B-25, comes in for a landing. The mass of Troopers and National Guardsmen, with Kit and Holly, walks out to meet it. A jeep leads it down the taxiway. A civilian bystander points Kit and Holly out to a young boy he holds in his arms.

EXT. RUNWAY - SERIES OF ANGLES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The props start turning. The crowd waves goodbye as the boarding door is closed. The wheels turn toward the sun. The Guardsmen race back to their trucks. A mailman carries off the mail bags he collected from the plane. The plane taxies down the runway and lifts into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>

(v.o.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kit and I were taken back to South Dakota. They kept him in solitary, so he didn't have a chance to get acquainted with the other inmates, though he was sure they'd like him, especially the murderers. Myself, I got off with probation and a lot of nasty looks. Later I married the son of the lawyer who defended me.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Think they'll take that into consideration?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
