Continuing to a CLOSE UP of the headline of a sensation- alist tabloid -- "WOMAN KILLS PLASTIC SURGEON THEN SELF, TOLD FRIENDS; I CAN'T BLINK WITHOUT PAIN."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The picture of a bug-eyed society woman is below the caption. A hand comes out from behind the paper, reaching for a bottle of scotch on the table. The bottle disappears behind the paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANNE, the owner of the store, enters abruptly -- closing the office door behind her, a cigarette dangling for her mouth. Her desk is organized litter -- her walls are filled with porno tapes. She searches for one as she talks:
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These people are insane today. They took insane pills...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
A bit about Anne as she searches for a video: Anne is in her mid-to-late thirties... and she is all woman! She has a raw, earthy, unmistakable sensuality. Her red lipstick matches her red nail polish like a hat and glove set. Inlaid on each nail is a rhinestone design of a little star. Her angora sweaters are tight and clinging, giving her breasts a decided lift and perkiness. Her backless pumps slap the ground. A half-smoked cigarette hangs out of her mouth with great expertise -- a skill Anne obviously picked up in a high school bathroom. Her voice is thick with a delicious Brooklyn twang.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is pure streetwise in attitude, philosophy and emotions. She turns and speaks to the man behind the tabloid.

The man lowers the newspaper: it is Jack Lucas: no longer the aggressive radio star but more -- a man who looks like he hasn't slept in months. An intolerant, paranoid, self-pitying misanthrope. The outrageous articles fascinate him. Anne removes the paper and scotch bottle.

JACK grins his teeth and stares like a madman while ANNE, aware of the affect this phrase has on him, throws a worried look from the cash register. The FRUMPY SECRETARY laughs:

A wet Jack stops to watch the goings on at the entrance. He sees a limousine at the Plaza -- parked and awaiting its occupants. A handsome man in his forties exits the hotel and walks toward the limo. He is holding the hand of his six year old SON, who is carrying a two foot high plastic, smiling Pinnochio doll. Both father and son are dressed in ties and jackets. Jack watches in envy. His ripped, wet clothes a shabby reflection of the man's. He eyes the limo with longing. As the man tips the doorman, a BUM approaches and asks for money. When the man refuses and turns his back to enter the limp, the Bum becomes aggressive and starts pulling at the man's jacket and yells:
</DIRECTION>
<BUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merry fucking Christmas... Happy fucking New Year!!
	</DIALOGUE>

He continues to harass the man, who pushes his son away. The doorman comes to the man's rescue. As they both try to pull the Bum off the man, the six year old son notices Jack and walks calmly over.

Jack, mesmerized by the scene, doesn't notice the Boy.

Jack looks down. The Boy stands directly before him. Jack sort of smiles. The Boy extends his arms and offers the Pinnochio doll to Jack. Jack is confused but the Boy simply deposits the doll into his arms and walks back to the limo. By that time, the Bum is being held by the doorman, and both father and son enter the limo.

Jack holds the doll. He is surrounded by street people asleep or drunk on the sidewalk near the hotel. He angrily realizes there's not much difference between him and them.

Jack stands prepared to surrender his fate and make the final leap. He stares at the river, almost smiling. He has made his decision. He is calm and serene. He raises his foot over the railing.

Two white upperclass JUEVENILE DELINQUENTS -- one wearing a leather jacket, the other a high school windbreaker -- get out of the car. Each is carrying a gallon of gasoline. Leather also carries a bat. Jack is drunk but he is immediately aware of the danger when he spots the gasoline cans.

<WINDBREAKER>

	AHHH!

</WINDBREAKER>
<DIRECTION>
A FIGURE stands backlit - mysterious and powerful, noble and fearless. JACK, LEATHER and WINDBREAKER instinctually bond together in the face of this fourth unknown entity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure turns out to be a BUM. Grimy face, tattered layers of clothing beneath a long over coat, a pork pie hat with a twig sticking out of it like a plume in a helmet of yore. Over his shoulder, a homemade bow and arrow set. Although clearly downtrodden, behind his beaten appearance, there radiates a calm intelligence and strength. There is something distinctly attractive and confident about him. We learn later his name is PARRY; a combination of Don Quixote and Harpo Marx. PARRY stands before them absolutely delighted with himself - hand on hip - beaming with pride..

WINDBREAKER grabs PARRY, pinning his arms behind him. WINDBREAKER laughs. PARRY just turns his head and stares into his eyes, causing WINDBREAKER to feel weird.

</PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
PARRY glances over LEATHER's shoulder. LEATHER TURNS to see: A BUM pushing a shopping cart comes out of the darkness. HE is mumbling to himself incoherently. Another BUM, appears from the dark, unnerving WINDBREAKER. PARRY looks to a third BUM, stepping out of the dark, menacingly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taken by themselves, the BUMS would look harmless and pathetic. But in the context of their uncharacteristic organization - THEY appear frightening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LEATHER and WINDBREAKER automatically whip out switchblades and take a "rumble" stance - as if protecting their catch, Jack. Jack sort of sides with them if for no other reason than - he's known them longer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LEATHER tries to remain confident. HE laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<LEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!

PARRY takes a few steps back and raises his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK stands close to LEATHER and WINDBREAKER, who prepare themselves for attack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARRY lowers his hand which acts as a signal for the BUMS. The BUMS reach into their coats and each pull out a FLASHLIGHT, which they shine at each other as THEY SING:
</DIRECTION>
<THREE_BUMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like New York in June...How about you? I like a Gershwin tune...How about you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREE_BUMS>
<DIRECTION>
JACK, LEATHER and WINDBREAKER are at a loss. The BUMS aren't getting all the words, but they're definitely in sync.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARRY lowers his hand proudly. The BUMS keep singing and turn their flashlights upon JACK, LEATHER and WINDBREAKER - blinding them to PARRY.
</DIRECTION>
<WINDBREAKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINDBREAKER>
<DIRECTION>
LEATHER brandishes his knife towards the dark spot where he thinks PARRY stands. But PARRY takes a flying step back. As he speaks, the Bums stop singing and hum the song.
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son...There comes a time in every man's life...and you will learn this, if and when you become men...

From his hat, PARRY pulls a long tube sock tied at the end and filled with a softball at the bottom...
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	....That there are only three things in this world ya need...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>

HE begins to swing the sock over his head - centrifugally gaining force.
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Respect for all kinds of life, ....the love of one other person who you can trust and pork on a regular basis ...and a nice navy blazer...Oh, and one more thing....always... keep your eye.... on the ball!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
PARRY releases the "weapon".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sock flies out of the darkness and, with amazing accuracy - beans LEATHER on the forehead between his eyes. HE drops his knife to rub his head. HE sinks out of camera:
</DIRECTION>
<LEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ow...Ow....OW!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
WINDBREAKER grows worried as PARRY reaches in to the lining of his coat, pulls out another "sock weapon" and starts swinging.
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	However, the ability to bean a shithead can be a fabulous advantage.

Jack and Parry sit facing the three Bums from the previous scene - A Black, A middle-aged Irishman and an Ex-Hippy - and the Pinnochio Doll. The Foursome sit against the giant base of the bridge discussing the issues of the day as they pass a bottle. OTHER BUM CLIQUES are scattered throughout the lot.

<DIRECTION>
The IRISHMAN absent mindedly flicks his cigarette ashes onto JACK'S SLEEVE, which is soaked with gasoline. The SLEEVE IGNITES JACK panics - waving his is arm, trying to get it out. PARRY is both amazed and impressed - seeing it as a sign. The bums talk casually as JACK tries to rip off his coat.

With the fire out, JACK tries to leave, saying:

This worries Jack. PARRY retrieves him and brings him back to the group.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The IRISHMAN removes the bottle from his saliva soaked mouth and hands it to JACK, who is disgusted:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no that's all-
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<BLACK>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
JACK feels sick as the cheap liquor running through him. IRISHMAN begins reciting a Chaucer passage in old English. The BLACK stares off, half listening. PARRY turns to JACK, his face beaming, he clasps his hands and says:
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Et in arcadia ego.

</PARRY>
<HIPPY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man...Why did God invent mediocrity?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HIPPY>
<DIRECTION>
This remark acts like a slap in the face to JACK. The others consider it in silence - not really knowing what it means. The cheap liquor begins to take it's effect and from JACK'S POV, WE FADE OUT OF THE SCENE ON THE NEXT LINES - AS HE CLOSE HIS EYES AND SLIPS INTO A DRUNKEN SLUMBER.

:SC: INT. PARRY'S BASEMENT HIDEAWAY - MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK is asleep on a mattress beside a boiler spewing steam. HE is slowly awakened by water dripping on his cheek - - - the first dull pangs of a mean hangover making itself known.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE opens his eyes, confused -- not knowing exactly what happened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GIANT FACE OF PARRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lying parallel beside him -- like a kid waiting for his parents to wake up Xmas morning.
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(loud and cheery)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you feeling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Jarred, Jack nods suspiciously. He notices the surroundings --
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have I died?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(friendly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...

</PARRY>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(his head throbbing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're going to murder me, that's fine... just don't laugh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to focus his eyes and looks around the room: there is an extremely organized "living area" -- a make- shift kitchen with hot plate, a nail in a wall with clothes on hangers... There is also a dumpster sitting beneath a garbage chute -- The dumpster has planets and stars painted on its side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks to the far wall and sees a handmade collage mural: pictures cut out and pasted in a haphazard manner, all medieval in origin; grassy landscape with castles, knights and maidens on horses, crests and symbols of the Crusades, and various renditions of the Holy Grail... One maiden stands out from the rest -- a frail looking doe-like creature.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the adjacent wall, however, there are no pictures. Only frantic scribblings in red marker... Out of the scribblings we can see: an evil looking face with a bear amateurishly drawn... a large red horse drawn as if it hurt to get out the image... the style is violent and erratic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks to the other wall and finds Parry's arsenal -- homemade "weapons" that also look medieval, like lances made from mop sticks, nets made of knotted rope, slingshots and a shield made from a garbage can cover with a rose painted on it. Against each wall are piled, what seems to be hundreds of books. Jack doesn't know what to make of all this. He is frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where am I?

</JACK>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry? Breakfast? A fruit pie perhaps?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shut up!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up a can of wintergreen air freshener and starts spraying, with violent strokes, to shut "them" up... Jack gets more nauseous from the smell... Parry yells to the air:
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I've got a right to say something. I mean, you're tying my hands here!

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They say you're not ready to know.

Jack makes a move to stand when Parry stops spraying and yells:
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hheeyy!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Jack sits back down. Parry whispers to the air:
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... You're frightening him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Parry kneels before him. Jack presses against the boiler.
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>

(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Do you know who I am?

(shouts to the air)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him guess!! Tch.

He goes for the air freshener but Jack's reply stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...

Jack's face drops. Parry gets comfortable and explains casually:
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... They came to me about a year ago. I was sitting on the john having one of the most satisfying bowel movements -- you know the ones -- where you just see God... And I saw them... just floating around... hundreds of these... cute little fat people... And they spoke. They said "I" was chosen to help them get back something very important they lost. But my part might be very dangerous. I said "Whoah".... slow down... ya start hearing voices from floating little fat people that tell you you're on a mission for God and you wind up in a mini-series. Then they said "Look in Architecture Today, Feb '88... page 33..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Parry quickly crosses to a pile of magazines, grabs one and dives back to Jack, who keeps scanning for his shoes. Parry leafs through the magazine and opens to page 33.
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And there it was... plain as day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He shows Jack a feature about Langdon Carmichael, a Malcolm Forbes type real estate baron. The five page pictorial depicts his ten million dollar restoration of an old N.Y. Armory into a palatial city home. Caption reads: "REAL ESTATE BILLIONAIRE LANGDON CARMICHAEL'S TOWER OF POWER"...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Langdon Carmichael?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>

Carmichael himself -- a dashing bachelor around fifty- five -- is shown standing in his private library beside a glass commode. Parry points to inside the commode, where a golden chalice is displayed.
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the Grail... The Holy Grail.

</PARRY>

He indicates the pictures on the collage. Jack's losing it.

	The Holy Grail? Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?

</JACK>
<PARRY>

	But I don't think God made man in his own image. No. 'Cause most of... the bullshit that happens, is because of men. No, I think man was made out of the devil's image and women were created out of God -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women are attracted to men, because, lets face it, the devil is a helluva lot more interesting -- I slept with a few saints and let me tell you... Booooorring!!!... And so the whole point of life, I think, is for men and women to get married so the devil and God can live together and, ya know -- work it out...

Anne grabs his face with both hands and pulls him into a kiss. She proceeds to climb onto his body as she utilizes a skill she picked up in high school make-out parties. She is a pro.

Jack is alone in the basement. He slowly walks around the room -- picking up little items here and there, as if trying to discover some clue to Parry. He scans the titles of the piles of books. All of them have something to do with medieval history or literature, myths, or the Crusades... He picks up one of the books and opens it... Page after page has been ripped out anywhere there might have been a picture or a diagram. He comes upon a large scroll that he unravels. It is a map, drawn by Parry, of Langdon Carmichael's house and the surrounding blocks... He rolls it up... The Pinnochio doll sits on a broken chair facing the wall with the nightmarish scribblings... acting like a sentinel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses to the prominent picture of the maiden with the long hair. He notices a small stand before the picture, with a candle. It is like a shrine with offerings: a flower, a small perfume sampler, a box of Jawbreakers candy and a dime store romance novel. Jack doesn't understand.

PARRY breaks away from him. HE falls back onto the ground. THE SCREAM STOPS and is replaced by an eerie SILENCE. As if sound were ripped out of space. JACK speaks but no sound comes out...We are in PARRY'S world for this brief moment...JACK leans over to help PARRY, but the latter inches away...fearful of the vision he sees: something out of sight, looming over JACK, breathing FIERY SMOKE...JACK tries to raise PARRY off the ground and, in doing so, the vision for PARRY comes into full view:

A door opens. Lydia enters with a bag of groceries she picked up on the way. She turns on the light to reveal an extremely neat, albiet modest, one bedroom apartment. She carries the grocery bag into the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of the bag, she removes a Lean Cuisine, a giant bottle of cream soda and four giant bars of Chunky chocolate. She pops the Lean Cuisine into the oven and walks back into the living room to an old stereo. She turns the TURNTABLE on -- a record already set upon it. She stands by her coffee table, as if taking position:

Suddenly, we hear ETHEL MERMAN -- as Lydia lip-syncs every word with complete commitment -- giving a full out performance.

Her attempts at hand gestures and choreography are awkward -- bunking into the coffee table, banging her hand against a lamp -- but, we see a part of Lydia that few (actually no one) sees. Her abandon, her joy... her smile. From upstairs, neighbors BANG for her to keep the music down. Lydia casually crosses to the stereo, turns off the turntable and heads back to the kitchen -- as if the neighbors interference were all apart of her nightly ritual.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Jack listens intently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail. Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him. He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, "What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?"...And the King says, "I need a sip of water to cool my throat"...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, "How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find"? And the fool answers, "I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty."... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool.

THE GAY BUM strolls nonchalantly into the office and down the aisle relishing in the amazed expressions of the employees. HE approaches a cubicle on which he reads a small name plate - LYDIA SINCLAIR. LYDIA has her back to him, but slowly turns as she feels someone watching her. SHE lets out a tiny scream when she sees him standing there like a deranged clown. The GAY BUM take notice of her outfit - a cordoroy, forest green jumper with a lime green turtleneck -
</DIRECTION>
<GAY_BUM>

	You MUST be SHE.

	Huh?

</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
THE GAY BUM begins to sing a SONG PARODY to the tune of a classical musical number. (Song to be chosen). After a big finish, the GAY BUM hands LYDIA a business card, drops the act and exits:

JACK PARRY; his hair slicked back, wearing a Video Spot T-shirt over his clothes. Jack hangs a car pine freshner around PARRY's neck to help with the smell...The bell on front door jingles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LYDIA cautiously enters the store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the counter, JACK spots her immediately and nudges ANNE. SHE turns to look, her bra straps are visible. JACK fixes them.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello....congratulations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....

</JACK>
<LYDIA>

	Parry Parry?

</LYDIA>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No just Parry.

</PARRY>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...like Moses.

</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
No one knows how to respond to this, so they don't.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; curt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how do we do this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well..um...you get an official membership card...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(takes one out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry? You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...

Parry stands staring at her.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Parry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Parry snaps out of it and crosses from behind the counter to the laminating machine next to Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(defensive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But now it's free, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Anne backs off. She stands next to an equally perplexed Jack as they watch Lydia fill out the card. Her abrasive demeanor is not what they expected. Lydia finishes the card and pushes it toward them.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Free?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. They're free.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(butts in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only the first ten. After that they're 2.99 a rental.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia eyes Anne suspiciously, then turns to survey the shelves. Parry picks up her card and laminates it -- all the while, keeping his eyes fixed upon Lydia's every move. Anne and Jack, having set the trap, watch with interest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia surveys the film boxes, H-L. She spots one of interest and pulls it off the shelf -- causing two other boxes to fall down on her. She catches one box and, as she replaces it back on the shelf, causes three more to fall. She catches two of the three.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parry, Anne and Jack watching with an odd fascination. Jack nudges Parry to forget the laminating and go help her. Parry gathers up his nerve and moves from around the counter, up behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Can... can I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia quickly turns -- she is uncomfortable by his closeness.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No... I can look myself...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
She moves away abruptly -- like a fox terrier who pretends to ignore the mess she made on the living room rug.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parry turns to Jack and Anne, as if to say "what do I do now?" Jack encourages him to keep trying. Parry organizes the boxes and picks one out.
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about the "Hell Merchants"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<LYDIA>

<PARRY>

	How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery. In subtitles.

</PARRY>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I like musicals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(encouraged)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we have plenty of those. Right over here. We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got any Ethel Merman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't see any. He looks to Anne, who shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<LYDIA>

Jack nudges Anne to do something.

<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.

	Well, I guess I'll come back then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's your card.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia walks back to the counter. As Jack hands her the card, she notices Anne's painted star fingernails.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like your nails. Where did you get them done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah... I do them myself. I used to work in a beauty parlor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia keeps staring at them. She says blankly;
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like the stars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Jack gets an idea.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Anne is surprised to hear
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	this. ... If you want, she could do your nails.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, since you're a member, we could...

</JACK>
<ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia considers the offer. Parry waits for the outcome.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tonight! How's tonight?

Jack searches frantically through a closet. Anne and Parry sit opposite each other at the table. Parry is eating Anne's homecooking voraciously. Anne doesn't quite know how to take Parry, who smiles mischieviously through his meal.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jack O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and him... She didn't even look at him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got any more bread crust?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
As Anne resentfully rises and crosses into the kitchen, Parry focuses on her robust breasts bouncing beneath the sweater. Anne's expression, as she serves him, is a mixture of repulsion and fascination... She sits at the table.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll make it very casual... not like a date or anything. I just have to find something he'll look good in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Anne looks at Parry as if this were an impossibility. Parry smiles back -- he likes Anne.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He just needs some clothes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got any more starchy food?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Another opportunity to watch Anne's breasts in action, as she reluctantly rises to get him more macaroni. She returns with the pot.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous. It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
	</DIALOGUE>

	This food's delicious. You're a wonderful cook. And you have a lovely home.

<PARRY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your welcome. You know, a beautiful woman like yourself -- your own business -- I'm surprised some guy doesn't snatch you up for his own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>

Anne looks in Jack's direction, but replies to Parry:
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're surprised!... But I guess I just never met the right guy. Whatta gonna do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm shocked. With a child bearing body like yours...

Parry, getting overly heated, slams down his fork. Anne jumps.

Anne, in spite of herself, agrees with him. She looks to Jack to see if he agrees, but Jack is too busy inspecting Parry.

PARRY molds his hair into a cone, then divides into two cones, then mushes it into a pompadour, then splits the pompadour - PARRY is having a wonderful time - applying enormous amounts to his head and eyebrows....Finally, JACK grabs the can out of PARRY'S hand.

	I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.

<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.

JACK adjusts PARRY'S tie, then undoes it and re-ties. PARRY takes wallet, keeping his eyes on JACK, as JACK primps him.

<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...You're a nice man, Jack. Doing all this for me...

JACK doesn't pay attention as PARRY'S expression grows pale and frightened. HE suddenly raps his arms around JACK and whispers;
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>

	I'm scared Jack.

JACK, uncomfortable at the intimacy, tries to comfort him.

<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's hard being a woman. I don't care what anybody says...People say we have choices - we have no choices...My grandma used to say that, for a woman in this world, behind every door there's either death...or husband.

LYDIA cracks up laughing.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh hi? How's it going?

Lydia loses her smile and becomes self-conscious and protective.

<JACK>

</JACK>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

JACK turns to find that PARRY is still outside the apartment. HE crosses to PARRY. The two whisper intensely....

PARRY stands in b.g. with JACK, whispering....

	No really..I can't.

</LYDIA>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.

LYDIA smiles as PARRY and JACK reach an agreement. All four turn to each other spontaneously and say:

PARRY and LYDIA walk and talk. ANNE and JACK walk behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It sounds exciting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
As Parry talks, he picks up a piece of garbage on the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you're calculating costs that could have an affect on whether or not the book is published and if it is, it could be a book that... ....might somehow change the way people think or act - a book can do that. And you would be a part of creating a cultural shift that could change our society forever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Parry drops the garbage in a garbage can and is almost about to browse through it when:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Parry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Parry is alerted by Jack that this would be inappropriate. However, he does take a wire champagne cork wrapper, indiscreetly.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Parry seems to be fashioning something out of the wire.
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Romance is romance no matter what kind it is...It could be a Victorian lady kidnapped by a viral sea captain with a hairy chest...or a horny pizza boy seduced by a housewife with a hairy upper lip. As long as there's heart, passion, and little bit of fantasy...romance is the stuff of dreams...there's always more to trash than meets the eye...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
With this, Parry shows her his creation - a little wire chair made from the champagne wire. Lydia is impressed. Their eyes meet for a dangerous moment, until:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LARGE MAN walks by, bumping into LYDIA without apology and knocking Parry's gift to the ground....
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
The LARGE MAN continues walking as PARRY reaches to his back pocket to pull out his SLINGSHOT when:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PARRY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
PARRY begrudgingly lets him go.

<MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Parry!...Parry - is that you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Parry spots a familiar homeless face, sitting on the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Martin...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you look all duded up!

</MARTIN>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Lydia!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice to meet you Lydia! Got a quarter?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
PARRY smiles proudly. A mortified LYDIA reachs in her purse and hands Martin a quarter...Anne and Jack watch in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. God bless...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Parry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice girl...Have you set the date yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia hurries away. Parry follows....The walk continues:
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lydia You lived on Sutton Place?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep! Right on it!

<ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(tries to save it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
They nod. After a beat, Lydia asks:
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you do - for a living I mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
JACK smacks his own forehead, exasperated. ANNE gives up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANNE and LYDIA sit opposite JACK and PARRY. THEY are served three large orders of dumplings.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh..I could eat all of these
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
LYDIA is nervous about this. As everyone begins to eat, SHE eyes her chopsticks with reluctance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARRY looks at her and smiles encouragingly. LYDIA forces a smile back, picks up her chopsticks and dives in. PARRY watches her in adoration. JACK subtly tries to get PARRY to stop staring. But PARRY is glued to his vision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LYDIA, even more awkward now with her new nails, drops her first dumpling into her lap.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh..god...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
To save her from embarassment, PARRY drops his dumpling into his lap as well.
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh boy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
LYDIA takes her napkin and dips it into a glass of water. PARRY follows suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When LYDIA removes the napkin, her glass falls over. PARRY forces his glass over, as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANNE and JACK are looking at this mirror exercise in fascination.
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(to LYDIA)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't take us anywhere, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
LYDIA can't help but smile - a little more at ease now. Grateful she is not the clumsy center of attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK leans over and whispers to ANNE:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.

<DIRECTION>
FADE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER IN THE EVENING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE PAN the table as everyone eats their main courses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LYDIA, we discover, has another eating idiosyncracy. SHE unconsciously, but quite loudly, smacks her mouth when she chews.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SMACK..SMACK...SMACK...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
WE HEAR THIS SMACKING OFF CAMERA as we begin on JACK; trying not to look at LYDIA but having difficulty enjoying his own meal. CAMERA moves to PARRY, staring at her, helplessly in love, not paying any attention to his own food; moving to LYDIA "SMACK, SMACKING" , beginning to accept PARRY'S attraction in her and, warming up to the idea, SHE throws a smile at him in between "smacks"; and finally ANNE, chewing quietly, staring at JACK with her eyes widened twice their normal size, indicating her disbelief at LYDIA'S vocal variety of noises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gazing at his sweetheart, a song to seranade comes to mind and he softly begins:
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lydia... Oh Lydia... That encyclopedia. Oh Lydia the tattooed lady...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
His gentle voice counterbalances the odd lyrics and makes it sound like a love song.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anne eyes Jack to stop him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack is about to make an attempt but can't seem to find the way, so he doesn't bother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia doesn't know how to respond either. At first she smiles politely, then she pretends to be too busy eating to listen -- but something about Parry's sincerity pulls her in. His face glows as he floats the lyrics across the table to her. Slowly, her "smacking" subsides, she lowers her fork, forgets her self-consciousness and listens to Parry -- slightly hypnotized; like a little girl watching a ballerina for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack is fascinated by Parry's complete adoration of this mess of a woman. He looks to Anne, who tries to continue her meal nonchalantly. He notices her bra strap hanging out from her sweater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA CUTS BACK AND FORTH between the exposed strap and Jack, as Parry continues seranading O.S. Anne realizes Jack is staring at her and immediately thinks something's wrong. But Jack just smiles at her. His hand reaches across the table, not to fix her sweater, but to take her hand. Anne is in shock. She slips her hand into his and smiles back, her eyes almost tearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Parry finishes, he smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would it be all right... I mean would you mind... if I walked you home tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia nods. From O.S., Parry's hand holds a napkin and gently dabs a stain of soy sauce on her sleeve.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't drink coffee...

<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't drink coffee...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch. Why am I putting myself through this?

(to Parry, as she quickens her pace)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..

She walks quickly away. Parry stops, confused to say the least, then runs after her. Lydia is just about to enter the front door of her building when Parry stops her.

	Well, no wonder. We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.

<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, you're very nice... b...

Lydia is about to speak when Parry puts his hand over her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... It's not just from tonight. I've known you for a long time. I see you come out of work every day. I walk with you to lunch. I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(slowly removes his hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Lydia listens with fascination)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Lydia begins to cry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you. I love you. I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss. But I'll be back in the morning. And I won't be distant. And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARRY>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him, tentatively -- almost awkwardly. Parry feels a surge of emotion that makes his whole body tremble. Lydia separates from him and looks into his eyes. She pinches his cheek, hard.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; earnestly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are real, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss again. Then Lydia quickly pulls away...
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... You can call...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
She runs into the building, afraid to linger and ruin the moment. Parry stands transfixed, his eyes following her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia pauses briefly to look back. She is so excited. She smiles and turns toward the elevator... her skirt spinning with her.

PARRY is standing frozen... We don't know whether he's looking ahead of him or in his mind's eye... He appears anxious and frightened as he steps back, away from Lydia's building... He senses someone is watching him. Parry smiles. But suddenly it is as if everything has gone into SLOW MOTION. His eyes focus on her skirt as it swirls around as she turns... His expression grows dark: O.S. we hear a horses HOOVES moving in slowly as CAMERA moves to CLOSEUP. He slowly turns his head and looks down the block to the corner to see:

The Red Knight. He sits upon his horse as if waiting for Parry. The street lamps cast a glow around his imposing figure. The night air lifts his cape up around his massive shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parry, vulnerable, in love, whispers plainly:
</DIRECTION>
<PARRY>

	Let me have this.

CUT TO:

THE RED KNIGHT

<DIRECTION>
silent, unforgiving, unrelenting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parry begins to move away, taking a step back and then another and another... until he is running down toward the opposite corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Red Knight shifts his horse into Parry's direction and begins to charge. Parry runs through deserted city streets -- running for his life; the sounds of the Red Knight GALLOPINGS grows closer. The Red Knight, looks like a surreal figure hunting his prey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Parry runs, IMAGES/MEMORIES begin to flood his mind uncontrollably;

An ambulance arriving at a hospital... his wounded wife being moved on a stretcher.

Parry and his wife at the side bar. He is making her laugh uncontrollably. He sees Edwin in the doorway, making nothing of it.

</PARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Passers-by on the street witness the familiar sight of a bum screaming at thin air then turn away. We hear the GALLOPING getting louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parry runs, mumbling incoherently. People on the street get out of his way or snicker behind his back. The Red Knight gallops toward PARRY, as he runs; his face wet with tears -- yet contorting with angry, incomprehensible reprisals. People on the street pay no attention.

His wife's lifeless hand lifted onto the stretcher.

Surprised, Parry's wife stops dancing to look at the ring. Parry smiles. It is his proposal...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two juvenile delinquents, Leather and Windbreaker, come strutting down the promenade, in SLOW MOTION. Parry looks toward them, as if surrendering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through PARRY'S POV we see the two youths are being lead by the Red Knight on his horse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parry, tear-stained face, rises to meet them. The Youths reach Parry and surround him. Leather flicks open a switchblade.

Parry stands before them, surrendering to his fate.

Through his POV, the Red Knight is pointing a sword at him in front of Leather and his switchblade. He slashes at Parry's chest as we...

:SC: INT. ANNE'S APARTMENT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside the bathroom door, we hear the toilet FLUSH. Anne exits in an imitation silk kimono, feeling very much the satisfied woman. She crosses into the living room and finds Jack, on the phone in mid-conversation, beside his open box of radio tapes. She hugs him from behind as he talks, still warm from their all night lovemaking...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(excited, very "on")
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Well, ya know, I'm feeling good, Lou... I don't know how else to put it... I... I had some personal things to work out and... and I have and...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... Well, the thing is... I want to work again... I want to get back into it... you think that's possible?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Anne releases her hug -- looking surprised, pleased, impressed... she stands by, waiting to ask Jack what's up!
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>

He hangs up the phone elated... Anne can't wait to hear...

<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's going on? Who's Lou again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<JACK>

(disappointed she doesn't remember)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My agent. I called my agent.

</JACK>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're kidding! What did he say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says if I want to get back to work, no problem. He wants me to come in and talk and... and... that's it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoah! Oh, honey, that's terrific!

She gives him a big hug. Jack is first to break away.

<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You made coffee?... You're going back to work and you made coffee?... I love this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>

Jack does not respond as he looks through the closet. Anne gets her coffee and sits -- watching Jack move about so full of energy and focus...
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ya know, I'm thinkin' -- with another income coming in, I would love to get a bigger place.

</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack stops organizing for a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I don't want to rush things -- you have to get a job first, but I'm so sure that's gonna happen I'm not even thinking about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack brings out his sports jacket, then returns to his tapes, hoping he can avoid having to respond.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ugh, these tapes are a mess. I don't know where to begin...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I would love to start looking at least. You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks at her, not knowing what to say.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... What?... You don't want to commute?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's not... Come here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He turns her around and cuddles her up in his arms, with her back to him.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're an incredible woman Anne...
	</DIALOGUE>

Anne breaks away suddenly and looks at him, sternly.

<JACK>

(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I'm an incredible woman?" What is this, a death sentence?

</ANNE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I... I think we should talk about this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(aware and suspicious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to talk? Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... it's just...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Anne shifts her body to face him directly.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Slowed things down? Where have I been? Have we been going fast!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. Anne stares at him like he's speaking Dutch.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm lost. What are you saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack sits them both down, takes her hand in his, takes a breath:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been a real... real difficult time for me... The past year or so... And now, for the first time, Anne, I feel like I'm above water. I feel like I know a lot more than I did, and I don't want to make any mistakes so... I think what I need is some time... to make the right choices. And... I think that maybe... I need to be alone for awhile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Anne is speechless -- for the moment.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as we go, what time do you need? What have we been doing here, except time? Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. So what time do you need? I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great! I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that! So what do you need to figure out alone!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack doesn't answer. Pause. Anne is afraid she knows.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. I'm going to ask you one question.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(summoning up all her strength)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you love me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Pause.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
She slaps him.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't even give me that?! What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicates the box)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else? What were you planning to do, Jack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know. I just said all I want is some time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(fighting back tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullshit! If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(pause, then:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Anne slaps him again.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have you been doing here! Huh! I wanna know! What have you been doing here?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen! We both got something out of it, all right!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah? What did I get? What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week? You think your company is such a treat? Your moods, your...

(sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then what do you want to stay with me for?

<DIRECTION>
ANNE physically attacks him...
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BECAUSE I LOVE YOU!...STUPID!...FUCKIN!...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
JACK blocks her blows and holds her arms. ANNE surrenders to her tears. HE is about to embrace her, when she pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No....You don't get to be nice now. I'm not gonna play some game with you where we act like friends so you can walk out here feeling good about yourself. I'm not a liar. If you're gonna leave me then that's what we call it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>

The phone rings. JACK answers it.

:SC: INT. HOSPITAL WARD - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARRY lays in bed - his face bandaged, his arms in a cast, his chest tightly rapped. HE has been severly beaten. JACK and ANNE stand at the foot of the bed in shock. A DOCTOR appears. The DOCTOR is young, dedicated and inexperienced enough to still feel compassion.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Parry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He can't hear you.

(JACK and ANNE turn)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reads)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	..."catatonic stupor"...condition rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(DOCTOR doesn't reply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll snap out of it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But..How could that happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(JACK shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be sent back to the same institution..
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(HE checks the record)
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if I was a relative?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
With that, the DOCTOR EXITS. JACK and ANNE face PARRY.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like a guy. Finds the woman of his dreams then falls into a coma... Poor Lydia...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(SHE looks at JACK)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Some women just have no luck, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Including herself in this remark, and having cried all she could cry, She and JACK exchange one final look. SHE turns and, with all her dignity, walks out of the ward. After a BEAT:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anne....Anne...I'll call you O.k...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
But ANNE doesn't stop or turn - she keeps walking. JACK stares at PARRY. CAMERA MOVES IN TO C.U. - His face hardening, a mixture of hurt, rage and resignation.

	Well, I'm gone-... Have a perfect weekend and remember on Monday, we have as our studio guest, Ben Starr - star of the recently defunct hit TV show ON THE RADIO - it's the rise and fall story of one of televisions brightest stars ruined by charges of sodomy in an Atlanta airport mens room. If you often wonder, "what IS sodomy exactly?", Ben'll have that answer and many more for you on Monday's show...Until then, don't do anything that will break your pattern of being the selfish scum sucking race you are. From one of the Botched to all of your bungled cats out there, I love ya and right back at cha!. Over and out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
HE flicks his monitor off as a commercial takes over. The CREW work in silence behind him. HE rubs his tired face and sits there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PAUSES on JACK for a moment as he sits in silence. HE looks neither happy nor said, neither satisfied nor unsatisfied. HE looks blank...emotionless...as if he knows something is lacking but he hasn't the strength or interest to find out.... THE PHONE RINGS - breaking the silence. JACK picks up.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...Yeah Lou....

JACK knows this must mean a great deal - especially to BETH - but he just can't get the steam up....HE smiles weakly.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great.

</JACK>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really. He thinks you'll be a phenominal success...and he says the cable people are very excited about the meeting... I said I always knew that and I really think it was like the first time he really respected me...So thank you for that.

JACK nods "it was nothing" as his hands move up her body.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh and I called him later to thank him but I really think you should send him a note... He wants to take us out to dinner tonight. The car's picking us up at seven...

JACK nods and watches BETH'S BREASTS pressing against her dress. Turned on, JACK moves to her and begins fondling her, as he kisses her neck. BETH giggles.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>

	Jaaack...what are you crazy? They're people all around us?

JACK flips a switch that send his studio into darkness and continues kissing and fondling. BETH giggles some more.

Gone are the little cliques of homeless, once scattered throughout the place. Gone is the magic and danger that night cast upon the surroundings. All Jack sees is garbage and decay.

Suddenly, SIRENS from an ambulance pulls his his attention away. At the same time, the Black and the Irishman (from that same first night with Parry), come running out from between the two giant foundations of the bridge and bolt out of the lot. Jack smiles in recognition as he moves to block them:

JACK is holding a rope with a self-made hook. HE looks up the at building, takes a gulp, then throws the rope up. IT MISSES and falls back toward him - scaring him to the side and making an awful sound when it lands. JACK tries again. IT CATCHES. HE tugs a bit. HE begins to climb up the building.

HE pulls and steps, pulls and steps...climbing up to a BALCONY mid-way between the street and the roof. JACK climbs over, falling into some exterior lighting that lines the balcony.
</DIRECTION>

A light is jarred loose, falling to the ground making an awful SOUND and lighting a stained glass window. JACK raises his eyes and sees THE RED KNIGHT standing six feet tall, as pictured in the design of the stained glass window. HE stares until HE HEARS THE SOUND OF A HORSE GALLOPING....HE freezes, then cautiously looks toward the street - but the street is vacant. The galloping stops. An eerie silence hangs in the air.

Jack reaches the roof and climbs over. He pulls the rope up and quickly moves to the skylight. He looks down into it and sees a dark void. He takes a breath and pulls out some masking tape. He makes three big tape loops and applies them to the glass. He then takes out a glass cutter and begins to cut a pane. The SOUND, at first, is starting. An O.S. VOICE says:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're being too loud.

Jack's heart stops. He looks into the darkness of the roof but sees nothing. He tries to slow down his heart and shake away thoughts of demons in the dark. He continues cutting. When he finishes the entire pane, he replaces the cutter in his pocket then plasters his arm against the tape. He gently bangs the pane and it comes loose, sticking to the tape. He is impressed. He places the pane on the roof and, fastening one end of the rope to a pipe, lowers the other end down.

He takes a breath and releases, falling to the floor with a THUD!... The room is dark. The moon- light barely illuminates the austere, castle-like surroundings. Jack pulls out the page from the Architecture Today and lights a lighter. The "Grail" is in the library on the first floor. Jack cautiously makes his way out.

Slowly, a shadow holding a shotgun emerges up the stairs against the back wall... Jack is paralyzed. He closes his eyes. The shadow reaches the top of the landing. It is EDWIN MALNICK... Wearing the same expression we saw on the TV broadcast -- sad and harmless. Jack's heart is bursting out of his chest. Edwin calmly raises the gun, cocks it and FIRES: the shot BLASTS down the hallway, deafening Jack. But when he opens his eyes to see if he has been hit, there is no blood, no wound... and when he looks up, no Edwin. He pulls himself together and continues:

Jack spots the antique commode and crosses to it... Within the commode, sitting innocently behind two small glass doors, is the "Grail"... Jack gently opens the doors and takes out the goblet. He holds it reverently for a moment, then, noticing an inscription, reads:

The bare foot of a man barely sticking out from in front of the Chesterfield chair. Jack slowly moves around the large back of the chair to the front and sees, to his amazement: LANGSTON CARMICHAEL, wearing only his silk pajama bottoms, asleep in the chair. On the table beside him is an empty bottle of vodka and an empty bottle of pills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack doesn't know what to do, when it suddenly strikes him that Carmichael hasn't moved at all. At first, he thinks it is another hallucination, but then he notices the pill bottle. He takes a step toward it, the floor SQUEAKING beneath him but Carmichael remaining unconscious. He reads the bottle: Seconal. Jack looks at Carmichael's limp body and checks his heart. It is very faint. Scared, Jack slowly starts backing out of the room.
