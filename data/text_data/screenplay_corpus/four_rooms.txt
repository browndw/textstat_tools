As presentation credits begin, we hear Johnny Cash's "Home of the Blues." Then we see Allison's name, under it Alex's, under that Robert's, under that Quentin's, then under that the title logo for Four Rooms, followed by "Starring Tim Roth as the Bellboy." Then "The Guests" listed in alphabetical order of all the actors playing guests. After the actors' names, we...

FADE UP ON A WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera pans down a weathered wall covered with postcards from Miami Beach, Florida, the Copacabana, N.Y.C., "Wish You Were Here" from Niagara Falls, rickshaws and babes on beaches, etc....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera comes to rest on an old photograph of a 1930s hotel, the "Mon Signor," in its heyday, with a full staff of 30 people posed on the lawn in front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old guy with a staccato voice delivers a monologue:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There used to be a staff of fifty in this place. I'm the only one left from those days. It all comes down to one sap: the night-shift bellhop, that's me. What the hell is a bellhop? You know where the name comes from?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(silence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not... It's so simple it's stupid. They ring a bell and you hop. You hop to front and center. No heroes in this line, kid. Just men doing a job. No questions asked, none answered. I try to keep it simple, kid, not too personal...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OVER>
<DIRECTION>
Another voice of a young man interrupts.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You met any of those old stars?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<THE_OLD_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stars! Are you kidding me? I took Rin Tin Tin out for a shit, for Christ's sakes. I taught Shirley Temple how to roller-skate. I saw Fatty Arbuckle regurgitate three cheese sandwiches right on the spot you're sitting, kid. What did you say your name was?

</THE_OLD_GUY>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<THE_OLD_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ted, right. I remember Marilyn used to come down at night and doze off in the kitchen. She liked the sound of the fans out back spinning around. Sure, these were stars, kid. Errol Flynn used to call me "Alibi." You'll pick up a few stories yourself, kid.

<DIRECTION>
A wisp of smoke passes over a napkin pinned to the wall with a lip print on it signed "Marilyn." The camera pulls back to reveal Ted and the Old Guy sitting on a foldout cot in a small back room of the Hotel Mon Signor. The old man is dressed in a striped T-shirt with a bellhop's cap on. He looks like an old pirate. Next to him on the bed sits Ted, a young guy with a bellhop jacket draped over his knees. The old bellhop takes a long drag off a big cigar.

</TED>
<THE_OLD_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The cigar. Cuban. A good cigar, wrapped in Miami. I get a box of them every Christmas from the chairman of the board. I think he sends them to me to keep my mouth shut. It's tough not to get a little personal in this business.

</THE_OLD_GUY>

The old bellhop takes a hit off his cigar and stares down at his cap, lost in thought.

<DIRECTION>
The old guy passes the cap over to Ted.

</THE_OLD_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Ted puts the cap on.

<THE_OLD_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frankly, you look stupid... like the Philip Morris guy. I can't believe I wore that thing for fifty years. You keep it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_OLD_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
The Old Guy gets up from the bed and throws a jacket on. Pulls a few postcards off the wall, throws them in an old straw suitcase, and slams the lid down. He heads for the door. Ted follows.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_OLD_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay away from night clerks, kids, hookers, and marital disputes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_OLD_GUY>

The Old Guy pauses for a second and looks Ted dead in the eye.

<THE_OLD_GUY>

INT. HOTEL LOBBY--TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The big empty lobby of the Mon Signor. You can tell that at one point this used to be a swank place. It still is, kinda. It's also kinda decrepit. The concierge -- a snappy, fast- talking, red-haired young woman in a blue blazer named Betty -- stands behind the reception desk. The old man, suitcase in hand, makes a beeline through the lobby, heading toward the front door. Betty sees him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's New Year's Eve.

	Ted, in a nutshell, all you have to do is hold the fort. It's New Year's Eve. Most of the guests are going out. You'll just be giving them a little nod as they come staggering in at three... four... five... in the morning. Nobody's having any parties, a few get-togethers, but no parties. You got about three people checking in tonight, that's it. The only variable is Chester Rush in the penthouse.

</BETTY>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chester Rush? The guy from The Wacky Detective?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, him and his entourage checked in last night. They're in the penthouse. The only reason I refer to it as a variable is that he's a movie star. Ya never know about movie stars. I'm tellin' ya, Ted, it's cake.

Betty takes a piece of paper and writes her number down.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifty bucks!

<TED>

	You're shirking your duties for this Nazi. For that you pay a price, and the price is fifty bucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One, Horst is not a Nazi. Two, that's not a fair price. You're taking advantage of the situation. Twenty bucks. Now, twenty bucks is a fair price.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but what you're doin' to me ain't fair. And, you are completely and totally taking advantage of me and your position. So fifty bucks is the perfect price.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Betty begrudgingly digs in her purse.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, but don't be a pussy. You don't bother me unless it's an emergency. In fact, for fifty bucks, you better not call me unless the fuckin' building's burning down.

EXT. THE MON SIGNOR HOTEL--DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted, the bellboy, meets his first guest of the evening, as a taxi unloads her luggage. To his warm surprise, the guest is a Beautiful Mediterranean Goddess (actually, we will come to see she is not technically a goddess, but a High Priestess). She is about 25 years old, speaks with an Italian accent and is dressed in Gypsy garb. She is Athena.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted takes Athena's luggage onto his cart. But one item in a woven Moroccan bag proves to be unbearably heavy. Athena is concerned as he attempts to lift it.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pleeze be careful -- my God. You have no idea...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
Ted strains as he uses all his cojones to lift the insanely heavy bag onto the cart. Athena tips the cab driver, stingily. The driver winces and gets in the cab. Ted has now managed with grunts and groans and strained blood vessels to put this thing on the cart. The cab skids away. Athena looks at Ted, who is out of breath.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm usually a good tipper, but this one -- this cab driver -- he had green all around him. I don't like that in a man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
Ted wheezes and pounds on his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Green? Is that bad? Like you read auras or something like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well what color are you seein' around me... how's the tip lookin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see purple... in your face, and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
As if she can't help herself, Athena's eyes are strangely drawn to his crotch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She frowns, confused by this impulse. Ted appears to be charmingly oblivious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Athena looks back into his face.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you're okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
Ted touches his face -- as if searching for the "purple" in it -- and moves the cart inside, discreetly checking out his crotch and giving her a confused side glance.

</TED>
<ATHENA>

</ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at this wacky Gypsy chick numbly -- she pulls out her Gold Card and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ELEVATOR--DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors open and Ted and Athena emerge upon the third floor. Ted follows Athena with the cart down the hallway to her room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE HONEYMOON SUITE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted opens the door, then lifts the easiest bags first. In the center of the room is a Jacuzzi with hokey plastic cupids poised with urns on each side. A dormant fireplace looms beyond the still hot tub.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted stares at the heavy bag with anxiety -- then looks in front of him to Athena as she rubs the round plastic head of a little Cupid and mumbles, "Perfect."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, arms open wide, chin lifted to heaven, eyes closed, she mumbles a faint incantation. Then she does a belly-dance wiggle and turns to Ted, who is truly perplexed.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- the other bag -- I need it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to lift it, again straining and turning purple. He laughs sickly.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell you got in here, lady? Nuclear weapons?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
She relieves him of the task and effortlessly picks up the bag.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
(dryly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The White Cliffs of Dover.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
Ted is stunned as she slings the bag over her shoulder and pauses to pull a 10 spot out of her cleavage. She hands it to him. Ted is grateful and disoriented.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The others will be coming soon. Send them, pleeze.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
Ted nods, confused by "the others," and walks off with the cart. Then he turns from outside the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- I forgot to show you how to turn on the Jacuzzi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
But Athena is ahead of him -- she flips a switch and water begins to flow from the baby cupids' urns into the hot tub.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I been in dis' place many New Year's. So... you send the others to me, huh. Go now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
As she says this, the door closes with a strange force, shutting Ted out. Athena takes the bag to the bedroom of the suite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE SUITE BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A round bed with pink tuck'n'roll headboard. It's impossible to imagine having an orgasm in this room -- unless it were achieved by laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Athena carefully removes a large, beautiful white slab of stone from her tapestry bag. She caresses it and carries it like a baby to the bed and places it in the very center, the head of the rock resting on dusty heart-shaped pillows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she removes from her bag a pink negligee and matching high-heeled slippers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And these she places with reverence on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On this night, oh great goddess Diana, we restore your virgin flesh and bring you back to real life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON the rock slab. We hold the artifact.

<ATHENA>

</ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRONT DESK--DUSK FALLS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as Ted is recovering from the mystery of this first guest, Elspeth arrives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She has skin like marble, the body of Venus, piercing blue eyes, blond hair and is dressed all in black clothing, like Honey West in a rubber dress. She carries several bags, and a silver sword on her shoulder.

Then she snaps, irritated, behind her.

</ELSPETH>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON a young punk rocker chick with long orange hair, a long leather coat, wearing a tight T-shirt with studs spelling "PUSSY" across her breasts. This is Kiva.
</DIRECTION>

Kiva is kicking the tar and nicotine outta the cigarette machine. Just as Ted's eyes grow wide with anxiety, several packs of smokes drop into the juvenile delinquent's hands.
</DIRECTION>
<KIVA>

	Wait up, gawd! I had to get supplies for this boring ass night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<ELSPETH>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have a reservation in the Honeymoon Suite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah... you must be one of "the others." And what're you carrying -- the Rock of Gibraltar?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at him without humor. He fumbles for the key. He walks around the desk to help her with her black crocodile luggage. Jars clang inside. He is ready to go, but Elspeth turns to lecture Kiva on the hazards of smoking, as Kiva lights up.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd I tell you about smoking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<KIVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You smoke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right -- I smoke, and I'm addicted to it, and I don't want the same thing to happen to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<KIVA>
<DIRECTION>
(in game-show host voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Hello -- welcome to this week's edition of the Hypocrite of the Year Award --"
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<DIRECTION>
As Kiva goes off on her impression of a game-show host, Elspeth is growing increasingly rageful, like a mother with an unruly child. Ted waits, luggage in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kiva! That's enough --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<DIRECTION>
She cuts Kiva's ramble off. Kiva blows smoke defiantly.
</DIRECTION>
<KIVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not my mother!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<KIVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why're we sleeping together?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<DIRECTION>
Ted looks on uneasily at the relationship that is beginning to unfold here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elspeth checks his reaction and becomes self-conscious at his scrutiny.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... I didn't mean it... literally. I... I happen to be the only one who... cares about you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<DIRECTION>
But her wild child looks off, bored. Elspeth turns to Ted, flustered.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please -- take us to our room!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<DIRECTION>
Ted smiles uneasily and reaches to relieve her of her sword, but Elspeth quickly slams her palm on the sword and shoots him a piercing glare. He jumps back with a light nervous laugh. He leads the way to the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE HONEYMOON SUITE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The couch has been set out here in the hall, as well as coffee tables, lamps, and the TV. Elspeth and Kiva enter the room. Athena is gone. As Ted stumbles around the furniture in the hall, he peers in the room and see a transformation. With most of the furniture removed, candles and incense and flowers are beginning to form an altar around the fireplace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But oddest of all is the pink-tinged water swirling in the Jacuzzi and pouring from the cupid urns. A sprinkle of white powder on the carpet encircles the hot tub. Elspeth hands him a tip as he gawks at the circle.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flea powder. One of the others is bringing her cat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<DIRECTION>
Ted starts away again, perplexed. He turns for one last look to see Elspeth kneeling before Kiva, who sprawls on the floor. He shakes his head and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gonna have to wait in the other room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<KIVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I said so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<KIVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll watch TV.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't watch TV because the noise will interfere with our ritual.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<DIRECTION>
Kiva looks around the room and spies the TV in the hallway. She turns to Elspeth with sarcastic concession.
</DIRECTION>
<KIVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay... Mommy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<DIRECTION>
Elspeth bristles as the brat saunters off to the bedroom. Elspeth enters the sacred circle, stands before the altar, whips out her sword, and makes a ceremonial gesture pointing the sword upward, perfectly centered between her breasts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiva, behind Elspeth's back, exits from the bedroom doorway into the hall and comes back in, lugging the TV into the honeymoon bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elspeth kneels before the altar. Athena enters the room with the "cleansed" artifact and lays the slab in the center of the altar upon the heart-shaped pillows as Elspeth lays her sword next to the rock. The women look upon the union with tender affection.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soon -- our goddess will come. I will go get her negligee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
Athena stands up but her reverie is dispelled as she shrieks! Loud TV suddenly blasts from the bedroom and Kiva the brat is trying on the pink negligee over her clothes. Athena takes the negligee off the irrepressible youth.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing! Have you no respect -- who -- who is dis girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kiva. My friend. Kiva, turn off the TV! I can't leave her at home -- she's on probation and I gotta keep an eye on her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Elspeth, your friend cannot stay here during the ritual. She may be one of your kind, but she is not one of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She stays!! Or I go -- along with my offering!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<DIRECTION>
The women have a stare-down. Then Athena calls out --
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	TURN OF THE FUCKING TV, MAN!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<KIVA>
<DIRECTION>
(in a seductive pout)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<DIRECTION>
Elspeth becomes anxious with jealousy. Athena is exasperated as she firmly demands from Elspeth --
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's not forget -- I am the High Fucking Priestess. Deal with dis girl!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
Elspeth defers to Athena with remembered reverence and respect. She bows apologetic and scurries to the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
(eyes lifted to heaven, wearily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me -- did we have these problems in Salem? I don't think so...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elspeth swallows her rage and approaches the brat with a soft touch.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kiva... you know what I love about you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<DIRECTION>
Kiva smirks... yeah, she knows.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your sweet side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<KIVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what do I get if I'm sweet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You get whatever you want. And you know what else I love about you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<KIVA>
<DIRECTION>
(seduced now)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your nose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<DIRECTION>
And saying this, she kisses Kiva's nose and leaves the room. Kiva is quieted now. As Elspeth closes the bedroom door, she has the last word.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I saw you checking her out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<DIRECTION>
Kiva slinks back on the bed, put in her place -- for now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ELEVATOR IN THE HALLWAY -- DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors open and Ted pushes a cart of expensive designer luggage -- and lots of it -- behind yet another Gorgeous Gal. This one is Jezebel, a Southern beauty, fawning over her cat, as she carries nothing else, and proceeds down the hall like a Southern princess.
</DIRECTION>
<JEZEBEL>
<DIRECTION>
(talking to her cat in baby talk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh you little stinker... oh you sweet little muffin. Yes... Mama loves the baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEZEBEL>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jezebel bursts in, chattering.
</DIRECTION>
<JEZEBEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, this is just darlin'! Just darlin' Hi-dee, girls...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEZEBEL>
<DIRECTION>
Ted carries all her bags inside awkwardly. Again, the place has become all the more transformed with wild canopies of exotic cloths and fixings. Elspeth and Athena are hard at work on a strange nature sculpture as Jezebel enters. She stands inside the powdered circle and before the hot tub, which now has dark blue water swirling inside. She presents her cat -- upward toward heaven -- frees the cat, bares her breasts and sucks in the vibes: "Ahhhh."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted settles the bags down, hoping for a peek at her charms, but her back is to him. The kitty rubs on her leg. She picks it up and presses it against her bare breasts, petting it sweetly. She winks and hands him a tip.
</DIRECTION>
<JEZEBEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Toodle-loo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEZEBEL>
<DIRECTION>
And saying this, she shoos him away. Through the glass doors to the bedroom, she sees Kiva sprawled on the bed, writing on herself.
</DIRECTION>
<JEZEBEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- I see Elspeth has herself a new lil' fool -- what the hell is she doin' here on our night of annual ritual?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEZEBEL>
<ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
(wearily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have sanctioned her presence, as long as she behaves. Come on -- there is more work to be done to welcome our great Diana.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<KIVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I WANT ROOM SERVICE!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do I always attract girls who are looking for a babysitter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<JEZEBEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well now, honey, maybe Juvenile Hall ain't the best place to find serious relationship material.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEZEBEL>
<DIRECTION>
Elspeth seethes at her. Jezebel acts blithely innocent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted is walking from the room with the cart. His face is etched in a mask of perpetual frown as he looks at the tip in his hand -- at least these lunachicks tip well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Waking him out of his deep mood is Raven. Another female intoxication, she wears a short skirt, all done up in Native American, Southwestern themes. No shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But she carries a small, old handmade broom. She moves down the hall, blissed-out. Ted makes eye contact, despite himself.
</DIRECTION>
<RAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm looking for the room for making love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAVEN>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You might be referring to the Honeymoon Suite. Straight thata way... you can't miss it -- see all that furniture in the hallway --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<RAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh I know the way. I just wanted you to know that I knew where I was going and that you needn't bother yourself with me. The others are here -- great!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAVEN>
<TED>
<DIRECTION>
(wearily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah -- it's so great -- it's fantastic.

<DIRECTION>

</RAVEN>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Past New Year's?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<RAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes -- we've been coming here every New Year... for a long time. Thanks for your patience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAVEN>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh hey -- no problem -- wreck the place. Bring in cats. Ruin the carpet with flea powder, pour paint in the Jacuzzi. Throw the furniture out the... where're your bags?

</TED>
<RAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I travel very light.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAVEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ted looks down at the broom at her side, her bare feets, her thick dark hair. It keeps getting weirder. She wanders off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRONT DESK--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last of the lovely girls arrives. She is different from the others. She looks like a farm girl, very Earth Mother, with a tablecloth halter top and skirt, sandals, and a simple scarf over her long dark curls. She carries two bags by herself and holds a small black pot under her arm. She is Eva.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
<DIRECTION>
(already weary of these girls)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, yeah, Honeymoon Suite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... yes... I'm late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<DIRECTION>
She lowers her eyes, worried.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right -- lemme give ya a hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... no, that's all right. I can carry them by myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<DIRECTION>
She is so sweet and sincere that he feels like a heel to have been irritated with her. He picks up her bags.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a man doin' a job -- no hero.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Eva smiles, beautifully.
</DIRECTION>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well gosh -- thank you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE ELEVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted holds Eva's hippy sacks as she holds her black pot. There is a shy quiet tension here.
</DIRECTION>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me, how long have the others been here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About an hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Eva's heart sinks. They arrive at the door. He carries her bags in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE SUITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is entirely transformed into a beautiful glowing palace with an elaborate altar, both earthly and the other- earthly. The other four girls are arranging the altar as Eva enters.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are very late, Eva.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Athena. I was attending a birth and the placenta was late in coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<DIRECTION>
Ted is slightly queasy. She hands him a tip and smiles, then takes it back.
</DIRECTION>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, wait, lemme give you a little more than that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<DIRECTION>
Ted's no fool, he waits while Eva looks through her change purse.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which birth is more important to you, that of a mortal or that of a goddess?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All life is precious... but I do apologize for being late, Elspeth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<JEZEBEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back home, they jist yank on the umbilical cord, do a Karate chop on the mama's belly, and them things come right out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEZEBEL>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They do that here, too, Jezebel, in the hospitals, but it causes hemorrhages. I fed the mother a bowl of comfrey tea and it brought the afterbirth down perfectly. The couple are going to use it for fertilizer to plant a lovely tree for their baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<KIVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh wow -- if they were really back- to-nature, they'd eat it, like other mammals do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON Ted's face as he gets thoroughly grossed out.
</DIRECTION>
<RAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In some Native American cultures, they dry the umbilical cord, grind it to a fine powder, and put it in a leather pouch that the baby wears to ward off evil. But burying the placenta is also a very sound ecological practice -- 'cause of the oxygen it carries.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAVEN>
<EVA>
<DIRECTION>
(cheerfully to the others)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- because you see when the placenta detaches from the uterine wall...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<TED>
<DIRECTION>
(wincing in disgust)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, thank you, ladies -- I'll be going now. If you need anything --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Eva places a nice tip in his palm.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. We do need a few things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
Ted sighs as Eva enters the circle with her black pot. She kneels softly, holds her hands in piety before the altar, and softly incants as she offers her pot and places it on the altar. The stone and sword and flowers now rest here on pillows covered in chiffon scarves. The negligee hangs from the mantel, the slippers underneath as if expecting someone to materialize into the garments.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need fresh rosemary from the kitchen. Mostly what we need is from the kitchen. Hey, are you listening?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
Ted is watching Eva, enchanted.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, yeah, rosemary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And a little bit of sea salt or Kosher salt if you don't got no sea salt. A bottle of spring water -- Italian please, not French shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<KIVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And some french fries!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kiva, shut up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
(irritated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And some ginger, two of the eyes of a trout fish, and a piece of raw meat, liver if you have it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<KIVA>
<DIRECTION>
(whining)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want fries -- you dumb jerks with your stupid fucking ritual!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up, you little shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't talk to her that way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<DIRECTION>
Ted has scribbled down the items as she speaks. He looks at this list and these girls and shudders as he walks away. He turns, points at Eva.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted smiles at this angel of a girl. She smiles back. But, as she looks him in the eyes, he feels a strange buzzing connection happening. He holds his head, almost swooning with dizziness. Athena smirks.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get to work, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
Ted comes out of his daze, looks at the list again and huffs off. After he goes, the girls begin to bring forth their most treasured offerings in ornate ancient bottles, vases or vials.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jezebel folds her arms and clears her throat in the direction of Kiva, sitting idly on the edge of the blue water Jacuzzi, with her feet dipping irreverently in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kiva...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<KIVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to go in the next room now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<KIVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, wow, like I'm bummed out that I can't watch.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(whining at Elspeth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm bored!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	UP!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<DIRECTION>
She climbs up the stairs, trying to pull the brat to her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<KIVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't put me in there by myself. I'll miss you way too much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kiva, don't do this to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<DIRECTION>
Kiva sees a bit of weakening here; she takes her feet out of the Jacuzzi. She begins to speak softly.
</DIRECTION>
<KIVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please... if you just lemme... I'll play dress-up with you, the way you like it... you know what I mean... remember...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<DIRECTION>
Elspeth begins to weaken. But continues to pull the brat up. Kiva pours on softer seduction.
</DIRECTION>
<KIVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can pretend and I'll do it exactly... the way you want it... with the egg whites and the kilt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<DIRECTION>
Elspeth is now fully seduced. Kiva takes Elspeth's hand and presses it lightly on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean... like last week?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<DIRECTION>
Kiva nods. Elspeth is enthralled, but from a disgusted "ick" sound from Jezebel, Elspeth realizes she's revealing this side of her life -- in front of her coven. She nervously looks around and see all the coven looking at her: a disgusted Jezebel, an understanding Raven, a preoccupied Eva and an impatient and stern Athena.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elspeth comes to her senses, straightens her posture.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll talk about this later, Kiva.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<KIVA>
<DIRECTION>
(angrily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<DIRECTION>
She turns on Elspeth and bites her hand. Elspeth pulls her arm away and grabs Kiva by the hair.
</DIRECTION>
<JEZEBEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, really now -- child abuse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEZEBEL>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You stay outta this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I demand this stop now, Elspeth!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
Elspeth lets go of Kiva's hair. Kiva jerks away from her.
</DIRECTION>
<KIVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm running away from you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIVA>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. Go ahead. And I'll call your parole officer and she'll find you and send you back to Eastlake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<DIRECTION>
Kiva stomps off into the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that the fucking melodrama is over, can we start the goddamn ritual -- pleeze?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
Elspeth enters the powered circle. Each girl takes off her shoes. They anoint themselves with oils.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are communing here on New Year's Eve to bring to life the great goddess Diana, who was turned to stone in this very room forty years ago today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
The girls moan in sleepy, eerie agreement as they begin to sway within the circle.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Diana, great beautiful one, we make these offerings to you, that we may undo the wicked spell which deprived you of the seed of your lover, your virginal blood, of your very life. We now form the symbolic rock with our bodies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
And saying this, the girls all form a "rock" with their bodies gracefully draped one upon the other. Music begins, and slowly they start to unfold from the rock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girls each find their place in a semicircle around the Jacuzzi. Some bare their breasts, other strip off a layer of clothes. They anoint their arms with water from the Jacuzzi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They begin a lovely dance, snaking their way around the semicircle. The first one to go from one end to the other is Athena. She then proceeds up the stairs and positions herself between the altar and the Jacuzzi. She steps forth with a bottle to the altar and pours it into the Jacuzzi.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On this night, in this hour, we Call upon the Ancient Power O Goddess bride, I offer thee Milk from a mother's sweet titty!
	</DIALOGUE>

Each of the girls moans eerily. Athena places the bottle on the altar and bows away. She joins the circle as Elspeth now steps forward with her offering in a vial.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To reverse the evil which has been done I make this offering to the Divine One A whore not, an innocent was, For whom I seized a virgin's blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<JEZEBEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddess of Light, Goddess of Lust, To undo this awful spell is a real must. To bring you life and get you high I offer the sweat of five men's thighs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEZEBEL>
<DIRECTION>
The girls moan loudly as they sway. Jezebel places her offering in the hot tub and bows out, returning to the circle. Now Raven comes forth with a small leather canteen. She unscrews the lid as she offers in her opiate stupor.
</DIRECTION>
<RAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Diana, oh great one, we live without sun Until this wicked curse is undone. In hope that you live, and to us appear, I have collected a year's worth of tears.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAVEN>
<DIRECTION>
She pours liquid into the mix, as the witches moan. Now it's Eva's turn. Eva continues to sway, not moving forth to the altar. The girls keep their eyes closed as they sway, waiting for Eva's offering. Athena finally gives her a push and she goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eva kneels before the altar. She produces a silver bottle with a chain on its cap and neck. She timidly begins to incant.
</DIRECTION>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great Goddess Diana, fail you I will, I was to bring fresh sperm from my Bill. I had him erect, and his semen would follow But alas I was hot, so hot that I swallowed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<DIRECTION>
The moans turn to wails as the girls GASP and SHRIEK! Athena opens her eyes, wildly.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You stupid little witch! You swallowed the sperm! Aye-yi--yi!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHENA>
<DIRECTION>
Elspeth opens her eyes and folds her arms, smirking bitterly.

<DIRECTION>
Ted opens the door. His eyes bulge out as he looks upon the fleshly feast. He steps back. They giggle seductively, all except Eva, who sniffles, red-eyed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amazingly, Ted's attention is captivated by Eva's sorrow, not by the naked charms of the other witches. She shyly covers her breasts. Sensitive to her shame and sorrow, he looks away and steps from the door to fetch the room-service cart. Athena directs the others to put on their shirts. Ted wheels in the cart.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's the things you asked for. Oh, and uhh, sorry, but I'm not gonna pick the eyes outta this dead fish.
	</DIALOGUE>

He points to the trout. Elspeth picks it up, flings the eyes into the Jacuzzi, and tosses the trout out of the window. She smirks at him comtemptuously.

The girls step out. Athena turns to Eva and points to her watch, then holds up one finger. Eva looks up, worried. The door closes on her and Ted. She looks at Ted and sighs. He covers her with a shawl.

The other witches listen at the door.

Eva sits among pillows before the altar as Ted stands in front of her. Ted is trying his best to make poor Eva smile. But no matter what his antics, she looks off sadly.

She begins to cry tearfully again.

He postures proudly, all puffed out. Eva looks at him helplessly. And he paternally encourages her to explain.
</DIRECTION>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... okay. The five of us -- Elspeth, Jezebel, Athena, Raven and me -- are a coven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>

He looks around the room: QUICK CUTS of candles, iconography, jars of lurid substances, unknown body parts of animals woven into the nature sculpture... and are those tongues in that can? Ted's getting the creeps, but again puffs himself up.

<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew that!
	</DIALOGUE>

	Gee, you don't look a day over twenty!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... ha ha... I mean the witches before us tried and failed. But Athena, our High Priestess, discovered a great potion to reverse the evil spell which turned our beautiful goddess into an old rock.

<TED>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at the rock)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? Is... is that her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Eva nods, looking lovingly at the stone.
</DIRECTION>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was a beautiful virgin. An entertainer by trade, but a great sorceress by design. It was here in this very room, on her wedding night, a jealous rival placed the curse on Diana.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She turned to -- that -- here?
	</DIALOGUE>

Ted frowns as he ponders all this. Eva takes a photo from the altar and hands it to Ted.

	This was Diana.

CLOSE ON photo: a Blond Bombshell in full-on Betty Page attire, a bare-tittied pinup girl, playfully spanking a girl in bondage with a spiked high heel.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This girl here? This is the goddess Diana?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
The photograph slowly comes alive. Diana stops spanking the girl and unties her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls the girl (in the black satin mask) up off her lap and makes the girl stand. The women face each other and break into a cheek-to-cheek tango.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON Ted as he shakes his head. Are his eyes playing tricks on him?
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate to tell you this, but I kinda doubt she was a virgin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, but she was! She had lovers, but she saved that for marriage. Which is the example I've tried to follow: to do everything but that till I marry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<DIRECTION>
She begins to sob again. Ted comforts her.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, don't cry... a virgin is a rare and beautiful thing. If you say she was a virgin, I'll believe it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it doesn't matter now... and she won't be resurrected tonight 'cause I failed her. I let my whole coven down!

	Now, that would be something worth seeing!

Eva looks off. Ted searches his brains, thoroughly sickened now.

Eva sobs, pleading. She throws off her shawl, baring her lovely breasts, and reaches her arms around his neck. He keeps backing off. Unbeknownst to him, he is already doing a ritualistic shuffle.

	Ha, c'mon now, joke's over.

	Hey, we're gonna step in the flea powder.

Athena regally leads the ritual as they all bare their breasts again. Kiva throws off her shirt to join in. As she does, we see black bondage tape on her nipples.

ROOM 404 "THE WRONG MAN"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DARK HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted saunters down a hallway with a butt hanging out the corner of his mouth and a bucket of ice swinging at his side. He pulls up at a door on which the faded numbers read something like "Room 404."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted knocks on the door. After a moment, the latch is thrown and the door swings open. Ted cautiously steps into the dark room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anybody home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
A DEMONIC CACKLE cuts through the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one here but us chickens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, it's pretty dark in here, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you expect, Theodore, a fuckin' floor show?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I know you?

<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
In a flash the lights switch on and Ted finds himself staring down the barrel of a pretty intense-looking .357 Magnum, cocked and ready to fire. At the other end of the gun stands a 50-year-old man, Sigfried, who sports a Cheshire Cat smile and a "just try fuckin' with me" look on his face. Sigfried isn't the only person in the room. Directly behind him sits a beautiful young woman, Angela, gagged and bound to a chair. Ted drops the bucket to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I brought your ice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's cute. In fact, the whole getup's kind of cute. The monkey suit's a nice touch, honey puss.

	This has to be a mistake. Is this room 404?

<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Theodore? What do you take me for, Theodore?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A very upset man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Sigfried reaches in his pocket and throws a handful of assorted stimulants into his mouth, chewing on them like they were breath mints. Sigfried thrusts his hand forward, gripping Ted by the throat, and leads him to Angela.
</DIRECTION>
<SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
(to Angela)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am an upset man, Theodore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know my name, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm psychic, Theodore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look my name is Ted, actually, and I have no idea what's going on here, but I've obviously come at a bad time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's not belabor the fact that you have no sense of timing, Theodore. The fact is you're here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
Sigfried turns to Angela.
</DIRECTION>
<SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I couldn't think of a better time for you to introduce me to your beau than on New Year's Eve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh fuck, there's a mistake. You're fucking wrong here. My name is Theodore, yes! My mother named me that and I hate the name. But I'm a fucking bellhop. People call me Ted. I work here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, with great force, Sigfried slams the butt of his pistol smack into Ted's temple, sending him to the floor. Ted looks up at Sigfried in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I'd love to sit here all night with you talking about things like when you broke in your first mitt --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was insensitive of me, wasn't it, T H E O D O R E? But let's cut to the chase, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So apologize!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
A tense silence fills the room. All eyes are on Ted, who can't figure out what the fuck this guy wants.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Sigfried looks hard with disbelief at Ted, who winces back.
</DIRECTION>
<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are really beginning to annoy me, Theodore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
Sigfried throws another handful of pills into his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, obviously you two are working something out and if I could help you with your problem I would.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you saying? Are you saying I got a problem? Are you trying to say I don't give her what she needs? That I'm FUCKING INSENSITIVE!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, is this about another man? Or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Ted has struck a raw nerve. Sigfried's mood swings drastically; he bends down next to Ted.
</DIRECTION>
<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get our ABC's right, here, Theodore. Theodore, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ted's better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ted, okay... Are you saying my wife cheats on me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say that... I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, for Christ's sake, Theodore, this is about as intimate a situation as you can get, you, me, and Angela here. It's pretty cozy. To say nothing of how stupid an idea it is to lie to a man with a loaded gun without considering the possible response. I demand an apology!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
The phone rings.
</DIRECTION>
<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move. I've got to take this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
Sigfried glances at it. Then to Angela. He picks up the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We ain't got any needles here, kid. Just a big fucking gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
He listens to the other line, says good-bye, and hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, where was I? Oh yeah, I remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
Sigfried kneels next to Ted and assumes a prayer position.
</DIRECTION>
<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to pray for forgiveness, Theodore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
Sigfried, hands clasped together, signals for Ted to do the same. The gun lies at his side. Ted considers a bold move, but thinks better of it. Sigfried's eyes pop open. He cuts a look to Ted, signaling him to assume the pose.
</DIRECTION>
<SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now say after me, "I apologize..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I apologize...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
Ted looks to Angela for help. She can only stare back with intense, wide-open eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For fucking what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That I said you might have been unfaithful?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"That I said you might have been unfaithful?" Listen, Theodore, you're in church here... you're kneeling in front of an altar. Truth... truth is all it hears. Say the following, "I, Theodore, must humbly and sincerely apologize for saying that you fucked another man!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
Ted repeats what Sigfried has told him. This appears to have a calming effect on Sigfried, who gets up off the floor, turning his face to Angela.
</DIRECTION>
<SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Satisfied?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
Angela nods.
</DIRECTION>
<SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you accept the fucking apology?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
Naturally, Angela says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You always gotta get the last word, don't you? It's one way with you, Angela, isn't it? I give and I give and I get nothing back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
Sigfried turns to Ted.
</DIRECTION>
<SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She just sits there waiting for me to jump through hoops...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
Angela attempts to speak through the gag. Both men wait with bated breath for a response. Sigfried's had enough.
</DIRECTION>
<SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stupid me, for a second I thought you were going to say something... something like, "I'm sorry." HA! "I'm sorry." You're absolutely right, love cakes, I wouldn't want it that way. That's one thing you can say about Angela. She'll never do anything she doesn't want to do. If the feeling ain't there, she just isn't going to do it. There is nothing in this world as fucked as a woman who gives when she doesn't want to. Never let that happen to you, Theodore. It makes you feel very little indeed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
Ted beckons Sigfried.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mind if I...?

<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead. Spit it out.

</SIGFRIED>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mean to upset you further, sir, but I think she was trying to say yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you condescending to me, Theodore?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely not, I would never do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you just say it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That you think I'm an idiot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would never say that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think you're superior to me, don't ya, Theodore? You don't think I notice there is a gag in the woman's mouth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course you do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naturally "of course." And do you know how I know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<SIGFRIED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I PUT THE GAG IN HER MOUTH! I'm gonna let you in on a little secret about communication, Theodore. It's all in the eyes...

	<DIALOGUE>

	Or me? Him or me? No one? Okay. Let's drag it out.

Sigfried empties the last of the pills into his mouth, heaving the empty bottle over his shoulder. He takes off, disappearing into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted finds himself alone with Angela. They lock eyes. Angela implores Ted to lean forward. Ted sizes up the situation: His chances of making it to the door are slim due to the fact that he would have to pass by the bathroom door. Ted paces back and forth in front of Angela, who struggles to get his attention. He whips around and they face off in what appears to be a game of charades. Ted finally gets the point and cautiously removes the gag from Angela's mouth. Angela spits an old sock out.
</DIRECTION>

	I used to have a little bunny rabbit named Teddy, it looked real cute nibbling on Angela's ear. Only problem here is you're no bunny rabbit, Theodore, and it really fuckin' razzes me to picture you doin' it. But don't let me stop you, Teddy... no need to play sneaky-poo.

Ted starts to back toward the door.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said, nibble, asshole! Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
The directness of Sigfried's command, coupled with the SOUND of a trigger being cocked, forces Ted to approach Angela. Angela is a stunning beauty, and Ted being kind of a shy guy makes for an awkward situation. Ted leans forward. As he closes in, Angela's eyes close.

Ted struggles to free himself from Sigfried's powerful bear hug and blasts out the following monologue.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is not Theodore, it's TED, TED, TED, T... E... D... TED... NOT TEDDY, NOT THEODORE... TED... Yes, my mother did me the service of naming me Theodore and I haven't a clue as to how you know that because everyone who knows that lives a long way away from here. Do you have any idea what it's like to go to school where all the other kids' parents are in jail doing time for crimes like grand larceny, aggravated assault, burglary and murder, and you get stuck with a mother who names you Theodore and dressed you up in little matching pink outfits with, get this, a little blue bow fucking tie! Well, I'll tell you what happens. Pretty soon Theodore becomes "Theo the Thumper," and when Theo the Thumper gets old enough, he packs his bags and goes thousands of miles away where he can put the whole bloody mess behind him. So, if you don't mind, shoot me now, because no one is going to call me that again. My name is Ted, okay? Got it? TED!

<DIRECTION>
Sigfried holds onto Ted's hand. The soft sound of distant fireworks pops in the background. Car horns and a muffled countdown signal that it's New Year's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sigfried moves uncomfortably close to Ted and from out of nowhere bolts forward, planting a wet kiss right on Ted's mouth. Something snaps in Sigfried. He is either really getting off on this or he is caught in the grips of a seizure. He doubles back on the floors. Ted and Angela watch as he flops around like a flounder with the cocked gun waving all over the place. Ted wipes his mouth with his jacket sleeve while trying to dodge the barrel of the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay, mister? I'll get help!

Sigfried manages to steady the gun and point it directly at Ted. He signals for Ted to go to the bathroom.

INT. BATHROOM--SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted enters the bathroom, which appears shaken by an earthquake. Towels and wet clothes are all over the place. An evening gown is flushed halfway down the toilet and pills are everywhere. Sigfried is shouting from the other room to hurry. Ted checks the cabinet, searching for a bottle marked "Nitro." No luck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted spots a small window set above the toilet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He figures this is the best chance he's got to make a break.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted goes for it. He manages to get his head and one arm through the window before he gets stuck. His legs dangle in the bathroom. Struggle as he may, he can only hit the toilet- bowl lever, which sends a loud FLUSH SOUND out through the apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<SIGFRIED>

	It's no time to take a leak, Teddy, I'm fucking dying here!

</SIGFRIED>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside the window, Ted's in another world. He's almost safe. It's a strange feeling, kind of like bathing in warm water in paradise, knowing a huge shark is ready to rip his ass off. He can see the flickering red glowing light from the witches' room from the floor below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW AND BELOW--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted sees Eva bopping naked past the window. He shouts her name out, to no avail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC drowns out his voice and they ignore his calls for help. The blood rushes to his head. He lets himself hang there for a moment. He wonders how many other people have found themselves in situations like this before him. Probably everyone. Right next to his face, Ted recognizes a bloody hand print. It's not his blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW AND ABOVE--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted hears a sound from above and twists himself around, spotting a young man (previously seen as the Yuppie Scumbag on the phone) leaning out of the window directly above him. After a quick moment of sizing him up, Ted gathers himself.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. Something's wrong with the guy, all the blood is drained from his face and he is mumbling something.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, I'm stuck here in a situation that I can't even begin to explain, but would you be so kind as to get help? Could you call the police, please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
The young man manages to belt out the word "ice" just before hurling a mouthful of vomit toward Ted. It takes all Ted's strength to dodge the puke and pull himself back into the bathroom. He falls back on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He props himself up and checks for damage. He notices something odd... the room is silent. No Sigfried. He walks into the bedroom.

<DIRECTION>
Ted looks around the still room. No one's there.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sigfried?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
He heads toward the door and, from out of the corner of his eye, he spots Sigfried's hairy leg. Sigfried has passed out on the floor. Angela's chair has been knocked on its side. Ted races over to help lift her back up. He pulls the gag from her mouth. Angela jumps all over him.

Ted turns on a dime and runs smack into Sigfried, who's been taking in the whole conversation.

Sigfried turns an icy eye on Ted, who has given up all hope of ever getting out of the room.

Sigfried tries jamming the sock back in her mouth to stop the flow; she manages to give him a "fuck of a bite" in the process. Meanwhile, Ted figures this to be his moment to make a move and bolts for the door, only to be tackled by Sigfried at the one-yard line. After a struggle, the two men rest on the floor, catching their breath in a relaxed embrace.

<SIGFRIED>

	You're lying, but I can respect that, Ted. If you told me, it would no longer be a secret, and secrets have a power, kid. You open that box and they disappear forever. A bad secret will rip you apart, but the good one are all you got. In the end, when all the people you knew are dead and gone, all you'll have left are you secrets. And when you die, the box is open and it all blows away -- dust to dust -- all the anger, jealousy, desire and love just blow away.

It could be as small as a little spark, but it will cut a path straight through all that blackness, straight to you. It could be another boat, or some distant fire on an island, but that light will shed a shining path of diamonds cutting through mile after mile of darkness to lie at your feet. That's love, Ted, it's like a path of light in an ocean of darkness.

Man hangs up the phone and stubs out his cigarette into an already overstuffed ashtray by the bed. Man turns around to face the camera. He is a dark and handsome Latin male in his mid-30s. Dangerous. Impatient.

He walks toward the camera as he continues straightening his tie.

He stops at the door of the bathroom and watches his Wife and two kids get ready for the party. Wife seems to be a beautiful woman in her mid-30s. The children are Sarah, nine, and Juancho, six.

Man strikes up another cigarette and finishes his tie.

Wife seems to be taking out her aggressions on the tangled mess.

Man is starting to have problems of his own with Juancho's hair. Juancho's hair is thinner than Man's, so it won't stay up.

Man puts down his cigarette in order to get a better handle on it. We see the frustration growing in his face.

Juancho picks up the cigarette and pretends he's smoking too, just like his dad.

Man tears the cigarette away from Juancho and smokes it down to the filter. He looks at his own cool hair, and then down at Juancho's, which won't stay up.

Wife goes straight for the door.

<MAN>

He blows one kiss. One for both of them.

As Man and his Wife walk out the door, Man turns back to the children...

He closes the door.
</DIRECTION>

Sarah stands in the middle of the room. She's looking at the door Man and Wife just disappeared through. Stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her dress looks frilly and beautifully uncomfortable. She touches the edges of the fabric.

Juancho shuts off the television. He drops the remote to the floor. His attention is on the fireworks outside. He leaps to the window and begins unlatching it.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>

</SARAH>
<JUANCHO>

</JUANCHO>
<DIRECTION>
Man bursts through the door of the hotel room and stands in the doorway, glaring at the mischievous Juancho.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.

Ted looks around, bewildered. Now what?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Man is reaching into his coat pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>

	You want five hundred bucks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure!

Man hesitates a moment, then pulls out his wallet. That was too easy.

</MAN>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can call out and hire a babysitter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't trust babysitters. My children are safer alone than with some fucked- up pedophile babysitter I don't know from the man in the fucking moon.

Man lets go of Ted's face. He feels his jaw. It's still there.

<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, sir, I'd like to help you out, but I really can't. I'm all alone here tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Man whips out his wallet and counts out money in Ted's face.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One hundred... two hundred... three hundred...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you said five hundred.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Man glares at Ted.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said three hundred.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ted doesn't back down.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you distinctly said five hundred.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
The angrier Man gets, the quieter he talks.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You calling me a liar?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ted, while not backing down, massages the situation.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm not saying you're lying. I'm saying you accidentally forgot that what you first said was five hundred.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Man has never been challenged like this by a fuckin' bellboy.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't do anything accidentally, jerk. I might've first said five hundred, but what I last said was three hundred, and what you say last is what counts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ted not only doesn't back down, but psychologically pokes his finger in the scary Man's chest.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well then, if you say five hundred one last time, we got a deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Man's eyes narrow. He physically pokes his finger in Ted's chest.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fuckin' with me, Pendejo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Now Ted takes a step backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not at all. It's New Year's Eve and I'm here alone. If there was somebody else here, no problem, but I'm by myself. And looking after your kids is a pain in the ass I don't need --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You callin' my kids a pain in the ass?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- No, they're not a pain in the ass, it's the situation that's a pain in the ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Man drops the tenseness.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you were right the first time. You win, tough guy, five hundred.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Man respects Ted for not backing down, but not insulting him either. A skill Man never learned. Wife shoots a look at the children.
</DIRECTION>
<WIFE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You kids are getting expensive.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP of name tag.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. It's Ted.

</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Man tears off Ted's name tag and throws it to children.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His name is Ted. If you need anything, dial 0 and ask for Ted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah catches the name tag and reads the name on it: "TED -- BELLHOP."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah looks up at Ted. She clips the pin to her dress and smiles shyly at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Man puts the money in Ted's pocket and then grabs his ear, pulling him close.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
<DIRECTION>

	If something happens to my children, I wouldn't want to be you.

As Man and Wife exit, he turns to the kids and says:

ROOM 716

Ted is standing facing the door the Man and Wife just disappeared through. He turns around slowly to face the children.

<DIRECTION>
His eyes are wide. His face is quiet. Stern.

The children are staring at him.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. These are the rules. Don't break the rules and I won't break your necks.

The kids look at each other.

Sarah laughs at his joke.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Except they were joking. I'm not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Ted goes to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The rules are simple. Don't do anything you wouldn't do if your parents were here. If there's an emergency, call me on the phone, like your dad said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not what he said.
	</DIALOGUE>

Ted's surprised by a challenge this early in the game.

<SARAH>

	He said to call if we need anything.

</SARAH>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I've got a lot of work to do and I can't have you calling me every time you want a drink of water, so please limit your calls to emergencies only.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We paid you five hundred dollars. We'll call you if we need anything. You don't want to upset my dad.

Juancho smells his feet.

Sarah realizes he found a Nudie station.

Juancho rolls up in a ball, the remote tucked in some recess of his stomach.

ROOM 716

Angry, Sarah slams down the phone. She has an unusually adult temper. We know where she gets it from. She looks up and sees that the nudies are still in full force.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Change the channel, now!

Juancho turns around. He has a face like someone just laid a fart in his nose.

<JUANCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, you're the one with the stinky feet.

</JUANCHO>

She sticks her foot out for Juancho to smell. He's reluctant. Fearful.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>

	Go ahead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
He slowly, very slowly... climbs onto the bed and lowers his head to her foot. Very slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah waits until he's close enough to her foot before she kicks him in the face, sending him somersaulting off the bed and crashing to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs the remote control he left behind and changes the channel to a cartoon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juancho gets up and realizes his defeat. He decides to wander about. Looking for something to do...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah tries to ignore him as he stalks the room. It's only a matter of time before he finds mischief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juancho sees the champagne bucket and Bingo!, he goes for the bottle.

<JUANCHO>
<DIRECTION>
(holding up the bottle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, get a bottle opener!

Sarah opens her mouth, as if about to tell him to leave the champagne alone. She stops herself when she realizes she wants some champagne too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She quickly scrambles about for a bottle opener while Juancho unwraps the bottle top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah opens the dresser drawer with such force that a few hidden contents long forgotten in the back of the drawer slide forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some coins, a paperclip, and a hypodermic needle. She looks down at the needle that lays beside the Gideon Bible and casually picks the phone back up and punches 0. The phone rings.

Ted, bucket of ice in his hand, gets ready to go to room 404. As he crosses the desk, the phone rings. He looks at the board and see room 716's light blinking.

	I thought I'd tell you that your cleaning ladies are doing a bum job. There's all kinds of leftover stuff around here.

Sarah picks up the needle and rolls it over in her hand several times.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>

	Needles and things. We're not supposed to have needles here, are we? I mean, they don't come with the room, do they? Send someone up here to clean this place up right.

The champagne bottle explodes all over Juancho. He looks surprised.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I TOLD YOU NOT TO SHAKE IT!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta go. My brother just exploded the champagne all over the room. Oh, and bring us a couple of toothbrushes. There's a card in the bathroom that says you'll bring free toothbrushes if we ask for them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
She hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A frustrated Ted hangs up the phone. He walks briskly to the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah and Juancho are pouring themselves champagne. They turn up the television and drink. Juancho shudders at the taste, but tries to drink as much as Sarah.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah clearly doesn't like it, but tries to pretend she does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah picks up an instruction card near the phone to see how to make room-to-room calls.

Sarah punches in the room number. The phone rings.

She holds the needle up to the light to examine it.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Hi. You don't know me, and I don't know you, but... do you have any needles? We've got needles here and I was wondering if they come with the room or not. Don't have any? Thanks. Just checking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
She hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juancho puts down his champagne glass and searches his father's coat pocket. He finds a pack of cigarettes and takes one out. He puts it in his mouth and pretends to smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah checks out the hypodermic needle carefully. She has an idea.

Sarah stands atop the chest of drawers and uses the lipstick to draw a bull's-eye on one of the hotel art paintings. She writes numbers next to each circle representing points.

Juancho is standing at the foot of the bed, cigarette hanging out of his mouth, as he practices his dart-throwing technique.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The center is the bull's eye, 100 points, this one's 10 points, this one's 20 points.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
WHACK! The needle lands an inch from her face in the 20-point slot.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, wait a minute. Let me get out of the way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah, a little tipsy now, grabs the needle and staggers to the bed. She hears the key in the doorway and throws the needle into the curtain to hide it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted enters the room, somewhat disheveled from his encounter with Sigfried. He has a tray and a new bottle of champagne.

He puts the champagne bottle into the empty bucket. He spots the original bottle lying on the floor half empty and dripping into the carpet.

Sarah gives up and throws the cracker back onto the tray. She's a little drunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted picks up the ruined champagne bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juancho dips his crackers and eats them. He makes a face and drops a soggy cracker onto the tray.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No crackers? Okay, fine. Sleepy time. Now, I don't want you guys wandering around, so if you need to go to the restroom, go now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
They go to the bathroom. Ted sits on the bed. Waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees the painting on the wall but can't figure out what's different about it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The red lipstick blends right into the aesthetic value of the painting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted smells something funny. He looks down and sees the socks on the bed. He grabs a fork from the tray and uses it to throw the socks across the room.

The kids come back out.

The kids lie on the bed.

Sarah notices a jar of Mentholatum ointment on the dinner tray.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, this is just some Mentholatum ointment. Come on, under the covers. Close your eyes and I'll tell you a story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
The children close their eyes. Ted opens the jar of the ointment and sniffs it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Strong stuff by the look on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your dad says he doesn't trust babysitters. I don't blame him. You know what my babysitter did to me once?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never told my parents, either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
The children lie in the bed, eyes closed, listening intently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted dips his fingers in the jar of vaporous ointment.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hated going to sleep. You know, it's nighttime and you wanna run around and act crazy. So what my babysitter did to make sure I'd go to sleep and not be tempted to get up, was, she'd take some of this vapor rub stuff... Can you smell this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Eyes closed, the kids inhale. They smell the ointment and nod yes.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, she'd just dab a little of this over each eyelid, so that I would be sure and keep my eyes closed all night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Ted is spreading the ointment over their eyelids as he says this.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There. Now you've got some, too! Don't open your eyes or it'll burrrn, burn, burn. The smell helps clear your sinuses too, so it's doing double duty.

AFTER A MOMENT OF DARKNESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment of darkness, the night is disturbed by the loud crashing of fireworks outside the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah sits up, eyes closed. Her face feels the warmth coming from the window and she tilts her head toward it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light of the fireworks dances its reflections off her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She inhales deeply... then makes a sour face. She goes for the bathroom, arms outstretched like a blind girl. She gets to the bathroom, turns on the light, and searches for the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She begins to wash the ointment off her eyes very carefully. She dries her eyes thoroughly and opens them... checks them in the mirror. A little red, but otherwise fine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes back into the bedroom, turns on the television and grabs the new champagne bottle. She shakes it violently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juancho wakes. He turns his head to her. His eyes are still closed.
</DIRECTION>
<JUANCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you watching TV?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUANCHO>
<DIRECTION>
The champagne bottle explodes. She pours herself a glass.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep. If you wanna watch too, you have to go wash your face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
Juancho gets up smiling and tries to run to the bathroom. He slams into the wall, hard.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be careful...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
Juancho walks into the bathroom a little slower, more cautious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah pours herself another glass. She downs the glass and shudders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She smells the bad smell again. Only now she really smells it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She smells her feet. Nothing. She smells the champagne. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juancho enters the room and sits on the bed. Sarah grabs his foot and smells it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She drops his foot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juancho stares blankly at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah looks down at the mattress. She smells the mattress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juancho looks at her as if she's drunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah leaps off the bed and turns on the room lights. She takes a huge swig from the champagne bottle, then stalks toward the mattress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juancho leaps off the bed as well and stands back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah pulls the mattress off of the bedsprings enough to see what is underneath it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juancho screams. Sarah is too stunned to scream. Stuffed into the bedsprings is a woman's dead and beaten corpse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Ted's phone ringing.

Ted is quiet on the line. Thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juancho lights up a cigarette for real and takes nervous puffs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah carries the phone over to Juancho and snatches the cigarette away from him. She stuffs it in her own mouth and nervously takes a long drag on it.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You never tried it, did you? Then you agree I'm smarter than you...

She drinks from her champagne bottle. She's pulling the mattress back over the corpse again.

She's drunk all right.

He sees Juancho with the cigarette hanging out of his mouth and rips it away from him. The butt goes flying onto the carpet near the spreading champagne spill.

Vomit spews out of Ted's mouth.

Sarah steps back, almost tripping over the champagne bottle. She picks up the bottle and holds it defensively in case Ted tries to retaliate. Ted spins around, now noticing the needle sticking out of his leg.

	Jesus!!

ROOM 716

Ted tries to pull the syringe out of his leg, but yanking it makes it break in two, the plunger in his hand, and the needle still stuck in his leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted staggers and grabs hold of the dead woman's foot for support as he steps on the remote control, flipping the TV on to the Nudie channel, just as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Man opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Man stands at the door, drunk Wife unconscious on one arm, the door knob in the other hand. He's looking mean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Man's POV: focused on the dead woman in the bedsprings. We pan up the dead woman's leg to find Ted holding her foot. We pan down Ted's leg to find the hypodermic needle jutting out... then pan over to the other hand holding the broken syringe plunger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pan over to the Nudie channel, then down to the fire blazing behind the children. Pan up to the dripping champagne bottle in Sarah's hand, then over to the cigarette hanging out of Juancho's mouth. Juancho tosses his cigarette out of his mouth to an area behind him. Another blaze starts immediately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Man drops his Wife to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the WIDE SHOT of Ted and the children, we see that the fireworks are bursting big and bright outside the window behind them. Almost as bright as the flames eating through the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Man simply glares at Ted. Finally Man speaks...
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>

<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the problem? I don't got a problem, I got fuckin' problems! Wanna hear?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, most recently, there's room 716. There's a scary Mexican gangster dude pokin' his finger in my chest. There's his hooligan kids snapping their fingers at me. There's the putrid rotting corpse of a dead whore stuffed in the springs of a bed. There're rooms blazing afire... There's a needle from God knows where stuck in my leg, infecting me with God knows what, and finally, there's me walking out the fuckin' door right now! Buenas noches.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
A RINGING SOUND happens that we haven't heard before. Ted's head turns toward it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the guest board. And the top light, the penthouse, is ringing. It rings where all the others buzzed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Betty can hear it distinctly on her side of the line. The sound fully wakes her up. They start talking Howard Hawks style again.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly alert)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that the penthouse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<TED>

<BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
(panicking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Ted, wait a minute. I know you're freaked, I know you're stressed. You've had a real bad night --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Betty, I've had-a-real-bad-night --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- You say there's a dead body in a room?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem, this is a hotel, we've had dead bodies before, it's just the price of doing business. You said the hotel was on fire. Is it still on fire?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, sprinkler system worked like a charm. Now, you wanna leave, you've had enough. Perfectly understandable. I'll take care of everything else. The only thing I ask is that you take care of Chester Rush. Then you can leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, look --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ted, he's a very important guest of this hotel. In fact, he is the most important guest at the hotel. The Mon Signor used to be a haven for movie stars. Through the thirties and forties, and the first half of the fifties, more movie stars -- if you break it down on a night-by-night basis -- stayed at the Mon Signor than any other hotel in Hollywood. Now, we had some hard time in the eighties, even though we were the official hotel of Cannon Pictures, but we're coming back strong in the nineties. And a movie star clientele is important to that comeback. If we can keep stars of his magnitude happy, we're on our way. So, Ted, just take care of him, then you can leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I don't feel like --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He probably just wants some champagne! You can do that, can't you? Please just take care of him, the entire staff of the Mon Signor is begging you!

Ted crumbles.

	Okay. But get your ass here pronto.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HALLWAY TO PENTHOUSE--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator door opens and Ted wheels out his tray into the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's been a bit of an effort to make himself appear a bit less disheveled than in the last scene. He's only minorly successful in the attempt. His uniform still looks like shit, his hair looks tousled, and he walks with a limp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wheels the cart up to the penthouse door and KNOCKS at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A woman opens the door, it's Angela from Alex's story.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Theodore.

	Having a drink.

From behind her we hear:

<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Entrez, entrez.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Angela steps aside and Ted wheels in the tray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENTHOUSE--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The penthouse is huge, far and away the best suite in the house. And standing in the middle of the biggest room in the hotel is the hottest, newest comedy star to burst onto the Hollywood scene in nearly a decade: Chester Rush. At this moment in time, he's the king, and he has the swagger of a new king. After only one movie, he's pulled the sword out of the stone. And the look on his face says, "King's good." Surrounding him is his entourage. They all look like once upon a time this evening they were dressed sharp; however, at this late hour, everybody looks about as disheveled as Ted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the lads, Norman, has planted roots in a comfy chair with his leg thrown over the arm and a bottle of Jim Beam in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second guy, Leo, is in the back of the room pacing back and forth on the telephone. He is completely oblivious to the rest of the room's activity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In Chester's hand is an ever present glass of champagne, which he constantly spills as he gestures wildly. Around the room are the leftovers: pizza boxes, fast-food hamburgers, and empty bottles of Cristal Champagne.
</DIRECTION>
<CHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(still sitting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Entrez, entrez, come in, come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, sorry I took so long, but I got everything you asked for --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Not a problem, my friend Mr. Bellboy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<ANGELA>
<DIRECTION>
(closing the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His name's Theodore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELA>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, it's not Theodore,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he throws a look at Angela)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Ted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Chester rises from the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Ted the Bellboy, as I was saying -- would you care for some champagne? That's not what I was saying, but would you care for some champagne?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ya sure? Cristal. It's the best. I never liked champagne before I had Cristal, now I love it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, yeah, sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
As Chester goes and pours Ted a glass:
</DIRECTION>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- As I was saying, Ted, don't worry about being late. For our purposes, promptness is far behind thoroughness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
On "thoroughness," he hands Ted the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chin-chin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
They clink glasses and drink.
</DIRECTION>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whadya say, Ted?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not thank you. Whadya say about the tasty beverage?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuckin' good, Ted. It's fuckin' good. Let's try it again, shall we? So, Ted, whadya think about the beverage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's fuckin' good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bet your sweet bippy, Ted. It's fuckin' Cristal, everything else is piss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Norman in the chair starts yelling at Ted.
</DIRECTION>
<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bellboy! Bellboy! Bellboy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ted knows he's being laughed at, but not why.
</DIRECTION>
<CHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Norman)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knock it off, you're making my friend Ted here uneasy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pay no attention to Norman here, Ted, he's just fuckin' wit' ya, that's all. That's from Quadrophenia. Now me, myself, when I think of bellboys I think of -- "bellboy" isn't an insult, is it? Is there another name for what you do that I'm ignorant of? Bellman, bellperson --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bellboy's fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. I'm glad they haven't changed that. There's a friendliness to "bellboy." As I was saying, Ted, when Norman thinks of bellboys, he thinks of Quadrophenia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
But me, when I think of bellboys, I think of The Bellboy, with Jerry Lewis. Didja ever see The Bellboy?
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should, it's one of Jerry's better movies. He never says a word through the entire film. A completely silent performance. How many actors can pull that off? And he has to go to France to get respect. That says it all about America right there. The minute Jerry Lewis dies, every paper in this fuckin' country gonna write articles calling the man a genius. It's not right. It's not right and it's not fair. But why should that surprise anybody? When has America ever been fair? We might be right every once in a while, but we're very rarely fair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where do you want this?

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not particularly.

</TED>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, then stop playing "Beat the Clock." Now let me introduce you to everybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his arm around Ted and leads him around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Angela crosses frame, drink in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our friend from downstairs you already seem to be acquainted with.

As she snuggles up in a big comfy chair:
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, me and Theodore go way back. Don't we, Theodore?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELA>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The name's Ted, Angela. I only let people with loaded guns at my head call me Theodore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Angela's like you, Ted, a newfound friend.

<DIRECTION>
(arm around Ted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Man sitting in the chair, with the bottle of Jim Bean in his hand and the sense of humor, is Norman. Norman, say hello to Ted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Norman shakes his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The sociable son of a bitch on the telephone is Leo. And the person on the other end of the phone is his lovely wife Ellen.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Leo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leo, say hello to Ted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Leo breaks away from his phone conversation for two seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<LEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Ted, glad you could make it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(back to phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does punctuality have to do with love?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEO>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which brings me to me, Chester Rush, Ted. Pleased to meetcha.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Chester shakes Ted's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I'm sorry I haven't seen your movie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Chester stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted wonders if he should have said that.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chester walks over to the table and pours himself some more champagne. When he talks now it's slower and somewhat distracted. The tone of the scene starts changing.
</DIRECTION>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's quite all right, Ted, nothing to feel sorry about. That's why God invented video. But you know, Ted, a lot of people did see it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Chester takes a drink of champagne, a disgusted look crosses his face, and he slowly puts it down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His manner gives the room a chill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he talks, he addresses the room.
</DIRECTION>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who drank out of this bottle last?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
No answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chester walks over to Ted and fills his glass.
</DIRECTION>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who drank out of this bottle -- not the other bottles -- this bottle last?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong, Chester?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He spills the champagne from his glass onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's fuckin' flat, Norman, that's what's wrong. The champagne -- the fuckin' Cristal's fuckin' flat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Chester improvises a temper tantrum about the flat Cristal. Everyone looks at him, not knowing what to say. Even Leo walks over to witness. The whole room is uneasy and a little frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Chester finishes his tantrum, he turns his attention back to Ted. As he talks to him, he opens up another bottle. But it's not the rapid-pace delivery Chester has done so far. It's more troubled and distracted.
</DIRECTION>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was saying, Ted, a lot of people did see it. And not just on video, either. Leo, what was the final take on domestic?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Leo is still in the doorway making sure his boy's cool.
</DIRECTION>
<LEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	72.1 million.

<DIRECTION>
(worried tone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay, champ?

</LEO>
<CHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(struggling with bottle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm cool, so talk to your wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Leo turns his attention back to the phone and goes inside the room.
</DIRECTION>
<CHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	72.1 million dollars. That's before video and before foreign, and before pay-TV and before free TV. We're talking fuckin' asses in fuckin' seats.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he pops the cork)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before all that other shit, The Wacky Detective made 72.1 million dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Chester walks over to Ted and fills his glass.
</DIRECTION>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And my new one, The Dog Catcher, it's projected to break a hundred.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
They both drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tantrum's over, and Chester's back to his fast-talking, good-natured self.
</DIRECTION>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now let's stroll over here and see what goodies you brought us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mind me asking what's all this stuff for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<CHESTER>

	One thing at a time, Ted. I'm not a frog and you're not a bunny, so let's not jump ahead. C'mon, Norman, you should be interested in this.

Ted doesn't know what anybody's talking about, which is just fine with him. He finishes laying out everything on the bar and says:

<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's everything, so if you don't need me for anything else, I'll go back downstairs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<CHESTER>

	Not so fast, Ted. We ain't quite done yet. Why don't you take a seat at the bar, get comfortable, and have an open mind when we explain the festivities of the evening to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, guys, you paid for the room. As long as you don't break up the furniture, you can do whatever the fuck you want. And me personally, I don't care if you break up the furniture. You don't have to explain anything to me. Whatever constitutes a good time as far as you guys are concerned is your business.

</TED>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's your business, Ted. 'Cause we want you to take part.

	First off, let me say that there's nothing homosexual about what we're going to ask you to do. There's nothing sexual at all about what we want. But I was thinkin' you might be thinkin' we want you to do some sex thing. Pee on us, suck us off, shit like that. Let me assure you nothing could be farther from what we want --

</TED>
<LEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you'd remember it all right. In the show, Peter Lorre makes a bet that Steve McQueen can't light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row. Now if Steve McQueen can light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row, he wins Peter Lorre's new car. If he can't he loses his little finger.

Norman lays an issue of Hot Classic Cars in front of Ted on the bar. On the cover is a picture of Chester smiling, standing next to a beautiful 1964 red convertible Chevy Corvelle. The headline reads: "Hollywood's Hottest New Star Next to America's Hottest Old Car."

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you take a good look at that machine that this motherfucker over here is standing next to. That's a 1964 nigger-red, rag-top Chevy Corvelle. And I love that car more'n I love hips, lips, and fingertips. Cut to we sittin' here celebrating, gettin' high, drinkin' champagne --
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMAN>
<CHESTER>

</CHESTER>
<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- drinkin' Cristal. Watchin' TV. "Rockin' New Year's Eve." When all of a sudden we flip on Steve McQueen and Peter Lorre bein' fuckin' badass. And I look at this funny motherfucker over here, and I say, "I'd do that for the Chevelle."

<NORMAN>

	I think that pretty much goes without sayin'. We'd probably chicken out. But when you're fucked-up, you don't lie. You tell the fuckin' truth. And the fuckin' truth is, my lucky Zippo's gonna win me Chester's car.

<LEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not? Life don't get much more exciting than this. I mean if Norman was puttin' his dick on the choppin' block, I'd step in, 'cause, ya know in the morning, we'd really regret that.

	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Ted, my old granddaddy used ta say: "The less a man makes declarative statements, the less he's apt to look foolish in retrospect." Now there're some inherent obstacles in this undertaking. First of all, I'm not some sick fuck like Peter Lorre on that show, travelin' the countryside collecting fingers. We're all buddies, here. Nobody wants Norman to lose his finger. We just wanna chop it off. So if fate doesn't smile on ol' Norman, we'll put his finger on ice and rush 'im to a hospital, where in all likelihood be able to sew it back on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHESTER>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hopefully.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<LEO>

	Eighty percent.

</LEO>
<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMAN>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Norman's protected. His interests have been looked after. My interests, on the other hand, have not. I am as emotionally attached to my car as Norman is physically to his finger. I'm putting up a very expensive piece of machinery on this wager. Now, if I lose, I lose, I have no problem with that. I'm a big boy, I knew what I was doing. However, if I win, I wanna win. If Norman lights his lighter ten times in a row, he's gonna have no emotional problems about taking my car keys whatsoever. But if I win, it's not inconceivable that Leo or myself, at the last minute, might not be able to wield the ax. Which brings us full circle to you, Ted. Sober Ted. Clear-eyed Ted. We want you to be the diceman.

</TED>
<CHESTER>

	Maybe you will and maybe you won't, but that has nothing to do with this hundred-dollar bill in my hand. You can tell us all to go fuck off and walk right out that door. But if you sit back down and wait sixty seconds before you do it, you'll be a hundred dollars richer.

Ted thinks.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take your money, and I'll sit back down. But a minute from now, I'm gonna walk out the door, and when I do, there'll be no hard feelings?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<CHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he lays another bill on the pile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some, which have no meaning, are insignificant and you forget them. And some that stick with you for the rest of your natural life --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he lays another bill on the pile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- barring Alzheimer's of course. Now, what we're proposing is so unusual, so outside the norm, that I think it would be a pretty good guess that this will be one of those experiences that sticks. So, since you're gonna be stuck remembering this moment for the rest of your life, you gotta decide what that memory will be.

(He lays down the
</DIRECTION>

In his right hand is his Zippo lighter, poised and ready to strike.

Norman readies himself.

Places his thumb on the wheel in the Zippo.

Takes a breath.

Without missing a beat, Ted brings down the cleaver, slicing off Norman's pinky.

INT. HALLWAY--AFTER DAWN

<DIRECTION>
CAMERA is positioned at far end of hallway, looking down it at the elevator at the other end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted walks out of the penthouse in the f.g. In a MEDIUM SHOT, he takes the thousand dollars in his hand, looks at it, smiles, and sticks it in his pocket. It might've been a bad night, but it's been a profitable one. He chuckles at the irony, and, whistling a happy tune, turns his back on the camera and walks down the hall to the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the while we hear PANDEMONIUM breaking out behind the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Ted walks to the elevator, the CREDITS ROLL. He waits for the elevator, it arrives, he gets in, the doors close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As CREDITS CONTINUE TO ROLL, we hold for about two beats... then...

The door BURSTS open and everybody comes piling out. Everybody's screaming, yelling different things to one another. Norman has a bloody towel wrapped around his hand, he's screaming and crying.

Chester has the bucket of ice with the finger in it. Leo's trying to direct everything. Everybody's in frantic activity, except for Angela, who stands back, drinks her drink, and watches the show. They all run down the hall, toward the elevator. Somebody trips and they all hit the ground. The bucket of ice with the finger goes spilling. They run around like crazy, looking for the finger and picking up ice cubes. Norman lies on the floor and screams. They pick it all up, get to the elevator, and push the button.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When it arrives, they all dive in except for Angela.

FOUR ROOMS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Angela sticks her key in the door, then stops when she sees something approaching. The look on her face combines strange awe and mild shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almost floating ethereally, a mysterious Blond Bombshell, wearing Diana's see-through negligee and slippers, armed with Elspeth's sword slung over her shoulder, wanders toward her. She is in a daze, perhaps lost or drunk.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELA>

	Lady, I haven't seen anybody.

Diana quietly says, "Ohhh," as she drifts on down the hall in a daze. Angela puts her hand to her temples before opening her hotel door. She does a double-take on the hallway -- empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pauses a beat, then walks into her room. After the door closes, we hear Sigfried on the other side.
