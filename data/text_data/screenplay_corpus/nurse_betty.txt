INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tense surgery in progress. Meters flicker, instruments flash in the bright overhead light. In the midst of it all stands DR. DAVID RAVELL, 35. The master of his domain. Ravell leans forward so a NURSE can mop the sweat from his brow as he completes a last, delicate procedure. His co workers sigh collectively with relief.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Ravell comes out of surgery, clearly exhausted. Without his surgical mask he is ruggedly handsome. TWO NURSES follow, attending him like a fighter fresh from the ring: CHLOE, 25, Raven-haired and striking, and JASMINE, 24, an exotic mix of African-American and Asian.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAKE DANIELS, 58, the silver-haired Chief Surgeon, rushes up the corridor. On his heels is DR. LONNIE WALSH, 33. Lonnie is also conspicuously handsome, but he'll always be second to David. In everything. The look on Blake's face stops David in his tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<BLAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's been a train crash near Santa Barbara. They're flying an aortal trauma here now. How can I ask you this, David...

David rubs his eyes. Thinks about it.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can do it, Blake.

</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
His bravery isn't lost on the two nurses, although Chloe exchanges a quick, covert glance with Lonnie.

INT. TIP TOP DINER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaint, Midwestern eatery. Knick-knacks and photos abound. The booths and counter are packed with LOCALS. A family dining section off in one corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO GUYS sitting at the counter in team jackets. The older of the two holds up his empty coffee cup. But his WAITRESS, standing a couple seats down from him, doesn't move. She's completely absorbed in watching the soap opera that plays on two battered, fuzzy TV sets. BETTY SIZEMORE, 30, has a wholesome attractiveness that competes with a bit too much makeup and a cheesy white waitress uniform. TWO OTHER WAITRESSES attend to customers behind her. The younger of the two guys is involved in the soap opera. But the older one, still wants coffee. He gestures toward Betty.
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss?

Betty leans forward, grabs the coffee pot and moves in front of him. Without taking her eyes from the TV, she pours the java, which somehow lands in his cup without spilling a drop.

The older gentleman's mouth works a bit but nothing comes out. He is flabbergasted by her attention to detail. She looks at the younger man, who is still following the show and gobbling down a huge bacon burger.

<DIRECTION>
Betty flashes the men a winning smile and moves off, one eye always on the TV as she approaches two local types.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHERIFF ELDEN BALLARD, 32, a short, tightly wound little man, sitting at his own booth. Ballard is spit and polish all the way: creases in his shirt, a glossy shine on his shoes. Badge proudly displayed. He sits with
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROY OSTREY, 31, a gangly, bookish local reporter. Betty drops five ketchup packets and four mayonnaise packets on the table for him. Another smile.
</DIRECTION>

His cup is full before he can even finish the sentence.

	There's yolks in there, huh? It's no prob'... gotta keep you on track.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
Betty grabs Ballard's plate without another word, gives him a reassuring rub on the shoulders and moves off. He smiles appreciatively after her, then turns on Roy.
</DIRECTION>
<BALLARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
	</DIALOGUE>

Still carrying Ballard's plate, she returns to the counter.

Frustrated, Betty delivers several plates and drops them at tables where the people know her by name. She moves off toward FOUR LOCAL GUYS in a booth jangling their empty cups. Betty weaves her way over to them and pours refills. When a hand strays around to touch her ass, she pushes it away with her foot and keeps right on pouring. Absently, Betty takes a look around the restaurant. The other waitresses are gone and no one is behind the grill. Alarmed, she pushes through the double doors into the kitchen.

A row of cheap trailers on both sides of a crumbling driveway. Betty appears with her cardboard man tucked under one arm and then disappears behind a pickup truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tosses the cardboard "David" over a concrete slab wall, climbs over herself and walks straight to the LeSabres. Her key opens the last one - maroon. She puts the doctor on the passenger seat, gets in the car and inhales the new car smell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joyce can be seen inside the trailer, still talking on the phone. She misses the whole scene as she works on her nails.

INT. LESABRE - DRIVING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Betty has the car at 75 m.p.h., on the rural Kansas roads, wheat fields for miles on both sides of her. The RADIO is blasting Bonnie Raitt and she's singing along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees her speed and punches the accelerator ... 80 m.p.h. ... 85 ... 90 m.p.h. She turns the radio up louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she approaches a sign saying "You are leaving Kansas" Betty suddenly becomes self-conscious. She eases up on the gas ... slows down ... does a U-turn and heads back toward Fair Oaks. She glances wistfully in her rear view mirror at the billboard that quickly fades into the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BETTY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Betty enters a modest residential neighborhood and pulls into a driveway. She parks in a detached garage and looks over at the cardboard David. There's no way he's going in the house. She puts him in the trunk and closes the garage door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks several houses down. On her way to the door we hear a DOG BARKING, CHILDREN and GENERAL COMMOTION from inside. SUE ANN ROGERS answers Betty's knock. Her hair is matted with sweat as she struggles with CHILDREN, ages 4, 3 and 6 months. Suddenly, Sue Ann is hit by an errant rubber ball.
</DIRECTION>
<SUE_ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, darling... oww! Sorry, got my own little Gulf War going on here.
	</DIALOGUE>

Betty takes the baby as Sue Ann pulls a videotape from a shelf. It's all one move; they do this every day.

Betty throws her a look as Sue Ann closes the door. Betty turns around, frustrated. She starts yanking her apron off as she crosses the street.

INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DAY

A low-end ranch. A worn-out sofa and loveseat form an 'L' that dominates the living room. Romance novels line a small bookcase. SIX CANARIES in cages chatter away in the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Del sits at the dining room table, agitated. He is presently attacking a pork chop, baked beans and a loaf of Wonderbread. All we hear is A FORK CLICKING and BIRDS CHIRPING. Betty stands at the breakfast counter, barefoot, still in her uniform and quietly eating a salad.

She drops the dishes with a clatter, pours herself a glass of wine, lights the candle on her deflowered cupcake and opens the one card on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a traditional greeting from her grandparents. Red hearts and lace. A color photo of them enclosed.

EXT. BETTY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Del gets out of a black Lincoln Town Car, followed by CHARLIE and WESLEY - the guys in the team jackets from the diner. Charlie is 63 years old. He wears a dress shirt, slacks and docksiders. The suburban father look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wesley is 28. He's in jeans, T-shirt and white Reeboks. Clean cut; the kid who used to mow your parents' lawn.

Betty quickly snaps out the light and closes the door until it is open only a crack.

</CHARLIE>
<WESLEY>

And with a long SCREAM, Wesley rips Del's scalp from his head. It makes a sickening sound like fabric tearing. For a long moment, there is only silence. An eerie silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Del SCREAMS into his socks and thrashes in his seat, blood pouring down his head on all sides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somehow, he manages to get to his feet, the chair still taped to him, and begins smashing into whatever is near. Blood flies and curios shatter as Del thunders through the room. A dying bull, only messier. It's quite a show.

Wesley steps back, staring at the dripping scalp in his hand, as if wondering how it got there. Betty is transfixed, horrified.
</DIRECTION>

Charlie re-enters. The two men look at each other over Del's MUFFLED SCREAMS as he plows headlong into wooden paneling, a china cabinet, and finally, back toward them near the breakfast counter. Del bashes blindly into it.

The flag poles over the CB unit are bare. Duane is in the sleeper cab, his forearms bound to his thighs with duct tape. A telltale piece of Confederate red fabric hangs out of his mouth. There is a purplish bruise on his forehead. He's quiet, but glowering at his captors.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... So, at a rest stop outside Logansport you noticed that two guys were slipping something extra in one of your cars, and you decided to see what it was. Then you figured you'd take this valuable commodity and go into business yourself, even though it didn't belong to you. But you needed a crackerjack salesman to move it, so you made the biggest mistake of your short life and chose Del. Sound right so far?

	You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! - she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.

Roy approaches his fish tank cautiously. He leans down and looks at the piranha as a TV commercial ends and "A Reason to Love" comes on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He then returns to his computer, struggling to find the right words and to type them with only one hand. He types a little, stares at the screen, then deletes an entire sentence one character at a time, hammering on the 'Delete' key. He glances up at the television as the words 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' are repeated.

Betty drives through Boyle Heights - East L.A., holding a map and checking street signs. She is wearing a brand new Nurse's uniform. Up ahead, she sees the hillside complex of L.A. County/USC Hospital. Hurriedly, she pulls over and checks herself in the visor mirror. She is underwhelmed.

INT. HOSPITAL / HALLWAY - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On her way down the hall Betty passes a patient's room when the sound of A PERSON MOANING stops her. She can't help but go inside. A TV plays commercials.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN OLDER WOMAN lies in bed, alone and staring at the ceiling. Betty looks around and notices several arrangements of flowers on a deserted nightstand. She brings them over to the older woman's bedside, positions them, then gently strokes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There... you rest now.

The woman smiles serenely at this and begins to drift off. Betty checks her monitors as the opening credits of "A Reason to Love" begin to play.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She glances up at the doorway at the same moment and sees Dr. David Ravell standing at the entrance. He checks the chart on the door, smiles warmly at Betty and then moves off. In a flash, Betty is up and after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The THEME MUSIC is her private soundtrack as she checks out every man in surgical scrubs, looking for David Ravell. Then... She sees him. In all his glory at the end of a corridor walking away from her. Betty gives chase. She gains steadily on him, her heart racing. As they near Emergency the NOISE LEVEL picks up. He stops at the nurses' station. Betty closes the gap. She starts to run.

INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY AREA - SAME TIME

FIVE AMBULANCES unload patients at the same time. At that moment a group of TWENTY JAPANESE HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS reaches the E.R. portion of their tour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WHITE MERCEDES tears up the ramp and SCREECHES to a stop. A YOUNG MAN in gang colors is pushed out, bleeding heavily. A DOCTOR runs at the Mercedes to head it off, yelling indignantly. The car plows right into him and takes off. Another ambulance crests the ramp, lights flashing. The Mercedes SLAMS into it head-on. NURSES AND DOCTORS run into the parking lot. A GANGBANGER gets out of the Mercedes, dazed and wobbly. He pulls a pistol. Everyone dives for cover.
</DIRECTION>

The Mercedes driver is unconscious. The driver of the smashed up ambulance is slumped over the wheel. The rear doors fly open, and a young Hispanic woman, ROSA HERRERA, leaps out.

Wesley is in the car, but he's too scared to tell Charlie, whose eyes are blazing. Charlie silently walks around to the driver's side and gets in. He and Wesley stare at each other over a photo of Betty, which is between them on the dash. Charlie starts the engine and snatches up the picture.

Wesley's driving now. Charlie's almost unrecognizable: a six day beard, uncombed greasy hair, bloodshot eyes, rumpled clothes and an exhausted, faraway look. The photo of Betty faces him, taped to the glove box. He is reading from the diary, which he clutches like the Bible. They roar along a desert highway, passing a sign that says "Grand Canyon, This Exit. 74 Miles." Charlie looks up, marking his place.

Charlie stares at him, hate rising from just below the surface. He draws a nickel-plated pistol and points it at Wesley's head. Wesley looks at it and keeps on driving.

Charlie knows this isn't the way to handle it. He lowers the pistol.

	If you don't take the next turn for the canyon, I'm blowing my goddamn brains all over this car.

</BETTY>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you...what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...

Chloe and Blake run through their lines lifelessly, then stop when they get to Betty's cue. Their faces loom around her menacingly. Staring. The lights are impossibly bright. People begin to shuffle and stare at one another. Lyla clears her throat as George bounds on stage, still smiling.

George wrenches free of Wesley's grip and takes off.

Wesley is furious. He catches George in two strides, spins him around and SLAPS him across the face. George's glasses go skittering across the floor. PEOPLE stare.
</DIRECTION>
<WESLEY>

	You need to learn some manners, friend... reach out to your goddamn fan base a little more.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Betty walks aimlessly along a busy street. She moves without direction, in a daze until a glint of bright light hits her, causing her to turn. She is staring at a black Lincoln sitting in a car lot, sunlight dancing off its chrome. She shudders involuntarily at it. Suddenly, she hears a familiar voice.

<DIRECTION>
He wipes the sweat from his brow. Betty looks at his handkerchief and sees that it's soaked in blood. Then back at his face, now obscured by blood pouring down from his head. She stares, horrified, and in that moment Del becomes... a MAN, staring back at her as he wipes the sweat from his brow.
</DIRECTION>

Charlie watches Betty undress from a nearby fire escape. He stares at the object of his desperate search with relief and some fascination.

Wesley gently nudges open the trunk to Betty's LeSabre. The cardboard cut-out of David Ravell pops out at him.
</DIRECTION>
<WESLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa! What the fuck're you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WESLEY>
<DIRECTION>
He breaks it over his knee and throws it in the gutter, then quickly removes the wing nut holding the spare tire. He removes the tire, then raises the panel on the floor of the trunk as Charlie joins him.

Wesley looks at him. He appreciates the compliment.

<WESLEY>

Charlie takes a long look at Wesley and smiles proudly.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?

<WESLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.

</WESLEY>
<CHARLIE>

	We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.

<WESLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WESLEY>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<WESLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.

<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.

Wesley hustles Rosa out of the room.

Betty nods, scared, and looks through the peephole. She stares with disbelief at ROY OSTREY. He KNOCKS again. She opens the door a crack.

Charlie has been listening quietly on the other side of the door and finally snaps.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two thousand miles? That's nothing!

He flings the door open, sticks a pistol in Ballard's face and yanks them both inside.

</DIRECTION>
<WESLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WESLEY>
<DIRECTION>
He breaks Roy's nose with his pistol. Roy crumples to the floor, holding his face. Betty starts to scream, but Charlie puts his hand over her mouth.

Wesley grabs his shirtfront and slams him to the floor, then with a foot on his neck, he loops Ballard's arms around one leg of the steel aquarium stand and handcuffs him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie does nothing but stare at Betty, his eyes locked with hers. Wesley sees it.

Charlie studies her, then sets his gun down on the bed.

Wesley is engrossed in watching "A Reason to Love." Behind him, Ballard quietly walks his feet up the wall until he's completely upside down. He rubs one foot against the other until one pantleg is above his cowboy boot. Rosa and Roy watch. He finally lifts the boot off. It falls soundlessly onto his chest. A small pistol is revealed, holstered above his ankle. He works the holster open using the edge of the fishtank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roy and Rosa COUGH LOUDLY at the same time to cover the noise. Wesley glares at them.

Ballard gets the pistol free. But it falls into the fishtank. The air goes out of Roy's sails. Ballard has fucked up again.

Wesley struggles out from under Rosa. Just as he gets free, Ballard FIRES, hitting him TWICE into his chest. Wesley stares in disbelief at the blood rushing out of him. Then at Ballard, as if trying to link the two.
