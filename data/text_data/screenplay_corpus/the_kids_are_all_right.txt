:SC: THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE UP ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The humming stillness of an American suburb on a summer's day: nannies push strollers, joggers jog, mailmen deliver, dogs are walked, kids shoot hoop in wide open driveways.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a quiet, tree-lined street we pick up two young athletic- looking boys riding bikes. LASER ALLGOOD (15) and his friend, CLAY (15).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like bats out of hell they pass block after block of charming, evenly spaced houses until they round a corner and drop their bikes in front of a large ranch house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLAY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They walk inside. We HEAR a baseball game on TV in another room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLAY'S, BATHROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay pounds on blue pills with a hammer, reducing them to powder. Laser watches.
</DIRECTION>
<LASER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, dude.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay cuts the powder into lines with a school ID card.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	B minus in geometry, yo! This shits the bomb!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay rolls up a dollar bill and takes a snort. Then hands the rolled up bill to Laser.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Add it up, son.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Laser takes the bill, bends over and snorts a line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - GIRL'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Part Oxford reading room, part teenage girl's lair. Leaning against the bed we see JONI ALLGOOD (18). It's her room. She pours over a game of Scrabble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting next to Joni is her best girl friend, SASHA, (18). Sasha's checking out Joni's FACEBOOK PAGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joni's best guy friend, JAI (18) sits across from her, calculating his next Scrabble move.
</DIRECTION>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God, Joni, there are so many hotties in your class. You are so gonna hook up the first week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<JAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just cause you're a 24 hour drive- thru doesn't mean everyone else has to be...

</JAI>
<SASHA>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever. Why don't you guys just do it and get it over with?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Joni and Jai blush. They're both too scared to admit their crush on each other.
</DIRECTION>
<SASHA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? I'm just asking.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, maybe because we're friends...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAI>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, really...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sasha turns to Joni like an agent provocateur.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLAY'S HOUSE - TV ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laser and Clay wrestle on the floor while Clay's DAD watches a baseball game on TV. They bump into the couch. Clay's dad looks back, menacing.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY_S_FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, ladies! Take it down a notch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY_S_FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
The boys keep wrestling, wired from the pills. Again, they knock into the couch. Clay's dad spins around, pissed.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY_S_FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did I just say?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Dad grabs Clay, pulls him off of Laser and over the couch. He gets his son in a headlock, forcing the boy's face into his big fat sweaty armpit. Both Dad and Clay enjoy the brutal play. Clay laughs manically.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<CLAY_S_FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, your pits smell like burnt ass! Get off me!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As Laser observes this male-bonding between father and son, we note a trace of longing on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - DINING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joni, Laser and JULES ALLGOOD (40's) fair-skinned, attractive, sit before well prepared dinner. Still buzzing, Laser taps his fingers incessantly on the table.

Jules puts her hand on Laser's arm.

Jules and Nic share a look. Jules starts making maternal windshield wiper strokes with her thumb on Laser's arm.

<JULES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I ask you something? What do you get from your relationship with Clay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<LASER>

	What do you mean, "get"?
	</DIALOGUE>

Laser looks down at Jules' thumb on his arm.

<LASER>

</NIC>
<NIC>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, if it was up to you, our kids wouldn't even write thank-you notes, they'd just send out good vibes.

INT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

Nic and Jules lay in bed watching TV, unwinding from the day.
</DIRECTION>
<NIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just don't understand why you bought the truck now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JULES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because if I'm starting this business I need something to haul my equipment in.

MINUTES LATER -- NIC AND JULES are cozied up side-by-side facing the TV.

The volume is turned low on TWO NAKED MEN lying on a chaise longue. One guy fellating the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRCASE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joni tiptoes up a dark staircase and enters an office off the mom's bedroom. She heads for the desk and stealthy opens a drawer. She rummages though with clear intention. She pulls out a FOLDER and studies the cover. We see the words: "Pacific Cryo Clinic: Bringing your dreams to life."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON - THE BED

Jules wrangles the blankets, trying to cover her partner. The transition is awkward and Jules gets caught in the top sheet. As Nic repositions herself, she leans on the VOLUME CONTROL BUTTON and suddenly the porn is blasting at full volume.

Jules looks defeated.

INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Joni turns back to the file on the desk. She flips though some pages of documents and stops. CLOSE ON a PHOTO of a 4 YEAR-OLD BOY standing in a sandbox looking straight into a camera with a big, open grin.

<DIRECTION>
MATCH CUT TO:

Joni cuts in, nervous and businesslike.

Joni and Laser get out of the car and head to the restaurant to meet Paul. They're both clearly nervous.

	</DIALOGUE>
<JONI>

<DIRECTION>
MINUTES LATER- Joni and Laser enter the restaurant. They look nervous too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON PAUL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He studies them for a beat, sees them looking around. Figures they must be "his kids." They look in his direction, spot him. He raises his hand, stands. They walk over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The moment is rife. Paul holds out his hand to Joni.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>

Paul realizes he's put his foot in his mouth.

	So this is your place?

<LASER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but...our moms are kind of anti-motorcycle.

<JONI>

	And by "kind of" he means they'd kill us if we ever rode one.

<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's too bad. They're fun.

Nic and Jules do a post-mortem as they floss.

<PAUL>

Paul nods, smiling at her nervousness.

Paul smiles at Nic, trying to disarm her.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I always liked food.

<PAUL>

	Oh yeah. Wow, that was a long time ago. Yeah, I was considering it, but then I dropped out of school.

<JONI>

	<DIALOGUE>
	No? Why's that?

</NIC>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It just seemed like a massive waste of money after a while. I mean, I wasn't "doing" anything. I was just sitting on my ass listening to people spout off ideas I could've just as easily learned reading a book.

Paul sees that his little rant may be alienating the moms.

</NIC>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what'd you do for her?
	</DIALOGUE>
<NIC>

<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right...

<JULES>

	Landscape design...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely.

</CLAY>

We cut to Clay on a skateboard on the ledge of a brick wall. He's preparing to ride the ledge, jump a dumpster and land his board on the ground.

	</DIALOGUE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you quit being a man-gina and run the camera! I'm only doing this once so keep my shit in frame!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Laser sighs, then holds up the camera. Paul looks at Laser, wondering why he puts up with this guy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIDEO CAMERA'S POV: We watch as Clay psychs himself up with an assortment of deep breaths and head-slaps. Finally, he starts down the ledge. He starts his jump, catches air and hits the edge of the dumpster and falls. We see him go into the dumpster and land with a nauseating THUD. Paul and Laser rush up and look over the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL_LASER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ARE YOU OKAY?!

There's Clay, his arm bent at a disturbing angle, in agony.

</PAUL>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not amped. That's being a dick.

<LASER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not a dick, that's just his way.

<PAUL>

	Well, it's a lot more fun then donating blood.

Laser's not really buying that.
</DIRECTION>
<LASER>
	<DIALOGUE>

<PAUL>

</JAI>
<DIRECTION>
Joni starts to move in, her face draws closer to Jai's, inch by inch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somehow, deep down, Jai can sense her moving towards him which exhilarates and freaks the shit out of him at the same time. To the point where he lets slip...
</DIRECTION>
<JAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's like she has to sexualize every experience, you know? It's just sad...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
That stops Joni in her tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<JONI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it is. It's really sad.

Jai's sabotaged the mood and they both know it.

	And look, I just want you to know, about the other day, the kiss, that's not something I...do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I sensed that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a step toward him, feverish.
</DIRECTION>
<JULES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wanted to clear the air.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They stare at each other. It's like watching two magnets.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The air is clear.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jules grabs Paul and starts smothering him with kisses. It takes a second for Paul to get his bearings, but when he does, he starts kissing her back with equal fervor, pushing her up against the wall, wedging his hand between her legs.
</DIRECTION>
<JULES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul, I can't!

Overcome with lust, Jules wraps her legs around his waist and Paul walks her into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quick cuts of their awkward ravenous gropings. Somewhere between slapstick and animal. He pulls her hair back hard. She loves it. She pulls his hair back harder. He yelps. She pulls down his underwear. Her eyes widen. It's been decades since she's seen a hard cock in the flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<JULES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Well. Hel-lo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULES>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JULES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>

Paul flips her on her hands and knees and they go at it some more.

</LASER>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>

	What do you care? You won't even be conscious.

	Hey, can I talk to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONI>
<DIRECTION>
Joni leads Jai to a private corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leans in and kisses Jai. And Jai actually returns the kiss. And it's completely sweet and intimate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then the kiss starts to morph as Joni's energy turns manic, intense, less romantic than emotionally needy. We see Jai start to pull away. But Joni keeps holding him, wanting more. Finally, Jai breaks off the kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<JAI Joni_Joni>
<JONI What>
<DIRECTION>
Joni looks pained, embarrassed. Jai keeps holding her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<JAI Are_you_okay>
<JONI Yeah_I_m_fine>

Joni pulls free and escapes, leaving a confused Jai in her wake.

INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - JONI'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joni packs for college. The room is littered with half- filled packing boxes. She picks up a pile of clothes from the corner and sees the farmer's hat Paul gave her. She puts it aside, not sure what to do with it.

<DIRECTION>
The doorbell rings.
</DIRECTION>
<JONI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's probably Sasha. I'll get it.

Joni runs to the door. Opens it. It's not Sasha. It's Paul.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No! They're not. This is not your family. This is my family! You're just a fucking interloper...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jules joins Nic, concerned things are getting out of hand.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean to hurt anyone...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul and Jules share a look as Nic deals the coup de grace.
</DIRECTION>
<NIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you want a family so much, go out and make one of your own!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nic heads back inside and slams the door behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul stand alone, spinning. After a moment he spontaneously looks back into the house. Laser is staring at him through the window. Their eyes lock and Paul give Laser a contrite smile. That's the final straw for Laser. He grabs his plate and walks out of view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reeling, Paul heads for his motorcycle. He gets on the bike, helmet in hand. Turns on the ignition. He picks up the helmet and pauses, shaking in the hell of his own making. Losing it, he hurls the helmet at the motorcycle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - TV ROOM - THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Laser, Joni and Nic watch "Locked Up Abroad" Jules walks in front of them, picks up the remote and turns off the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<JULES>

	I need to say something.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone sits up. Jules acts stoic but she's wrecked.
</DIRECTION>
<JULES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, it's no big secret your mom and are in hell right now. Bottom line...marriage is hard...really fucking hard. Just two people, slogging through the shit, year after year, getting older, changing. It's a fucking marathon, okay?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is silenced by the outpouring. Jules soldiers on.
</DIRECTION>
<JULES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So sometimes you're together so long, you just stop seeing the other person. You just see weird projections of your own junk. And instead of talking to each other, you go off the rails, and act grubby and make stupid choices. Which is what I did. And I feel sick about it because I love you guys and I love your mom and that's the truth. Sometimes you hurt the ones you love the most. I don't know why. Maybe if I read more Russian novels I would...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULES>
<DIRECTION>
Nic looks down, overwhelmed by it all.
</DIRECTION>
<JULES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, I just wanted to say how sorry I am about what I did and that I hope you'll forgive me eventually.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(awkward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And, without further ado, Jules hands the remote back to Laser and departs the field. Everyone's silenced by Jules' rambling apologia, especially Nic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JONI'S ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>

The Allgoods pull up to the curb, get out. Laser piles Joni's boxes on his skateboard.

Laser dollies Joni's boxes though the corridor and while Joni and the moms follow behind.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<JONI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guys, it's okay. I got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONI>
<DIRECTION>
Nic and Jules get the hint. They move back and Joni enters the room alone. Nic and Jules quietly turn and leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JONI'S DORM ROOM - BEDROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joni stands among her bags and boxes looking around. She goes into her suitcase and pulls out her linens. She starts making her bed but suddenly stops mid way. She stares out toward the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally she moves to the doorway and looks out. She realizes her family isn't there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DORM BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joni exits, looking around to find her family. The station wagon is gone. She looks panicked. Her pace quickens as she makes her way down a hill toward the road. Finally Joni sees the Volvo heading towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car pulls over to the curb and everyone gets out. Joni looks vulnerable. She tries to cover it.
</DIRECTION>
<JONI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd you go?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<NIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had to move the car.

</NIC>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly, everyone realizes...this is it. It's time to say goodbye. First Laser comes up and hugs Joni.
</DIRECTION>
<LASER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gonna be weird not having you at home.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JONI>
	<DIALOGUE>

</JONI>
<LASER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. I can handle it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Laser backs up. Then the moms both come up and hug Joni, tears streaming down their faces.
</DIRECTION>
<JONI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guys, come on...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I'll talk to you soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONI>
<DIRECTION>
Joni tries to detach from the hug. But her moms won't let go. They keep holding her and crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, their tears begin to break Joni down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trapped in their loving embrace, Joni's feelings rise up, unbidden, overpowering her. She starts crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The moms hold her tighter, which makes her cry even harder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soon she's sobbing in her mothers' arms, as all the pressure, resentment and anger she's felt starts seeping out of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nic and Jules feel their daughter letting go. They hold her tight to comfort her. They keep holding her until a calm sets in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hug breaks apart. Nic pushes the hair from Joni's face. Joni gives her moms one last smile. Laser, Jules and Nic get back in the car. Joni stands watching as they drive off and her new life begins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STATION WAGON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The family drives home. Jules is at the wheel. Nic's in the passenger seat, eyes red and puffy. Laser's in the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one speaks, everyone's lost in their own worlds. Finally Laser breaks the spell.
</DIRECTION>
<LASER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think you guys should break up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<NIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No? Why's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<LASER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're too old.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIC>
<DIRECTION>
Both Nic and Jules crack smiles. Their son's rudeness is unsurpassed. But then his words have an unexpected gravity.
</DIRECTION>
<NIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Laser.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIC>
<DIRECTION>
Jules, disarmed and slightly smiling, reaches over and puts her hand on Nic's leg. She gives it a gentle squeeze and doesn't let go. Nic looks over to Jules, finally disarmed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nic reaches for Jules' hand and holds it tight. Nic and Jules look at each other, and then away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laser watches his moms holding hands from the back seat. Their small gesture is what he needed. He smiles to himself, grateful for a sign.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT THE END
</DIRECTION>
