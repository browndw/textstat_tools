A large and very comfortable office over-looking St. Patrick's Cathedral. At the moment the office is filled to bursting with men and women, slumped in chairs, sitting on desks, all of them very tense. Among the crowd of people we note: MURRAY FISHER, a young and very ambitious junior executive and PHYLLIS BERNARD, an attractive woman in her early thirties. She is a lawyer with the agency.

At the moment, TED KRAMER, nice-looking without being what you would call a matinee idol, paces back and forth. His tie is loosened, he checks his watch every fifteen seconds. Clearly he is very distraught.

Now that the light is brighter, we can SEE her more clearly. In her mid-thirties, she is beautiful, dressed in a style that can best be described as Bloomingdale's. HOLD FOR A BEAT as she leans against the door. It is clear from her expression that she is terribly upset. Then, making up her mind, she crosses to a closet and takes out a suitcase.

HOLD ON BILLY

As he wakes up, struggles to his feet.

THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as, eyes closed, he stumbles into the bathroom, pees, and still not remembering to flush the toilet walks into the bedroom and wakes his father. As the child turns and walks toward the kitchen, THE CAMERA HOLDS ON TED. He heaves himself to his feet and, eyes closed, in much the same manner as his son, stumbles into the bathroom. He automatically flushes the toilet without bothering to look, walks into the living room, opens the front door and picks up the paper. As he starts into the kitchen, he meets Billy coming the other way carrying two plates, a doughnut on each.
</DIRECTION>

THE CAMERA NOW TRACKS WITH BILLY as he walks into the living room, carefully sets the plates on the dining table, crosses to the television set, and turns it on. He returns to the table, and sits down as Ted appears carrying two glasses of orange juice and vitamins. He takes a seat in the chair opposite Billy and opens his paper and starts to read.

About half a block away Joanna paces back and forth. She hasn't seen them and it is clear that she is as nervous as they are.

ANOTHER ANGLE ON TED AND BILLY

Ted stops, turns to Billy and gives him a last-minute check. Then, spotting a smudge he takes his handkerchief, spits on it and wipes the child's chin. Now satisfied, he takes Billy's hand and they continue. Suddenly:

Ted and Phyllis, getting ready to go to bed. They look like a couple that has been married at least five years. Ted is busy talking as he takes off his tie, jacket and starts to unbutton his shirt.

	Six years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<GRESSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</GRESSEN>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<GRESSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?

</GRESSEN>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I did not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<GRESSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you wish to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRESSEN>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I tried to talk to Ted – my ex- husband – about it, but he wouldn't listen. He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby-sitter for Billy.
	</DIALOGUE>

<GRESSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?

	Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?

</GRESSEN>
<JOANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(emphatically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Very much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<GRESSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And yet you chose to leave him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRESSEN>
<DIRECTION>
There is a long pause, then:
</DIRECTION>
<JOANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(speaking carefully, with great thought)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... Look, during the last five years we were married, I had... I was getting more and more... unhappy, more and more frustrated. I needed to talk to somebody. I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what. But every time I turned to Ted – my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it. He became very... I don't know, very threatened. I mean, whenever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack. Anyway, we became more and more separate... more and more isolated from one another. Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex- husband's attitude – his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self-esteem...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with feeling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me – that my son would be better off without me. It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person. And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<GRESSEN>
<DIRECTION>
(to the judge)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRESSEN>
<DIRECTION>
And with that he hands both the judge and Shaunessy a thick sheaf of papers. Then, turning his attention back to Joanna:
</DIRECTION>
<GRESSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRESSEN>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because my son is here. And his father is here. As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<GRESSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRESSEN>
<DIRECTION>
There is a pause, then:
</DIRECTION>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because he's my child... Because I love him. I know I left my son, I know that's a terrible thing to do. Believe me, I have to live with that every day of my life. But just because I'm a woman, don't I have a right to the same hopes and dreams as a man? Don't I have a right to a life of my own? Is that so awful? Is my pain any less just because I'm a woman? Are my feelings any cheaper? I left my child – I know there is no excuse for that. But since then, I have gotten help. I have worked hard to become a whole human being. I don't think I should be punished for that. I don't think my son should be punished for that. Billy's only six. He needs me. I'm not saying he doesn't need his father, but he needs me more. I'm his mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<DIRECTION>
There is a beat of silence, then:
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
(to the judge, correcting himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	– my ex-wife – when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage... Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true. There were a lot of things I didn't understand – a lot of things I would do different if I could. Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change... But we can't. Some things, once they are done, can't be undone. Joanna says she loves Billy. I believe she does. So do I. But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue. The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy... When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right. But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex? I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent: constancy, patience, understanding... love. Where is it written that a man has any less of those qualities than a woman? Billy has a home with me, I've tried to make it the best I could. It's not perfect. I'm not a perfect parent.

Suddenly Ted can't stand it any longer.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, it's getting cold. Why don't you go inside where it's warm. I'll be along in a minute.

Billy hangs back, watching Ted.

The boy turns and runs back along the beach toward the house.
</DIRECTION>

Then, he stops, turns back to look once more at his father.

HIS POV – LONG SHOT

Ted stands at the ocean's edge, his back to CAMERA, weeping.

INT. KRAMER KITCHEN – MORNING

<DIRECTION>
ON TED AND BILLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stand side by side, like a surgeon and his assistant. Spread out on the counter in front of them are the makings of French toast. The following is done with great efficiency, in contrast to the first time we saw them go through the same ritual. They work in silence except for an occasional command. Each concentrating on this last moment of closeness, each doing his best to avoid thinking about Billy's departure. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BILLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking at his father, trying to memorize the older man's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted turns, sees his son watching him.

Billy's bags are packed and stacked neatly in the living room.

Nearby, Billy and his father sit, silent, waiting.

Sound-effect: The intercom from the lobby buzzes.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSER IN ON TED AND BILLY

Ted looks at his son, smiles. The boy smiles back.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is it, pal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Billy, fighting back tears, nods.

Sound-effect: The intercom buzzes again.

As they open, Ted steps out, looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lobby is dark, the only light coming from the window. Joanna sits off to one side, wearing sunglasses. She looks up as Ted approaches, a small smile on her face.

He nods.
</DIRECTION>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love him too... I don't think I ever knew how much until now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<DIRECTION>
There is a long pause as she looks at Ted, unable to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<JOANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(a deep breath, then:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and... when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby... and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and –

<JOANNA>

</JOANNA>
<DIRECTION>
ON TED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Struck by the urgency in her voice.
</DIRECTION>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After I left... when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy – I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me. Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him... And I did... And I won. Only... it was just another "should."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she begins to break down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened. I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy. I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...

<JOANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(she reaches out, takes his hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two... He's yours...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(her last ounce of reserve crumbles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God... Oh, my God...

<JOANNA>

	Only can I still see him?

</JOANNA>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more waiting in Coffee Shops... I promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Joanna's last ounce of reserve crumbles, she begins to sob. Ted puts his arms around her and holds her. They do not kiss. Then, after a few moments she steps back.
</DIRECTION>
<JOANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(chin high)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay... I think I'll go talk to my son now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(wiping her eyes)
</DIRECTION>

	How do I look?

They step into the elevator and, as the doors close, blocking them from view, we...

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. STREET – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TED AND BILLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING JUST IN FRONT OF THEM as they walk to the park. They are deep in conversation, although we are too far away to bear what they are saying. HOLD ON THEM and, as they reach the entrance to the park, Billy first, then Ted begin to run, overwhelmed with the sheer joy of being alive, of being together. As they continue to run, THE CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP AND WE SEE that they are only two among thousands of parents and children in Central Park on a sunny afternoon. THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK until they are lost from view and it is...

FADE OUT:

THE END
