EXT. CAROLINA MALL - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT FROM THE BACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PERVERT in a trench coat runs along the edge of the mall. A group of OLD WOMEN is coming toward the MAIN ENTRANCE. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes the old women. They SCREAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Pervert ducks behind the bushes and runs with the skill of a Navy SEAL. A FAMILY is walking down the sidewalk. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Pervert ducks behind a dumpster. He keeps running and sees a car driving by. The Pervert flashes the CAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Pervert takes a two-step run, sees ANOTHER LADY, flashes her. He dives behind a car. Then pops up and flashes ANOTHER GIRL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's an all-out Pervert assault!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Pervert then runs across the parking lot, jumps a fence, and darts from the property -- vanishing as quickly as a Ninja who just perfectly executed an assassination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MALL - BUSINESS OFFICES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARK, the Mall Manager, walks by a group of women, who were exposed to the Pervert. They crowd around and complain loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies, please, we're doing everything we can to handle the situation. Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our shoppers. Now in the meantime, feel free to check out some of our wonderful back-to- school sales. Excuse me for a minute.

Mark walks down the hallway that houses all of the business affair offices. He stops at the RECEPTIONIST'S desk.

The Mall Manager quickly walks off. On the way, he passes a JANITOR.

<JANITOR>

The Mall Manager keeps walking.

<DIRECTION>
INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mall Manager comes into the surveillance room. It's a small office with monitors that show the different security cameras around the mall. DENNIS, a Mall Security guard with sunglasses who will not utter a word ever, turns around in the chair.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is Ronnie?

INT. GARAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackness. White shafts of light sporadically shoot through the dark and we see IMAGES. A GIANT FLASHLIGHT is inserted into a UTILITY BELT. MACE is inserted in the other side. A WALKIE-TALKIE is turned on. A TASER is sparked. MIRRORED SUNGLASSES are pushed over the nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A garage door raises and bright light spills in...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A garage door opens slowly and reveals a souped-up ORANGE GOLF CART. There's a siren on top that spins around. The man driving is RONNIE BARNHARDT (28), a stocky mall security guard whose expression reads all business. Ronnie pulls out of the garage...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSE: OBSERVE AND REPORT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEAVY METAL MUSIC. A group of anarchist SKATERS rages through the mall parking lot tearing up everything they see. A couple of them smoke cigarettes. One skater grinds over a bench. One kid ollies onto the hood of a car. Another slams into an old man and knocks him over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Ronnie sits in his golf cart -- waiting. He looks eerily like Mel Gibson at the beginning of Mad Max.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The skaters ride past a set of construction cones. One skater picks up the cone and tosses it across the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The skaters soar past Ronnie, who flips on the silent orange siren and gives chase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the skaters ride through the parking lot, Ronnie pulls up and drives alongside of them.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cop authority voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pull over to the sidewalk, NOW!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
STEVIE, the leader of the skaters, yells back.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck off, Ronnie, it's just a parking lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVIE>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, pull over to the sidewalk, NOW!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>

HECTOR, another skater, joins in.
</DIRECTION>
<HECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave us alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HECTOR>
<STEVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, skating's not a crime, dick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVIE>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Skateboarding is not allowed on mall premises. Pull over now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<STEVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not leaving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVIE>
<HECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, fuck you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The skateboarders flip Ronnie off and push hard to get away from him. Ronnie guns it and an all out chase ensues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie pulls up alongside of a SLOW SKATER. Ronnie side- swipes the skater, forcing the skater to run into a trash can and fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie catches up to ANOTHER SKATER. This time, Ronnie tries to hit the skater on the side again, but he is too fast. Ronnie swerves trying to get him, but he dodges and ducks. Ronnie hits the brake. The skater thinks he has escaped, but looks up and sees that a car is in his way. The skater nails the car and is thrown over the hood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie is back in the chase and only Hector and Stevie are left. Ronnie guns the golf cart and zooms up closely behind the two kids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie rams Hector over and over from behind. Hector wobbles. Ronnie rams him again. Hector goes swerving off and falls down hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie doesn't break his pace and guns it toward Stevie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stevie is good. He turns and rides through cars, ollies over parking blocks, and through pedestrians. Ronnie burns down the lane beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stevie looks behind and Ronnie is nowhere in sight. He's in the clear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stevie turns back around and sees Ronnie, driving in reverse straight towards him. Ronnie rams into the skater and knocks the poor kid on his ass.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVIE>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was driving in reverse and trying to get you to flip into the back seat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<STEVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVIE>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That way I could handcuff you smoothly and take you in. You know, never mind, just get in the goddamn golf cart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Stevie picks himself up slowly and hobbles toward the golf cart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MALL - SECURITY OFFICE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie is in the room with the monitors. The skaters sit across from him. There's a poster on the wall with the security guard motto: OBSERVE AND REPORT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie fiddles with his walkie-talkie.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It seems like we go through this every day. What's it going to take for you all to realize that I won't tolerate this horseplay and just do whatever you want to and don't worry about the rules attitude?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<STEVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ronnie, I hear what you're saying and I just want you to know that personally, it pains me to see you all worked up and I just want you to know that I'm really sorry because you can't do shit and you can take your little rules and stick'em up your ass, you fuckin' rent-a-cop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVIE>
<DIRECTION>
The Skaters all start cracking up.
</DIRECTION>
<HECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, suck my dick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Skaters start laughing louder.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's funny, guys. I try to be a mentor to the youth, but it seems like you boys have gone straight past boydom to the land of street- hardened criminals. I'm left with no choice. You call me rent-a- cop, but I call myself the law's right hand. I see the crime... and I phone it in. And that's what I'm getting ready to do right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie picks up the walkie-talkie and turns it on. He speaks into it.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>

Ronnie winks at the Skaters.

	Uh... Yeah, Ronnie, we're kind of busy today. I mean, we got like three car accidents.

<DIRECTION>
Ronnie picks up the walkie and whispers into it.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(into walkie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean? I've got these guys red-handed. I'm gonna need a car over here pronto. I can't hold them all day by myself. Over.

</RONNIE>
<WALKIE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Copy. Yeah, like I said, we're awfully busy right now. I think you should probably just make'em promise not to do it again and threaten to call their parents or something. That'll get them. Over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALKIE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The Skaters start laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(into walkie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I don't think you understand, their parents don't care about them. This is a 911 from one of your soldiers. Officer needs assistance! Over!

<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it's not gonna happen...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALKIE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The VOICE fades as Ronnie turns off the Walkie.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So as you can see, the law is just one little call away. But I'm gonna choose not to use that tactic today. I'm gonna do something that I like to do from time to time, and that's called handle shit myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie takes his pad out of his pocket. He begins writing.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	While I won't have you arrested today, I am going to suspend each of you for one week. For those of you who don't know how this works, here it is. This is official documentation. If you step foot on mall property, it is considered trespassing. At that point, I call the police, they come down, you go directly to jail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie fills out the paperwork, sets the suspension notes on the table. Stevie looks down at it. He picks it up, reads it, balls it up, and throws it at Ronnie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Skaters start cracking up.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You accepted it originally, so it still counts.

Ronnie sits there while the Skaters laugh.

Ronnie sits at a table with a Cinnabon in front of him. Across the table sits NELL, a chubby but cute girl, who wears a Cinnabon uniform. The couple holds hands and they have their heads bowed.
</DIRECTION>
<NELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear Lord, bless this food that we eat and purify it with Your salvation. Also, please keep Ronnie safe as he works in Your name to protect the customers and employees and store owners of the mall. And please turn your wrath on any sinners that try to hurt him and make them pay by burning in the eternal flames of hell. In Christ's name we pray, amen.
	</DIALOGUE>

Ronnie begins devouring his Cinnabon.

<NELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's on the agenda for you today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NELL>
<RONNIE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<NELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong, Ronnie?

</NELL>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing, Nell.

</NELL>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I'm okay, Nell. Thanks, but really, I mean, I'm on the front lines right now. I'm livin' it.

<NELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your job is definitely more exciting than mine.

Nell leans in to kiss Ronnie, but he pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at work, Nell. We have to keep up appearances, we talked about this. And don't call me sweetie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<NELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I'll see you after work, Officer Barnhardt.

INT. MALL - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Ronnie stands in the middle of the mall and supervises the early morning MALL WALKERS as they stride around the outer marked lane. It's all senior citizens.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Slow it down. Watch your speed there. This ain't a race. Hey, second time, slow it down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mark, the Mall Manager, walks up to Ronnie.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been looking all over for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't been hiding, but some things that I have to do are better to keep hidden from you and 'official' eyes. Trust me, it's best all around if there are no bodies to clean up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you may or may not have heard, but this morning, several women were assaulted just outside the front doors by a crazy Pervert.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the love of God.

</RONNIE>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, it's horrible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to phone this one in to the police?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not just yet. See if we call the police, they'll be a big scandal and something like that could kill what little traffic we have at this mall. What I need you to do is watch out for this Pervert and if you see him, try to stop him or quietly phone it in so we can handle this discreetly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on, Mark. Let me make sure I understand you. You're telling me to deny my primary objective of Observing and Reporting crime and at the same time, you're giving me authorization to handle this case on my own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just saying keep an eye out and keep quiet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So basically, I'm in charge of this whole investigation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no investigation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet. Okay, Mark, I'll do it, but I'm gonna need a few things first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't carry a gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm gonna need a new title. Something to instill fear in the criminal mind. How about Director of Mall Intelligence?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Head of Mall Security.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's perfect.

</RONNIE>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it doesn't come with a raise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the new title stays between us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Understood. Thank you for this opportunity, Mark. I won't let you down.

	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BRANDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What skirts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDI>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what skirts. Something like that could set him off. And for that matter, you better not wear any of those little low-cut top things either, okay? Especially with those black bras because, you can really see them in the light. Perverts really tend to notice stuff like that. Okay, see you later.

Ronnie takes off and leaves Brandi still applying make- up.

INT. MALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights are turned off and the mall is empty. Ronnie walks out with Dennis.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dennis, man, I'm glad we've got a minute to talk. There's no easy way to say this so I'm just going to come right out with it. Mark offered me the position of Head of Mall Security. I know this isn't easy for you to hear seeing as you've been here longer than me. But I want you to know that you're my best friend and I'm only going to accept the job if you're okay with that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Dennis shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you should know I've already accepted and it's too late to turn it down now. Every ship needs a captain. So you were passed over. Who gives a shit? Dennis, in time, you'll come to accept answering to me. Remember, there aren't any leaders in friendship. We cool?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Dennis and Ronnie shake hands. They walk out and lock the doors behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you want to go and grab a beer or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Dennis doesn't say anything and just walks to his car. Ronnie follows.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you're right. You're probably in no mood to party after that news. Well, try not to take it too hard. See you later, buddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>

Ronnie leaves Dennis and walks to his car.

<DIRECTION>
Ronnie's home is a shitty double-wide at the very end of the shittiest trailer park in town.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RONNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie lives in a boy's room. There's all kind of posters up with instructions on how to execute choke holds, wrist locks, and other assorted death blows. However, the biggest decoration is a large diagram of the mall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie stands in the middle of his room with his MOM across from him. She's an old, thick boozer, with the strength of a father and the love of a mother. She downs a full beer and throws it against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think you're ready for a shot at the title, motherfucker?!

Ronnie and his Mom take to fighting. Ronnie's Mom is surprisingly good and she lands the first blows to Ronnie's cranium.

</RONNIE>
<MOM>

</MOM>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie attacks his Mom. He manages to scoop her and body slam her to the ground. Ronnie's Mom flips out of it on the ground. However, Ronnie holds onto her wrist and stands up, thus locking in the submission hold.
</DIRECTION>
<MOM>

	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie's Mom rubs her arm. Ronnie drops his guard and comes over to tend to his Mom's wounds. However, she's only playing possum. Ronnie's Mom sees an opening and attacks Ronnie at his legs. Ronnie goes down and the two start wrestling again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: This plays as realistic as possible, no phony punches or smooth/comedy fighting, it looks like a school yard fight video. Sloppy and real.)

INT. RONNIE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

	Yeah, well for your information, I'm in charge of this whole BEEP operation. I don't give a BEEP if you believe me or not, Ms. Hot BEEP BEEP news lady. Do you see anybody else? BEEP no you don't. As the law's right hand, I'm the first line of defense against this pervert. I'm here so that people like you can live in your own little happy world and think places like this mall are safe and fun. I'm the defender of this war zone. Just me and my BEEP flashlight.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No comment as to why steps are not being taken, but this Security Guard feels like he is the only one doing anything to protect the people who visit Carolina Mall from the suspect. For all of us, I hope this isn't the case. Back to you, Lindsay.

</RONNIE>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, you did good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I usually don't come out to the forefront like that. My official orders are Observe and Report, but when Mark put me in charge of mall security, something inside of me changed. It's what I've always wanted. Things haven't always worked out, with the whole... well, you know. But this gives me faith that I can do something great. This is my call to duty and I'm going to answer. I'm going to bust this fucking pervert. I swear it on everything I am. Anyway, I better get to sleep. I got a big day tomorrow. Good night, Mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off no answer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom?

</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
On cue, Ronnie's Mom falls over in a drunken sleep. She starts SNORING loud as hell. Ronnie gets out of the covers and helps his Mom onto the bed. Ronnie tucks her in like a loving son. He pries the bottle from her fingers. Then, he grabs a pillow and goes to sleep on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MALL - O'CHARLEY'S - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie walks up to O'Charley's. It's the one-step-up restaurant that's in the mall. There's a BOUNCER out front who watches over the store.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You working the door here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what they tell me. They needed to hire a little security here in case the drunks get out of line or whatever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kind of funny they thought they needed more security here. Ha. You do realize that if anyone gets out of hand, you need to call me to handle the situation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I work for O'Charley's, not for the mall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Granted, but you realize that my jurisdiction supersedes any and all other forms of security when under the roof of Carolina Mall?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I thought about getting a job as a Mall Security.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, man. I mean, I'm kind of on extended vacation from college and it's just like, I don't want to do shit, you know what I mean? My parents said I have to work if I want to live at home, but I just don't feel like doing anything. This was the easiest job I could find, I mean, what the hell could be hard about being a bouncer in a mall restaurant? But now that I think about it, Mall Security could be easier than this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My young friend, you are sorely mistaken. Do you know how much stuff I'm in charge of?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A shitload. That's not even counting the parking lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? I thought you just kind of chilled out and called stuff into the police.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way, that's about like 75, maybe 82 percent of it. There's so much other stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two words, Friday Night.

</RONNIE>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about it?

<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's crazy, let's just leave it at that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen. I like you, but I don't like the fact that you're masquerading as an official in the security world. If you're serious about a career in the security world, then perhaps I could look into getting you a job on my staff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Part of my job is reaching out to troubled youths such as yourself. It's who I am.

Ronnie laughs. He leans over to the Bouncer and whispers in his ear.

</BOUNCER>

Ronnie stands back and winks at the Bouncer.
</DIRECTION>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd say that's more than I'm making now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on, this job involves a probationary period. You have to prove yourself worthy. We can't just hire any old Tom, Dick, or Harry just because they want to carry a flashlight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I have to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to complete a term as deputy. You will answer directly to me. Your job will be to come and find me if you see any trouble. If this works out, then I will phone the crime into the police. Now, this will train your eyes to spot various criminal activity. Once you have completed your training, you will be awarded an official position on my security staff where you will have the duty of actually phoning in crimes to the police yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So basically, I just do what I'm doing now and then you'll get me a job?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For starters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long does this mentorship last?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until Mark lets me hire another guy.

<BOUNCER>

	Can I smoke while I work?

</BOUNCER>
<RONNIE>

<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You keep that attitude up and you'll have no problem making the squad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie reaches into his pocket and hands the Bouncer a mini flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a flashlight. Get to know it. It's your new best friend. Until you get your giant flashlight. Then, that will be your new best friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
The Bouncer takes it and puts it into his shirt pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, look alive, soldier. Deputy time starts now. No more slacker attitude for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>

Ronnie walks away, but after he takes a few steps, he stops and turns.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I remember when I got my first flashlight...

Ronnie goes into an emotional memory in his mind.

Ronnie walks away leaving the Bouncer there alone.

LOUD ROCK SCORE FADES TO LOUD ROCK SOURCE. A tricked-out Toyota pulls up to the parking lot. The car comes to a stop and out steps Brandi, the makeup counter girl.

Brandi walks toward the mall to start her new day. As she crosses the parking lot and heads toward the door, the Pervert pops out. This time, he's upped his attack and beats off staring right at her.

EXT. MALL - DAY

A black UNMARKED POLICE CAR pulls up quickly and stops directly in front of the Main Entrance to the mall as if to say to the world, "I'm a Cop and I can do this."

Ronnie puts his sketch away.

<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Brandi, I think that's good for now. I think the best thing at this point is to just follow up with the other ladies who saw the perpetrator yesterday and see if they remember anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
<BRANDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if he comes back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDI>
<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's highly unlikely. These incidents are usually random and unpredictable. I'm sure you'll be safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid I'm going to have to disagree with you there, Detective. By my math, it seems pretty clear that Brandi's been targeted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Targeted? What gives you that impression?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, how about the fact that she was the first employee to get assaulted? Not to mention the fact that she is the prettiest girl who works at this mall. To me it seems obvious that this is some sort of methodical villain that plans on returning to finish what he started by murdering Brandi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BRANDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that going to happen?!

<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, Brandi, you've got the best team in law enforcement working for you.

</RONNIE>
<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>

	Look, I've got to get going. Here's my card. I'll even write my home phone number on the back, just in the event you need to get a hold of me.

<DIRECTION>
Detective Harrison writes his number on the back and then hands his card to Brandi.

</RONNIE>
<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can just leave a message at the station. I check my messages constantly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, but I'm gonna need those digits. If we're gonna solve this crime we need to constantly be in communication with each other and have an open door policy with intelligence. Brandi, let me see that card.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie takes the car from Brandi and copies the home phone number from the back.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Cool, I'll call you later with an update.

	</DIALOGUE>
</NELL>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what it's like when you date the Head of Mall Security. The downside is we don't get to see each other as much, but the upside is you get to brag to all your friends.

Ronnie decides to push it. He takes his hand and tries to go up her shirt. Nell immediately stops kissing and pushes Ronnie away.

	Ronnie, you know I'm saving myself for marriage. I thought you were okay with that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NELL>
<RONNIE>

Nell stands up and starts to put on her coat. Ronnie stands up and tries to comfort her.

Detective Harrison knocks on the door and walks in. Ronnie stands up to greet him.

Ronnie gives Detective Harrison a hug.

	I'm ready to go to war with you.

<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for waking me up this morning, Ronnie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've already checked the Security tapes. They didn't catch a thing. Someone must have broken in here and turned them off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My team just checked all the doors and there are no signs of forced entry. I've also checked out the crime scene, but we didn't see any fingerprints on the glass. The suspect was probably wearing gloves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That doesn't sound good. How did they do it?

</MARK>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Laser technology.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My guess it was an inside job. Probably someone who has access to keys like a janitor or a security guard.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Detective Harrison, can I ask you how long you've been a detective for?

<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>

	I'm almost at the end of my first year.

<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just as I thought, a rookie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been a police officer for several years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you're a rookie, okay. It's fine, you'll learn with experience. And when you do, you'll discover that rule #1 of law enforcement is that you don't ever turn on a fellow officer. Now, I know you would never actually accuse somebody on my Security Force of committing this act of lawlessness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoever did this would have to had keys to the Security Room so they could shut off the camera.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, my record speaks for itself and as for Dennis, well I can certainly vouch for him. Dennis is one of the finest men I know, so just take my word, you're barking up the wrong tree. Now, let's put this little squabble behind us and get back to busting the guys that robbed this mall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ronnie, nobody is accusing anybody, but I would like to stick around for a while and interview some of the employees.

	Okay, but all I ask is that you do it quietly, so that the hoopla is kept to a minimum.

<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ronnie, you are to leave Detective Harrison alone and let him handle the investigation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No can do, Mark. When you appointed me Head of Mall Security, I swore an oath to protect this mall and aid in bringing crime to its knees.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't swear an oath.

	To myself I did.

</RONNIE>
<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>

	Ronnie, on these types of investigations, it's usually not a good idea to have too many cooks in the kitchen.

	There's only one cook. I'm a chef. A cook and chef, together, serving up justice.

<DIRECTION>
Ronnie talks to Dennis in the middle of the mall.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Dennis. I've gotta hang with Detective Harrison. What I need for you to understand is that just because Detective Harrison is here, doesn't mean that you and me are no longer best friends. Sure, Harrison would be cool to hang out with. He carries a badge and a gun. He probably owns a boat. Over time, we'll probably become really close like brothers, but for right now, you're still number one. Now, I must leave you behind because duty calls, so... chin up. Radio if you need anything.

	You guys should have been there today. We were just solving shit left and right. I mean, that's what this job is supposed to be like. Busting loiterers and kids who steal pennies from the fountain has its rewards, but really getting in there and closing cases is where it's at. It's rewarding too because at the end of the day, you know you've done something good for the world.

	Well, my young apprentice. I called you here today because as Head of Mall Security, I have decided that it's time to take protection to the next level. In other words, I alone cannot combat this recent crime wave. In order to help me in my personal journey, I have decided to divide up the tasks between my soldiers. So, for now on, Dennis, my right-hand man, you will be in charge of solving the case of who is robbing the mall. Little Chucky, you will be on the case of the Pervert. You are both to collect data and provide it to me. I will analyze the data, draw conclusions, and solve these crimes as well as coordinate and strategize with various law enforcement agencies.

On top of the Pyramid is a combination drawing/picture of Ronnie. The body is drawn with his arms folded across his chest and a photo of his face is tacked on top.

Well, you may really like that Toyota, but you're going to feel weird about driving it to work every day, right? Now let's say that somebody offers you a chance to get rid of that Toyota and instead you get a Ferrari. It may be more expensive and harder to drive, but I mean, it just looks good as hell.

	Nell is a lucky girl.

</MOM>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Its not Nell, Mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really, I thought you and Nell were going to get married some day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did too. But then I met this girl Brandi and she swept me off my feet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I always liked Nell, but as long as you're happy, Ronnie, that's all I care about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I actually feel kind of bad about Nell, but I figure that I can pour all the sadness into Brandi and just really rely on her for my happiness instead of Nell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sounds wonderful. Is she pretty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is, Mom. She's the most perfect girl in the whole world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember when your father picked me up for our first date. I swear he was the most handsome man that I had ever laid eyes on. I knew right then and there that this would be the man that I married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope that happens tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It will, Ronnie. Then you'll have to give her a ring like the one your father gave me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie's Mom holds up her finger for Ronnie. It's a giant yellow/cottony-looking diamond ring.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that a yellow diamond?

</RONNIE>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a glass diamond. This is how it looks now.

</MOM>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom, why did Dad leave?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, he kind of freaked out when you were born. You had so many special needs that he just couldn't handle the pressure. One day, he just couldn't take it anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think it was my fault that Dad left?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Definitely. You don't think it was mine do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I didn't know, with the drinking and all.

<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, how do you like working at the mall?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BRANDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate that shit. All I do is listen to bitching all day long. I got to put makeup on these fat- ass women all day and it's like, I don't give a shit what you do, you can't polish a turd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDI>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I see how that could get to you.

</RONNIE>
<BRANDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got a few hook-ups but nobody who is a boyfriend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDI>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BRANDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, it's just like a time in my life where I want to be free right now and think about myself. Not get tied down to one person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDI>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I understand. I hate ties. I recently cut mine and now I'm free like a bird.

</DIRECTION>
<BRANDI>

	Who wants to see my titties?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDI>
<DIRECTION>
Brandi lifts up her shirt and shows the passengers of other cars her boobs.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brandi, this is the most fun I've ever had on a date.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BRANDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the last time, this ain't a date, motherfucker! This is a party!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDI>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wooo! Um, so, Brandi, it's no secret that I'm attracted to you. I think everybody in the mall is. As you know, I recently split with my girlfriend and basically, I was wondering if, since you don't have a boyfriend, that I could maybe be your boyfriend and you could be my girlfriend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BRANDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my house!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDI>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie hits the brakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRANDI'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie opens Brandi's door and helps Brandi out. She's almost passed out drunk. Both of her eyes are closed and she immediately tries to sleep on the ground. Ronnie helps her up, but when he does, Brandi gives him a kiss -- a sloppy one.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brandi, I had a wonderful time tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BRANDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so fucking shit-faced.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDI>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss again, but when they do, Brandi pukes all over the place. It's a disgusting puke and there's vomit on her cheek and stuff. Ronnie holds her head for her.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BRANDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My breath smells like asshole.

Ronnie is with Dennis in the food court. Ronnie is smiling, but Dennis isn't saying a word as usual.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't look at me like that, Dennis. I told you I wouldn't talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie sits back, but he can't help a giant grin on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm serious, Dennis. A gentleman never kisses and tells. So, just stop with all the pressure because it's just not gonna happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie keeps on grinning at Dennis.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, fine, you son of a bitch, you want details, I'll give you details. I had sex with Brandi last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Dennis and Ronnie high-five.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was amazing. I mean, I've never experienced anything like it. I've been with a girl or two.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Dennis stares at Ronnie.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, fine, I've been with a girl, but let me tell you, this was so much better. You know how many times we did it? Twice! BAM! BAM! BAM!

</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
OVER AT THE CINNABON STAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nell, who looks like she's been crying nonstop, stuffs a whole Cinnabon into her face. As it fills her cheeks, she looks over to Ronnie's table and sees Ronnie making thrusting motions at the table. Nell swallows, stuffs another Cinnabon in, then storms out of the Food Court.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK AT RONNIE'S TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie continues to talk to Dennis.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I got to tell you, Dennis. It was steamy and sexy, but more than anything, I should tell you that it's her soul that I fell for the most. She got pretty tanked, but I could just really tell that she's a good person. The kind of person that I could see myself with. Look, I'm gonna get out of here. There's a lot of people I need to tell about this, so I'll catch up with you later. Oh, and I almost forgot, keep your eyes peeled for crime and stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie leaves the table.

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

Nell watches Brandi as she pops a couple of aspirin behind the makeup counter. She takes a deep breath and walks up to the counter.

</NELL>

<NELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to talk to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NELL>
<BRANDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it, honey? Let me guess. You're looking for something to take care of those blackheads and hide that puffiness under your eyes. I've got just the thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDI>
<NELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that's not it. Well, how much is it?

</NELL>
<BRANDI>

	</DIALOGUE>
</NELL>
<BRANDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know who you've been talking to, but it's safe to say that you're fucking trippin'.

	It's fine really. It's going to take a while for me to get over it, but I'll be okay.

Nell starts to get all teary-eyed. She picks up a Kleenex from a box on the counter and wipes her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANDI>

	Oh fuckin' Lord. This is disgusting.

</BRANDI>

	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NELL>
<BRANDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pull it together. This is how you run around all the time? Have some self-respect. No wonder your man left you. Who the hell would want to be around this shit all day?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDI>
<DIRECTION>
Nell pulls herself together.
</DIRECTION>
<NELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus teaches us to forgive. And I forgive you for what you did to me when you stole my boyfriend. Plus, I feel pretty confident that you'll end up burning in hell because of the various evil ways you live your life and that brings me some satisfaction. But I just want to tell you that Ronnie is a good person. He does a lot of stupid stuff, but really, he wants to do good for the world. I want you to know that if you hurt him and ruin his heart, I will personally come down here and kick the ever living shit out of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NELL>
<DIRECTION>
Nell walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You better fuckin' run, bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>

Nell turns around and starts storming toward Brandi. Brandi throws her hands up, frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just kidding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDI>
<DIRECTION>
Nell stops charging and walks away. Nell walks past Bruce who is helping a customer at the end of the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<NELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not too late to change your ways.

The Flower Salesman winks and starts laughing. Ronnie doesn't. It gets weird so the Flower Salesman stops.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What color of roses do the women like anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<FLOWER_SALESMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it depends on what you are trying to say. The white roses symbolize innocence and purity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLOWER_SALESMAN>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, we're way past the color white if you know what I mean. What about the yellow ones?

<FLOWER_SALESMAN>

<FLOWER_SALESMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you really like Brandi?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLOWER_SALESMAN>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've only been on one date with her, but I could see myself being with her for all of eternity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<FLOWER_SALESMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, in that case, the greatest symbol of love is just a single red rose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLOWER_SALESMAN>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seems like a big bag of roses would be more love than just one, but I guess you're the expert. Gimme one.

The Flower Salesman takes a single red rose from the case and hands it to Ronnie.

</RONNIE>
<BRANDI>

<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the head of Mall Security.

	Exactly. The point is, I don't really see myself being with that. Like ever. You know what I mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDI>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brandi, I know exactly what you mean. And I just want to thank you for being honest. You're telling me I'm not living up to my full potential in life. It's funny, because I've been feeling like this for quite some time. I guess I just needed that extra little push to get me over this hurdle I've been stuck on. How can you be with a man who isn't living the life he was meant to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BRANDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, something like that. And just you know, you're a security guard at the mall and it's like, come on, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDI>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like it, Brandi, but I do understand. I promise you this. Next time you see me, I will be wearing a uniform that will make you proud. I will be the man that you will be honored to call your life's love.

Ronnie sits at a small table and waits patiently. Then a POLICEMAN walks into the room. Ronnie stands to shake his hand.

<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here to become a police officer.

</RONNIE>
<POLICEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're always on the hunt for new recruits. Do you have at least a high school diploma?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICEMAN>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a GED.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<POLICEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We usually prefer an actual diploma, but GED is technically acceptable. Are you a citizen of the United States?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICEMAN>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bet your ass I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<POLICEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Mr. Barnhardt, there are several steps you have to complete in order to be eligible for the police academy. Physical evaluation, psychological test, background check. If you pass these tests, you will be admitted to the police academy. Now, I like to tell all new recruits that they should complete a ride along before making this decision. It's where you actually ride along with a real police officer during a routine patrol. It helps give you an idea of the kind of situations you'll be dealing with. Sound good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICEMAN>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sounds fun. Sign me up.

INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Ronnie sits in the unmarked police car with Detective Harrison.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's like it was meant to be. You behind the wheel. Me riding shotgun. Two brothers of the badge unite to form the ultimate crime-stopping combo. I'm psyched to be here, Harrison. Thank you for the opportunity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You requested to ride along with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. You want to know the truth. It's because I respect you. See, when we're at the mall, it's obviously my turf. Sure, I break your balls about being a rookie, but out here in the streets, I'm the rookie. I'm here to learn. Teach me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you want to become a Cop?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've wanted to be a Police officer all my life. Don't get me wrong, I love keeping the mall safe, but you guys are the ones that really enforce justice and protect, not just our mall, but our whole community. I don't tell the guys on my squad this, but the Security Guard job was just temporary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, just pay attention tonight and make sure you stay out of the way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
<RONNIE>

	Right, we're not back at the station anymore so we can cut the charade.

<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I know that policy demands I stay out of the way, but between you and me, I just want you to know that if anything pops off tonight, I'm going to jump right in there and take 'em down with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. Ronnie, policy says you have to stay in the car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I get you. You have to say this in order to keep you safe 'legally' speaking. I should probably follow along too. 'I swear I won't get out of the car and fight justice tonight.'

<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. POLICE CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie and Detective Harrison sit in the parked car. They're at the shittiest crack corner in the whole town. Lots of scary bums and hookers loiter around the car.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, so then I basically saw his ass trying to circumvent around the ped exit and slip through the employ exit. Not allowed. The two ped exits are to be used only --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see that corner there, Ronnie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I see it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That corner used to be the worst corner in this whole town. It was riddled with drugs, prostitution, and gang violence. It was nicknamed 'The Crossroads.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, I've heard of that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, but myself and the other officers worked on cleaning it up for years so that the good folks of this neighborhood wouldn't have to worry about being safe. Yes, sir, that corner is a testament to the fine police work of our force.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. It looks pretty shitty to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's a low income area, Ronnie. You're being kind of prejudiced.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah, I can see that it's basically a fine neighborhood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, but it hasn't been easy. We still patrol this area every night just to keep our presence up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I use that same technique at the mall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure. I usually do the foot patrols myself, but because I like you, I'm going to let you do it tonight.

</DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DETECTIVE_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, really. But I told you about department policy, so I'm going to need you to keep quiet about this one.

<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can count on me. Thank you for the honor.

Ronnie is shaken, but he waves to Detective Harrison like he's okay. Detective Harrison waves back, then PEELS OUT OF THERE. Ronnie is confused.

Unbeknownst to Ronnie, Gang Members start walking up behind him. It's like that scene in Training Day where all the gangsters are hanging out right across the street with guns and shit. They come up behind him as he speaks to the kids...

Ronnie reaches into his boot and pulls out a small rod. He flips his wrist and it extends into a night stick. Ronnie's begging was a trap. Ronnie pops up and begins dropping all those motherfuckers with lightning-fast precision.

Ronnie breaks arms and busts heads like a fucking ninja. Gang Member #1 comes in and hits Ronnie with a sucker punch, busting his nose wide open.

Ronnie stands up and goes mano y mano in a fist fight with Gang Member #1. He starts kicking Ronnie's ass. Ronnie goes down again and Gang Member #1 starts stomping Ronnie.

Ronnie grabs Gang Member #1's leg and twists it. He takes him down. Ronnie jumps on top of him and begins beating him senseless.

INT. PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie sits across from a female PSYCHOLOGIST.
</DIRECTION>
<PSYCHOLOGIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Ronnie, today I'll be giving you a psychiatric evaluation to determine if you're competent to enter into the Police Academy. It's really just a formality. Don't want any serial killers working for us, now do we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PSYCHOLOGIST>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, ma'am, we don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<PSYCHOLOGIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Ronnie, so let's start with your background. Where are you from?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PSYCHOLOGIST>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Born and raised right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<PSYCHOLOGIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Local boy. Okay, and, Ronnie, have you ever been convicted of any crimes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PSYCHOLOGIST>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, ma'am. My record is totally clean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<PSYCHOLOGIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you now take any illegal drugs or have you taken any in the past?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PSYCHOLOGIST>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, ma'am. I believe drugs are the path to self-destruction and should be purged from the face of the earth with ruthless vengeance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<PSYCHOLOGIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any prescription medications?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PSYCHOLOGIST>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, for my nerves. A man in my line of work has a lot of stress to deal with. If you've seen the bloodshed I've seen, you'd be on the meds too. I -- Where are you going with this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<PSYCHOLOGIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you presently or have you ever been affiliated with the Communist Party?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PSYCHOLOGIST>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe you'd even ask me that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<PSYCHOLOGIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever been in the military?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PSYCHOLOGIST>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<PSYCHOLOGIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What branch of the military were you in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PSYCHOLOGIST>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The kind of branch that doesn't exist on paper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<PSYCHOLOGIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, here's a real world scenario. You have a gun --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PSYCHOLOGIST>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<PSYCHOLOGIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That wasn't really the question, never mind, I think I got that one. Um... here's one. Do you feel like you would work well on a team?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PSYCHOLOGIST>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would I? Yes. Would I be more useful working alone, I would say definitely. I see myself more like a Rambo kind of guy. A man who rolls solo. Taking care of business on his own terms. Kind of like a Superhero or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<PSYCHOLOGIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you want to become a cop?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PSYCHOLOGIST>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to become a cop to help people. The world is a scary place with lots of evil everywhere. See, I have this vision of evil trying to get at the world from every angle and there I stand at the top of it all with my gun, just kind of blowing it away. Just me and my weapons, cleaning up this whole town. I know I could do some good if I was just given a chance and everybody would be a lot better off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<PSYCHOLOGIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh. So, what do you feel is the greatest danger facing a police officer today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PSYCHOLOGIST>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe Russian gang activity, but you know what? I think I'm gonna have to go with evil on that one too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<PSYCHOLOGIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I think we're good here. It's been a pleasure, Ronnie.

<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom, I appreciate it, but I'm going to make it as a police officer. I'm tired of coming in second all the time. Everybody in life gets to go for their goals, why should I be any different?

	You know, Dennis, for the longest time I made this job my whole life. I looked at this mall as a kingdom and I looked at Mark as the King. I thought of myself as the first Knight and the customers, well, they were the peasants. I lived by an old code where one was bound by duty and honor. But now I don't know if I believe in that code anymore. I've lost my way. Now I just feel like it's one big kingdom of shit. Right now, I got half a mind just to let this whole place burn. Burn it to the fucking ground!

	I've been waiting on you to get on my page this whole time. You look at this mall as a Kingdom?! Shit! I look at this place like a motherfucking jail sentence. You put on that uniform every morning, but what are you really protecting? Commerce and corporations and money. Well I say, fuck that! I'm a fucking outlaw and I'm going to live that until the day I die. Now, I can show you the way, but you've got to be willing to accept it. So I'm gonna ask you now, Ronnie. Are you ready for a trip to the other side?

	It seems only natural that 'some people' would want to blame me and truth be told I do put a lot of that blame on myself. But some people might say that the cops are to blame for not catching them.

Look, whiskey was always the way I dealt with being a single mother, but as I get older, I know that I can't keep doing this. I've got everything I need with you. So I want you to know that I'm ready to make a change. Your life needs to get easier and you don't need to take care of old Mom anymore.

I know most people don't think it's shit, but I really loved it. Then, all of a sudden, I find out that your ass got promoted over me. After all I put into it, you're the one that makes it to Head of Mall Security. You know what it's like to get passed over, Ronnie? So I got pissed off.

	I'll be quick. Nell, this is the only job I was ever any good at. I'm not a crime solver or right hand of the law. I'm just a dumb guy in a uniform who can't even become a real policeman. Somewhere along the way I started to think I was something special, someone whose shit didn't stink, someone who deserved to date out of my league. You know, I've learned. My shit does stink. It smells horrible. And you're also out of my league, but for some reason, you like the smell of my shit. I guess what I'm saying is...
