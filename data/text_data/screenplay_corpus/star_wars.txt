STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls into infinity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- MAIN PASSAGEWAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are old and battered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic surface of an Art Deco design.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're doomed!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that only another robot could understand.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make their way into the smoke-filled corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered arms and faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An explosion hits near the robots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TATOOINE -- DESERT WASTELAND -- DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable lad with a prize-winning smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions. A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the tiny robot to follow him.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurry up! Come with me! What are you waiting for?! Get in gear!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum madly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- MAIN HALLWAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away from the imposing warrior.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER.

A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome. Artoo makes beeping sounds.

<DIRECTION>
Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel soldiers can be heard in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place, dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little robot joins his companion.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At last! Where have you been?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the subhallway. Threepio chases after him.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute, where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo responds with electronic beeps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Capturted rebel troops are marched away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<VADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have you done with those plans?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADER>
<REBEL_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBEL_OFFICER>
<VADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If this is a consular ship...where is the Ambassador?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADER>
<DIRECTION>
The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp. Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to his troops.
</DIRECTION>
<VADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the passengers. I want them alive!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADER>

The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- SUBHALLWAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the stormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the troopers spots her.
</DIRECTION>
<TROOPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's one. Set for stun!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TROOPER>
<DIRECTION>
Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with her laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a paralyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.

<DIRECTION>
Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod. He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light begins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into the cramped four-man pod.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure..
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo beeps something to him.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding the mission he is about to perform.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps and twangs angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris through the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and, after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky robot jumps into the lifepod.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to regret this.

Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship. Stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo beeps an assuring response.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure this thing is safe?
	</DIALOGUE>

The lifepod disappears in the direction of the planet.

Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white buildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty empty street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist at Luke as he flies past.

<DIRECTION>
Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the office, yelling wildly.
</DIRECTION>
<FIXER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I hear a young noise blast through here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIXER>
<CAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was just wormie on another rampage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly, handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics of the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shape it up you guys!.... Biggs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great joy and emotion. They give each other a great bear hug.

<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know you were back! When did you get in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<BIGGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just now. I wanted to surprise you, hot shot. I thought you'd be here...certainly didn't expect you to be out working.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he laughs.)
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Academy didn't change you much...but you're back so soon? Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.
</DIRECTION>
<BIGGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I got it. Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week. First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service...(he salutes)...I just came to say good-bye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIGGS>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of it.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I almost forgot. There's a battle going on! Right here in our system. Come and look!

The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie and The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes. Luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There they are!
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain to see something with the naked eye. Through the binoculars Biggs sees two small silver specks.
</DIRECTION>

	That's no battle, hot shot...they're just sitting there! Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.

	But there was a lot of firing earlier...

The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs his shoulders in resignation.
</DIRECTION>
<FIXER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here. I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system. Believe me Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing...

Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about Luke's ineptitude.

INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad of armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>
<VADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADER>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...

<VADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...and a traitor. Take her away!

Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering hole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander turns to Vader.

<COMMANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.

	I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base!

	She'll die before she tells you anything.

Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander. They stop and snap to attention.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.

Vader turns to the Commander.

Jundland, or "No Man's Land", where the rugged desert mesas meet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droids kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily work their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in the distance rests half buried in the sand.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>

	How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life.

Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio stops and yells at him.

A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small robot.

	Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier.

Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the direction of the vast dune sea.

	And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.

	I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own...It's what we always talked about. Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service. The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side -- the side I believe in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIGGS>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm stuck here...

	I thought you were going to the Academy next term. You'll get your chance to get off this rock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIGGS>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not likely! I had to cancel my application. There has been a lot of unrest among the Sandpeople since you left...they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<BIGGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sandpeople with one blaster.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIGGS>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off. He needs me for just one more season. I can't leave him now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<BIGGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important. What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?...You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems...it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIGGS>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It couldn't happen here. You said it yourself. The Empire won't bother with this rock.

	No, I'm leaving in the morning...

</BIGGS>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I guess I won't see you.

	Maybe someday...I'll keep a lookout.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIGGS>
<LUKE>

EXT. TATOOINE -- ROCK CANYON -- SUNSET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, a pepple tumbles down the steep canyon wall and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the narrow path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down the trail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TATOOINE -- ROCK CANYON -- SANDCRAWLER -- SUNSET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot is sucked into the giant machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SANDCRAWLER -- HOLD AREA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end of the chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SANDCRAWLER -- PRISON AREA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation, while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls out from the gloom.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half-buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine, searching for the droids on foot and mounted on dewbacks.An Imperial heavy shuttle transport lifts off in the background, wings unfolding as it flies off.A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.

Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wake up! Wake up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men. Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the odd assortment of robots.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're doomed.

A Jawa starts moving toward them.

Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.

EXT. TATOOINE -- DESERT -- LARS HOMESTEAD -- AFTERNOON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small adobe block house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils should be.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.
</DIRECTION>
<OWEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, all right, fine. Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>

A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru standing in the main courtyard.

<BERU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.

	What I really need is a droid who understands the binary language of moisture vaporators.

	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>

As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.
</DIRECTION>

Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the head of the red astro-droid, throwing parts all over the ground.

The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo is moving up and down trying to attract attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps Luke on the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>

(pointing to Artoo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain.

	Yeah, take this away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<THREEPIO>

INT. LARS HOMESTEAD -- GARAGE AREA -- LATE AFTERNOON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery with a cord to his face.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>

Luke seems to be lost in thought as he plays with a model of a small two-man Skyhopper spaceship. Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>

	It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here!

Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

</THREEPIO>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.

	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping oil from his bronze body.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
	</DIALOGUE>

	With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.

Luke sparks to life at the mention of the Rebellion.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?

</LUKE>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.

</THREEPIO>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you been in many battles?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's neck joint. He uses a larger pick.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel Senator, being projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly lit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.

</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.

Artoo beeps something to Threepio.

	He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.

Luke has been looking longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't really heard what Threepio has been saying.

	H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay.

Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of this name, but manages to control himself.

Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.
</DIRECTION>
<OWEN>

	But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?

<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He knew my father?
	</DIALOGUE>

<OWEN>

	I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWEN>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.

Owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress it.

INT. LARS HOMESTEAD -- GARAGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in sight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt similar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a short yell, pops up from behind the family landspeeder.

Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in sight.

<THREEPIO>

	It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.

Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro- robot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his electrobinoculars.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times.

The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio pilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast wasteland.

EXT. TATOOINE -- ROCK MESA -- DUNE SEA -- COASTLINE -- DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen gliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground two weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of the marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs the gun before it can be fired.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes called, speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an animated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to get in the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TATOOINE -- ROCK MESA -- CANYON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied to a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs and ride off down the rugged bluff.
</DIRECTION>

The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. Luke runs up to stand before little Artoo.

The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses menacingly behind the little runaway.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.

EXT. TATOOINE -- ROCK CANYON -- RIDGE -- DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young adventurer.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles down the side of the mountain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces. The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible shrieking laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TATOOINE -- ROCK CANYON -- FLOOR -- DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in the rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the inert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the speeder. The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the Sandpeople fleeing in terror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>

	Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid.

Artoo begins to whistle and beep his concern about Luke. Ben puts his hand on Luke's forehead and he begins to come around.

	Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master...I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi- Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?

Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.

	No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter.

Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around. As Luke finishes repairing Threepio.

<DIRECTION>
Luke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out about four feet and flickers there. The light plays across the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>

I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.

INT. DEATH STAR -- CONFERENCE ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black conference table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around the room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general, is speaking.
</DIRECTION>
<TAGGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize.

The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.

Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial outland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally, The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his place at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<TARKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.

	That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?

</TAGGE>
<TARKIN>

	The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.

</TARKIN>
<TAGGE>

	And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.

	Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTTI>
<VADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADER>
<MOTTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...

The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldy den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender stops Luke and the robots.

Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.

Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear or whatever.
</DIRECTION>

Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall- savage-looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur-covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance. Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a sight to behold.

Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between Ben and the giant Wookiee.

A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid.

A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating his comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an annoyed look.

<GANTRY_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>

As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing the towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chilling howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and the robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed as a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet.

Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information to the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something.

<THREEPIO>

Chewie lets out a hideous growl.

The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as Han binds him with the electronic cuffs.

<THREEPIO>

	Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking...but, ah...what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?

<LUKE>

Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops, bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious glance.

Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door slides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards enter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates are everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath.

</OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in the information. There are only three other troopers in the area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look out! He's loose!

<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</HAN>
<DIRECTION>
The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink system, which is screeching questions about what is going on. He quickly checks the computer readout.

A series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door through which several Imperial troops begin to emerge.

Han and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke and flame. They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting up with Luke and Leia rushing toward them.

Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as they continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far and of the hallway. The laserfire is very intense, and smoke fills the narrow cell corridor.

She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca look on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and says something.

<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it.

Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the tiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work their way toward the opening.

	Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there!

INT. DEATH STAR -- GARBAGE ROOM.

<DIRECTION>
Han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck. Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won't budge.
</DIRECTION>
<HAN>

</HAN>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! wait!

Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room. Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes almost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a rather grim look on her face.

A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the murky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins to back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols drawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.

Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and move in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet. Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca howls in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke suddenly bobs to the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grab him!

Luke seems to be released by the thing.

<DIRECTION>
A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for See-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand comlink, which is sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and Threepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the floor. Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber.

As the walls rumble closer, the room gets smaller and smaller. Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his giant paws. Han is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is snapping and popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio.

The walls are only feet apart. Leia and Han are braced against the walls. The princess is frightened. They look at each other. Leia reaches out and takes Han's hand and she holds it tightly. She's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels the first crushing pressure against her body.

Ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge tractor beam. The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep. The clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard.

Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful. She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled troops, who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo beeps with happiness.
