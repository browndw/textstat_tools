The tree-shaded dirt street of a small, one-street river town; a picturesque, mid-19th century remnant of the old river civilization, which general Progress has left behind. Chiefly we see, in this order: A schoolhouse (on far side of street); Miz Cunningham's second- hand shop; a Grange House sporting a poster for a Western movie; Spoon's Ice Cream Parlor. At the end of the street, down the river-bank, is a brick wharf and Uncle Birdie's wharf-boat. In b.g. and in passing, suggestions of sleepy small-town life.

The gears of the car shift; the car moves away unseen; its sounds diminish slowly, and die. A moment of silence; then JOHN turns and we PAN him to the bed.

The children get through the open door as PREACHER reaches the top. JOHN slams the door, catching PREACHER's hand. PREACHER screams. JOHN's astonished eyes peer through the crack in the door; the door loosens; PREACHER yanks his hand loose and sucks it, groaning; the door slams to; the bolt is shot home.

(whispering, so that he does not hear)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For every child, rich or poor, there's a time of running through a dark place; and there's no word for a child's fear. A child sees a shadow on the wall, and sees a Tiger. And the old ones say, "There's no Tiger; go to sleep." And when that child sleeps, it's a Tiger's sleep, and a Tiger's night, and a Tiger's breathing on the windowpane. Lord save little children!

</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That watch sure is a fine, loud ticker!

	<DIALOGUE>
	A fella just can't go around with run-down, busted watches.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
She turns back, face to us, and goes on with her stirring. JOHN goes off towards the staircase to join the GIRLS; then turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
