EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The end of Winter. SNOW blankets the landscape. A SMALL STREAM rushes through the VALLEY. A clear, blue sky hangs over the DISTANT MOUNTAINS adding to the beauty of the setting.

SUPER IMPOSE: SCOTTISH LOWLANDS - 1665

The CAMERA begins to PAN. The color of the SNOW begins to change, darkening from PURE WHITE to ASH GRAY, eventually to COAL BLACK. We continue to pan until we arrive at..

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plague. Once a charming settlement it is now ravaged by disease. Everywhere BONFIRES burn, sending plumes of BLACK SMOKE rising into the sky -- the ash and soot drift back down, blackening the earth. VILLAGERS scurry about in tattered clothing, their faces soiled by soot as they throw objects of WOOD and CLOTH into the fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE HORSEMEN ride into the village. Two of them we can see clearly as large, powerful men with savage faces. The THIRD MAN'S man's face is hidden from us in the shadows of a black HOODED CAPE. He dismounts, motioning for the other two to wait for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hooded Man walks though the village. The SOUND of HAMMERING fills the air as several VILLAGERS finish building a make-shift GALLOWS.

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Built of stone it is already centuries old. A VILLAGER stands guard at the entrance. The Hooded Man approaches and WHISPERS something in the Villagers ear, then holds up a GOLD PIECE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHURCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark and musty, lit only by shafts of LIGHT which flow in through the windows. The Hooded Man follows the Villager across the stone floor until he reaches a WOODEN DOOR at the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STONE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No windows. The Hooded Man enters. In the center of the room a CIRCLE has been drawn. Bordering the circle are hundreds of CANDLES, forming a ring of fire. A MAN stands in the center, his head bowed -- his weight supported by thick ROPES around his wrists that are fastened to a wooden beam which runs the length of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<HOODED_MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vieira...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOODED_MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
VIEIRA looks up. He is old, his hair thin and gray, but his eyes are alive, defiant. The Hooded Man moves closer. Vieira follows him with his eyes, trying to see the Hooded Man's face. Vieira strains against his ropes. The Hooded Man does not move.

The Hooded Man slowly pulls back his hood. We see his face for the first time. It is hard, brutal, his eyes cold and dark. He grins -- a wicked grin.
</DIRECTION>
<HOODED_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a magic of my own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOODED_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Hooded Man removes a KNIFE from under his coat. He holds it before Vieira, then he quickly stabs it into his chest. His face fills with pain -- blood flows from the wound -- he falls to his knees. A beat. He slowly looks up at Vieira as he pulls the knife from his chest, then stands unharmed. Vieira cannot believe what he has seen.

In the b.g. we HEAR the SOUND of FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs. Vieira looks at the Hooded Man.

The Hooded Man stares at him -- a hard, unnerving stare -- then slowly, his thin lips from a cruel grin.

EXT. VALLEY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUND of SWORDS CROSSING fill the air. Two MEN, one YOUNG, the other OLD fight across the SNOW-SWEPT GROUND. In. the b.g. a large, stone building is built at the base of a mountain range.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Young Man fights furiously, his only weapon strength, but he is clearly inexperienced. The OLD MAN is agile, and easily moves out of the way of each blow. The Young Man swings wildly, he loses his balance. The Old Man strikes his SWORD away, then pushes him to the ground. The Young Man looks up as the older man raises his SWORD above his head. Their eyes lock. The Old Man smiles and slowly lowers the sword to the Young Man's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Old Man reaches out his hand, helping the Young Man to his feet. The Young Man is clearly angry.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your anger blinds you. You must learn to control it. When the time comes you'll only have but one chance. You best use it well.

INT. STONE BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Large and barren. A fires roars in the fireplace. The Old Man sits across a wooden table from the Young man as they finish eating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Young Man appears restless. He pushes his plate away -- stands up and walks toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you off to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To the village for some ale -- and if the truth be known, I need to see someones face other than yours, old man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
They smile. The Young Man takes his SWORD then puts on his COAT. He picks up a SACK and leaves. The Old Man begins to clear away the dishes. Suddenly he stops -- his smile fades. He looks towards the door filled with a premonition. Outside we HEAR the SOUND of SWORDS CROSSING. It lasts only for a moment. SILENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A blinding GREEN LIGHT fills the frame of the door. The ground begins to TREMBLE -- the STONES of the building shake from the force -- debris falls from the ceiling. It stops. SILENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Old Man takes his SWORD from the mantle. The DOOR OPENS. The SOUND of the WIND rushes in. Outside nothing can be seen - - only the darkness of the night. A beat. The Young Man enters the room. The Old Man smiles at the sight of him. The Young Man places his sack on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Old Man turns his back as he starts to replace his sword on the mantle. The Young Man's expression hardens. He stares at the Old Man's neck as he starts to raise his sword.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OLD MAN'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a SILVER WINE CHALICE he sees the reflection of the YOUNG MAN who is now slowly raising his SWORD and about to strike at the Old Man's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In one fluid movement the Old Man unsheathes his sword, then turns quickly. The Young Man's blade slices through the air missing it's target. The Old Man pivots and slices his blade across the Young Man's chest. The Young Man winces in pain, then takes a deep breath -- his body begins to shake violently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TRANSFORMATION BEGINS. The image of Young Man begins to fade and is replaced by the HOODED MAN. He LAUGHS LOUDLY as he holds up his arms as if prompting The Old Man for his appreciation of the illusion.

	It's not been long enough. What witchcraft is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN>
<KILVARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Impressive -- is it not? The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes. I need more power to hold the form longer. I need the Highlander. Where is he?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh well -- I shall find him. Time is on my side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KILVARA>
<DIRECTION>
The Old Man looks sadly at the open door. Kilvara notices and grins.
</DIRECTION>
<KILVARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this what you're looking for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KILVARA>
<DIRECTION>
Kilvara opens the SACK. Inside it is the head of the Young Man. Kilvara LAUGHS, a deep guttural laugh. He turns and starts towards the door. Suddenly he stops and turns back to face the Old Man.
</DIRECTION>
<KILVARA>
<DIRECTION>
(mockingly)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- I almost forgot. Your head.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KILVARA>
<DIRECTION>
With a savage YELL Kilvara draws his sword and lunges at the Old Man. The Old Man steps aside and Kilvara's sword smashes down on the table, shattering it into splinters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two Horsemen step into the room and watch. Kilvara lunges again -- and again -- each time the Old Man side-steps him. Kilvara swings -- the Old Man ducks -- the blade hits the stone wall -- SPARKS FLY -- ROCK EXPLODES. The Old Man slices his blade across Kilvara chest. A deep gash is cut -- blood flows. Kilvara examines the wound.
</DIRECTION>
<KILVARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KILVARA>
<DIRECTION>
With brutal strength Kilvara begins his attack again, whipping his sword through the air furiously. Their swords cross -- sparks fly. Kilvara is too powerful for the Old Man. All he can do is back up -- using his sword to block each ferocious blow. They pass through a large ARCH at the rear of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAVERN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The building is built at the mouth of a vast CAVE. TORCHES set in the walls of the cavern are the only source of light. A WOODEN BRIDGE is built over a deep RAVINE. Kilvara and the Old Man continue their fight across the bridge. The Horsemen lag behind, enjoying the battle. The Old Man's strength is giving way under the merciless attack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SPARKS from each contact is even more dazzling in the dim light of the cavern. Kilvara swings again. The Old Man tries to block it. In one fluid movement Kilvara scrapes his SWORD along the Old Man's -- then lunges forward -- thrusting his blade through the Old Man's chest. The Old Man SCREAMS in pain. Kilvara lifts him up with the blade. Kilvara flings him off the blade and onto the ground. The Old Man is on his knees. Kilvara raises his sword above his head.
</DIRECTION>
<KILVARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There can be only one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KILVARA>
<DIRECTION>
Kilvara brings the blade down. It slices through the Old Man's neck, severing his head from his body. Kilvara waits, preparing himself. A stream of bright GREEN LIGHT begins to flow from the BODY of the OLD MAN. It grows BRIGHTER and BRIGHTER. The Body of the old man begins to hover above the ground, then in a pulsing burst of energy the LIGHT flows into Kilvara. The force knocks him to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GROUND SHAKES -- The walls of the cavern move. Suddenly, chunks of rock are blown out of the walls -- the RUMBLING SOUND grows LOUDER and LOUDER -- blinding GREEN LIGHT FILLS the cave and then -- a deafening EXPLOSION. Whole sections of the cavern begin to collapse -- covering the exit -- trapping everyone inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOUNTAIN - WIDE SHOT - NIGHT

The RUMBLING SOUND subsides. In the distance we hear the savage SCREAM of Kilvara. The CAMERA MOVES UP the side of the mountain. As we come over the top we see...

A thick FOG hangs in the air. A light wind blows, moving newspapers and other articles of trash along the deserted street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crates and trash dumpsters line the alley. A single, naked light bulb shines down like a spotlight. Through the fog the SILHOUETTE of man appears as he steps under the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING WITH THE MAN - REVERSE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow the man from behind. He is tall, dressed in a long, tan rain-coat, jeans and sneakers. A small TRAVEL BAG is slung over his shoulder. As he moves down the alley he hears a SCRAPING SOUND. HE stops -- but does not turn around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A street PUNK emerges from behind a trash crate, scraping the BLADE of his KNIFE along the wall of a building. He studies the man for a moment as he runs his thumb along the edge of the blade, almost caressing it.
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'cha got in the bag?

</PUNK>
<DIRECTION>
CONNER MACLEOD slowly turns around. He is mid thirties, handsome, his chin dotted with the stubble of a beard. He is calm, detached -- yet under the surface there is a great sadness from a lifetime of pain and loneliness. He stares at the Punk wearily -- knowing both what is going to happen and what the outcome will be.

Macleod turns his back to him and starts to walk away. The Punk moves after him quickly. Macleod reaches into a trash can and pulls out a piece of PIPE. The Punk stops and stares at Macleod.

A beat. The Punk is losing confidence. He looks at Macleod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MACLEOD'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deep. Confidant. They radiate an intensity that seems to burn into the Punk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Punk is unnerved by Macleod's calm. Macleod waits, letting him make the next move. A beat. The Punk backs away and disappears into the darkness. Macleod stares him for a moment, then drops the pipe to the ground and walks off in the other direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Macleod stops at the mouth of the alley where it intersects with the street. He stares across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACLEOD'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old building. A sign reads: RUSSELL NASH, ANTIQUES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sadness falls across his face -- his mind floods with memories as he looks at the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the street the door of the antique store opens. RACHEL, an attractive woman in her fifties exits -- locks the door -- walks down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macleod watches her affectionately -- painfully. As she crosses the street, he steps back into the shadows of the alley, hiding in the darkness. Rachel reaches the alley, then stops -- thinks -- looks back at the Antique Store. She is only a few feet away from Macleod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MACLEOD

Macleod struggles to make a decision. Slowly he raises his hand -- reaches out -- but cannot bring himself to touch her.

Rachel starts to walk away.

<DIRECTION>
No more needs to be said. She recognizes the voice instantly. She turns around slowly and looks behind her. In the b.g. Macleod steps out of the darkness. He smiles at her weakly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Confusion fills her face, but is quickly replaced by a wave of emotion. She moves towards Macleod slowly, as if trying to determine if he is really there. She cups her hands to his face and stares deeply into his eyes. No words are spoken -- none need to be. The power of their feelings are shown in their eyes.

A sadness falls over Macleod's face.

His words touch her. She opens a cabinet and pulls out a bottle of GLENMORGANGIE scotch. Macleod forces a weak smile. In the light he looks tired. She pours him a drink.

Every inch of wall-space is filled with shelves and BOOKS. Macleod walks along a row studying the titles. A faint grin falls across his face as he sees a selected works of poetry.

Rachel enters the room with a tea service and places it on the table.

+IN THE FIELD

A man toils behind an ox, his arms straining as he guides a plow through the soft earth. He stops, runs his hand across his brow, then turns around. It is Macleod. His hair is longer, but he looks exactly the same.

EXT. DOCKS - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A desolate area of the RIVER. Abandoned WAREHOUSES line the waterfront. His PORSCHE is parked in the b.g. Macleod leans against the railing, staring out over the water. A beat. Suddenly, Macleod stiffens, his gaze lifts off the water. A premonition fills him. He turns around, knowing what he will find behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACLEOD'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other Horseman approaches. He holds his broad sword at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macleod holds his hand up.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. We don't have to do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman lunges at Macleod. He raises the sword and brings it down quickly. Macleod moves quickly to his side. The sword miss him by inches as it smashes into the railing, slicing through the metal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macleod stares into the Horseman's eyes -- they are cold, savage. He knows there is not point in talking.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
Macleod opens his rain coat and slowly removes the ancient Samurai sword. He expertly twirls the sword as he raises it over his head and holds it in a fighting stance. A beat. Both men lock eyes. The Horseman attacks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blades cross. Sparks fly. The men move across the quay towards the warehouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman thrusts his sword. Macleod steps to the side and slices the blade of the Samurai across the Horseman's face. A deep gash appears, blood flows down his cheek. The Horseman touches the wound, looks at the blood on his finger, then tastes it. He grins and attacks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman whirls his sword, swinging furiously at Macleod. Blow after powerful blow pounds against the samurai. Macleod is backed up against the railing. The swords cross and remained locked -- each man pushing against the other in a show of strength.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman knees Macleod in the groin. Macleod doubles over. The Horseman brings the butt of his sword down hard between Macleod's shoulder blades. Macleod falls to his knees, dropping his sword. The Horseman lifts the Samurai and throws it behind him. Macleod struggles to shake the pain from his body as the Horseman raises the sword above Macleod's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he brings it down, Macleod lunges forward, hurling his body into the Horseman and picking him. Macleod's runs across the quay carrying the Horseman on his shoulder. The Horseman raises his sword above his head. Macleod heads towards one of the large windows of the warehouse.
</DIRECTION>

INT. MEAT PACKING WAREHOUSE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH! Glass shatters as Macleod and the Horseman break through the window. Carcasses of BEEF hang from hooks on a curving S-HAPED processing line. Slowly the two warriors get to their feet. The Horseman's sword is a few feet behind him. He stands and walks to it. Macleod looks around the room, looking for something -- anything -- that might be used as a weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman attacks, swinging his sword wildly. Macleod grabs the racks of beef, using them as a shield. The Horseman's blade slices through the meat. Macleod back up, grabs another side of beef and pushes it into the Horseman. The impact knocks the Horseman to the ground. His sword slides across the floor. The Horseman gets up and walks over to his sword.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macleod grabs one of the MEAT HOOKS and hurls it towards the Horseman's back. The Horseman has just about reached the sword when the Hook spears him between the shoulder blades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macleod pushes a RED BUTTON. The processing line begins to move -- the hook lifts, picking the Horseman off the ground. The Horseman tries desperately to reach the hook, but he cannot. Macleod picks up the sword and readies himself. The Horseman heads back towards Macleod . In one fluid motion Macleod cuts off his head -- leaving the rope intact. The headless body continues to swing across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Macleod readies himself for what he knows his coming. Sparks of green light begin to pulse out from the Horseman's headless body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macleod's body stiffens as a jolt of power fills him. Overhead LIGHT FIXTURES CRACKLE as the LIGHT BULBS begin to glow. The ENGINE of an old fork lift comes to life. A RADIO turns on filling the room with MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

One by one the WINDOWS EXPLODE, raining a shower of glass on the dock -- and then -- SILENCE.

From pillar to pillar his shape changes until when he passes from behind the last one he is now Kilvara.

Kilvara falls to the ground on his back.

The Bank breaks into Chaos. CUSTOMERS dive to the ground. The Guard slowly moves over Kilvara and kicks the sword away. He leans over to take a pulse. Kilvara's eyes open.

Exactly as we remember it from Highlander one. Macleod sits on the couch, next to the aquarium. His eyes drift up a stone wall at the back of the room.

INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eighteenth century France.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An elegant room. Aristocrats, dressed in lavish clothing mingle and dance. Macleod and Cavanaugh stand off to the side. They are well dressed with white, powered wigs. Cavanaugh is clearly uncomfortable with his dress and surroundings.
</DIRECTION>
<CAVANAUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are we doing here?

Something catches Macleod's eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACLEOD'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the room, standing with a group of pompous-looking MEN is ISABELLE TOUREZ a beautiful woman in her early twenties. She looks remarkably like Jennifer. Her gaze falls on Macleod, she smiles shyly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cavanaugh follows Macleod's stare. He knows when trouble is coming -- and this is it.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
Macleod starts to walk over to her.

<MCCLEOD>

<CAVANAUGH>

</CAVANAUGH>
<MCCLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then she should be an excellent dancer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
Macleod walks across the room, his eyes on Isabelle. She steps forward as he approaches, leaving the group of MEN behind her. Macleod smiles and bows, then offers her his hand. She takes it and they walk out onto the dance floor.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.

</ISABELLE>
<MCCLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it's the past -- and things that are in the past are best left there.

Macleod knows where this conversation is going.

	So, you do this for yourself? What about her?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You cannot not have a relationship, Macleod. You've told me of your wife, Heather, and how you loved her. Romeriz warned you then, but you would not listen. You watched her grow old and die -- and there was nothing you could do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAVANAUGH>

A sadness falls over Macleod as he remembers. Cavanaugh walks over to him and puts his arm on his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>

Macleod stands in a courtyard with Cavanaugh and Gaston. Macleod looks up the stone wall to a balcony. Cavanaugh and Gaston do not appear pleased to be there. Macleod looks at Cavanaugh who nods to him reassuringly. Gaston looks around nervously.

Large and beautifully furnished. A fire glows at the far side of the room. Isabelle sits before a dressing table and mirror, combing her hair. She is a beautiful woman in her late twenties. In the mirror she sees Macleod as he enters the room from the balcony.

Macleod takes a ring off his finger. IT IS THE SAME RING JENNIFER WAS WEARING. He gently slips on Isabelle's finger.

Macleod and Cavanaugh start to leave. The GUARDS draw their swords. Macleod and Cavanaugh turn and draw their swords. Gaston is nervous. He reaches under his jacket.

<GASTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have permission. I'll show you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GASTON>

Before he take out whatever he is reaching for one the GUARDS thrusts his sword at Gaston. In a flash, Macleod Samurai is out and blocks the blade, stopping it inches before Gaston's chest.

Gaston leaves. A fight begins. The Guards are not match for the two immortals. Cavanaugh quickly stabs one of the Guards in the arm. He drops his sword and falls to the ground. Macleod battles with the other Guard. He backs him up to the wall, knocks his sword away and hold the tip of his Samurai at his throat. A beat. Anger fills Macleod's face as he decides what to do.
</DIRECTION>

In the b.g. we HEAR the SOUND of FOOTSTEPS. Macleod turns around to find that he and Cavanaugh are surrounded by TEN MORE GUARDS. Macleod looks to Cavanaugh, who shakes his head, No.

An unmarked POLICE CAR is down the street. Greley is inside it watching the shop.

The streets are empty.

Macleod reaches under his raincoat for the handle of his sword and starts walking. As he reaches the corner we HEAR FOOTSTEPS. Macleod stops -- waits.
</DIRECTION>

A UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICER turns the corner and walks towards him. Macleod takes his hand out from his coat and walks past him. The instant the COP passes Macleod he turns and removes a SWORD from under his jacket.

Jennifer watches helplessly.

Macleod is walking away. He hears her SCREAM and turns around just as the sword comes streaking at his head. Macleod side- steps the attack, the blade slices across his forearm, a stripe of BLOOD appears on his arm. Macleod quickly removes his Samurai from under his jacket.

The cop studies him for a moment then begins to LAUGH. A transformation begins and he turns into Kilvara.

Jennifer's face is filled with disbelief from the sight she has just witnessed.

Kilvara smiles at Macleod, his eyes alive with hatred.

Kilvara says nothing. He lunges at Macleod. Their swords cross - sparks fly -- as the battle each other along the street. Their sword cross and lock -- they grab each other hands -- their faces inches from each other.

Kilvara knees Macleod in the groin. Macleod doubles over, then pushes forward, ramming his head in Kilvara's stomach -- pushing him backwards and slamming his back into a wall.

LIGHTS begins to come on in the windows of the apartments. Macleod runs off. Kilvara follows. Macleod runs around the corner.

Jennifer does not move. She is trying to digest what she has seen. A beat, then she runs after them.

As Kilvara rounds the corner he sees Macleod waiting for him, his sword at his side. Kilvara runs towards him, begins to raise his sword then stops.

We see why. Behind Macleod is a CHURCH. Kilvara lowers his sword and looks at Macleod hatefully.

Nineteenth century England.

The East end. The waterfront, cobblestone streets, gas lamps. A thick fog hangs in the air. Piano MUSIC drifts out of one of the pubs. CROWDS of people hurry along the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Among them is Macleod. He is dressed in a suit like an English Gentleman and carries the ivory-handled WALKING STICK. He walks slowly, through the crowd, seemingly oblivious to the people around him. He comes to the mouth of an alley and stops, thinks, then enters.

Wooden crates and stacks of garbage fill the alley. Macleod continues. In the b.g. we HEAR the SOUNDS of a struggle.

A middle-aged man, also dressed like an English Gentleman is struggling with a PROSTITUTE. He grabs her roughly and pins her against the wall. From inside his overcoat he slowly removes a long sword. He holds the tip of the blade up before her eyes.

	Let me ask you something else. At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.

	So?

<MCCLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It came from your great, great, great grandmother, Isabelle Tourez, who lived in Paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried. The ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.

Now that she has heard what she suspected a look of doubt crosses her face. Macleod notices it.

	I was born into the clan Macleod, five hundred years ago in Glenfinnan -- on the shores of Loch Shiel.

Jennifer stares at him -- there is doubt in her eyes. Suspecting and believing are two different things and her expression relays her skepticism. Macleod picks up a DAGGER on the worktable and holds it before his heart.

<MCCLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've wandered the world ever since then. I cannot die.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
She tries to stop him, but before she can Macleod thrusts the dagger into his chest. His face fills with pain -- he drops to his knees. Jennifer watches in horror. A beat. Macleod looks up at her, then pulls the dagger from his chest. Jennifer is overwhelmed with astonishment. She slowly drops to her knees. They are inches from each other.

Jennifer stares deeply into his eyes. She moves closer and then, gently kisses him. They search each others eyes. She leans in to kiss him again. Macleod pulls away. She starts to say something, he gently puts his finger over her lips and stares at her fondly -- then leaves.

	Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords. One cut off the others head. He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.

<KILVARA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No? You know, some people think that I don't have any good qualities, but that isn't true. I saw you tonight with your little friend -- I let you say goodbye to her. I think of it as letting a condemned prisoner have his last request. Besides, I have her now.

MACLEOD'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer is gagged and tied to a chair which has been placed on top of a long table. Another chair has been placed about three feet away from her on the table. On the second chair a CROSSBOW has been mounted and aimed at Jennifer. A ROPE is tied to the TRIGGER and stretched to her chair. A WEIGHT has been tied in the center of the rope. A CANDLE burns behind the WEIGHT. When it burns though the rope the WEIGHT will fall and the CROSSBOW will fire at Jennifer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kilvara steps out of the shadows, a wicked grin on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<KILVARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clever -- don't you think. You can save her. All you have to do is blow out the candle. Of course, you have to get past me to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KILVARA>
<DIRECTION>
The rope is beginning to turn black as the candle burns deeper into it. Macleod knows he has little time before the ropes snaps. He moves towards her. Kilvara blocks his path.
</DIRECTION>
<KILVARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, you die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KILVARA>
<DIRECTION>
Kilvara swings his sword at Macleod. Macleod blocks the attack. Kilvara kicks him in the stomach, doubling him over and driving him back. Kilvara wields his sword powerfully. Macleod side-steps the attack -- Kilvara's blade slams into a table, slicing it cleanly in half.

The battle continues. Kilvara presses the attack, swinging his sword furiously and relentlessly at Macleod. Macleod jumps up on a table. Kilvara swings his blade at Macleod's knees. Macleod jumps, the blade sails under his feet, when he lands he KICKS Kilvara in the face, knocking him to the ground. Kilvara's sword slides across the floor. Macleod looks at Kilvara, then across the room. He has only a second to decide: Kilvara or Jennifer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACLEOD'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ROPE is about to snap -- strands are staring to fray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macleod runs across the tabletop and jumps onto another as he heads for the long table across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kilvara stands -- picks up his sword and runs after Macleod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More strands of the rope snap as the flame burns deeper in the rope. It is just about to when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macleod runs onto the long table. He dives and slides across it -- his Samurai extended in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rope SNAPS. The WEIGHT begins to fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macleod drives the blade of his sword through the trigger housing. The WEIGHT pulls on the rope -- but the blade of the Samurai blocks the trigger from pulling back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kilvara reaches Macleod. Their eyes meet. Macleod knows he cannot removes his sword to defend himself or the crossbow will fire. Kilvara raises his sword and is about to strike when a SHOT is FIRED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bedsoe is standing in the doorway, his gun aimed at Kilvara.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bedsoe fires two shots. They hit Kilvara in the chest. He drops to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macleod unties Jennifer quickly. Bedsoe moves across the room towards them. He carefully passes the motionless body of Kilvara.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bedsoe -- he isn't dead!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
Too late. Kilvara stands, grabbing Bedsoe guns hand. He smashes it against the wall. The GUN flies out of Bedsoe's hand and slides across the floor. Kilvara effortlessly lifts him off the ground and throws him against the wall. Bedsoe hist the floor hard, his face etched in pain from several broken bones. Jennifer runs over to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kilvara picks up his sword and moves towards Macleod.
</DIRECTION>
<KILVARA>
	<DIALOGUE>

Macleod stares at him confidently.

Macleod quickly spins the chair with the CROSSBOW around so it is facing Kilvara. He removes his Samurai. The trigger snaps back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOSH! The ARROW hits Kilvara in the chest. Pain fills his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macleod runs towards him. Kilvara pulls the arrow from his chest and manages to raises his sword just in time to block Macleod's attack. Through the room they battle. Macleod fights fiercely backing Kilvara up.

Jennifer makes Bedsoe more comfortable by propping him against the wall. She looks around the room.

JENNIFER'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of Bedsoe's gun on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer rushes over to it and picks it up. She aims it at Kilvara.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kilvara sees her with the gun. He knows that if she shoots him he would be stunned along enough for Macleod to take his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer FIRES a SHOT. It misses -- the bullet hits the wall. Kilvara swings his sword powerfully at one of the WOODEN PILLARS. His blade slices through it. Part of the ROOF collapses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUST fills the room. SILENCE. Jennifer slowly moves forward, trying to see through it. The dust clears. She stops -- stunned and confused by what she sees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JENNIFER'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing in the middle of the room are TWO MACLEOD'S.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer moves the gun back and forth between each of them, noting knowing which is the real Macleod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both Macleod's look at each other. They lunges at each other and the battle begins again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer can only watch helplessly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the room they fight -- both Macleod's swinging their swords at the other -- their swords cross -- sparks fly. They move through the room -- fighting fiercely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the Macleod's swings his sword -- it slices through the other arm. The other Macleod's drops his sword. The first Macleod raises his sword.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLEOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There can be only one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLEOD>
<DIRECTION>
He swings the sword, slicing it across the other Macleod's neck. A beat. Out the gash come a brilliant GREEN LIGHT -- then the transformation begins. The image of Macleod fades and is replaced by Kilvara. He stares at Macleod, tries to smile, but falls to the floor and dies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Macleod readies himself. The place explodes in a burst of GREEN LIGHT. Windows explode, overhead lights flash on and off then blow up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer and Bedsoe shield their eyes from the brilliant spectacle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macleod's body pulses with pain as Kilvara's power flows into him.

For a moment it is as if he didn't hear the question, then slowly he looks at her. He picks up his Samurai and slowly slices the blade into the palm of his hand. A cut appears. A beat. It does not heal. Macleod looks at her with a trace of grin.
