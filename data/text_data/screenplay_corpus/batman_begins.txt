Thomas, coat over his arm, ushers his family down the dark alley, heading for the WELCOMING GLOW of the main boulevard.
</DIRECTION>

A FIGURE emerges from the shadows in front of them. A MAN. With a GUN. Shifting uneasily.

<DIRECTION>
Thomas hands Young Bruce his coat, then reaches for his wallet. The Man JERKS the gun at Thomas, eyes DARTING. Young Bruce stares up at the gun TREMBLING in the Man's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>

She starts pulling off her rings. The Man JERKS the gun at her neck. Thomas STEPS protectively in front of his wife.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, just-
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM. Young Bruce FLINCHES. Thomas looks down at his bleeding chest. Then back to the Man, saddened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas CRUMPLES. Martha SCREAMS. The Man REACHES for Martha's pearls- but she SCREAMS desperately for Thomas.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THOMAS!! THOMAS!!

</MARTHA>
<MAN>

	Gimme the damn...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
But Martha FLAILS, trying to grab her fallen husband.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Man SHOOTS her. Then YANKS at her necklace, which BREAKS. Spilling PEARLS all over the asphalt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Man stands. Turns to Young Bruce. Who STARES at him. Uncomprehending. The Man cannot bear the boy's gaze...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then he RUNS. Young Bruce looks at the bodies of his parents. DROPS to his knees, head down: PEARLS dot the asphalt beneath him. Some of them are bloody.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young Bruce starts to SHIVER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE STATION -- NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
(reassuring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay.

EXT. FROZEN LAKE, HIMALAYAS -- DAY

Ducard STRIKES DOWN at Wayne with his sword. Wayne BLOCKS the strike with FOREARMS CROSSED, SLIDES BETWEEN DUCARD'S LEGS across the ice to where his sword lies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRASPING his sword he SPINS, SWEEPING at Ducard's feet. Ducard LEAPS- Wayne CATCHES his foot, brings him down onto the ice. Wayne THRUSTS his sword at Ducard's throat-

STOPS INCHES from Ducard's bare neck. Ducard freezes, arms at his sides. Wayne looks down at Ducard, SMILING in triumph.

Bruce STOPS in his tracks. Reporters DIVE for cover- COPS jump on the Blonde Reporter, pinning her...

Bruce. Fifteen feet away. Loaded gun up his sleeve. Face as uncomprehending as the night Chill killed his parents. Rachel moves to Bruce, pulling him away from the chaos.

	This city is rotting. Chill is not the cause, he's the effect. Corruption is killing Gotham and Chill being dead doesn't help that- it makes it worse because Falcone walks.

Wayne STRIKES Ducard in the head with the butt of his sword, DOUSES his mask in the liquid fire and TOSSES it back into the mezzanine where the explosive powders are stored...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ra's LEAPS from his throne, STRIKING at Wayne with his sword- Wayne parries- EXPLOSIONS roar from the balcony, shooting flame across the ceiling- Ra's and Wayne fight as EXPLOSIONS surround them...

Wayne LEAPS clear as FLAMING DEBRIS collapses onto Ra's, CRUSHING him... the flames are rising, Ninja bodies are strewn around, fresh explosions rip across the hall as Ninjas flee and Wayne spots Ducard lying unconscious.

Wayne PICKS UP Ducard, hauls him out of the Throne room, into a passage, SMASHING THROUGH an ornate screen...

Wayne and Ducard CRASH down onto a steep slope of ice and rock, the monastery exploding above them... Wayne rolls over, GRABS a rock, looks across to see-

Ducard UNCONSCIOUS, SLIDING down the icy slope. His limp form ROTATES, spinning as his body gathers MOMENTUM, rushing towards the EDGE of the CLIFF...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wayne DIVES AFTER HIM, SLIDING HEAD-FIRST down the ice... the cliff closer and closer as Wayne RACES after Ducard...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERE FEET FROM THE CLIFF EDGE, Wayne GRABS Ducard- raises his free GAUNTLET-CLAD ARM, and SMASHES AT THE ICE, DIGGING IN with the BRONZE SCALLOPS... STOPPING on the edge- Ducard HANGS LIMPLY over a tremendous drop- Wayne STRUGGLES with the dead weight. Wayne PULLS Ducard up onto the ice. BREATHING.

DARKNESS, punctured by LIGHT as BOARDS are YANKED, splintering from the mouth of the well, high above.

Wayne climbs down a jagged rock crevice. Air blows in his face. The crevice WIDENS into a low-ceilinged chamber. Wayne hears the RUSH of WATER. He crouches, advances through the low chamber. It turns DOWNWARDS, steeper- Wayne carefully slides on his back, LOWERING HIMSELF into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIMITLESS BLACK. Wayne stands. A ROAR of water now. He REACHES into his coat, pulls out a CHEMICAL TORCH. CRACKS it, throwing LIGHT into...

<DIRECTION>
A VAST CAVERN. An underground RIVER, a JAGGED ceiling, far above, which, as Wayne PEERS, starts to MOVE-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BATS EXPLODE from the ceiling. THOUSANDS DESCEND, SCREECHING, attracted to the light- Wayne instinctively CROUCHES. But as they SWARM around him terrifyingly...

Wayne RISES to his feet amidst a CYCLONE of bats, watching the fluttering blackness with a profound CALM.

And he knows the symbol he must use.

INT. GORDON'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon SLUMPS into his chair, back to the window. Reaches for the phone- notices a BOOK sitting on his desk: an old, worn copy of: "PHYLUM PERACOPDA: THE TWILIGHT WORLD OF BATS".

Gordon frowns at the book, CONFUSED. The light goes OUT.

Wayne RACES for the GAP- LEAPS... DROPS FAST... misses THE TOP STORY- GRABS the balcony below... it BREAKS AWAY- DROPS him onto the one below. Winded, Wayne CLIMBS onto the wall.

Wayne feels the weight. It is light. Strong. He picks up the HARNESS that goes with it. Shoulder straps with a wide, hi-tech BELT. Wayne shoves the back end of the gun into the belt buckle- it CLICKS into place.

Wayne examines it, shrugs. Fox puts on a GLOVE.

Fox releases the tent, which instantly COLLAPSES.

	It could be tailored to any structure based on a rigid skeleton.

Fox SHOUTS over the noise of the engine.

Wayne inspects the cockpit: a forward-slung "gunner's" driving position between their legs, video screens, electronic controls, windows with HEADS-UP DISPLAY. Wayne ACCELERATES...

Wayne lifts a GLOVED hand, metal contacts on the fingertips. With his other hand, he picks up a FABRIC GLOVE, RIBBONS dangling from each finger.

Alfred indicates the steel carved into a BAT'S WING.

<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
They stroll, side by side, towards the smoking ruins.
</DIRECTION>
<ALFRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought we might take the opportunity of making some improvements to the foundation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALFRED>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the south east corner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<ALFRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Precisely, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALFRED>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The irregular SHADOW of a BAT SYMBOL cast up onto turbulent clouds... and we are-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOF, POLICE STATION -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon sips coffee from a styrofoam cup. Beside him- an upturned spotlight with a METAL STENCIL bolted to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dark FLUTTERING, and Batman is standing the other side of the spotlight. He reaches out, taps the stencil.
</DIRECTION>
<BATMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BATMAN>
<GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
(crushing his cup)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Couldn't find any mob bosses to strap to the light.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon kills the searchlight. The two men stand opposite each other in the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<BATMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Sergeant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BATMAN>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Lieutenant, now. Commissioner Loeb had to promote me. And he had to disband the task force hunting you. Amazing what saving a city can do for your image.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<BATMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then things are better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BATMAN>
<GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've started something- bent cops running scared, hope on the streets...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon leaves his sentence hanging between them.
</DIRECTION>
<BATMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BATMAN>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But there's a lot of weirdness out there right now... the Narrows is lost... we still haven't picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<BATMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We will. Gotham will return to normal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BATMAN>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will it? What about escalation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<BATMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Escalation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BATMAN>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We start carrying semiautomatics, they buy automatics... we start wearing kevlar, they buy armor- piercing rounds...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<BATMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BATMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon leans closer to Batman. Points at him.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And... you're wearing a mask and jumping off rooftops...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon fishes in his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take this guy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls out a clear plastic evidence bag.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...armed robbery, double homicide...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the clear plastic bag is a PLAYING CARD.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got a taste for theatrics, like you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon hands Batman the bag.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leaves a calling card.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
Batman turns the card over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a JOKER.
</DIRECTION>
<BATMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll look into it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BATMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He steps up onto the balustrade. Gordon looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never said thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
Batman looks out at the lights of Gotham. Cloak billowing around him.
</DIRECTION>
<BATMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you'll never have to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BATMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Batman DROPS from the rooftop, GLIDING on the night wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon smiles. He can't help it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREDITS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END.
