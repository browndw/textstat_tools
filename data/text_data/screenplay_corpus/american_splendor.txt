INT. HARVEY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BEDROOM MIRROR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is dark. A perfectly square mirror hangs crooked on a wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, out of the darkness, the reflection of a man's face comes into focus. He stares straight ahead, perhaps studying his own unrecognizable reflection. It's quite clear this is a portrait of sickness; the man's pallor is gray, his eyes are confused. There is something most definitely wrong.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tentatively, the figure steps away from the mirror, leaving the frame empty and dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON BED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like a ghost, the naked man (Harvey) stands over his bed staring down at his sleeping wife (Joyce). In the eerie light, he's almost translucent.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(faintly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joyce... Joyce?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Joyce springs up, alarmed.
</DIRECTION>
<JOYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong, Harvey? What are you doing up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOYCE>
<DIRECTION>
Harvey just stands there for a moment saying nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<JOYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOYCE>
<HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(delirious, out of breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me the truth. Am I some guy who writes about himself in a comic book? Or am I just -- am I just a character in that book?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Joyce rubs her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<JOYCE>

</JOYCE>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I die, will 'dat character keep goin'? Or will he just fade away...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Joyce just stares at him, unsure how to answer. Suddenly Harvey collapses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joyce leaps from the bed, nervous, hysterical. She gets down on the floor and shakes him.
</DIRECTION>
<JOYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Omigod, Harvey! Harvey, wake up!

FADE TO BLACK:

EXT. CLEVELAND ROW HOUSE - FALL - 1956 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE UP ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A surreal kaleidoscope of black, white and red. Similar to the mirror scene above, the colors slowly come into focus, revealing the chiseled features of a familiar face. But this time we see that it is not a real face, but rather a plastic mask of the D.C. Comic hero -- SUPERMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERTITLE: CLEVELAND OHIO, 1956

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON SUPERMAN MASK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It glows eerily in the light of a porch lamp. A child's pupils glare through the eye holes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera pans from SUPERMAN to the masked face of another caped-crusader: BATMAN. Batman turns toward his loyal sidekick ROBIN, who clutches a plastic, trick-or-treat pumpkin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next, we find THE GREEN LANTERN as he reaches up to ring the doorbell. The camera finally rests on the last boy: an unkempt KID wearing no costume at all. Looking irritated and removed from the rest of the group, the KID shoves his hands in the pockets of his shearling coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spits and rolls his eyes as a lady answers the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The brick home is as working class as it gets. The lady at the door is a 1950's HOUSEWIFE.

She finally stops at the costumeless KID. He halfheartedly holds up a ratty, stained pillowcase.

A grown-up version of HARVEY PEKAR (now mid-thirties) stomps along the same Cleveland street. Unfortunately, 20 years have made this rust belt neighborhood a bit rustier. The "GROWN UP HARVEY" dons the same shearling coat, sports the same disheveled hair, and wears the same curmudgeonly expression.

Harvey fixes a rip in his coat with Elmer's Glue.

(Note: Each "Cartoon Harvey" looks similar but unique... A variation on a theme. This is because his cartoons are drawn by different comic artists.)

Intermittently, bold cartoon credits flash across the screen:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. We're throwing a lot at ya here, so lemme step in an' help ya catch up. This is the story about comic books, an' a guy who made a whole life outta them. You could even say comics saved his life. This guy here, he's our man, Harvey Pekar -- all grown up and goin' nowhere. Although he's a pretty scholarly cat, he never got much of a formal education. For the most part, he's lived in shit neighborhoods, held shit jobs, and is now knee deep into a second disastrous marriage. So if yer lookin' for romance or escapism or some fantasy figure to save the day, guess what? Ya got the wrong movie.

The REAL HARVEY PEKAR (not the actor who trudged through the credits) sits behind a microphone, supplying the "voice over" above. He clutches a movie script in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The frame is spare, with a few well-chosen items to indicate that he's in a recording session.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Although he is significantly older than the man who portrays him, the "Real Harvey" is every bit as much of a sad sack... maybe even more. He is large and slightly threatening with knitted brows and wild eyes. Yet there is something kind and vulnerable about him -- a teddy bear who could kick your ass. Off Camera, WE HEAR the voices of the male and female directors (us -- BOB and SHARI) coaching the "Real Harvey" through his voice over. Harvey's irritable and contrary, saying that the whole Halloween incident never even happened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"But I don't care man. I'm just doing this for the dough." We learn that Harvey is a reluctant participant in a film being made about his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY, his third wife JOYCE BRABNER -- an intelligent control freak obsessed with all things negative -- joins in the conversation. Pushing back her huge glasses, she reprimands Harvey like he is an infant: "Harvey you are talking too loud, Harvey you are being difficult." Harvey just rolls his eyes. Joyce gets offended. It is clear they have had this argument a million times. As Joyce storms off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harvey explains that his wife is trying to take over the movie. He laments that she is his third wife, and he has no luck with women. "Man, chicks just don't dig me." That's why he marries anyone who will have him. "And I marry them fast before they get to know the real me..."

HARVEY sits on a table in his T-shirt and underwear. A DOCTOR unwraps a tongue depressor.

Harvey's voice is hoarse, raspy and barely audible. It sounds like it hurts for him to talk. Yet, he can't stop ranting.

Relieved, Harvey calms down. He nods, agreeing to be good.

	Once he came to visit when I was really feelin' bad. It was right around the time of my throat operation, an' right after my second wife left me. At first it was pretty weird. I mean, here my life was falling apart an' everything was going great for him. I was on my second divorce an' he was a big hit with the chicks. I was a nothin' file clerk and he was this famous cartoonist.

We see Joyce standing in front of a GROUP OF PRISONERS.
</DIRECTION>
<JOYCE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a sometime activist and I teach writing to prisoners. I try to help them build an interior life and make art out of their monotonous, suffocating routine.

Now we see Harvey (full screen) in bed in his underwear talking on the PHONE. He's clipping his toe nails.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Cleveland? You think that's a good idea?

<HARVEY>

	It's a great idea. You should meet me, 'cause I'm a great guy. Despite the way my comics read, I got a lot of redeeming characteristics.

Joyce sits on her equally disheveled bed dunking a tea bag.

Her hair is wet from a shower.

Joyce sighs and lies down. A variety of AMERICAN SPLENDORS are across her bed. Different interpretations of Harvey stare up at her.
</DIRECTION>
<JOYCE>
<DIRECTION>
(sipping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, the way all those different artists draw you, I don't quite know what to expect. I mean sometimes you look like a younger Brando, but then the way Crumb draws you -- like a hairy ape with all those stinky, wavy lines radiating off your body -- it's kind of scary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOYCE>
<HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those are motion lines. I'm an active guy. Anyway, just come out here an' I'll try to be anyone you want me ta be.

INT. AIRPORT - ARRIVALS GATE - 1980'S - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A nervous JOYCE walks off the plane into the arrivals area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She scans the crowd of friends, family, lovers and limo drivers waiting to meet the disembarking passengers. Where is Harvey? What will he look like?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Joyce surveys the unfamiliar faces, she imagines different versions of an animated, illustrated Harvey among the people.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She double-takes as sees the R. CRUMB HARVEY -- hairy, scary, smelly and picking his nose. Joyce rubs her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next she sees the BRANDO HARVEY (Gary Dumm), but unfortunately he disappears fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Disappointed, Joyce notices the realistic DREW FRIEDMAN HARVEY walking towards her. She smiles as he dissolves into:
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Are you Joyce?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Joyce turns around. The flesh and blood HARVEY PEKAR stands before her -- not quite as bad as the Crumb version, not quite as good as the Dumm version, but still acceptable. She sighs with relief.
</DIRECTION>
<JOYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Harvey. We finally meet in person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOYCE>
<DIRECTION>
She politely offers her hand. Harvey shakes it, but he looks overwhelmed, worried and pessimistic.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hiya. Look, before we get started with any of this, ya might as well know right off the bat. I had a vasectomy.

INT. TGIF STYLE RESTAURANT - 1980'S - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The most awkward date in history. Seated in an ultra-yuppie restaurant filled with business lunchers, Harvey and Joyce hide behind their menus. While everyone else looks slick and successful, these two compete for the world's worst posture.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong?

	Me? I never been here. I thought you'd like it. But obviously ya don't, do ya?

</HARVEY>
<JOYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's fine. What difference does it make?

Harvey shakes his head, feeling more pessimistic.

	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Joyce grabs a bread stick.
</DIRECTION>
<JOYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm. I support and identify with groups like PETA, but unfortunately I'm a self-diagnosed anemic. Also, I have all these food allergies to vegetables that give me serious intestinal distress. I guess I have a lot of borderline health disorders that limit me politically when it comes to eating.

Harvey just stares at her.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. Yer a sick woman, huh?

JOYCE and HARVEY enter the apartment. The place is a mess, as usual.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I was gonna clean up, but why should I give you any false notions? The truth is I got a serious problem with cleanliness. I could wash a dish ten times and it'd still dirty. They even kicked me outta the Army 'cause I couldn't learn ta make a bed.

Joyce puts down her bag.
</DIRECTION>
<JOYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>

She slumps down on the sofa as if she's been here a million times. She rubs her head. Harvey sits next to her.

<JOYCE>

	Harvey, go get me water and a few aspirin.

Harvey empties the aspirin bottle in his palm. For some reason, he's feeling more comfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well lemme tell ya Joyce, it sure is nice ta have company. I mean, despite all your problems, you seem like a great person. An' hey, sorry if my dating skills are kinda rusty, but I've just been through hell and back with women. I mean that last one turned out to be a real nasty bitch.

He stops by a junker car and peeks in the window, finding TOBY eating lunch alone. He has an entire White Castle smorgasbord spread across the front seat.

	What are these nerds like? How would you describe them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<TOBY>

Toby spills some catsup on his polyester button-down shirt.

</HARVEY>
<TOBY>
<DIRECTION>
(rubbing out the catsup)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I consider myself a nerd. And this movie has uplifted me. There's this one scene where a nerd grabs the microphone during a pep rally and announces that he is a nerd and that he is proud of it and stands up for the rights of other nerds. Then, he asks the kids at the pep rally who think they are nerds to come forward... So nearly everyone in the place does. That's the way the movie ends.

	It's an entertaining flick an' I can see why you like it Toby, but those people on the screen ain't even supposed to be you! They're college students whose parents live in big houses in the suburbs. They're gonna get degrees, get good jobs and stop being nerds.

We can see THE REAL JOYCE sitting with THE REAL HARVEY in the distance.

<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I think the thing with Joyce is that as manic as Harvey can be, she matches him with depression. In that way they complete each other. I mean, she's obviously a very smart woman, but she has a lot of trouble functioning in a world she can't control. And she's totally obsessed with all things negative; y'know, diseases, dysfuctions, etc.

HARVEY and JOYCE sit in the office holding hands, like two terrified high school kids. A DOCTOR stands before them.

They just got bad news...
</DIRECTION>
<JOYCE>

	I don't understand, does "tumor" mean the same thing as "cancer"?

</JOYCE>
<DIRECTION>
The doctor gently nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joyce covers her mouth. Harvey holds onto his head. He looks positively dizzy. The doctor starts to talk, yet the words don't seem to match his mouth. He looks dubbed. Strange phrases just weave together, echo and bounce off the wall, making no sense at all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...we know the growth is malignant. What we don't know is how far it may have spread. Once we have the results of the biopsy, we can make more informed decisions about treatment... blah, blah, blah...

</HARVEY>
<JOYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, you can. And I'll tell you how. You'll make a comic book out of the whole thing. You'll document every little detail. And that way you'll remove yourself from the experience until it's over.

Despite Joyce's passionate pitch, Harvey shakes his head.

CLOSE ON HARVEY'S FACE

His eyes remain closed, his expression far, far away. The sound of Joyce's voice fades until it seems like a distant echo.

Then PANELS from Harvey's comics begin to float over his head, his life literally passing before his eyes in comic book form.

Slowly, the comic images and the unconscious Harvey evaporate, giving way to:

A SURREAL DREAM SEQUENCE

We are now in a large, empty room similar to a blank comic book panel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A healthy, fully dressed Harvey appears in the corner of the frame. He is very far away, barely recognizable. We slowly dolly towards him as he delivers a formal soliloquy to the camera:
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Harvey Pekar. It's an unusual name -- Harvey Pekar...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
As Harvey speaks, one-dimensional comic book images from his life pass over the screen once again. This time in front of him, behind him, everywhere. We dolly in towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	1960 was the year I got my first apartment and my first telephone book. Imagine my surprise when I looked up my name and saw that, in addition to me, another Harvey Pekar was listed!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Images of Harvey's childhood float by, followed by his young adult years.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was listed as Harvey L. Pekar... My middle name is Lawrence... He was listed as Harvey Pekar -- no middle initial... Therefore, his was a purer listing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
We see Harvey age in the images: he's hanging on the street corner with friends, collecting records, hanging with Crumb.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then, in the seventies, I noticed that a third Harvey Pekar was listed in the phone book! This filled me with curiosity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could there be three people with such an unusual name in the world, let alone in one city?!

<DIRECTION>
Now, numerous images of Harvey's many years at the V.A. Hospital float by: Harvey filing, Harvey arguing with his boss, Harvey and Toby, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then one day, a person I worked with expressed her sympathy to me concerning what she thought was the death of my father. She pointed out an obituary notice in the newspaper for a man named Harvey Pekar. One of his sons was named Harvey. These were the other Harvey Pekars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
The comic images fade out. Harvey is once again alone in the empty room.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Six months later, Harvey Pekar Jr. died. Although I'd met neither man, I was filled with sadness. "What were they like," I thought. It seemed that our lives had been linked in some indefinable way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
We slowly move in on his face. Extremely close. As close as the camera can get.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>

	With a little luck, I'll get a window of good health between retirin' an dyin'. The golden years, right? Who knows. Between my pension and the chunk of change I got for this movie, I should be able to swing somethin'. Sure I'll lose the war eventually, but the goal is to win a few skirmishes along the way. Right?
