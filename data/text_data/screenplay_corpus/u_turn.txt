EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE DESERT SOUTHWEST - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEGIN TITLES OVER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is early morning and already hot. INSECTS drone, crackle, and scurry for shade. PRAIRIE DOGS burrow to escape the sun. We can see the heat shimmering off the surface of the Earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a dusty highway, a pair of VULTURES dine on a dead coyote. One of them snags an intestine and tugs a few feet of it out of the carcass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, where a long, dusty road meets the horizon, a small shape appears -- a Sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang convertible, its top down. Its candy-apple red burns like a brilliant fireball under the sun. As the car drifts closer, we see steam escaping from under the hood. Sammi Smith's "Please Help Me Get Through The Night" plays on the car's radio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOBBY COOPER'S MUSTANG - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the wheel, ignoring impending disaster, BOBBY COOPER, young, good-looking, fiddles with the RADIO dial, annoyed only to find country stations. He's been driving since noon yesterday and it shows -- along with a heavily-bandaged left hand resting on the steering wheel. He finds something by Pearl Jam or Smashing Pumpkins and he cranks it. He pops a Percodan with his good hand as, in the shimmering distance ahead, he sees black shapes in the road and lays on the horn.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get off the goddamn road!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the MUSTANG powers by, the VULTURES move off the shoulder, silently watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUSTANG - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The RADIO blares as BOBBY fights to stay awake. His attention is caught by blue and red lights flashing in the oncoming lane. He sits up as the POLICE CAR (SHERIFF POTTER inside) closes quickly. The SIREN starts faintly, then SCREAMS as the cruiser roars past at speed.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
There is a loud pop from the front of the Mustang and a thick cloud of steam now pours from the hood. The temperature gauge now starts rising.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!...Not now!...Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
A couple of SEMIS roar past in the opposite direction, buffetting the Mustang with their air waves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FORK IN THE ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car rolls into a fork in the road, limping with the droop of an animal that won't make another hundred yards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One sign on the larger road says "GLOBE" is 29 miles away. The other sign, on the lesser road, tells us "SUPERIOR" is only 2 miles. A third sign confirms his destiny with "Gas, Food, 1 Mile."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOBBY seems to have no choice. He aims the car down the lesser road towards "Superior, Arizona."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTSKIRTS SUPERIOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car rattles on its last legs, as BOBBY mutters incantations, noticing a old, ghostlike MINING COMPANY at the base of the mountains overlooking the TOWN. It's deserted now, no one visible, the gates shut, but in its vast, dark bulk, we sense the ancient richness and power of this town. Bobby moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HARLIN'S GARAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down the road from the MINING COMPANY, BOBBY'S CAR pulls into a small GAS STATION, made of weather-beaten wood, its windows long since dusted over. The pumps themselves look to have been manufactured in the early fifties. Above the station is a sign so faded it's barely readable: HARLIN'S.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby gets out of the car and with great care, favoring his bandaged left hand which seems to give him a great deal of pain, he opens the hood. A plume of steam hits him in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby looks around for someone, anyone. After a few moments he reaches into the car and blows the horn. He waits, then blows it again. From out of the station walks DARRELL - a slow-looking man in coveralls caked with grease and dirty. He looks the part of a yokel.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You Harlin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope. Darrell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harlin around?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's up at the Look Out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<DIRECTION>
Darrell points a scraggly finger at a plateau in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will he be back soon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doubt it. He's dead. The Look Out's a cemetery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You own this place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why do you call it Harlin's?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause Harlin used to own it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby is confused, but chooses to drop the matter.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn. Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither. Then of course the clouds come in...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<DIRECTION>
Darrell mops his brow with a greasy rag. It doesn't so much wipe the sweat as it does streak his forehead with dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darrell--
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose. It's busted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Darrell is clearly upset at being cut off. He leans into the car and looks at the engine.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your radiator hose. It's busted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know it's busted. What did I just tell you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time. Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somewhere else? Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I'm stuck. You happy? Now can you fix it, or not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I can fix it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(rewinds his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What time is it now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty-after-ten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus. Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ninety-two. Course half hour from now might be seventy-two. These clouds move around a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby wipes the bandaged hand across his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to your hand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<DIRECTION>
Self-consciously Bobby quickly drops his hand to his side.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Accident.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got to be more careful. Hands is important. Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Diner up a piece. Not much, but us simple folk like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Darrell slams down the hood.
</DIRECTION>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby reaches into the car, pulls out a small ugly gym bag which he slings onto his shoulder and moves to the trunk, pops it open.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not just a car. It's a sixty-four and half Mustang convertible. That's the difference between you and me, and why you live here and I'm just passing through.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
The trunk lid rises in the air, partially blocking Bobby from Darrell, acting as a partition between them.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now do you mind? I got to get some stuff out of the trunk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
He throws the car key to Darrell who takes the hint, spits grotesquely into the dirt, scratches his nuts, and walks back to the shack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Concealed by the trunk lid, Bobby pulls out a GUN (a .9mm black Baretta), wrapped in a t-shirt, from the top of the bag. Perhaps we see a flash of green money, lots of it. Sports pages and betting sheets are piled inside. With a look around, Bobby takes the gun and stashes it underneath the rubber mat in the trunk. Briefly we notice a towing ROPE under the mat. There is a small travel bag, from which he peels a fresh bottle of Percodan, quickly taking two, as well as the sports page.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HARLIN'S GARAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DARRELL watches out of the darkened office through the front window, as BOBBY slams the trunk and starts walking down the road, with the bag on his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT ROAD - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOBBY walks along a dusty patch of road into town past a sign saying "SUPERIOR - HOME OF THE GOLDEN DOOR RETIREMENT COMMUNITY." As he walks on, a pair of MOTORCYCLERS roar past on their Harleys blanketing him in a cloud of DUST. He shouts after them, but his words are lost under the whine of the cycle engines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUPERIOR MAIN STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOBBY hits town, such as it is: The Freeway left here a few years back. There are only a few little stores: A general store, a catalog outlet, a post office that doubles as a bus depot. All of them built for the desert heat. The busiest spot in town seems to be the truckstop/diner with a few 18 wheelers parked outside it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the corner of one street sits an old BLIND MAN dressed in raggedy clothes, perhaps an Indian. His SEEING-EYE DOG lies next to him. He's talking to TWO OLD MEN, veterans perhaps, Indian or Spanish. They both have missing limbs and slide off with furtive alcoholic looks as Bobby passes. The Blind Man yells out in an American Indian accent.
</DIRECTION>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! You there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want something, old man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't call me old man. Ain't you got no respect, boy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah I want something. I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't do that yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind. Can't you see that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, I didn't--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on? Sunnin' myself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't got no eyes. You want to see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam. Lost them fighting the commies. Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said I was sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be sorry. Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, sure. You got change?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Change? You want my change? I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, old man. Christ.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby walks across the street to a very old soda machine; it has bottles instead of cans. The blind man shouts to Bobby.
</DIRECTION>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get me a Dr. Peppa! I don't want no Colas. Colas ain't nothing but flavored water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby puts change in the machine and pulls out a bottle of Dr. Pepper. He starts back to the blind man.
</DIRECTION>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't forget to open it for me. I can't be opening my own bottle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby goes back to the machine and opens the bottle, then walks back to the old man who pours a splash on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little for Mother Earth. I'm about fifty percent Indian, you know. To all our relations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a hearty swig of the soda.
</DIRECTION>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah! Just what I needed! Want some?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The blind man holds the bottle out to Bobby. A string of saliva runs from his lips to the bottle's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll pass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby reaches down and pets the old man's dog. Flies buzz around both the dog and the Blind Man.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's 'cause he's dead.

Bobby jumps back.

<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Jesus.

<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's only just dead. What was I supposed to do with him? I can't take him away anywhere. And nobody wants to take him for me. Do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See. Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me. That's where he belongs anyways. Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes. He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.

<DIRECTION>
Bobby noticing a beautiful woman down the street, GRACE McKENNA, compulsively turns and catches up to her. She is dressed better than the usual t-shirts and tank tops of this town -- perhaps a mail-ordered dress or a mother's hand-me-down. With her raven hair and caramel skin, it is obvious she is Native American. Her arms are full with an awkward package she can barely manage.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I give you a hand, beautiful?

</BOBBY>
<GRACE>

Grace stops walking.

<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.

	Oh, this isn't my car. It's down a ways. I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy. I could drive up.

</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all right. I got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby takes up the package and they begin walking again. The package seems to have gained weight.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just new drapes and curtain rods. If I had known it was going to be so heavy I would have had them delivered up to the house.

	<DIALOGUE>
	That a fact?

</BOBBY>
<GRACE>

	Didn't have a choice. My car overheated up the road.

	And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Grace steps to Bobby and places her hand against his chest. She rubs away some of the sweat. They look at each other a beat. A POLICE CAR, seen earlier, pulls up beside them from behind and idles. SHERIFF VIRGIL POTTER is a weathered, handsome, middle-aged man with suspicious eyes, black haired in contrast to Bobby's sandiness.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning Grace.

<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.

Bobby wants to shrink behind the drapes.

<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.

	Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.

</SHERIFF>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anybody hurt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<SHERIFF>

The Sheriff drives on. Pause. They look at each other.

<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I guess I could use some help getting this box into the house. Not far. You could shower, get something cool to drink.
	</DIALOGUE>

Bobby considers the offer, but there's not much considering to do.

	I couldn't stay in this place. I wouldn't. I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.

INT. GRACE'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOBBY, naked, steps into the shower and turns on the water. It shoots from the shower head and cascades over his body. As the water falls over him we hear a Russian accented voice:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VOICE(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want my money.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby press his left hand against the white tile to steady himself. His hand is curled in such a way we cannot see his pinky or ring finger. Bobby leans back in the shower. Just as he does:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is raining hard. Matching the backwards motion of the last scene BOBBY is thrown violently against a brick wall, facing out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VOICE(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want my money.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I'll get the money! You don't want to do this!

</BOBBY>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take two for now. One a week, punk...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby is being pressed against the wall by two muscular GOONS. Another MAN stands partially hidden behind the goon's frame. With one hand one goon flattens Bobby's hand against the brick, with his other he clips two fingers off with a GARDEN SHEAR. We see Bobby's face in agonizing pain, then he slides screaming to the ground until he is framed between the legs of the men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Bobby clutches his left hand the rainwater runs in streaks down his ashen, blank face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GRACE'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see BOBBY's face reliving the experience as once again we hear the voice.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two weeks, asshole. Get the money or you gonna lose your nose and ears.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby has slumped to the floor of the shower, looking to his left hand, almost crying, unable to tolerate it. As a streak of blood snakes down the white tile we see that the pinky and ring FINGERS have been cut off at the joints.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GRACE'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOBBY, his hand rebandaged, is putting on his clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're still lucky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
As he does he looks at himself in the mirror. He bends to pick up his shirt which is draped over the gym bag. As he lifts it we can see, perhaps more closely than at the garage, that the bag is 3/4 filled with money. He closes the bag and stands. In the MIRROR, hidden in the doorway, he sees GRACE watching him. Bobby slows perceptibly, but does not try to hide himself. After a moment Grace walks into the room carrying a glass of lemonade.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thought you might like a refill on your lemonade.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby takes the lemonade and drinks it down. He rubs the glass against his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good. Cools you right off.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(tentatively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw you watching me.

	I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say it bothered me.

</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you like it; me watching you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess. I've got an ego same as any man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby gives a smile as devilish as it is pleasant. Grace slides an ice cube from the glass between her lips. He notices a framed picture of GRACE and an OLDER MAN.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

Grace sits on the edge of the bed. Bobby indicates the picture, ironic.

<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd you learn to do that?

</BOBBY>
<GRACE>

<DIRECTION>
Bobby goes to Grace and kneels before her. She takes his head in her hands and looks deep into his eyes. Her voice goes thick, but soft, like a morning fog.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's something in your past; something you want to keep hidden. There's a pain. Something ... someone you can't forget. And there is something you want very badly. It seems very far away to you, but you are determined, and you will do what you must to get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby closes his hands on Grace's and takes them from his face. He is more than slightly spooked by the accuracy of Grace's reading.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My face tell you all that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>

<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? I want to hang drapes.

Grace walks from the room. For a moment Bobby stares after her. He takes an ice cube from his glass and crunches it in his teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GRACE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

GRACE is standing on a step ladder trying to hang the drapes. BOBBY notices a photo of Grace with an older INDIAN WOMAN, her mother?

Bobby stands behind her, gently places his hands on Grace's waist.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Tighter. I won't break. You know girls are a lot tougher than men think.

Bobby holds her tighter as she finished hanging the drapes. His eyes are transfixed on her ass.

With a sexy pout Grace loads the next question.

	<DIALOGUE>

Bobby steps close to Grace and takes her by the shoulders. He pulls her to him and presses his lips hard to hers. Grace doesn't respond.

For a beat Bobby stands and stares hard at Grace. His pack slides from his shoulder and thuds on the floor. With great determination, like a beast closing for the kill, Bobby moves for her. Grace stands firm, ready for him; her head tilts back. Her breath comes deep and hard.

Just as Bobby is about to reach her, just as he is about to take her, he is stopped dead by the booming voice of JAKE McKENNA.

</BOBBY>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You a sailor man? That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that. Just sail away until all he was was a memory. I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.

<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body. Don't be offended, lad. A man who's got no ethics is a free man. I envy that. Beside, how can I blame you? That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Jake nudges Bobby who smiles a nervous smile.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She does at that. I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect? But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her. What are you to do, eh? Women.

</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby starts to laugh. Bobby stops laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I'm sick and tired of her little games. Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.

</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
The old woman's eyes widen. She starts to scream, but quickly clamps her hands over her mouth. For a moment Bobby thinks the woman is screaming at what he has said. Then, as if he feels a presence behind him, Bobby turns slowly to face the TWO tough-looking, unshaven, tattoo-covered BIKERS. One holds a gun.
</DIRECTION>

The biker grabs Bobby's bag. Bobby flinches in anticipation of a shot but refuses to let go of the bag. The biker swings the gun hard, clipping Bobby across the forehead. Bobby falls against the counter and to the floor. The woman starts to scream. The biker grabs up the pack, then, looking back at the woman, sees a ring on her finger. He grabs her hand and pulls at the ring. The woman screams wildly.

From beneath the counter the woman pulls a shotgun. The woman fires A SHOT that rips through the bag and into the back of the biker. He falls to the ground, very dead, amid a shower of blood and shredded money.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Bugger! You bitch!

The Second Biker now sees the money floating all over the place out of the torn bag. His eyes go big with greed as he FIRES at the old woman, who ducks behind the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Biker grabs for the bag and what's left of the money, not expecting the feisty old lady to pop up and unload her SECOND BLAST into him and the bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whatever was left of the money on the first round is now gone to shreds along with the bag and the Biker who is very dead.

BOBBY, dazed and holding his head, sits on the ground next to a SPIGOT that is dripping water. He cups his hands under the water and splashes it against his face, lightly wiping the cut above his eye. The SHERIFF'S CAR goes wailing by on the main drag. Recoiling from being spotted, Bobby tries to take another drink. A SCORPION crawls out of the faucet. He jumps back.

It is a little worn diner-type stop one would find on most any open road: Counter with stools, laminated menus, a Wurlitzer in the corner belching out country TUNES.

In the background, two teenagers sit at a booth. TOBY looks the part of a local, wearing jeans and a white T-shirt. His hair is cropped close and he looks to be a senior in high school. His girl, JENNY, is nondescript, neither ugly nor beautiful. She is the kind of girl most guys would pass without a second look. Toby gets up from his booth and goes to the bathroom.

Reluctantly Bobby rises, facing off against Toby, each clenching their fist and waiting for the other to make the first move. The tension builds.

BOBBY walks a bit going nowhere in particular. Looking at his watch thinking of Mr. Arkady, he shields himself with one hand from the sun. At the side of an old building, in the bit of shade it throws, he twists at the beer cap which sticks and won't turn. Bobby tries again twisting harder -- too hard -- as the cap jerkily twists off, cutting into his hand as it rotates. Bobby yells in pain. At the same time the beer comes foaming from the bottle and spills onto his sleeve. The bottle slips from his wet fingers and crashes on the ground, emptying. He clutches his bleeding hand, pissed.

	You love her, but you hate her?

<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy...How much you want?

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I don't know. Tell her you had to see her. Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman. A young buck like you must be good at that. Then ... maybe shift the conversation. Get her thinking about that jeep of hers. She loves that thing. Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.

JAKE(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There won't be anyone for miles around. Just the two of you and some prairie dogs. That's all. You can sweet talk her a little if you like. Makes no difference to me. Just put her at ease, make her feel relaxed -- then do it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but I like the sun. I grew up on a reservation. The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us. Jake's the same way. He loves the desert. I guess we're alike that way. That's about the only way.

	Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.

	Is that so bad? It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy. For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would ... do things for him. I guess I'm no good that way. I guess I tried to sucker you along like that. Do you hate me for it? I wouldn't blame you if you did. But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.

	<DIALOGUE>
	If I was a bird I would fly to Florida; to Disney World. I always wanted to go there. I'd fly to New York. Maybe. I guess New York isn't the best place to be a bird. I'd fly to St. Louis, then New Orleans, all over Texas. Then I'd fly to California. I guess by then I'd have seen it all and I could die.

Bobby now stands a few feet behind Grace. She kicks a rock and watches it sail over the lip of the cliff into the nothingness below.

GRACE(CONT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They say you don't feel anything. The shock kills you before you hit the ground. I don't know how they would know that. But I heard it's just like flying; straight down into the ground. I guess if it doesn't hurt it's a beautiful thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby tenses himself. Sweat forms on his brow as he stands directly behind Grace with his hands extended before him. They hover just below her shoulder blades ready to push forward. Suddenly Grace wheels. Startled by Bobby she almost falls over the edge. Bobby grabs her, her weight still going back. Grace's life is literally in his hands. She looks down at the ground far below, then up into Bobby's eyes. She shows no fear, but instead wears a curious smirk.
</DIRECTION>

	Hate's a funny thing. Right now I bet you don't know if you want to kill me, or fuck me.

I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted more. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, really taken -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him...

Grace lays her hands on Bobby, starting to caress him. He bristles and freezes with fear and disgust.

</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
He abruptly pulls away.

<BOBBY>

	Jesus Christ! I think this place is making me crazy. I was crazy to come back here and see you. I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute with you.

Grace rises, covering her nakedness, shooting a hand to his face, like she did when she read his fortune.

BOBBY walks through the desert parallel to the road, still in a rage. Desert insects produce a cacophony of drones, buzzes, and clicks. A rattlesnake darts off a rock into the brush. A VOICE whispers to him.

In a news pot, further down the street from where he was first seen, the old, BLIND MAN sits with his dead DOG, speaking as if into camera, sipping on a Dr. Pepper.
</DIRECTION>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the desert that makes you crazy. The loneliness out here. Nobody to talk to. People on the run. Trailer parks. White trash. I seen some peculiar things on a hot day. I seen a scorpion sting itself to death. It just keeps driving its tail into its body again and again. A little killer killing itself. Seen a coyote kill itself too. Just kept on biting and tearing at its own legs. Near tore one clean off before it bled to death. And what a white man'll do when it's freezing one moment, hot as hell the next. A man could get hisself killed just for rubbing shoulders with another
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smacking his lips)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	kiss kissy kiss. Nice pussy y'see, see it coming. I don't know what it is about the desert. I figger it's sort of like putting a kettle of water over a fire. People is mostly water. We boil when it's hot. 'Cept when we boil the water's got no place to go. It just churns inside of us until we can cool off. If it's not too late.

BOBBY is now revealed standing next to the blind man, and we realize the blind man has been talking to him all along. Bobby sips a Dr. Pepper as well.

	Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.

Bobby is clearly unnerved by this. Suddenly the blind man stands, pissed and powerful, sniffing the air with the police radio in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As SHERIFF POTTER cruises by, glancing at Bobby shrinking. The car goes on up the street.
</DIRECTION>
<BLIND_MAN>

	All them miners last century. Hungry ghosts, killed off all the Indians. Up at the mine. Earth ran red with blood, think I'm fooling around here. White sky was on fire. Grown men cried like babies. I saw a flash, then darkness descended upon me. They put me in the joint. Took my eyes. I cursed them. White people can't seem to stay away from Indians

</BLIND_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
It sounds demented. Bobby, checking him out to see if he's really blind, walks quietly around him during this monologue and peeks over his glasses trying to see the blind man's real eyes. Although he thinks the Blind Man thinks he's on the other side of him, the Blind Man fools him by suddenly swivelling around and cranking a gob of spit into Bobby's face as if Bobby were on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby, pissed, wipes the spittle from his face.

	Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...

<DIRECTION>
Bobby is in a rage. He turns to leave and walks a few paces. He sees a WRENCH lying on a table. For a second his mind reels, then he snatches up the wrench and turns ready to smash it down on Darrell's head. He stops cold. Because ol' Darrell holds a CROWBAR in a batter's stance ready to smash it onto the Mustang.
</DIRECTION>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to play, Mister? I'll play with you. You want to smash something? So do I.

Darrell begins to laugh. Bobby, desperate, looks to the trunk, thinking of his gun in there.

Darrell starts to laugh. It is a repetitive, almost demonic laugh that grows louder as the camera slowly dollies in on Bobby's anguished face.

As BOBBY steps out into the glaring sun, he notices down at the other end of the town, GRACE'S JEEP parked right outside the SHERIFF'S OFFICE, empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Presently, GRACE and the SHERIFF walk out TALKING, and she gets in, says a few last words and drives away.

Bobby backs around a corner into a sidestreet. Is she selling him out? He's very confused, turbulent.

INT. BUS DEPOT - LATER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOBBY enters the BUS DEPOT. The interior is poorly lit. There are a few benches for people to wait on, but they sit empty. Old, faded travel posters hang on the wall. A bored FEMALE CLERK is behind the counter.

<DIRECTION>
Bobby starts to walk away. Suddenly he turns, runs back at the clerk, proffers his money, half-crazed, near tears.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, ma'am, you don't understand! I have to get out of here. They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me. If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here. You know what I mean! I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave. Please. I can't...I can't.

He's so desperate and in her frightened but neutral expression, Bobby experiences the only compassion he ever finds in this whole town.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I'll give you the ticket, sir, but...just...just, please calm down, please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
her sane tone reminds Bobby of how far down he's come. He shrinks, suddenly ashamed of himself. She takes the cash on the counter, hands him a ticket.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep your change. Bus three-twenty-three. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.

She nods, puts a "closed" sign in the ticket window, disappears.

EXT. BUS DEPOT - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the crackle of the same POLICE RADIO again, OFF CAMERA, as BOBBY walks out of the depot. ticket preciously held in his hand, and suddenly reels as he sees SERGEI, about a 100 yards down the main stretch, slowly rolling into town in his convertible, looking for guess who.

BOBBY, ducking around a corner, hears the brief "Whoop" of the sheriff's POLICE SIREN. He glances back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His POV - sure enough, the SHERIFF'S having a field day. He's just pulled SERGEI over. At this distance, we catch snippets of conversation as the Sheriff ambles from his car, checking Sergei's out-of-state plates.
</DIRECTION>

	Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGEI>
<DIRECTION>
We pop in closer to their conversation -- Bobby relishing this in his mind's eye. Sergei is constantly looking off to where he last saw Bobby. But the Sheriff, strangely, pays no attention to these looks.
</DIRECTION>

Sheriff cuffs Sergei and sticks him in the police car.

<DIRECTION>
Bobby can't help smiling as he turns away to the SODA MACHINE seen in an earlier scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes up with the change the bus clerk left him and, dying for a drink in this heat, inserts the coin. Though still under considerable pressure from all sides, this lucky break with Sergei seems like it might be the beginning of something new today -- some luck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The icy cold soda bottle shoots out. Bobby raises it to his lips, about to taste it, about to relax for once. Violently it explodes out of his hands as he doubles over in blinding pain from a KIDNEY PUNCH. He stumbles forward into the soda machine, gasping. The legs of his assailant are close to him, but the face is unseen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby doubles his agony as his bandaged left stump takes the brunt of the blow into the machine, re-opening the wound. Blood starts to seep through the bandage.

Toby's words drift to Bobby from a million miles away. The world around him is like a dream, or a nightmare.

Then he lands blow after blow with his right hand on the boy's face and head.

	Afraid of it? Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death

The Blind Man slowly lifts his glasses, showing his EYES at last. Where his eyes should be are scars and dead flesh. An ugly sight that even takes Bobby back a step.
</DIRECTION>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Used to be a young smartass like you. Then I got smart with the wrong man's daughter. Got some acid poured on my peepers for my trouble.

INT. MCKENNA HOUSE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
GRACE stands by the back door staring at the bolt lock. JAKE yells to her from another room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell you doin', Grace? Are you coming to bed, or aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment Grace's hand wavers above the lock. Suddenly, like a snake striking, her hand shoots out and unlocks the bolt. Just as quickly she turns from the door and heads to the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. YARD - MCKENNA HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LIGHT is on in the bedroom window. After a moment it dims and the house is dark, silhouetted against the horizon by moonlight. BOBBY steps into frame, carrying an iron pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MCKENNA HOUSE/BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We start close on GRACE -- a KEY slapping against her buttocks as bedsprings groan. We reveal Grace copulating on all fours with JAKE from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.

<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.

	Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!

	You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.

<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! No! Please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
He hits her. Harder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a strange flashback of his mind, he now sees Grace's MAMA beneath him, receiving his punishment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops, abruptly. He can't go on. Fear coming into his eyes. He starts to whimper, begging for his punishment and/or forgiveness.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh baby, I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>

(he starts to cry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

He drops down, burying his face between Grace's legs.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me, baby, forgive me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
He hides there from the world that he has created, crying to himself.

<DIRECTION>
Grace has an unreadable expression, but that's certainly not a new occurrence in their strange relationship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MCKENNA HOUSE/BACKDOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The knob of the backdoor twists and the door opens. BOBBY slips quickly through the space and into the house quietly closing the door behind him. It is nearly pitch dark, and he has no bearings. He steps gingerly through the hall, but in the darkness he bumps into a table nearly knocking over a lamp only to catch it just before it crashes into the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MCKENNA HOUSE/BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

JAKE hears the noise. He raises his head and cocks an ear to the air. She knows who it is, and is concerned; he's too early.

Jake climbs out of bed, throwing on some pants, reaching into a drawer in the chest of clothes, pulling out a small dark metallic OBJECT.

INT. LIVING ROOM/MCKENNA HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crowbar in one hand, BOBBY makes his way slowly through the living room, banging against the edge of a table. He hops silently in pain, then waits at the door to the next room and listens. Hearing nothing he slowly pokes his head into the darkness. A moment later Bobby backs from the door and we see the barrel of his own black .9mm BARETTA pressed against his forehead. JAKE appears now, backing him into the living room. He switches on a LAMP.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, well. As I live and breathe. I didn't expect to be seeing the like of you again. Thought you'd be long on your way by now.

	No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!

Suddenly Jake swings his arm, clipping Bobby across the side of the head with the pistol and opening another bloody gash.

Bobby crumbles to his knees, crying out.

Jake suddenly grabs Bobby by the hair, forcing his face back and smearing his lips with his own in a vengeful kiss. The blood from Bobby's wound runs down to his lips and mixes with Jake's lips.

<DIRECTION>
GRACE is in a quandary. How many seconds before Bobby walks in to kill her? Or can he really kill her? She's not sure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around the room frantically. Picks up a lamp, puts it down. She looks quickly through her closet, rummages below in the boxes. Suddenly she finds it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dangerous looking Indian HATCHET with a feather hanging off its bindings. It's a formidable piece of iron, quite capable of splitting a skull or impaling flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grace hears the footsteps just outside the door. She runs behind the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later, the bedroom door creaks open and BOBBY quietly enters, approaching the bed. We sense the doubt in his eyes as to whether he can kill her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a reverse POV, Bobby sees the outline of Grace in the bed as victim...closer, closer. He now lifts the edge of the bedcover but sees a blanket bunched up to resemble a human figure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He suddenly hears a foot fall behind him, then he feels her presence. He spins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's directly behind him, hatchet raised. His life is in her hands.

His eyes, locked in an eternal moment.

Her eyes, the hatchet.

JAKE bulls into the bedroom. It's a mess, furniture overturned, sheets and blankets all over the floor. The lights broken. Waiting for him, face down on the floor, is BOBBY'S BODY in a pool of liquid. A broken bottle lies nearby. Bobby's body heaves in its final death throes, and then shudders quiet... Over there, by the bed, is GRACE, who still clutches the HATCHET. The look on her face is pure shock.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...looks like you got him, Grace. That's good...that's real good. He must of slipped past me, but you got him. Looks like that drifter from this morning. Got to be careful who you make friends with, sweetheart.

What choice does Grace have? She lets the hatchet clank to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aww, that's my Grace: Not about to let someone get the best of her. That's what I love about you. As dangerous as you are unpredictable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
behind Jake, the lifeless BOBBY rises up from the floor, very much alive, and clobbers Jake with a golf club. Jake is staggered, but he's one tough old customer as he manages to spin slowly, gun still in one hand, as if to fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before he can, Grace grabs up the hatchet from the floor and drives it straight into his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gurgles, stunned from both sides, but it's like trying to kill Rasputin. He still has the gun as Bobby jumps him from the rear, trying to get his neck in a chokehold. The gun FIRES once, discharging into the wall. The hatchet is ripped from his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grace watches as the two men bang into the walls in a rugged rodeo-type fight, Jake seeking to dislodge Bobby off his back. An expression of fear and excitement in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally the two men go crashing to the ground, rolling around, Bobby maintaining his stranglehold, but calling to her, his hands full.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grace, goddamit, do something!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Jake's eyes rolls up at her like a beaching whale, pleading for help.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grace...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
She commits. Jumping into the fray, it's not clear whose side she's really on as the three of them roll across the floor, strangling, biting, hitting, spitting, scratching, gasping. It's a Guignol, but the pressure from Bobby's forearm is taking its toll on Jake. Trying to bite Jake, Grace bites Bobby instead, but then she scratches Jake's face. Jake is grabbing her hard as Bobby chokes him, trying to use her to leverage himself away. But she manages to rip herself from his grip and scrambles on her knees across the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs the hatchet. And stands, moving back towards the two men locked on the floor. Bobby looks up at her, hatchet in hand, no longer sure which way she'll go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake, however, gasping for air, eyes bulging, spittle dripping from his mouth, looks at Grace with some inner certainty that she will help him. He gasps the words.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me, Grace, help...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like you helped her, Jake?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Grace stands there, deciding, the power of the hatchet in her hands. She raises it suddenly over the two men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It flashes downwards. Deep into the gut of her husband Jake, almost transfixing him to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the silence that follows, Jake's eyes roll up to meet hers. But all she has for him is a cold, distant stare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake's head drops as the life rushes out of him. Bobby falls back from the body puffing and dripping with sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell'd you wait for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't answer, turbulence in her face. He rolls Jake's body off, upset. She may have made it a murder, but he was part of it, and he feels the shift in himself. They're both in new territory, feeling an apartness between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly JAKE gasps, still alive! It is too much for Bobby. He grabs the hatchet and plunges it down on Jake, silencing him one last time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grace is pushing the bed away from the wall, slipping down on her knees and prying open several floorboards.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The money's right here! Get the key!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! You get it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't want to get close to Jake. Grace coldly runs over to his corpse, ripping the chain, key and all, from the neck. The action pulls Jake's head up, then she lets it thump back on the floor. She runs back to the floorboards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The top of a thick steel floor safe is revealed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby watches -- his whole life, it seems, hanging on the outcome.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the key, she opens the safe. Inside are rolled-up bundles of cash -- in hundred dollar denominations. She looks up at him, offering it as she reaches in for more. Bobby also gets down on his hands and knees and grabs more and more, sucked into the fever of freedom, far more money than he lost at the grocery store, overcome now with emotions of fear and freedom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They see each other.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't I tell you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(plunging into the cash)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There must be 150, 200 thousand here! Goddamnit Grace, you were right!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We done it, Bobby. Oh my God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
They laugh excitedly and start kissing, rolling in the stacks of cash, some of which sticks to Bobby's sweating back. The day didn't turn out so bad after all for Bobby.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck me baby!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at Jake)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him watch. I want him to know what he's missing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
As they consummate their violent relationship for the first time, Jake's lifeless eyes watch them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MCKENNA HOUSE - LATER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The LIGHT in the bedroom window is low candlelight, but we sense something watching them. GRACE's silhouette moves across a window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOBBY now comes out of the house, cautious, walking down the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops, thinks, and walks back to open the hood of GRACE'S JEEP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into the ENGINE and disconnects something, then closes the hood and walks on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HARLIN'S GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOBBY walks up to the SHACK near the garage and bangs on the door. A light goes on in the window. DARRELL shouts out.
</DIRECTION>
<DARRELL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you want?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're closed. Come back when the sun comes up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby, in a hurry to get back should Grace pull any tricks, bangs and kicks against the door. Darrell yanks the door wide.
</DIRECTION>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell ... oh, it's you. Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over. What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want my car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got the money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby pulls the money from his hip pocket and hands it to Darrell. The mechanic fingers it suspiciously.
</DIRECTION>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills. And this morning you was broke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's none of your business. Get the keys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want no dirty money. I run an honest business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>

	Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there's a $50 overnight storage charge we got to talk about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby is ready at first to explode, but then just laughs out loud. You got to give it to a guy like Darrell. He holds up a $100 bill.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby pulls the hundred back from Darrell's grasp.
</DIRECTION>
<DARRELL>
<DIRECTION>
(going to get the keys)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't know nothing about no gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Course you don't. Tell me something Darrell. Forty thousand people die every day! How come none of them are you?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you know where to find her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the trunk key.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DARRELL>
<DIRECTION>
(pulls out the trunk key)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Topped off the tank for you. No charge. Just my way of doing business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARRELL>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(jovial, confident now)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen up good, Darrell. I'm getting outta this shithole. You're staying! And one little peep outta you -- remember that gun makes you part of the food chain. Your prints are all over it. I'd be awful careful whose rectum I was pointing my finger in, Darrell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby hops in the car, a free man. As Darrell glares at him, bewildered and frightened at the same time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MCKENNA HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOBBY turns the MUSTANG up the drive. THE HEADLIGHTS cut the darkness and land on an empty patch where Grace's jeep had been parked. Bobby jumps from the Mustang and runs around frantically. His look is devastated. He falls to his knees, about to sob when:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRACE opens the front door and pokes her head out, putting out several suitcases.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby? What the hell's the matter with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ... nothing. I just stubbed my toe on a rock. Hurt like hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got the money all packed. I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away. Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good thinking.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's all this?

<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not coming back.

</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(accepting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Awright, let's go. I want to be fifty miles from here before the sun comes up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Funny thing; the jeep wouldn't start. I had to push it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(dryly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Funny thing... I'll get the bags.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MCKENNA HOUSE - LATER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby's MUSTANG is backed towards the front of the house. We see a silhouette of BOBBY and GRACE carrying something wrapped in a BLANKET and dumping it in the trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lone pair of HEADLIGHTS illuminate the night as the Mustang cruises through the dark. As the lights brighten the screen we:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. MUSTANG - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRACE sits next to BOBBY peering out the windshield, clutching the money in a backpack. She's humming an Indian song.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't see it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It should be just up ahead. Hold on ... there! There it is!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
A SIGN illuminated by the HEADLIGHTS. It reads: YOU ARE LEAVING SUPERIOR. THANKS FOR VISITING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grace lets out a scream of joy, leans over and hugs him.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God! I can't believe it. I'm out. I'm finally out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSTANG begins to swerve along the road.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Take it easy. Want to get us killed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>

find him...(then)

	It'll be over soon, Grace.

<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sailing his boat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I thought --

</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anywhere?

</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You already have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him a funny look.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I thought you'd left me back there.

</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(emotional)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I got back from the garage, and your jeep wasn't there, I thought you'd gone and left me and taken the money.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off her look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Cause I never had any luck with women, Grace. You don't know what I been through. The shit I've taken. I thought you were like the rest of 'em... but when you came out of the house... well you're here Grace and we might be starting in the shit but we're starting where I never been -- together with someone -- together with you Grace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
She responds with a luminous smile.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you Bobby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks back at her with trust and love in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're gonna pull this off, Grace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Just then a HEADLIGHT rakes them from the rear as we hear, again, the ominous crackle of a POLICE RADIO and the short brutal "Whoop" of the siren, as Sheriff Potter's VEHICLE rolls up quickly behind them. Grace's face is caught like a surprised deer in the headlamps.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby is in a bind. The siren whoops again. The lights flash to highbeam.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He must've seen us swerving on the road, that's all, just gonna give us a ticket for swerving...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
But even Bobby has trouble believing that as the POLICE VEHICLE pulls out sharply alongside his and SHERIFF POTTER motions to him aggressively to pull over on the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF>

(into loudspeaker)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pull over, goddamnit, pull over!

</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
She seems to be panicking. Bobby pulls over.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck this!...Just shut up, Grace. We done nothing! Be cool. Let me do the talking. He doesn't know anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>

His vehicle pulled up on the shoulder in front of them, the Sheriff gets out, shining his power flashlight into their faces.

	'Evening Sheriff, sorry bout that but this jackrabbit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby has no time to react as the Sheriff is suddenly there at his window, jerking his door open, angry. A GUN in his hand, pointed at them, his eyes on Grace.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had to fuck him, didn't you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF>
<GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
(nervous cool)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would never do that to you, baby... He killed Jake -- said he'd kill me if I didn't come with him. All he wants is the money.

Bobby looks at her. He cannot believe what he just heard.

Grace knows the jam is up.

<GRACE>

	OK...but he never made me cum! Really Virgil, I was only doing what I had to do so we could be free. Just like we talked about. It meant nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. Virgil wants to kill her, but he also wants her back badly.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fucking him too Grace? Is everybody fucking everybody in this town?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
She ignores him. Her attention on the backpack with the money between her legs -- the gun is there, inside an outer flap of the bag.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?

	This road don't go to Globe, Grace -- where were you going to meet me?

</SHERIFF>

His flashlight on the four suitcases in the backseat. She doesn't have an answer to that one.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not like that it... Look, Virgil, I got the money here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
She gets out of the car on her side, comes around to him, the pack of money slung on her shoulder, hard to see in the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF>
<DIRECTION>
(hurt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Grace, you can say what you want...but, I watched you fuck that pervert for years while you're telling me you loved me? What happened to going to Milwaukee together? You and me -- gonna open up the finest sporting goods store that city ever did see? Get us a place on the north shore, by the lake? Season Brewer tickets! Just you and me, Grace. What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>

The Sheriff, deeply wounded, casts a hot vicious gaze on Bobby.

	Shut up, Virgil! Take your share of the money. It's not so bad.

</GRACE>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's you. You Grace or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife...(hopeful). What do you way Grace?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.

Bobby gets out of the car, misunderstanding the situation.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, we got more. We got $200,000 at least. Split it three ways, we all walk away...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff snaps and smashes Bobby with his flashlight, knocking him to the ground, kicking him again and again, gathering the psychic force to murder him. Grace tries to approach.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF>

	Shut up, boy! You don't know shit round here!

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were you going to help her fly away, asshole? What'd you think, you were the first boy to drift through this town she came on to? She tell you the story about old Jake forcing her to marry him? That's a good story... How he killed her crazy Mama?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby in bloody agony. Grace stunned that Virgil would reveal this now publicly.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamnit Virgil, stop! Don't!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...But I bet the story she didn't tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake was really her Papa. And she liked fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!

Grace plunges into the pack, pulls the gun and shoots Virgil across the car in the gut.

</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff flies back onto the road, stunned, not realizing what's happened.

Bobby watches unbelieving as Grace quietly steps up over the Sheriff.

She puts the next round in his nuts, a modern fury enacting ancient wrath.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grace. No!

<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff is wide-eyed, dying in shock. Grace then fires right at his head in a coup de grace that blows his brains out the back of his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grace and Bobby both stare, then Grace jumps into action, dragging the body. She snaps to Bobby.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me get him off the road. Into the car! We'll ditch his car... Get the fuck up!

Bobby stares at her.

EXT./INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

They're driving. GRACE and BOBBY, wordless, each thinking in separate worlds. Grace wipes her hands. The bag with the money between her legs. The Baretta is back in the bag.

	Jesus, did you have to kill him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you and me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was a cop, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was a scumbag!... He wanted me, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're dead...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(softer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
A silence. The oncoming road.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, aren't you going to ask me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want me to say!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
She's yelling, emotionally out of control.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! I was! I was fucking Daddy! And I married him!... I married him...okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at Bobby, forces him to look at her. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know why!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
She drops back in her seat. Tears come.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I wanted was to be a kid... He took that from me... They all did...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(very quietly, dangerously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They treated me like meat. A piece of meat. Fuck me. Blow me. Bend over. Stick their fingers up my ass... Fuck them! Fuck the whole town! They deserved to die!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
A pause.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And us Grace? What do we deserve?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
(crying quietly to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Nin chonk, nin chonk," my Mama used to say in Apache. "Your worst is doing this to you," she said, "your worst has killed you." And "Be go tsee" -- "you will find out the result of what you have done..." Just when you think it's over, when you've gotten away, it begins. Cause you never get away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby stares straight ahead at the oncoming road. Can he still love her? She seems to be reading his thoughts, like she said she could.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's easy to judge someone else when you don't know nothing about it... I'm Apache, Bobby. You don't eat what I eat. You don't see what I see. Don't judge me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
A silence. Two former lovers in the dark of a car moving through the strangeness of an Arizona desert at night.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to think anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then drive...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
The lights of the car fade until there is nothing but darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SUN COMES UP:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CANYON - END SPOT - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the vast reaches of a deserted canyon, where VULTURES circle in a hot white sky, we find the MUSTANG parked at the edge of a drop. We hear the SOUND of a body being dragged.
</DIRECTION>
<D_J>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Nobody's sure where it was heading so fast but the way it hit the semi, it won't be getting home now! Hey area weather is gonna be hot! Hot! Hot! Then cold! Cold! Cold! Just like yesterday. Just like every day. Some surprise, huh? So if you're planning on anything, don't. You don't like the weather, just wait one minute. Got any brains, get up to Alaska and get yourself some trailer park where you don't see no desert for miles and miles...
	</DIALOGUE>
</D_J>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right there... Drop it there. I got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
BOBBY is giving GRACE instructions as they drop SHERIFF VIRGIL POTTER'S corpse over a drop onto some rocks 30 yards below.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See ya, Virgil. God bless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby pushes him over, his hand hurting. The body crashes below. It's hard work. They head back for the Mustang, to retrieve JAKE'S body in the popped trunk. But Grace notices Bobby glancing at the Baretta now tucked in her waist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The silence is tense between them, the rocks and gravel crunching under their shoes as they walk.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicates the gun)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this what's bothering you Bobby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No Grace, my hand's bothering me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls an imaginary trigger on Bobby, mimicking the recoil of a gun. Bobby is nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could give me my gun back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Grace smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't we just finish what we started.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
She stares down at Jake. She can't help feeling some old feelings. As Bobby walks back to the front of the car, turns off the annoying radio. He watches as she softly prays over Jake, whose face is concealed by the blanket in which he is rolled.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
(after a moment with Jake)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think happens to someone's spirit when they die?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(lifting Jake by the shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Grace leans into the trunk to take his boots when he makes his move, quickly, closing on her when she's off guard. He slams her hard in the face, coldly sending her sprawling to the ground, dazed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He steps over her and grabs the gun in her waist, checks it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She puts her hand to her mouth, feels the blood on her finger tips. She looks at him and laughs a wild crazed laugh that cuts into Bobby like a knife.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hit me, Bobby? You hit a woman, you motherfucker! Didn't your Momma ever teach you anything...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes go to the gun in his hand and she stops laughing. Her calm is extraordinary, as if expecting to die.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, Bobby does nothing, then he slips the gun through his belt.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now? How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
(in pain)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cause my Mom slept around. A lotta men! Anybody could've been my father. But we knew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(not listening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well you got what you wanted all along by fucking me. I wish you had told me the goddamn truth in the first place!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
(screws out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't want you to know! Don't you... unnerstand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby's got a headache now. It's too much to understand, too much talk. Too much history has taught him to doubt.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
The expression on Grace's face changes as rapidly as the desert weather, a coldness passing over and through her.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know your own mind. It blocks your heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Keeping a wary eye on Grace, Bobby starts hauling Jake out of the trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me a hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
He wrestles Jake up to a sitting position. He grabs a can of beer from a warm six-pack in the trunk and shoves it into a pocket of Jake's coat.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor old Jake, a few drinks, a fight with the sheriff over his wife. And both of 'em ended up dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Grace takes his boots.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time to go for a walk, Jake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother died in this canyon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
They lift the corpse, and with great effort, haul it towards the edge of the drop. As they pause on the way, Bobby, wary of Grace's strange coldness, tries to soften the blow of separation.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, it's not so bad we split up. It might be months before they find these guys. If at all. I mean with the mountain lions around here. Remember, if they can't find no bodies, there's no crime...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(She doesn't respond.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll be in Phoenix by noon. Lose this car, get another one. Texas, Mexico are big countries, all that money Grace, you'll meet someone else, you know, there's a lot of hope with a $100,000...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
They lift Jake again, and move to the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hope is a four-letter word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we all need that too. Hold him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
He props Jake at the edge, standing, and transfers the weight onto Grace. Jake's head is on her shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You make a pretty couple.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
It seems he might push them both over but instead takes the gun, wipes it of his prints, and slips it through Jake's belt.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Won this in a poker game in Reno. God knows who it's registered to. You shoulda been more careful, Jake. See you later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
As he takes Jake's weight off Grace and pushes it over the drop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grace watches him go, her eyes shifting to Bobby, his back momentarily to her, also watching. She moves towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby turns, slips on the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now all we got to do is try and--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
He feels a blur of motion, almost like a bird, and he is falling...falling, his life coming to an end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grace is standing somewhere up above, briefly seen. Did she push him? He doesn't know.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's stunned as he falls on the rocks next to the bodies of Jake and Virgil. He screams out in sharp pain. His leg feels broken. But he is alive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grace walks away, cutting it all off, deeply shaken. She must get away from the past and all these hollow men. She closes the trunk of the Mustang, gets in the driver's seat, reaches for the ignition key. Her hand fumbles for it a moment. It isn't there.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
She sits there. Bobby is calling from below.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grace! Help me, Grace...! We been through too much together. We've only had one day, but you and me have been through more than most people ever will. I know you were angry at me, and, you know, you were right! I'm sorry I hit you. I was wrong about leaving you. You don't belong in Mexico.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
She finally gets out and walks back to the edge of the cliff, looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby? Are you all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I busted my leg!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you make it back up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks. Of course the trunk is closed. She closed it.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby, the trunk...it's locked. Throw the keys up to me. I'll get the rope.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby's eyes pass over Jake a few feet away, his eyes staring upwards in death. They take in the gun still attached to his waist. He knows the trunk wasn't locked when they took Jake out.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't throw that far. You got to climb down here and get the keys. You can make it. It's the only way Grace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Grace looks down at the drop. It's a tough descent but she knows she could make it and get back up as well.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grace!...Please, Grace! You have to help me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Grace takes a look around.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. I'm coming. Calm down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
She starts down the cliff face. As she descends, he talks deliriously.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew you'd help me. I knew you wouldn't leave me baby, cause we're tied together too close. We belong together always.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Grace makes it to the bottom of the drop, and walks cautiously towards Bobby.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling back, echoing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby! Don't flip out on me. I can't do this alone. I know you don't trust me, but you gotta pull yourself together, I'm not gonna leave you...I never wanted it to go down like this. It was different with you Bobby. You had dreams like me. You listened... I would've gone anywhere with you, Bobby. We can make this work. I'm sorry...I really am. I didn't wanna hurt you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Can he believe her? She sounds so sincere this time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's heading for the body of Jake. And the gun. Bobby knows that and is already crawling there.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(as he crawls)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're right here, Grace. The keys. Come get me out of here... Know why else I could never leave you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Inching closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Closer. They meet at the apex of Jake's corpse.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I love you too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And love's a funny thing. Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Grace leans close to Bobby. He dangles the keys out in front of her, but she doesn't reach for them. Her eyes go to Bobby. She reaches for him. At that instant Bobby's hands shoot out and clamp hard around her. A sharp gurgle is all that escapes Grace as Bobby twists the life from her, as Jake leers up at them.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...or kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Grace twists and flails in Bobby's hands, but in spite of his bleeding stump, he holds her like a bear trap holds a grizzly.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you Grace, but I just can't trust you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him, trying to protest, shaking her head. Grace's flailing goes into overdrive. Somewhere in his semi-delirious state, Bobby's eyes might notice the gun at Jake's waist is no longer there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grace manages one word:
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jake...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He can't help you now, honey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby is in agony as he kills her, part beast, part lover, he kills that which he loves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a SHOT is heard. Bobby buckles with the blast, hit in the side. He kills her with one last wrenching thrust of his hands, breaking her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby looks down at Jake's gun, which she clutches in her hand, and sees the hole in his side and the river of blood that flows from it. He manages to stand, looks at Jake; their bodies lying side by side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby, with great difficulty, claws his way back up the rocks to the car, his fast-flowing wound staining the white rocks with blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He makes it to the top and, losing more blood, climbs into the driver's seat. He checks the money in the bag. All there. All his.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he pulls a huge clot of blood from his side, the vultures circle. Perhaps one, smarter than the others, lands close by. It spooks Bobby but he's okay. He looks in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're still lucky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the key in the ignition, the engine comes to life.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(waves back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adios --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the RADIATOR HOSE Darrell installed blows apart loudly. Bobby knows exactly and immediately what it is as a cloud of steam now rolls from under his hood. He shakes his head, frustrated.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs) Oh shit!...(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arizona.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
He can't help but laugh at his bad luck. As we rise off the desert floor and take flight with the vultures, eventually leaving them all as specks of earth in the vast empty canyons of Arizona.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
