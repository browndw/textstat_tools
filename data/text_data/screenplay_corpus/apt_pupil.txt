Through the window of a moving vehicle, we see a series of small, middle-class houses. This could be any suburban street in America.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CITY BUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A boy is seated near the back of a moving bus. This is TODD BOWDEN, 15, as All-American as they come. He stares out at the other passengers indifferently. Then something catches his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SANTO DONATO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLE: SANTO DONATO, CA FEBRUARY 1984
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd pedals his bike down a quiet street and pulls up to an unassuming bungalow set far back on its lot. This is the kind of house one would hardly notice driving through the peaceful suburban community of Santo Donato. Todd gets off his bike and heads up the front steps. On the way, he bends down to pick up the L.A. Times.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two signs, in laminated plastic, are secured neatly above the door bell. The first reads: "ARTHUR DENKER". The second reads: "NO SOLICITORS, NO PEDDLERS, NO SALESMEN".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd RINGS the bell. Nothing. He looks at his watch. It is twelve past ten. He RINGS again, this time longer. Still nothing. Finally, Todd leans on the tiny button, staring at his watch as he does so. After more than a minute of SOLID RINGING, a voice is heard from within.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. All right. I'm coming. Let it go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Todd lets go as a chain behind the heavy door starts to rattle. Then it opens. An old man stands behind the screen. He is KURT DUSSANDER, a.k.a. Arthur Denker. Mid-seventies. Standing there in his bathrobe and slippers, a cigarette smashed in his mouth, he looks like a cross between Boris Karloff and Albert Einstein. Dussander stares at Todd, who tries to speak, but suddenly cannot.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A boy. I don't need anything, boy. Can't you read? I thought all American boys could read. Don't be a nuisance, now. Good day.

The door begins to close. Todd waits till the last moment before speaking.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't forget your paper, Mr. Dussander.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
The door stops. Dussander opens it slowly. He unlatches the screen and slips his fingers around the paper. Todd does not let go.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me my newspaper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure thing, Mr. Dussander.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander snatches the paper away and closes the screen door. Quickly, almost imperceptibly, the old man's eyes survey the area: across the street, up and down the sidewalk, the boy's bicycle.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Denker. See?

<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Denker. Perhaps you cannot read after all. What a pity. Good day.

As the front door closes, Todd speaks rapidly into the narrowing gap.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bergen-Belsen, January '43 to June '43. Auschwitz, June '43 to June '44. Then you went to Patin.

	<DIALOGUE>
	After the war, you escaped to Buenos Aires. From 1950 to '52 you were in Cuba, and then... From 1952 to '58... I don't know. No one does. But in 1965, you popped up in West Berlin, where they almost got you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens wider.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, boy. I don't know what is the matter with you. But I don't have time for this game. Now, get out of here before I call the police.

The heavy door slams shut.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay by me Herr Kommandant. I'm sure the police would love to meet the "Blood- fiend of Patin."
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
In a flash the front door is open, so is the screen. Dussander is through the doorway and descending upon Todd with the rolled umbrella raised to strike him. Todd stumbles back against the porch rail.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You get away from this house, God damn you! I'll beat you all the way home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
But Todd regains his composure quickly. He brushes himself off and levels his eyes at the old man who now hardly seems the threat he was a few seconds ago.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After 1965, no one saw you again... Until I did. Three weeks ago on the downtown bus. If you want to call the cops, go right ahead. I'II wait on the steps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll do no such thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't? Listen, old man, if I want to start screaming right here, I will. If I want to ride down to the police station and bring the cops back myself, then I will. I will do what ever I want. Do you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)

	<DIALOGUE>
	But if you like, I could come in for a minute. We could talk.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander turns and steps back through the screen door. He stops at the threshold of the house and turns. He is holding the screen door open with one leg, the front door open with the other. He looks straight ahead. A moment later, Todd steps into the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUSSANDER'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander's home is what you would expect of a single, poor, old man. Nothing fancy, nothing out of the ordinary. Todd looks around, perhaps half-expecting to find a Nazi flag or an oil painting of Der Fuehrer hanging above the mantle. But he doesn't, and moves into the living room where an old picture of a woman sits framed on an end table.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My wife. She died in 1955 of lung disease. At that time I was working at the Menschler Motor Works in Essen. I was heartbroken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>

Todd's attention drifts away and his fingers slip over to a lampshade next to the photograph. He begins to feel it as though he were inspecting it for something.

<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What business? You sit in that ugly chair and watch soap operas all day. Except on Friday afternoons when you walk down to the movie theater. And twice a week you take the bus downtown to do your shopping. You always use the express lane because you never have more than ten items.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have been following me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps for me you made an exception.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>

	No, for you I had to be sure. For Kurt Dussander I had to be absolutely certain. ...Now, I am, and that's why I'm here.

</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
Todd sits on the sofa.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes, I see now. As I am this ex-Nazi fellow, as you say, then this must be the part where I offer you my hidden stash of gold, taken from the mouths of old Jewish men, of course, which I keep buried in the basement. Isn't that right, boy? Well, I'm afraid you're wasting your time. I have no money. If I did I might even give you some just to be done with this nonsense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't need money. You don't have any anyway. At least, I don't think so. You probably had to spend it all to sneak in the country. A good American passport is expensive on the black market, that I know.

</TODD>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you? Good for you.

<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My One Great Interest. Well, not you personally, but, ...well, it's something I learned back in eighth grade. Our teacher, Miss Harmon, she said we'd have to find our One Great Interest in life. You know, the thing that would really grab us. Once we did that, everything would fall into place. Like hers, she said, wasn't teaching, but collecting nineteenth-century postcards. I guess there's no money in that, so she has to be a teacher. Anyway, she told us to start thinking about it. So I did, but nothing happened. Until the following summer, in Ronny Pegler's garage. That's where I found it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RONNY PEGLER'S GARAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd and RONNY, both 13, rummage through several large boxes in the corner of the garage. We see that the boxes are filled with old war magazines. Ronny tosses several of them to the ground as he digs for his dad's old copies of Penthouse. Ronny selects one Penthouse and rifles through it. He discards it a moment later.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of these has three girls doing it at the same time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNY>
<DIRECTION>
But the old war magazines catch Todd's attention. He picks one up curiously and carefully flips through the tattered pages. We see a few of the photographs: Nazi storm troopers, prisoners behind barbed wire, the ovens.

Todd speaks excitedly. Dussander, very bored, clearly indulges him.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It... grabbed me. It was just like Miss Harmon said. I couldn't believe it. But there it was, the camps, the uniforms, the ...the way they saluted each other. But what am I telling you for? You know more about this stuff than anybody.

<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Accelerated?

<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some kids resent me for it. That's not important. Anyway, my paper really floored my history teacher. I guess because I got through all those books without throwing up. But I learned something. I learned that when you talk about the camps now, you have to remember to sound really disgusted. I mean, you can't just say what happened like the magazines did and leave it at that. If I tried that the teacher would have freaked and called my parents in.

Todd, lost in the sea of old photographs, doesn't notice Ronny at first. Then he looks up at him. In his eyes is a glint of a darkness that we will come to know better.

Todd's voice narrates what we are seeing. Todd, seated near the back of the bus, watches Dussander climb aboard. Todd thinks nothing of it at first, but soon finds that he is unable to take his eyes off him. Todd is trying to place the old man's face in his mind...

	You climbed on the bus and started this slow walk down the aisle. Just like you were examining a new batch of inmates. I don't think anybody gave you a second glance but me, but somehow ...people seemed to move out of your way. And under your arm you carried a rolled up umbrella. But what really did it, what really set me off was the coat. You were wearing this long black rain coat. My mind suddenly flipped back to a picture of you taken at Patin. You in your S.S. greatcoat with a riding crop under your arm.

He lets out a long, nervous breath, showing for the first time the presence of something other than the cold confidence he has been putting up for Dussander. He knows he has crossed into dangerous territory from which there is no going back. But after a moment he composes himself; he has come this far. The sternness returns to his eyes. Todd is all business. He takes a breath, and then speaks loudly enough for Dussander to hear him in the kitchen.

	Boy, I will tell you this once more, and for the last time. My name is Arthur Denker. It has never been anything else. It has never even been Americanized. If you must know, and apparently you must, I was named by my father who greatly admired the stories of Arthur Conan Doyle. I did serve in the reserves, I admit, and in the late thirties, when I was first married, I supported Hitler. I supported him most, I suppose, because for the first time in years there was work and there was tobacco. ...Would you like a cigarette?

	No. My dad used to smoke. Mom made him quit. Now he's addicted to Nicorette... that's nicotine gum.

Dussander turns toward the counter and pulls a kitchen match from a cabinet. He lights his cigarette with his back to Todd.

	Nicotine gum.

Dussander's eyes drift to the collection of kitchen knives neatly stuffed in their block on the counter in front of him. He lingers a moment, pulls deeply on the cigarette, then turns and continues.

	Anyway, Hitler lost his mind at the end, directing phantom armies at the whim of his astrologer. He even gave his dog, Blondi, a death capsule. On May 2nd, 1945, my regiment surrendered to the Americans. I remember that a private named Gonzales gave me a chocolate bar. I wept.

	I was interned at Essen where I was treated very well. We listened to the Nuremberg trials on the radio and when Goering committed suicide, I bought half a bottle of schnaps and got drunk. When I was released, I put wheels on cars at the Essen Motor Works until I retired in 1963. In 1967 I emigrated here, to California, and became a U.S. Citizen. I am as American as you are. I vote. No Buenos Aires, no Berlin, no koo-ba. And that's it, my whole story. I hope you're satisfied. But if not, it's, as you say, tough shit for you. Now, you go. Enough of this.

Dussander points to the door, but Todd remains motionless in his chair.

</DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander steps past Todd and picks up the receiver of the phone hanging on the wall above the table. The boy still sits motionless behind him. Dussander dials a "9", and then, with more difficulty, a "1". He stands with his finger poised over the final "1". Tiny beads of sweat roll over his forehead. His shoulders drop. Todd stands up. Their faces are close together.

Everything I have on you, the compares, the want sheet, all the photographs, are all in an envelope under my mattress. I'm going to put it there every time I come to see you. If anything happens to me, if I should suddenly disappear, some one will find it. Believe me --

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLE: SEPTEMBER 1984
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A typical high school image. Rows of students sit listening to a lecture from MR. PROXMIRE, fifties, as he weaves his way through the aisles.
</DIRECTION>
<PROXMIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But in 1902, Panama didn't exist. The country we know as Panama was part of Columbia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROXMIRE>
<DIRECTION>
As the teacher continues to lecture, the camera stops on JOEY, 17. On his desk is a folded note. He hands it across the aisle and motions for it to be sent to Todd a few rows over. The note moves across the room, avoiding the meandering teacher, on its way to Todd.
</DIRECTION>
<PROXMIRE>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now the nations of the west knew they needed a canal through Central America. They were tired of waiting for their ships to sail around Cape Horn. This was the new century, the age of modernization. And the U.S. was at the forefront. Teddy Roosevelt was in the White House, looking for any chance to assert the might of America. When Columbia balked at the offer made by the U.S. and England, Roosevelt sent his naval war ships to sit off the coast of Panama, just sit there, where they could be seen from the coast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROXMIRE>
<DIRECTION>
The FEMALE STUDENT across the aisle from Todd now has the note. She whispers to him but he doesn't hear. Todd is trying to say awake with great difficulty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girl extends the note just as Proxmire passes. He stops, turns around, plucks the note from the girl's hand and heads for the front of the class.
</DIRECTION>
<PROXMIRE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finally Columbia gave up the territory for about a tenth of its original price. And as Roosevelt would say later, "The U.S. stole the Panama canal fair and square."

Without glancing at it, Proxmire crumples the note and drops it into the waste basket by his desk.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA - DAY

It is in between classes. The denizens of STUDENTS crowd around their lockers. Among them is Todd. He searches through his locker and selects a book. Suddenly the door SLAMS shut to reveal the face of Joey standing against the lockers. Todd, startled, jumps back.

TITLE: OCTOBER 1984

It is late afternoon. Dussander sits in a rocking chair facing out into the backyard. Todd is in the lawn chair off to the side. He has just finished a McDonald's cheeseburger and is about to start another one. Dussander eats a Big Mac, washing it down with bourbon. A large cat keeps jumping onto Dussander's lap while he is eating. He brushes it away annoyed.

	I've never seen anyone drink bourbon with McDonald's before. ...So, How did the stuff get to Patin?

	Bullshit. You're lying. What did it do?

The cat jumps up a third time. This time Dussander picks it up and tosses it a good six feet. The animal hits the ground and runs away.

	Like Zyklon-B, it came in through the shower heads. After a few seconds the prisoners began to leap about. Some were screaming. Most of them were laughing. They began to vomit and to... to defecate helplessly.

But Dussander ignores him, staring out into the yard as he begins to remember more easily.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They began to twitch all over and make high, strange sounds in their throats. At last they collapsed and just lay there on the concrete, twitching and yodeling, with blood streaming from their noses. But I lied to you, boy. It didn't kill them. Either because it wasn't strong enough or because we couldn't bring ourselves to wait that long. I suppose it was that. I sent five men in with rifles to end their agonies. These were five men I trusted. It would have looked bad on my record to have wasted so many cartridges at a time when the Fuehrer had declared every cartridge a national resource. I was always given high marks for efficiency.

DUSSANDER'S DREAM #1: EXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander is asleep in his bed. A low groaning sound comes in very slowly. Dussander's eyes open. He sits up, looks around, sees that his bed is in the middle of a large open field. It is grassy, but certainly not beautiful. Something is wrong about this place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands out of the bed, wearing pajamas. But it is cold. He takes the sheet and wraps himself in it. The groaning is getting louder, more human. We have never seen him frightened, until now. He steps a few paces from the bed. The groans have becomes low screams. There is no where to go. Slowly, as if he knows what he's going to see, he looks down at the ground. It's just grass. But the human voices are now wailing desperately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His knees buckle, but he tries to fight it. He reaches his knees and lowers his head toward the ground. The white sheet flows around him and blows off in a gust of wind. The screams are now at a feverish pitch. His ear is inches from the grass and his eyes, marked with unmistakable terror, are wide open as...

RICHARD (DICK) BOWDEN, 38, is a taller, grayer version of his son. He stands over Todd's shoulder watching him shoot at a paper target. He still has on a tie from work, but the knot has been loosened and his shirt sleeves rolled up. Both Dick and Todd wear headphones and orange shooting glasses. Dick chews gum. They are alone on the range.

Todd fires a few rounds from his father's .30-.30. A strained tension exists between the two Bowdens.

Dussander looks shabbier than in previous scenes. His clothes and hair reflect an increasing disregard for personal appearance. He goes to the basement door and, leaning carefully over the steps, retrieves a fresh bottle from his stash, stored precariously on some shelves leading down to the basement. He comes back to the counter and cracks the bottle open. Todd's irritated voice booms in from the living room.

INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd has built a fire, probably the first fire Dussander's fireplace has seen in twenty years. The room is bathed in a warm orange glow as the winter sun sets outside. Todd uses the poker to adjust one of the logs.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Screw you. I'm doing this for me. This place is freezing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander comes back in with his drink and settles into his easy chair, which has been positioned in front of the hearth.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it must be fifty degrees outside. I'm sure to you it seems positively frigid.

<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you pay your gas bill?

<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It slipped my mind. I will attend to it tomorrow.

<TODD>

	Slipped your mind. I noticed it didn't slip your mind to stock up on a new case of bourbon.

	Leave me alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Todd finishes with the fire and sits on the floor a few feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, so finish your story, because I'm still not clear. You cook up this stew, and you bring the prisoner in, and you let them smell it, and suddenly they tell you everything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, don't misunderstand me. Certainly with a pistol pressed to their head, a prisoner would tell us everything we wanted to know, sometimes more. But mine was a much more ... elegant method. Remember, it had been months since they had smelled real potatoes simmering over an open flame, and boy, when that delicious odor hit their noses their mouths would drop and out would pour an account of every minor infraction their friends had committed, I mean it was magnificent...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you let them eat the soup?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, we never promised them the soup in exchange for information. We never mentioned it at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. Todd is impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow, that's really good, Dussander. I mean that's...

<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	that's thinking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander does not respond. He gazes deeply into the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...But, as the war pressed on, the time for such civilized measures became a luxury. I remember by April of '45, we had barely enough food to feed ourselves. The sound of the Russian mortars grew louder everyday, but still, the train cars from France and Poland kept coming. This was a time of desperation. The ovens burned day and night and still I knew we would not beat the arrival of the Russian forces. Many of my men, the cowardly ones, deserted during the night. But the men that remained, the same ones I had called upon so many times, ...continued the work. At first we thought a massive fire in the main building would serve our purpose. We could just crowd them in and pull a gas torch up to each of the windows. But with so many of them, we couldn't be sure the bodies would burn properly. We needed something ...certain. Then a young, bright soldier, I shall never forget his enthusiastic smile, pointed to a pair of bulldozers near the Western gate which had been used during construction. How perfectly simple it was. The bulldozers carved a narrow trench, four meters deep, down the center of the camp. For two hours they dug until I realized we may not have enough gas to finish the job. So the inmates were given shovels and told they were building a shelter from the incoming artillery. When they were done, I immediately called for a practice drill and three thousand naked bodies began to march into the trench. It took less than twenty minutes to get them in place. Quickly the bulldozers moved down the sides of the pit sending the piles of earth into the massive grave. Those who tried to free themselves were shot, of course, but very few cartridges were wasted that day. The machines were too fast. Back and forth they went... packing the dirt. One by one the tractors ran out of gas and my men had to scurry along with shovels. But by sunset... it was done. I gave the order to evacuate. In the distance the plumes of Russian mortar fire rose like an approaching thundercloud. But I knew that no matter what happened, ...no one would ever forget what we did here.

Dussander stares into the fire. Todd, wide-eyed, is locked on Dussander when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PHONE RINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other, a bit puzzled. Clearly, it does not ring very often, and when it does, Dussander cannot help but be apprehensive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It rings again. Dussander gets up and moves toward the kitchen, Todd watches him go.

INT. OLD TOYOTA CAR - ROADSIDE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd and Becky are in the backseat of Becky's car. They are on a date and have parked on the side of a road overlooking the lights of their town. At 16, BECKY TRASK, is an attractive girl who has recently discovered that boys like her and she likes them. They are kissing in the back seat. MUSIC plays on the stereo. Becky's blouse is unbuttoned. She stops kissing Todd.

	</DIALOGUE>

Todd just stares at her. He doesn't know what he wants. Becky decides for him. She slides down out of the frame. Todd is startled at first, but lets her. After a moment, he closes his eyes.

EXT. DUSSANDER'S BACK PORCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander sits in his rocking chair. A small blanket drapes across his lap. He smokes a cigarette and holds a near-empty glass. On the ground beside him, there is a small bowl.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Out in the yard, the large cat emerges from the darkness and moves across the grass. It sees Dussander and, more importantly, the bowl next to him. We see that the bowl is filled with milk.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSSANDER>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, puss-puss. That's right. I'll wait.

Dussander sits perfectly still. Cautiously, the cat moves toward the porch.

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, puss-puss. You can smell it now, can't you?

The cat creeps to the edge of the steps. It takes them one at a time.

<DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, kitty-kitty. That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment the cat edges up to the bowl. Its tail twitches nervously. Finally, it begins to lick up the milk. Dussander crunches the cigarette out in his empty glass. His movements are slow and patient. From under the blanket he pulls a pair of yellow rubber gloves. He begins to put them on. The cat jumps back for a moment. Dussander freezes. He waits the cat out. Soon the animal is back at the bowl. Dussander continues with the gloves. He watches the cat's tail. As the animal gets comfortable, its tail flips under the rail of the rocking chair. Dussander slams the chair back. The CAT SHRIEKS. Dussander flips the blanket on top of the cat and wraps it into a tight, squirming, HISSING bundle. He stands out of the chair.

INT. BECKY'S TOYOTA - ROADSIDE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
It is later. Becky sits behind the wheel. Todd is next to her. A different song is on the RADIO. They sit for a moment in silence, clearly uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<BECKY>

For a moment it is as though Todd's face were purple with rage. But a moment later the expression is gone. Todd turns away. Becky sees that her comment has hurt him.

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a lousy thing for me to say. I'm sorry, honey.

INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander bursts through the door with the bundle. A single paw emerges from the corner of the blanket and flails at Dussander, clawing him across the neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oww, you mother-fucker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
They move across the room to the stove. With difficulty, Dussander pulls open the oven door, revealing the glowing red interior. The animal SCREAMS and claws at Dussander's neck and arms, escaping more and more from the blanket with every gyration of its body. With a mighty shove Dussander plunges the cat toward the opening, but the animal braces its paws on the edge of the stove. The two are deadlocked. But Dussander's hands are too close to the heat. He screams. His grip loosens just enough. With a desperate cry, the animal charges up Dussander's body, over his head, and leaps to the floor. Dussander dives after it.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>

But the animal is too swift. In a second, it is atop the counter and out the open window above the sink. Although defeated and exhausted, Dussander cannot contain his excitement. His panting gives way to a twisted, hearty laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD'S DAYDREAM: INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a 1940's laboratory. Todd is in his boxer shorts. Dussander is next to him, wearing a lab coat and his S.S. officers hat. Todd looks down on the examination table. A YOUNG GIRL, about 16, is held to the table with clamps. She is naked, staring at Todd. Behind the table is a glass window and behind that is another room where OTHER SCIENTISTS are monitoring equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over Dussander's methodical voice, Todd's dream shows flashes of what is being done: some sort of sexual experiment on the girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Test run eight-four. Electricity, sexual stimulus, metabolism. Based on the Thyssen theories of negative reinforcement.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Subject is a young Jewish girl, approximately sixteen years of age, no scars, no identifying marks, no known disabilities --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the control room, a SCIENTIST monitors a volt meter, calling out the readings as Dussander yells for the voltage to be increased. As the meter rises, the girl SCREAMS more violently. Perhaps her eyes roll back, her tongue flutters in her mouth. Through all of this, the scientists call out and the record heart rate, blood pressure, brain activity, voltage, etc. Todd's eyes close. His breathing accelerates as does the motion of his hips until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd snaps out of his daydream. His trigonometry class is having an examination. He sits at his desk, staring blankly at the paper before him. Most of the answer spaces are empty. He knows he is going to fail another test.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTOOOR SHOOTING RANGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd is blasting away, rapid-firing the rifle down range at an unfortunate paper target. The protective headphones lay on the counter beside him, as does his backpack. He stops shooting when a voice snaps over the P.A. speaker next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You, on lane twelve. You need to have your headgear on at all times.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(click)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And no rapid firing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Todd looks over at the man frowning at him from inside a small booth. Todd puts on the headgear, and after a moment, the man goes back to reading a newspaper. Todd looks up and down the range. One or two other shooters are concentrating on their targets. Todd quickly hoists his rifle up and aims it at the man in the booth. He snaps off a single dry round. Todd smiles weakly at the sound of the click. Unnoticed by anyone, he turns back toward the target, strangely comforted.

INT. DINING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thanksgiving dinner. All the Bowden's are there, including Dick's parents, VICTOR and AGNES. Dussander sits at the head of the table, Todd next to him. The family has finished dinner and is having coffee. Dick and his father smoke cigars. Todd's mother, MONICA BOWDEN, still pretty at 36, pours Dussander some more coffee.

He begins to remove the bow, and then the paper. He moves very cautiously, as if the package might explode at any moment.

Finally, he removes the lid and his expression shifts from one of fear to one of exasperation.

Dussander is stomping in place vigorously. He spins on command, facing Todd. He gives a Nazi salute. Todd watches him march for a moment. At first he enjoys the domination, but as Dussander gets caught up in the marching, Todd's expression changes.

DUSSANDER'S DREAM #2: INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander wakes to a strange, faint rumble. He climbs out of bed and walks across his bedroom toward the source of the sound. We follow him as he moves farther and farther away from his bed. Soon it is apparent that he is in a space much larger than his room. Yet he is still in darkness, as if his room has suddenly ended and continues into a black void.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the rumble gets louder, more mechanical sounding. As the sound crescendoes we see what Dussander sees. A train car. Steam rises in the air as if the train has just come to a complete stop in the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander stares at the boxcar coldly, and we realize that something is staring back at him. Eyes, dozens of them, glare back at him from between the slatted boards of the train. Some are low to the flooe, like those of children. Others are higher. Dussander snaps at them in German.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
(in German)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come out. ...Come out, now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
No one exits the train. Yet, the eyes seem to move around cautiously within the boxcar. Dussander is getting angry. His orders aren't being carried out. Suddenly the door of the train slides open. But still only the eyes are visible.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (in German)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Line up in front of the train. Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Again, no one gets off. Enraged, Dussander takes a few steps toward the train. In a flash the eyes charge at him. But these are not the eyes of prisoners. These are wolves. Dussander can only cover his face with his arms as the snarling teeth descend upon him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander wakes from his nightmare in a cold sweat. His pajamas are soaked. Disoriented and out of breath, he climbs out of bed and clicks on the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The closet. He stares at the closed closet door for a moment and then moves toward it slowly. He opens the door and runs his fingers across the assortment of shirts and jackets. His hand stops near the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - FIVE MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander is seated on the side of the bed smoking a cigarette. He is dressed, with the exception of the boots and hat, in the SS uniform. He appears calmer, less agitated. He crunches out the cigarette and slips under the covers. He turns off the light. He closes his eyes. For the moment, he is at peace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd stands facing his open locker. He is staring at his report card. Sweat collects on his forehead. He looks like he is about to explode. He wipes his brow with his sleeve and turns around to see if anyone notices him. TWO STUDENTS catch his eye. They are both Asian. They are smiling and pouring over each other's report cards. Todd zips open his backpack, giving us a quick glimpse of the disassembled rifle pieces inside. He throws the report card in and zips up the bag. Slinging the bag over his shoulder, he slams the locker shut and heads off down the hall.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
Todd does not respond to his friend's attempt at humor. He is slamming the ball around with great force. He bounces it hard off the back wall to give himself a rebound. He is mumbling to himself.

<DIRECTION>
A strange SQUAWKING sound is heard. Todd doesn't hear it at first, but as the sound grows louder Todd stops the ball and looks around. His eyes focus on the area near an open doorway. Sunlight streams into the empty gym. Todd walks closer, seeing that the sound is coming from an injured bird that has crawled in from outside. He goes up to it. The bird is black. Its wing is damaged. It SQUAWKS loudly, looking up at Todd. Todd begins mumbling again. He starts to dribble the ball thoughtlessly. As his words become clearer, the bouncing gets harder.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Todd is bouncing the ball very hard next to him. The bird continues to SCREAM. Slowly the ball drifts from beside Todd to in front of him, gaining force with every bounce. He brings it up to his face and with both hands throws it down with all his might. When it comes back up, it is smeared with blood. He throws it down again, this time it comes up with feathers smeared in the blood. The squawking has stopped. Blood splatters on Todd's shirt. His eyes close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops the ball, looks around. No one has seen him. He notices his shirt. Calmly, he tears it off, wraps the ball in it, and tosses it in a nearby trash can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

Todd pedals his bike through town, carrying a brown paper bag under one arm. He turns down Dussander's street. He stops in front of the house and heads for the front door.

In light of his previous good work in this school, the sudden deterioration in his grades suggest a specific problem which should be addressed before his academic advancement is jeopardized permanently. Such a problem can often be solved by a frank and open discussion. I am ready to work out a time for us to meet. In a case such as this, earlier is usually better. Sincerely yours, Edward French.'

	Boy, ...you have a far greater problem than your school grades. Before you speak to me about what they will "get out of you", remember the facts. ...Seventy thousand people died at Patin. Have you forgotten that? To the world at large I am the most despicable of criminals, a monster. Do you think I would stand aside and let you turn me in so easily? Without a fight? Is your American self-confidence so bloated that you have never once realized you are an accessory to my crimes. You have criminal knowledge of an illegal alien, and have not reported it. Don't you see that? And if I'm caught, I will tell the world all about you. When the reporters put their microphones in my face it will be your name I'll repeat over and over again. Todd Bowden, yes that's his name. How long?... oh, for months, almost a year. He wanted to know everything... That's how he put it, yes - everything.

Dussander picks out a pencil with an extremely sharp point. He holds it point out and approaches Todd. He gets closer, the point moves in toward the back of Todd's head. He holds the point inches from the boy's neck. He deliberates.

Kurt Dussander, a.k.a. Arthur Denker, a.k.a. Victor Bowden, Todd's grandfather, sits outside an office marked, "Edward French - Guidance." Dussander looks the best he has ever looked. His hair is clean and combed. His face is shaved. And he is smartly dressed in his best blue suit. As he waits, he glances down at a piece of paper. We see that it is a "crib- sheet" of Todd's family tree. Several names appear on the sheet, connected to other names by lines and arrows. By each name is one or two word description, such as "dead: cancer, 1981" or "divorced, Dallas, Tex." The door opens up. Dussander pockets the note. EDWARD FRENCH, 40's, stands in the doorway.

<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. The boy has told me that he has come home on two occasions and has found her sprawled out on the kitchen table. He knows how my son feels about her drinking and so on these occasions he has put dinner in the oven himself and forced enough black coffee down his mother's throat so that she will at least be awake when Richard gets home.

<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is not without blame, believe me. The hours he works. The meals he has missed. They take a toll on a family. I was raised to believe that a man's family came before his work or anything else. I tried to teach my son that... but --

(glancing at folder on desk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I see that. Anyway, Todd is, and I hate to phrase it this way, but he's one of the ones worth fighting for. He's a special kid, we both know that. But If Todd's grades don't improve drastically and quickly... he'll be opening a real nasty can of worms. Summer school would just be the beginning. His whole college acceptance schedule would be thrown way off course. The good schools won't know what to make of him. I'm sure he'd hate that and so would you.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<FRENCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So let's get to the bottom line, shall we? What I'm proposing is some family counselling at the Counselling Center downtown. Everything is in confidence, of course. A man in charge down there, Harry Shumacher, is a good friend of mine. I think Todd and his parents should go see him together. It might be difficult for Todd to go to his parents with this; I think you should do it. Maybe we can get everybody on track by the end of the next quarter. It will be tough, but not impossible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRENCH>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure that would be the best thing for the boy. The parents might resent him if I took them that proposal right now. Things are very delicate. To swing the scale too far in the wrong direction might cause more harm than good. The boy has promised to work harder in his studies. He is most concerned by the drop in his grades, more alarmed than you might expect. He has his mind set on attending Stanford or Berkeley next fall and does not wish to see his plans altered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<FRENCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, well --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRENCH>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Also, the parents would resent me. Monica already thinks I meddle too much in her affairs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<FRENCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a great deal of experience in these matters, Mr. Bowden. And please understand that my interest in your son's marital problems begins and ends with the effect they are having on Todd. And right now I think they are having quite an effect. I really think counselling is in order here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRENCH>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Allow me to make a counter proposal. You have, I believe, a system for warning parents of poor grades?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<FRENCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Interpretation of Progress cards. IOP cards. The kids call them flunk card. They only get them when their grades in a class fall below the seventy percent. That means a "D" or an "F". Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRENCH>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And they are sent out when?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<FRENCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mid-quarter. That's about three weeks into the new marking period.

	Listen, boy. Before today it was possible, just barely possible, that you could have denounced me and come out clean yourself. The way your nerves have been lately I don't think so, but never mind that. It was - at least technically possible. But now things have changed. Today I impersonated your grandfather, one Victor Bowden. And it was you who arranged the meeting. What would people make of that? If things come out now... perhaps you were right, your age and a good attorney might keep you out of jail, but you would be humiliated, boy, publicly. You would be infamous. Your parents too. Do you know what such a scandal would do to them? To you? Think about that.

DUSSANDER'S DREAM #3: EXT. PRISON YARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spotlights, like those from a guard tower, criss cross over a small compound surrounded by an electrified fence. Inside the pen, wolf-like dogs snarl and gnash their teeth. The spotlight catches the source of their aggravation...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander, caught ghoulishly in the roving light, stands in uniform outside the pen. He is laughing. In his hand is his Luger. He fires through the fence, killing one of the dogs. They go wild. He laughs harder. He shoots again, and then again. It is like shooting fish in a barrel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light beam passes the pen to reveal that the dogs have transformed into human prisoners. They maneuver helplessly to avoid Dussander's bullets. But he fires faster, his laugh growing more extreme. His movements in between shots becomes a sort of dance. One prisoner flies against the fence in a pools of sparks. As Dussander's waltz reaches it's climax, one prisoner remains in the pen. He looks up. It is Todd. Angle on Dussander's toothy grin. The gun comes up...
</DIRECTION>

INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - IMMEDIATELY AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander wakes up. A CLANKING SOUND echoes from the street. Dussander looks like he could have been having a wonderful sex dream, but he turns his head toward the direction of the street. He clicks on the light. Dressed in the SS uniform, he gets up and moves toward the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the window, bathed in the glow of a street lamp, a derelict, who we will come to know as ARCHIE, rummages through Dussander's trashcans. Under his arm are a few of the empty bourbon bottles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BECKY'S TOYOTA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car pulls into the driveway of Todd's house. Becky is smoking a joint and blowing the smoke out the window. They both look a little tipsy, as if they have been to a party. She holds the joint up to Todd. He contemplates, then takes it. Todd's first toke of marijuana isn't very small. Becky looks on, surprised. She reaches out for the joint and Todd waves her off. He pulls again, this time ingesting a huge hit. He holds it, then exhales. He gives the roach back to Becky.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Their light is still on. I'll get out on your side. Don't say anything.

Becky gets out. Todd slides over and does the same. She crushes the joint out on the pavement and puts the rest in her purse.

INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander watches Archie collect the cans and bottles. There is something about Archie that makes Dussander wonder if he has seen him before. Archie looks up, right into Dussander's window, as if he were expecting him to be there. The two stare at one another for a long moment. Suddenly Dussander is aware that he is dressed in the SS uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He quickly steps back from the window. His breathing is short and erratic as he waits in the shadows for Archie to finish. After a long moment, the noise from the street stops. We hear only the faint steps of Archie walking away.
</DIRECTION>

INT. TODD'S BEDROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - NIGHT

Todd and Becky's lips are locked in a passionate kiss. In their exuberance they fall onto the bed. As they try to undress and kiss at the same time, Becky begins to moan. Todd brings his fingers to his lips.

He slides off her and opens the drawer by his bed. He pulls out a condom. By now she is naked. Todd slips out of his underwear and falls on top of her. The RADIO plays in the b.g. as Todd begins to grind away with his hips. She moans softly with delight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA MOVES off of them to reveal a man in a lab coat setting up a volt meter. This is one of the scientists from Todd's laboratory nightmare. The CAMERA continues TO PAN across the bedroom, showing the other scientists preparing for the electricity experiment. The CAMERA STOPS on Dussander, clipboard in hand, observing everything carefully.
</DIRECTION>

Todd releases with a final thrust. Becky is MOANING in a series of high, fast yelps. Todd lies still on her body. Becky is speechless, still quivering from the unusually intense love making.

It is raining. Todd is riding fast. He wears a raincoat with the hood up. He talks to himself loudly, but we can't make out what he is saying. He enters the tunnel.

</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I got it... thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
The figure steps closer. The light catches his face to reveal Archie. He is an unshaven, filthy mess, and when he speaks his words are slurred from years of steady drinking.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That case maybe you could loan me a dollar. Help out a Vietnam vet? How 'bout it?

Todd eyes the man cautiously. He looks around. No one is nearby. The constant din of the rain echoes within the confines of the tunnel.

The bum looks at him hopefully. Todd looks back at him, sizing him up, really noticing him for the first time.

	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Todd freezes for a moment. The bum is right in his face. Suddenly Todd throws a handful of change at the bum and sprints back to his bike. He hops on and is gone in a flash, leaving the bum there to pick up the scattered coins.
</DIRECTION>

As Todd zips away, the hood is off his head. The rain begins to beat away the splattered mud from his face.

Moans erupt from the class. Todd sits motionless at his desk. The moment of truth. Proxmire passes him and places the exam face down on Todd's desk. Todd hesitates before turning it over. He is sweating.

He flips the paper over and glares at the small card clipped to the top of the paper. He picks up the card and reads it: "I'm sure glad I didn't have to give you one of these for real! Great improvement, Todd. -- Anne Leland." Todd cannot contain his delight. Nearby students stare curiously at the strange boy beaming over his flunk card.

	Then the box is opened in the presence of a bank official and a representative of the Internal Revenue Service. The contents of the box are inventoried. In this case they will find only a twelve-page document. Non- taxable... but highly interesting.

Todd understands what the old man has told him. He slams his glass down on the table and jumps out of his chair.

Todd is leaning over the rail looking out at the yard when Dussander steps onto the porch. He carries with him the bottle of bourbon and a glass.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then there is nothing for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But there is. As the years go by, as I get closer to the grave, your hold on me will become worth less and less. A man five, ten years older than I worries more about his ailing heart than being extradited to Israel. And there will come a day - if I live long enough - when I decide what you know no longer matters. Then, and only then, I will destroy my document.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But... but so many things can happen to you in between. Accidents. Sickness. You could slip in the shower, for Christ's sake...

Dussander shrugs and lights another cigarette. He begins to sing softly, then gets caught up in the song... Todd turns away, angry.

	My dear boy, I see you thinking about it, even now. It is in your eyes. Killing me. It would take only a flick of a knife. Or maybe push me down the steps, make it look like an accident? I am old. You are strong. You are angry. Good assets for killing. But there is something missing...

Dussander speaks with a near whisper in Todd's ear.

There is a long pregnant pause. Then Todd lets out a sigh, as if to dismiss what he has just heard. He turns to face Dussander.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>

	You know this means we're through. You won't be seeing me around here anymore.

TITLE: APRIL 1985
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander, dressed smartly for a day out of the house, emerges from a matinee at the movie theater and strolls down the sidewalk, the umbrella under his arm. He stops at an empty bench and sits to wait for the bus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archie sits down next to him. At first Dussander doesn't pay attention to him, but Archie's behavior tells us that he is keenly aware of Dussander's presence. Dussander stares out into the street, but Archie fidgets about, his eyes roaming, and finally slides a little closer to Dussander. Dussander looks at him flatly. Archie grins. Dussander turns away, prepared to dismiss this odd behavior as that of a crazed derelict. Then Archie speaks...

<ARCHIE>

(leaning over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I notice the kid don't come around no more.

<ARCHIE>

Dussander is like stone, flashing the eyes of a man who is not to be harassed. Finally...
</DIRECTION>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mistake me for somebody else. ...Pardon me, my bus is coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander stands, slightly rattled only to those who know him well. He looks down the street for the bus. Archie doesn't move. Rather, he inspects Dussander from head to toe, stopping on the shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn... Cuban high heels. Nice ones, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHIE>
<DIRECTION>
The SQUEAL of brakes grows louder as the bus comes to rest in front of Dussander. He has become perceptibly more nervous as he waits for the passengers to exit. He climbs up the first step.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't seen a pair like that since I was in Havana.
	</DIALOGUE>

	That's the only place you can get'em. Can't get'em exported... Government don't let you.

The door closes behind Dussander. The bus pulls away. Through the window of the bus Dussander watches Archie as he continues his speech to no one.

Todd opens the office door. As his eyes scan the floor he notices a familiar pair of yellow high-tops. He looks up to see Ed French leaning against the wall. Seated at the desk is MORGAN, a thin, stern man, around 50. Todd's face shows a moment of trepidation, but he regains his composure almost instantly.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Todd is kneeling down at the bike rack. His backpack is on the ground next to him. He unlocks his bike and begins to coil the chain around his wrist when Joey walks by. He sees Todd and considers going by, but stops. We can tell they haven't spoken in a while.

Pause. They look at each other. Joey wants to talk. Todd slips the chain lock into a pocket on his backpack. Joey jingles his car keys anxiously.

Joey sits on the handle bars as Todd pedals over the rugged terrain. Joy looks scared, but appears to be enjoying the ride and the chance to be with his old friend.

The next shot shows Todd's bike laying on the ground. The wheels still turn slowly. The camera moves to reveal Todd and Joey standing on a rocky ledge. Orange Country sprawls out before them.

Under the cross-hairs of a telescopic sight, a truck, from the freeway below, zooms out of frame. The image vanishes. We see Joey looking through the scope which he holds in one hand.

Todd grabs the scope. But Joey doesn't let go. He finally locks Todd in a stare that he has been avoiding for months. He wants to say something. Todd takes the scope. He sees that Joey is serious. He takes a few steps toward the edge, toward the gun. He looks out.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's such a rush, you know?... To be up here. Don't you feel it? So high above them they never know we're here. It's like an ant farm. We're the gods on Mt. Olympus, Joey. They can't see us, they can't hear us, but every so often we can make them feel us. Just so they never forget. Look...

INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN & BASEMENT - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archie, seated at the table with his back to Dussander, is in the middle of a sprawling monologue about his life to which Dussander half-listens. Dussander goes to the cabinets and takes out two glasses. He pours the drinks and sets the glasses on the table. Archie picks his up and is about to drink.

	It's all right. So have I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander raises a meat fork up to the back of Archie's neck. He starts to plunge it in just as Archie turns back to look at him. The fork goes in crooked. Archie explodes from the chair, HOWLING, his arms flailing like those of a grizzly bear. With the fork protruding from his back, Archie tosses the table to the side. The empty bottle tumbles to the middle of the floor and shatters. Archie spins and slams a fist into Dussander's temple. Dussander collapses against the counter. Archie moves about wildly, trying to grab the fork and pummel Dussander at the same time. Blood is streaming freely from his wound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander grabs a frying pan from a rack of drying dishes on the counter. As Archie approaches, Dussander swings the pan into Archie's descending fist. Archie winces and staggers backward. He stomps down on the broken bottle and screams. His guard falls briefly. Dussander is upon him. He swings the pan, catching Archie squarely in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archie brings his hands up to his face, which now oozes with blood. Blinded by the blow, Archie charges Dussander, who crouches to the side, and as Archie passes, hurls himself into the man's back, sending him through the open door of the cellar. Archie flies down the stairs face-first, tumbling into the packed dirt floor like a derailed train. Dussander, exhausted and bloodied, exhales deeply. Looking down at the crumpled body below, he straightens his tie, brushes the hair from his face, and then surveys the kitchen.

He rises slowly and brushes himself off before heading down the steps to finish the bum for good. After about three steps he stops abruptly. He appears puzzled, but after a moment the expression changes. A look of searing pain rushes across his face. Dussander brings his hand to his chest. He collapses on the stairs. He is having a heart attack and knows it.

He looks down at Archie, up to the kitchen, then back down to the cellar. A moment of decision.

The stairs appear ten times longer in each direction than they did a minute ago. Getting to his feet, he turns slowly toward the kitchen. He starts up the steps at a painfully slow pace, counting with each step.

Todd's driving reflects his state of mind: erratic and out of control. He meets a police car at an intersection and almost runs a red light. The police car doesn't bother him, however, and a moment later he pulls the Honda up to Dussander's house.

INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Todd appears in the door of the kitchen. His face tells us that what he sees is ten times worse than whatever he expected. The room is a gruesome sight. Blood and broken glass are everywhere. The table has been knocked to the side. Dussander, barely conscious, slumps in a chair.
</DIRECTION>

Todd pounds awayat the door. Tears now stream down his cheeks. His relentless pounding has Dussander enraged. Dussander pounds back at the door to shut Todd up. It works.

	Enough. Enough. Enough! If you don't stop screaming like a fucking school girl I'm going to...

Todd realizes he can't get through the bars. He turns around to find another option. In the obscured background, Archie begins to stir. Silent and bewildered, he feels the area around him and rises slowly to his knees. Todd doesn't see him and moves into a dark corner of the cellar, rummaging through the piles of cluttered junk for something to help him escape. He disappears for a moment into complete darkness and then emerges holding a shovel, a fresh confidence on his face. He holds it like a sledge hammer.

Todd runs toward the staircase and is only a few feet from Archie when he sees him. Todd, mortified, lets out a scream. This startles Archie, who cannot speak. He only gurgles a SICKENING WHINE, the fork still sticks out of his neck. Blood drips into his eyes from a gash above his forehead. Yet even on his knees, he is an imposing figure.

But Archie is too disoriented to move. Summoning all his courage, Todd pokes the shovel into him, as if to prod him out of the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But when the blade of the shovel touches him, Archie counters violently, grabbing the metal end and swinging it to the side. Todd holds tightly to the handle, an act which sends him flying across the cellar. The shovel stays with Archie, and now he wields it like it were a child's toy. He slashes it viciously through the air. Todd hides under the stairs, watching Archie duel with the shadows. Todd bumps into something. Archie hears him. Through the slats in the staircase we see Archie jabbing the shovel at Todd.

Archie steps closer. Instantly, Todd tightens his grip on the shovel. He is no longer afraid. He swings the shovel at Archie's head striking him. Archie staggers back, stunned, but then charges forward. Todd strikes him again, this time with more force and anger. Todd lifts the shovel to strike again, but this time catches the ceiling light with the metal blade. The glass shatters. The room goes black.

A shaft of dull light from the kitchen cuts across the cellar floor, revealing Archie's slain body. An expanding pool of blood seeps out from his head. As the door upstairs opens wider, the light falls on Todd standing over Archie, the shovel still in his hands, his face spattered with blood.

The Todd we knew only a minute ago has been transformed. He stares up at Dussander, not with the eyes of a boy, but with those of a man. A man who can no longer be saved.

Todd smacks the back of the shovel on the finished grave to pack the dirt, then smooths the area over to destroy any markings. He is sweaty, dirty, and tired.

A SERIES OF SHOTS showing Todd cleaning up the mess. He is on the stairs sponging up the blood. Then we see him skimming the area where the pool of blood was with the shovel. The NEXT SHOT has him sprinkling fresh dirt over the same area. Then, on his knees, he carefully picks up bits of broken glass from the light bulb and drops them into a bucket. In the FINAL SHOT, Todd stands on the steps as his eyes comb the cellar. The shovel has been cleaned and replaced. The floor looks smooth and even. Satisfied, he goes upstairs.

Todd is back in his clothes. He wears a white T-shirt. He brings a knife up to Dussander's neck and slices down his suit, still stained by Archie's blood.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>

The blood and glass have been removed. Todd runs a mop over the floor. His job is almost over. Sweat pours down his face. The same for Dussander.

Todd puts the mop away. He surveys the room as before. Dussander does the same. There is a strange silence as the two of them look around the room for anything damning.

He hangs up. He sits down across from Dussander. The old man is near death, but through the slit of an eye he watches Todd. The stare between them is lethal. For a long moment this continues until...

Todd turns to go and stops.

INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Todd bursts through the door and drops to his knees in front of the dresser. He yanks on the drawer. It comes half way out and stops.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn you, come out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
The drawer flies out, knocking Todd back. He digs through it, the contents of Dussander's fake lives spilling about the room. He finds the box at the bottom. As he expected, it is locked. Without a moment's hesitation, he slams the box down on the post of the bed frame. It doesn't open, but bits of the frame fly across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the third attempt the tiny box shatters. Todd freezes, cocks his head. Outside he hears the distinct ROAR and sputter of the Porsche engine. He grabs two pages of a letter. There is nothing he can do about the mess in the room. He closes the door on his way back to the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Ben looks oddly at Dussander. The wheels of his memory slowly, very slowly, begin to turn.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we'll see. Looks like I'll be here for a while. I didn't want to alarm my nephew just yet, but this break in my leg... well, we'll see what the doctor says.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, of course. But for now, you must forgive me, my medication has made me drowsy. Do not be offended if I fall asleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<BEN>

	Don't be offended if I keep talking anyway. It beats wondering if I'm ever going to walk again. I tell you, my friend, the ways of God are not meant to be understood.

But Ben's words are lost on a sleeping man. He continues to stare at Dussander.

<DIRECTION>
Todd manages to get the drawer back into the dresser. He throws all the remaining debris and bits of wood into the trash bag. He goes to the closet and searches through the clothes. He finds the S.S. uniform, now tattered from many night of fitful sleep, and places it in the trash bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HILLCREST SAVINGS AND LOAN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BANK CLERK behind the counter is a fat, elderly woman, pleasant-faced and not too sharp. Todd stands solemnly on the other side of the counter. She stares hard at a piece of paper. We see that it is a note: "Please allow my grandson, Todd, to retrieve my insurance documents from my safety deposit box. Thank you, Arthur Denker." It is Dussander's phony signature at the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's really sick. ...Please.

The woman looks up at Todd, the key in his hand, then back down at the note.

The woman inserts her key into the first lock and Todd does the same in the second. A moment later he is holding the box in his hands.

She escorts him to a small room where he can view the contents of the box. She leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BANK - SMALL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd puts the box on a table and opens it. It is nearly empty: a few old photographs, some financial records. There is no document. Todd is swept up in a wave of emotion-- anger, relief, contempt. He's been played like a fool, but is nonetheless grateful. Ultimately, he is so overwhelmed a laugh springs from his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son of a bitch.

He scoops out the contents of the box and puts them in his pocket.

EXT. WOODED AREA - DUSK
</DIRECTION>

Todd has dug a hole in a remote location. He empties the letters, the S.S. uniform, and the contents from the safety deposit box into the hole. A little lighter fluid. A match. Todd watches the evidence burn.

Todd stands next to the bed holding a small clump of flowers. Dussander notices the bouquet.

<DIRECTION>
Todd exits. Ben sits quietly for a moment, thinking. He turns on the television-- "The Price is Right". We hear it over the following. Ben glances over at the screen which separates him from Dussander. Slowly his eyelids begin to get heavy. He starts to nod off. But as sleep begins to envelope him, his eyes suddenly fly open. A surge of terror burns across his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits up frightened. A single crutch stands next to the bed. He grabs it. He strips away his covers and the restraints on his leg, once or twice shoving his hand over his mouth to quell a painful scream. He gets to his feet awkwardly, hobbling, half-dragging his bad leg. Every step he takes is a study in agony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on the screen. It slides out of the way, revealing Ben staring down at the sleeping Dussander. In the pained struggle to keep silent, he brings his face right up to Dussander's, close enough to smell his breath.

Ben stumbles out of his room into the hall. The crutch falls to the ground. He slides against the wall toward the nurses' station. Tears stream down his face. As he clutches the wall, we glimpse the faded green numbers on his forearm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches the nurse's desk. She is on the phone. He grabs her by the shoulder and pulls her face up into his. She lets out a startled SCREAM. But Ben's emotion stops her from resisting. He is sobbing uncontrollably. Orderlies appear and pull him off of her. He collapses to the ground, consumed by grief.

BLACK.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander slowly wakes up for the first time since his surgery. A large black man, DARREN, stands above him changing the IV bag. He notices Dussander is awake. Dussander's voice is low and hoarse from hours of sedation.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the nurse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<DARREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Darren. I'll be taking care of you from now on. I'll tell the doctor you've woken up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARREN>
<DIRECTION>
Darren finishes with the IV unit and goes to the door. Dussander watches him, a bit puzzled, but his eyes are closed again before Darren is out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander wakes up again. Something is different in his room. He looks to the table next to him. All his magazines are gone. He looks to the other side of the room. Ben is gone, his bed stripped of all linen. Finally he looks to the door. It is cracked open. Two men in suits are talking in the hallway. One we will come to know as Detective GETTY. The other is a subordinate. Dussander is clearly bothered by what he sees. He reaches over for the call button and rings it several times.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later Darren comes in. Getty sees this and stops talking. He watches Dussander from the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DARREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you need something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARREN>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is going on here? Where is Ben?

</DUSSANDER>
<DARREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Krauss has been moved. I'm going to give you something. It will help you sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARREN>
<DIRECTION>
Darren readies Dussander's arm for an injection.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want it. Who is that man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Before Dussander can protest, Darren sticks him with the needle.
</DIRECTION>
<DARREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your surgery was a success. Just try to relax.

Dussander's eyes open. The first thing he sees are three men, all in suits, standing over him.

<DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
(in German)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you speaking to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
The voice comes from WEISKOPF, 40's. His suit is dark gray, well tailored, probably European. He speaks eloquently despite an accent that shows roots of Europe and the Middle East.

<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, of course, but you seem to have me confused with someone else. My name is Arthur Denker. Perhaps you want a different room --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Weiskopf sits on the edge of the bed. Dussander notices the pin on his lapel. A small, silver Star of David.
</DIRECTION>
<WEISKOPF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Weiskopf. You are Kurt Dussander.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEISKOPF>
<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know no one by that name. Shall I ring for the nurse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSSANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander reaches for the Call button and stops in horror. He looks at his hands. His fingertips are smeared with black ink. He looks up at the men in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<WEISKOPF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The man in the next bed was Benjamin Krauss. He was imprisoned for ten months at Patin. You were responsible for the death of his wife and two daughters. His identification of you was quite specific. I'm sure his reward from my government will help offset the burden of his broken leg.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DUSSANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Arthur Denker. I am an American--

The detective, GETTY, snaps a few pictures of Dussander. The other man is FBI Special Agent DAN RICHLER.

INT. TODD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd's room is dark as he lies on the floor, writing something on a pile of index cards. The only light comes from the hallway through the open door of the bedroom. Todd is deep in thought, but from the bits of shredded index cards we can tell the writing is not coming easily.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The road ahead reveals itself, uh, God, no. The road ahead... grrrr, The fucking road ahead.

<MONICA>

Todd doesn't notice her. He stares down at the card. Finally he looks up, as if it took her voice a few seconds to register in his mind. His response is hardly audible.

<DIRECTION>
Monica reaches in to his room to turn on the light. She touches the switch but then pulls her hand back. Todd is back at the note card. She looks at him oddly, worried, but then steps away from the door and goes downstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd's lips are moving, as if he were speaking to himself. He pauses. Then, in a sudden gust of inspiration begins to write furiously. He finishes and stands up, catching his reflection in the mirror above his desk. In the eerie half-light, he stares at the ghost-like image of himself.
</DIRECTION>

<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We all have dreams that we carry with us. Perhaps it is a dream of prosperity, or happiness. But now, so early in our lives, it seems that all we should ask for is to be at peace with the world, because only then can we be at peace with ourselves.

Weiskopf and Richler, both wearing rubber gloves, are carefully looking through the contents of Dussander's dresser. They pour over everything, placing some items in clear plastic bags. A few DEPUTIES are milling around. Richler picks up a small photograph of a young woman. Todd's voice comes in:

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The following series of images appear under music:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The quiet wing of this hospital has transformed into a frenzied sea of reporters, cameramen, photographers, and police officers. Everyone is struggling for a glimpse of the infamous celebrity through the window that looks into Dussander's room. Inside, Weiskopf and Richler are speaking to the doctors. Getty stands to the side, instructing the DEPUTY who guards the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through all of this Dussander lies like a fossil in his bed as the bodies whirl around him. Darren enters the room to change Dussander's IV bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the door flies open and a young photographer dashes in, snapping pictures wildly. Getty and the other officers descend upon him. The camera flashes. Other photographers try to get in but are blocked. Pandemonium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yet Dussander seems oblivious to the commotion. His eyes are nothing more than glazed slits, his mouth hangs open. Darren runs toward the door to help. Dussander's eyes open slightly. There is life behind them after all. He turns his attention imperceptibly toward his IV bag...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera moves away from Dussander to the window. Outside in the parking lot, groups of protesters have gathered. Some hold candles. Others chant and wave signs. News reporters surround them.

Todd appears apprehensive as he sits down on the couch next to his mother. She puts her arm around him. He is pale and glassy-eyed. His parents don't look much better.

The faucet runs at full blast to hide the noise as Todd digs through the medicine cabinet and takes out a bottle of Pepto- Bismol. He takes off the cap and gulps down what is left in the bottle. He finishes and takes a few deep breaths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he turns around he catches his reflection in the mirror. An empty bottle in his hand, a bright pink ring around his lips, a few pink splotches down his shirt-- he looks totally ridiculous. Todd can't help but laugh.

The interview continues. The clock ticks on. Richler drinks from a coffeee cup. Todd is back in his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Todd, let me tell you what we're really interested in here. You told the admitting nurse that Denker had a heart attack while you were reading him a letter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHLER>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. I was. That's what I was doing there. It was in German but he insisted I try to read it anyway. Once or twice he got pissy about the pronunciation but I asked him what did he want from me. I don't speak German. Mr. Denker... Dussander... got really excited at one point. He yelled out, "Yes, that's what you would do all right." but I didn't know what he was talking about. Then he grabbed his chest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<RICHLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's when you called the ambulance, right?

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.

</RICHLER>
<TODD>

	I guess it was still on the table. I couldn't swear to it, but --

</TODD>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, I saw a letter. It was in German. I didn't think anything of it at the time. But, yeah, it was on Airmail stationery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<RICHLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it should still be there. This is our problem.

</RICHLER>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DICK>
<RICHLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHLER>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe somebody broke in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<RICHLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would somebody break into his house simply to steal a letter? ...Unless... there was someone... someone right here in Santo Donato who would want to protect him for some reason. Maybe a close friend, or even another fugitive. I know it sounds like a bunch of Robert Ludlum stuff, but when Dussander was taken to the hospital, we think our Mr. X scooted over to the house and swiped the letter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHLER>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That doesn't make sense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<RICHLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not, Todd?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHLER>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if Denk... if he had an old Nazi buddy in town, why didn't he come over himself and read the letter to him? If you could have heard the way he corrected me at every word--
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<RICHLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A good point. Except maybe this other fellow is in a wheelchair, or blind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHLER>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guys that are blind don't normally go scooting out to steal letters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<RICHLER>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True. Did Dussander have any friends that you knew of?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHLER>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<RICHLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about phone calls?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHLER>
<DIRECTION>
Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I heard his phone ring maybe five or six times in all the time I knew him. It was never anything out of the ordinary. Salesmen. Wrong numbers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<RICHLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you ever hear him speak German on those occasions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHLER>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. He hardly ever spoke German. He always said he would teach me someday, but he never got around to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<WEISKOPF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he ever talk about his past?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEISKOPF>
<DIRECTION>
Todd looks at Weiskopf. This is the first question he has asked and Todd is more wary of him than of Richler. Todd shrugs innocently.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not really. Little bits, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, don't you remember what he told us at Thanksgiving?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
Todd looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said he was in college--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DICK>
<DIRECTION>
(shutting her up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Monica. They don't care what we know, they care what Todd knows.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Richler notices the tension in the room. He looks at Weiskopf. Finally, he speaks to Dick.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I'm sure this whole thing has come as a terrible shock. I think we've done enough for the day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHLER>
<DIRECTION>
He and Weiskopf stand. Dick is almost surprised that they are leaving so soon.
</DIRECTION>
<WEISKOPF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Todd. Mr. and Mrs. Bowden.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEISKOPF>
<DIRECTION>
Weiskopf nods good-bye.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute... Agent Richler, before you go-- Todd's not a suspect in this, is he? I mean he's just talking to you, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<RICHLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHLER>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because Todd always thought he was helping that old man. We didn't know any of this before today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<RICHLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Bowden, you and Todd have nothing to worry about. I assure you. Your son has been a great service to us. Thank you, Todd. For now that's all we need. Our next step is to turn that house upside down. We're bringing in some special teams to look through everything. We may come up with something. We'll be in touch if we need you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHLER>
<DIRECTION>
They are almost to the door, when Richler stops.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHLER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Todd, by the way....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(casually, pulls a photo out of a folder he is carrying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever seen this man before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHLER>
<DIRECTION>
He holds the photo up to Todd. It is a picture of Archie in military dress, probably a blow-up of his military ID. Todd stares at it for a moment. His face shows no reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<RICHLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHLER>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles. Weiskopf opens the door and the two men leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - TODD'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From his window Todd sees Richler and Weiskopf talking by their gray sedan.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll be back, won't you boys? Won't you, Special agent Jackoff. You and the sheeny professor. ...I know, let's show him an old army picture, that'll screw him up. ...Fuck you. Fuck-You.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dick is half-way up the stairs when he hears yelling coming from Todd's room. He pauses a moment. Most of Todd's words aren't clear, but the profanity sure is...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - TODD'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, the sedan pulls away. Todd turns away from the window and we see that he is holding the barrel of the rifle in one hand and the scope in the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a few breaths, tries to calm down. A burst of nervous laughter slips out of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a KNOCK at the door. Two seconds later Dick comes in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DICK'S POV: Todd stands in the middle of his room. The gun pieces are nowhere in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything all right, son?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mother and I feel terrible... like we...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not your fault.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
Dick grabs his son and pulls him close. Todd doesn't know how to respond. For Dick, it is like hugging a phone pole. He knows something is terribly wrong. Todd stands stiff in his father's arms until he releases him.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know we love you, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles at his father, comfortingly. Dick is not comforted.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, ahh, your mother and I are going to go down and talk to our lawyer. I don't want you to worry about a thing. It's just a precaution. I don't trust these cops. We're not going to be gone long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your old man is on top of things, all right? I am going to take care of this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
Dick kisses Todd's forehead. He turns to leave and stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This afternoon, if you're up for it, we'll go do something. How 'bout it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
Dick tries to smile and goes out, the door, leaving Todd alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The garage door opens and Dick backs the Porsche into the street. Monica is with him. Todd, from the upstairs window, watches them go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd is near the end of his rope, trying to hold himself together. We see him splashing water on his face in the bathroom. He gazes into the mirror, transfixed by the ghost- like image reflected back at him. Todd pounds his fist against the sink. He can stand it no longer. He darts out of the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd drives his mother's Honda wagon towards the entrance of the hospital and for the first time witnesses the scope of Dussander's discovery. News vans are everywhere. The protesters have grown in number. A line of cars wait for admittance into the parking lot. A policeman stands a few feet away from Todd, directing cars in, turning others away. He is moving toward Todd. Horns honk around him. Todd sees that more police officers are standing by the door of the hospital. The nearby policeman notices Todd and walks closer. Todd doesn't wait. He pulls the car out of line and drives off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HONDA WAGON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd holds the steering wheel with a white-knuckled grip. His face is sweaty and flushed. He rocks back and forth as he tries to reassure himself...
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're okay. We're okay. We're o-kay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
He is almost calm when he nears his house. But it doesn't last. He sees something he can hardly believe.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got to be fucking kidding me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old Vo1vo is parked on the street in front of the house. Standing on the porch, sneakers and all, is Ed French. Todd pulls into the driveway and gets out. French has a cautious air about him as he walks toward Todd.
</DIRECTION>
<FRENCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Todd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRENCH>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. French, what brings you to the wild side of town?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
The two of them are standing on opposites sides of the car. French pulls a folded newspaper page from his pocket. He starts to move around the car toward Todd, but Todd circles the other way, keeping the car in between himself and French.
</DIRECTION>
<FRENCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Todd... I found something troubling in the morning news. Are your parents home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRENCH>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<FRENCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know the man in this picture is the man who came to see me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRENCH>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's sort of a bad time right now. Why don't you go home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<FRENCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will. But first I need a couple of things explained to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRENCH>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - OUTSIDE DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richler is speaking to the reporters. Cameras and lights are in his face. His words are low, serving as a backdrop, but we can tell that he is telling them of the plans to relocate Dussander. Weiskopf stands close by...
</DIRECTION>
<FRENCH>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Todd, why don't you tell me what happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRENCH>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While Todd almost seems to be enjoying this odd dance around the car, French does not.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Mr. French, sometimes one thing just leads to another and before you know it... things get out of control.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<FRENCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid that's not much of an answer, Todd. When do you expect your parents home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRENCH>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, Ed. You want to come in and wait? I'll put on a pot of tea. We'll talk about old times.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<FRENCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you might need some help, Todd. That's why I'm here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRENCH>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander is alone in the room as Richler addresses the reporters outside. His eyes open wide and his movements are the liveliest they have been since he was discovered. He reaches over to his IV unit and begins to disconnect the tube from the bag...
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know? You're right. I do need help. I really do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd becomes more animated, more threatening with every word. Somehow it is as though French is now retreating from Todd as they circle the car.
</DIRECTION>
<FRENCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me help you, Todd. I want to. You're too smart to do anything crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRENCH>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I ask you something, Ed? You don't mind if I call you Ed, now that I'm out of your fucking school, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<FRENCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRENCH>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know all this crap you see on TV about forensics... hairs and fibers, that stuff? How much of it do think is true and how much is just bullshit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
French is puzzled by the question. He has no answer.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, how would you know? You're a fucking guidance counsellor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>

French stops.
</DIRECTION>
<FRENCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Todd, this is silly. Why don't we go inside?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRENCH>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liquid spills onto the floor as the tube comes loose from the bag. Dussander sits back and pulls the free end of the tube up to his mouth. His lips wrap around it and his face tightens as he begins to blow....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd starts moving again. French does the same.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's a little factoid for ya. I'll bet you didn't know this one. Hairs fall out of your head all the time. But it's even worse when you're nervous. And you know what? I've been real fucking high-strung lately.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
Todd comes around the rear of the car and stops at the door to the back seat. He opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<FRENCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Todd... Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRENCH>
<DIRECTION>
Todd bends down to get something from the back seat. His voice is muffled from the inside of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's how it all happened, you know. One thing lead to another and before I knew it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
Todd pops back up holding the rifle, fully assembled and aimed at French's chest.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you showed up in my driveway, wearing those same fucking sneakers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<FRENCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa. To--
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRENCH>
<DIRECTION>
Todd rapid-fires. French's chest explodes red as his lifeless body sails back onto the grass. In the front yard, a dozen birds evacuate a tree in a panicked exodus. Todd swoons back on his heels, overcome by something. But it isn't pain, rather, it's a rush of pleasure. A laugh slips out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander takes the tube from his mouth and lets it fall to the floor. The camera moves along the tube and stops at Dussander's arm, where it ends. He lies back in his bed and waits...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd regains his balance. French stares wide-eyed as Todd steps up to him, the muzzle aimed at French's head. Todd grins widely. For the first time he looks ...happy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A single round obliterates half of French's skull. Todd chokes back a giggle like a drunk chokes back a belch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dussander lurches up in the bed in a spastic, contortive fit as the air embolism reaches his heart. His arm flails against the IV unit, sending it crashing to the floor. The monitors next to him reflect a drastic turn in his condition. The door flies open and a pair of nurses charae in through the swarm of journalists. Richler and Weiskopf run in and the eager cameramen follow. The room is bathed in flash explosions as the nurses try to subdue Dussander.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd throws open a cabinet door above the workbench and eyes the boxes and boxes of ammunition. He lets out a beautifully wicked laugh as he dumps all of the cartons into his backpack. He leaves the cabinet door open as he slips the bag over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd zooms out of the garage on his bike, the rifle slung over one shoulder, the backpack over the other. He zips past French's body and out into the street. In the distance, we hear the faint, but rising wail of sirens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A front door or two slams shut as Todd passes. Suddenly he cuts up between two houses. A man standing in his back yard sees Todd and freezes. Todd ignores him. He steers the bike through the yard and picks up the dirt path he has used so many times before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From above we see Dussander's eyes, wide open, motionless. Yet the expression on his face is one of odd satisfaction. A doctor pounds on his chest, barks orders. The trauma team prepares the defibrillator, but we know they are too late...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DIRT PATH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd rides fast over the dry, rocky ground. The wind streaks back his hair. His excitement is as palpable as the grin dancing across his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An aerial shot follows him as he angles the bike off the trail and up a steep embankment. As the camera moves ahead of him, we see the crest of the hill, and beyond it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The freeway, teeming with rush-hour traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
