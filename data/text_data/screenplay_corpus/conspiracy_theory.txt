INT. MANHATTAN STREETS - CAB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the wheel: JERRY FLETCHER. Flat-out handsome if not for his eyes. Someone rash, someone making an uninformed decision might call them crazy eyes. He stops across from an apartment building, TOOTS his HORN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN DOORWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A woman and a man, a CYNIC, appear. Jerry smiles as they kiss goodnight. A bit of desperate passion. She watches after him as he gets in the cab.
</DIRECTION>
<CYNIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Luxembourg Towers on 7th.

INT. CAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry nods, rolls out. The Cynic watches the door to 1257 close, then sighs. Jerry looks at him in the rearview.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The sound of love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<CYNIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNIC>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry exhales an exaggerated sigh.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<CYNIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love? Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'. Love is bullshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNIC>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I live on tips, so don't be offended, but you're a liar. I saw you kiss. Admit it, this is the street where love lives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
The Cynic looks back over his shoulder. Down love street. As Jerry hangs a right, the Cynic faces forward.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love gives you wings. It makes you fly. I don't even call it love. I call it Geronimo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<CYNIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Geronimo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNIC>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Geronimo. When you're really in love, you'll jump. Off the top of the Empire State. Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<CYNIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you'll die. You'll squash yourself. What's the point?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNIC>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you listening, man? Love gives you wings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
The Cynic just smiles, leans back.
</DIRECTION>
<CYNIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She must be some girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNIC>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love her so bad. She just... wrecks me. I would die for her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry stops at a light. A road crew are at work ahead. A white strobe light warns motorists that they're here.
</DIRECTION>
<CYNIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She feel the same about you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNIC>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry can't take his eyes off the stroke. As he blinks.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUBJECTIVE POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking down as a man's arms are strapped to the arm of a chair. The POV JERKING UP as the same is done with the head. A kaleidoscope of flashing lights ahead, then darkness as eyes are shut. They're forced open. We see the reflection of blue eyes in glass as they're taped open. As bright lights strobe...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO TAXI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry stares at the light, transfixed.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never told her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<CYNIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why the hell not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNIC>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I, uh, I have some problems.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
The traffic light glows green; Jerry doesn't see it. The sound of conspiratorial WHISPERS fill the taxi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUBJECTIVE POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The contents of a syringe pumped into the strapped arm. The walls begin to melt. The WHISPERS CONTINUE. GARBLED, but their tone is perfectly clear. Threatening. Cabalistic. Human forms appear. Stretched impossibly long, melting along with the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We CLOSE ON the reflection of a dozen pair of the same taped-open eyes. The WHISPERING CUTS SHORT. Ominously. The eyes dart from side-to-side as FOOTSTEPS approach. The eyes suddenly widen in agony. As Jerry's scream of pain becomes the BLARE of a HORN, we find ourselves back in the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TAXI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Going about 60 mph. Jerry snaps to just in time to avoid a head-on collision with a car coming the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<CYNIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you crazy?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNIC>
<JERRY>

	The guy came right at us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<CYNIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You turned up a one way street!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNIC>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry watches, in a sweat, as he passes a "ONE WAY" sign pointing the opposite way. He mutters to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was only going one way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<CYNIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop me off here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNIC>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I'm sorry --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<CYNIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just drop me off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNIC>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry pulls to the curb. The meter at $3.60. The Cynic slides a twenty through the slot and is out the door. Jerry watches over his shoulder as the Cynic disappears down the street. Jerry rubs his eyes, tries to regroup.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love street...

</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIFTH AVENUE (MANHATTAN) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Late. The cab rolls, this time the right way. Ahead, a well-dressed man steps off the curb, flags Jerry down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry slows, stops. As the well-dressed man starts over, Jerry sizes him up. The man seems suddenly sinister.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he reaches for the door, LOCKS CLICK DOWN. Jerry GUNS the CAB away. The confused man stumbles back, shouts, apparently not a threat at all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING (UPTOWN) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Headlights out, the cab pulls up to the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry glances at a lit 2nd floor apartment window, then settles in with a bologna sandwich. About to take a bite, he pauses, removes a slice of bologna. He regards it a beat, then carefully peels off the edge. Jerry holds the narrow casing up against the glow of a streetlight, like it was encoded. Then something catches his eye. He trades the sandwich for binoculars, focuses on the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BINOCULAR POV - WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIZA SUTTON. In a Yale sweatshirt, stretching, earphones on. She forces her head past her kneecap and holds it there. Driven is the word to describe Liza. When she sleeps, she tries to do it better than anyone else does. We can't hear her, but as she finishes stretching, she sings along with the music on her headset.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JERRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
captivated, he sighs -- the sound of love. Then he gets an idea. Still watching, he fumbles for the RADIO. Turning it ON, he SCANS radio STATIONS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BINOCULAR POV - LIZA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her lips don't match anything. COUNTING CROWS. DAVID BOWIE. The TRAFFIC REPORT. A RAP TUNE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JERRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Never takes his eyes off her, SCANS STATIONS for the elusive number. He finds ANNIE LENNOX singing "Blue Moon."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BINOCULAR POV - LIZA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lips in synch. That's what she's singing along with.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (joins in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Blue moon, you saw me standing alone...'
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT between them. "Without a song in my heart, without a love of my own. Blue moon..." In a weird way, it's a duet. A sweet moment. Then, Liza stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gets on a treadmill and cranks it up. Walking a few moments before she's jogging, before she's running. No easy pace here. Liza gets grim, cranks up the speed and goes hard. She's punishing herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JERRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His voice trails off as he watches. Sad, he lowers the binoculars, doesn't want to watch her do this. Throwing the CAR in GEAR, he takes a last look and drives away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW YORK NEWS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A classic corner newsstand except that a river runs down the street and over the curb. Newspaper stacks usually on the sidewalk are up on milk crates. The owner, FLIP TANNER, cruises the sidewalk in a battered wheelchair. All sinew and tendons, Flip is black, about 50. He looks to Jerry's cab plowing twin fountains as it approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flip heaves a stack of newspapers and magazines into his lap. he rolls to meet Jerry at the curb, hands him the stack through the window. Jerry looks down at the water.
</DIRECTION>
<FLIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Water main. Broke all the way over on 40th Street and Seventh. Subway's a damn river.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLIP>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry stares back over his shoulder at water gushing out a manhole cover. Flip watches him, smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<FLIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you thinking, Jerry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLIP>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Water mains usually go in the winter. It's August 1st.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<FLIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell you what. Reminds me of life in the Delta.

	You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<FLIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone. Nearly snapped me in half.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLIP>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta go, Flip. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>

As Jerry drives away, Flip smiles, shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VILLAGE BROWNSTONE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrying his magazines and newspapers, Jerry climbs onto the roof from the fire escape. He deadpans a look back and forth. All seems clear. Jerry starts across. COOS as Jerry passes a PIGEON coop. He steps back, opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your choice, fellas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
As Jerry continues...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPACE BETWEEN TWO ROOFTOPS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jerry leaps, PASSES directly OVER us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VILLAGE BROWNSTONE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry enters by a window at the fire escape. Apartment 202. He checks the seam between the door and casing. The tip of a toothpick is just visible. Assured, he unlocks the door. As the toothpick drops, Jerry steps inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT 202 - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stacked with filled-to-bursting file cabinets. On the walls, a silvery particle board. Jerry locks the door, balances an empty beer bottle upside down on the door knob.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Satisfied, Jerry enters the file labyrinth. As he moves we FLASH ON some of the labels, some with not bad cartoon drawings. "George Bush," "Delta 30," "Blue Flood," "Sirhan2."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry turns the corner. "Nazis & Nutrasweet," "Patti Hearst," and among many more: "MK Ultra" which features the silhouette of a man holding a handgun & "Council On Foreign Affair" with the C-F-A in heavily Gothic lettering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KITCHEN - REFRIGERATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Locked. Padlocked chains run through steel rings bolted to the sides. Jerry spins the combo-lock. Before opening, he pauses to consider a set of magnetic poetry words on the fridge door. He arranges them, reads:
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The essential goddess death could chain bitter men,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moves words)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and crush the ugly moment... like life pounding eggs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry opens the fridge to reveal ten padlocked stainless steel containers. He removes one labeled: "Tapioca."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT 202 - JERRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrying a bowl of tapioca, Jerry enters. More files, a manual typewriter. On the wall, an American flag alongside a poster of John Lennon reading: "Assassinated 12/8/80."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He strides to his desk and a...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUBLISHING MONTAGE BEGINS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry scans a New York Times spread on a drafting table. He circles headlines, names and dates. Does the same with the San Francisco Chronicle, Le Monde, Time, the Economist and Popular Mechanics. He enters raw data on 3x5 cards: space shuttle launched, base closings, escape from mental hospital and especially the obituaries. Specifically: "Industrialist Ernest Hariman Drowns."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry flips through 100s of cards on big Rolodexes as he cross-references data. Jerry pulls cards, lines them up. The first connection: the dates of six Space Shuttle launches and six earthquakes all coinciding. Jerry lets out a low whistle. Never too jaded to be shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry types the text of an article, crosses out mistakes. He handcranks copies off an old drum mimeograph. The hand drawn logo: lips whispering into an ear. The title: "Conspiracy Theory."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry writes out five labels. Addresses from across America. Jerry slaps the labels on the newsletters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun comes up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry drops the newsletters into a mailbox. He starts across the street, then stops, looks back with dread. He steps back over, checks the slot. Everything went down. Jerry starts away, then stops again. As he looks back...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT - NYC OFFICES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry passes through the metal detectors. He stops to stare at the blindfolded Status of Justice. As a FEDERAL COP steps over to join him.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smart girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<FEDERAL_COP>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT - OUTSIDE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The morning meeting yet to begin. Lawyers wait as, THROUGH the glass, treadmill girl Liza Sutton argues with brusque department head WILSON. It's a screaming match, though on this side of the glass their VOICES are MUFFLED THUMPS. Liza waves her arms. Wilson shakes his head emphatically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they continue to argue, a YOUNG LAWYER arrives being shown the ropes by an OLDER LAWYER.
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the conference room. We start 9 AM sharp. Usually.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
The argument in the conference room has gotten so vociferous, that people have stopped pretending not to watch.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. How long till I can talk like that to Mr. Wilson?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_LAWYER>
<OLDER_LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About a thousand years. That's Liza Sutton. You heard of the federal judge? Tom Sutton? Assassinated a few years ago?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_LAWYER>
<YOUNG_LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By that cult leader who's in prison, right? Ezekiel Walters. The one who blew up the Citibank Building.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_LAWYER>
<OLDER_LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None of it ever proven. But Sutton did deny Ezekiel a writ of habeas corpus. Anyhow, Liza is Sutton's daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
A commotion down the hall. Jerry. The cop from downstairs and a second one try everything short of violence to usher him out.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm an American and I demand to see Liza Sutton!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
CONFERENCE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wilson and Liza are nose-to-nose. THROUGH the glass, the head of every lawyer turns from them to Jerry. Like deftly executed synchronized swimming, Liza and Wilson can't help but notice. Jerry. Liza shakes her head in despair.

The guards hesitate. Wilson nods. As they let Jerry go...

INT. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT - LIZA'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In its own way as cluttered and overflowing with files as Jerry's apartment is. At her desk, Liza watches Jerry pace. The door is intentionally open. Liza's secretary JILL keeps a protective eye from the outer office.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see the connection.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<JERRY>

(incredulous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Testing some top secret seismic weapon.

	Not testing. Using. Nukes are passe. This is the weapon of the future.

As Liza exchanges a look with Jill, Jerry pauses to look at a framed photo on a credenza.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liza, 20, in full riding gear, gracefully jumping a horse over a set of rails.

<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I -- Jerry, the point. Get there. What does it have to do with the President?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
It takes him a moment to switch gears. Setting down the picture, he pulls out a map, unfolds it on Liza's desk. A seismic survey map. He points as he talks.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line. They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Motive?
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.

Liza sighs. On another day, Jerry might have been welcome comic relief. Not today. As she folds his map...
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You going to warn him?

</JERRY>
<LIZA>

</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy against yourself. I can't lie to me, Liza. And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?

Cordoned off with cops redirecting traffic. A lake. Big diesel pumps gush water into the gutters, and the sidewalks are sandbagged. All the same, water flows over Jerry's sneakers as he flags down a passing PUBLIC WORKS GUY.

Jerry enters, watches Clark and Piper get on the elevator for the 14th to 25th floors. As the door closes, Jerry steps to a podium with a directory of the building's occupants. He drops a finger onto a listing. Floors 18 to 22 are occupied by: the Central Intelligence Agency.

LOBBY SURVEILLANCE CAMERA POV - JERRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grainy black and white as Jerry exits. Is he being watched?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DINER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry's cab is reflected against the glass. THROUGH the window, we see Jerry at the counter. Standing, he throws a few bills down and exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry reappears in reflection, stops short as Piper is reflected on one side, Clark on the other. They grab Jerry. As he struggles Clark jams an air syringe against his neck. Jerry's reflection goes slack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they drag him into his cab, a single OLD MAN at the counter looks over, then back to his meatloaf as the yellow of the cab streaks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DECREPIT HOSPITAL ROOM (GERONIMO) - JERRY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Strapped to a chair in the middle of what looks like an old hospital room. Jerry's groggy, starting to regain consciousness. As he comes round, we hear FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING from the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON JERRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two men enter. They may or may not be Piper and Clark, but we only see their torsos as they move back and forth. We hear a CLOSET OPEN, EQUIPMENT being DRAGGED. Jerry knows he's righteously fucked. But he also knows...
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was right. Wasn't I? I was right.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was I right about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
They don't seem to pay him any mind.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you guys from NASA?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Without warning, one of the figures grabs Jerry's head from behind, straps it to a slat he attaches to the back of the chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry struggles, but his head is immobilized. The second man goes about taping Jerry's eyes open.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was wrong! I was wrong!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Finished, they leave. Jerry struggles, then finally waits. A new set of FOOTSTEPS in the hall. Jerry's eyes follow someone into the room and across from him. Jerry frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I know you?

<JONAS>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JONAS>
<DIRECTION>
WIDEN to include --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JONAS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing opposite Jerry. Genteel looking, professorial. There's something calm, oddly soothing about him.
</DIRECTION>
<JONAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever been in a place from which hope has gone? All that's left is patience. Everywhere. Like a fog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONAS>
<DIRECTION>
A beat as Jonas considers Jerry.
</DIRECTION>
<JONAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a very patient man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONAS>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's great. Good for you.

</JONAS>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you be a little more specific?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Jonas doesn't answer. Instead, he methodically loads a syringe. Jerry watches with grave apprehension.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JONAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own. Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONAS>

There's nowhere to go, but Jerry still tries to go there as the needle descends. And then the plunge.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I know?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Jonas switches on a row of strobe lights. They flash into Jerry's face. In between them, on a screen, images.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JERRY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man on fire. Kennedy with the waiter on the floor in the Ambassador. That guy in Vietnam being shot in the side of the head. Rhesus monkeys subjected to direct brain stimulation. Reagan catching it under the armpit. A slaughterhouse. And interspersed between it all, a rather official-looking photo of a middle-aged man we'll call Mr. S. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JONAS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is dancing back and forth before Jerry. The strobes freeze him like some club from the '70s.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Jonas isn't really dancing. He's directly across from Jerry -- profile-to-profile.
</DIRECTION>
<JONAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who else knows what you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONAS>
<DIRECTION>
Slack-jawed, Jerry doesn't answer. Jonas holds an electrode to Jerry's leg, touches a second to his side. Jerry arches back as current flows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JERRY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the ceiling melts and drops in heavy globs around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonas cuts the flow.
</DIRECTION>
<JONAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who else knows what you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONAS>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry's only answers are the tears running down his cheeks. Jonas hits him again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry jerks back so hard the chair snaps right off the floor and topples over backwards. Jerry's left wrist and right leg burst through the straps which were holding them down. A wisp of smoke rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonas sighs. He looks down at Jerry who moans, whispers...
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Jonas smiles paternally, steps over. Jerry's mouth moves, but we can't hear him. Mr. S flashes on the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<JONAS>
<DIRECTION>
(crouching)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From your lips, to God's ear.

</JONAS>
<DIRECTION>
JERRY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jonas leans in, his nose looks enormous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grabbing Jonas' shirt with his limited left hand, Jerry uses the only weapon he's got. He bites Jonas on the nose. Blood pulses as Jerry's teeth find an artery. Howling, Jonas tries to scramble out of reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry kicks him in the stomach with his free leg and then keeps kicking. It's inarticulate, roughshod work, but he connects and Jonas feels it and each new kick as a little more fury than the last.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally Jonas rolls away. Jerry half-crawls, half-rocks his way to a crouched position. Rising, he staggers into the window, the top of the chair smashing through the glass. Jerry stares down to the ground below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JERRY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the earth rises and falls like a wave. The distance down is impossible to gauge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jonas staggers to his feet, Piper and Clark charge in. They move forward, but without warning, Jerry gathers what balance he has and heaves himself out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDE OF BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Partially obscured by trees, Jerry does a half-gainer from exactly two stories above the ground. The chair back takes the brunt of the landing. Wood splinters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood spurts between Jonas' fingers. Clark and Piper draw their guns and rush to the window...

Slats of wood hang at his elbows and knees as Jerry reels across the lawn.

Clark and Piper FIRE.

<DIRECTION>
As Clark and Piper rush off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry slogs, sinks into asphalt up to his knees. A truck sets a dumpster down on the street ahead. As it pulls away, Jerry dashes, grabs hold of a handle on the rear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET TWO - SOME BLOCKS AWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the truck approach. As it turns right, the centrifugal force flings Jerry off the back and into the oncoming lane. Several taxis slam on their brakes to keep from running him over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All Jerry sees is yellow.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm one of you! I'm one of you!

INT. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT - LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the elevator doors open, Liza steps into her worst nightmare.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Liza Sutton! I need to see Liza!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry is being blocked by three FEDERAL COPS.
</DIRECTION>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't leave now, you're under arrest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_1>
<DIRECTION>
As Jerry spots her....
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Liza! This is it. They just tried to kill me! I don't know what I know, but it's big!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
They tangle him up, a few feet from his destination. Liza can see that something, real or imagined, has happened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the struggle, Jerry wrenches free, taking one of the Cops' .45s with him. He waves them off with it.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone freezes. Stand-off city.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's blood on your shirt.

</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
Indeed, blood is splattered across his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bit the bastard's nose off.

</JERRY>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bit someone's nose off?

</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! Don't let's get into this thing where I have to repeat myself!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
As one of the Cops moves to flank, Jerry aims the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!

</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the boss. Just don't make me repeat myself. I hate that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Liza sees blood dripping onto Jerry's shoe. She looks to where he clutches his side, blood oozing out. To his face.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jerry, you're bleeding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry takes his hand from his side, looks at the blood.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't even feel it till a few minutes ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
As Jerry's distracted, one of the Cops moves in. He forces Jerry's gun hand up while the other two Cops take him down. Jerry struggles till one jams a thumb into a pressure point in his neck. Jerry winces, collapses.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are they? I don't even know who they are. But it's on the tip of my tongue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
And Jerry starts to sob. As Cop one cuffs him.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of you call an ambulance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
A hesitation before one of them moves to do so. Liza pushes her way through the other two.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ease off of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
They back off a step, keep him covered. Jerry continues to sob, desolate. And Liza, despite herself, puts an arm around him, does what she can to comfort. Her life's never going to be the same.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROOSEVELT HOSPITAL - WAITING AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A definite inner city feel. Liza stands out in her smart, stylish business suit. She sits in a plastic chair, tries not to scream into her cell phone.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need the files tonight. Have them sent to my apartment. I don't give a rat's ass what you're doing! Hello? Damnit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
Phone's dead. Sitting beside Liza, fidgety in the early stages of withdrawal, is DOLLY, a 20-year-old prostitute.
</DIRECTION>
<DOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sucks, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Liza doesn't even look over. Dolly holds up a pager.
</DIRECTION>
<DOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should get one of these. Then use a pay phone. Cell phones can be traced.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOLLY>
<LIZA>

The Doctor's already on his way out. Liza sits back down.

Liza reaches into her day planner, pulls out a crisp $100 bill, holds it out to Dolly.

<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>

A cop reads the paper at the end of the hall. He barely looks up as Liza walks down, steps into...

Liza enters as a NURSE injects a syringeful of "something" into Jerry's IV. Jerry's strapped to the bed.

Jerry's as serious as a guy about to pass out can be.

They look at each other a moment. Then, as Jerry's eyes flutter.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Switch 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
A long sigh and Jerry's out. Liza starts out, then stops, laughs at herself as she realizes what she needs to do. Stepping over, she switches the chart at the foot of Jerry's bed with that of his unconscious roommate. This guy's handcuffed to the bed frame.

Liza looks at Jerry a beat, sighs, then exits.

INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM 322 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A crash. The Intern staggers back out the door and into the wall. Jerry exits -- wearing a johnny which flaps as he dashes down the hall. Bouncing along behind him is the bed's side rail which he's still cuffed to.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 3RD FLOOR HALLWAY - ELEVATORS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry pounds on the down button. PING! The doors on the middle elevator open to reveal Liza, Jonas, et. al... They spot Jerry the same moment he spots them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry drives the rail into one agent's gut, staggering him. The second agent trying to exit catches the rail in the teeth. The elevator doors close.

<DIRECTION>
ELEVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lowry reaches for the control panel. But he's too late. As the elevator starts up, Lowry slaps the emergency stop. Then they pull the doors open. The various agents climb out, step down to the 3rd floor hallway below. Jerry is nowhere in sight. But from the hallway to the right of the elevators, a SHOUT and a CRASH. Everyone heads that way.

NURSES' STATION

A nurse stands over an upended Med-Cart. She looks up at Liza and the suits charging around the corner. Points. PILLS CRUNCH under their feet as they take off in pursuit.

HALLWAY TWO

Jerry pulls a chair cover, hops up and punches a ceiling panel loose. Then he continues down the hall.

The gang round the corner, stop short at the chair and panel. Jonas motions two agents up.

<DIRECTION>
HALLWAY THREE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A row of beds against the wall. An orderly dumps a load of laundry down a laundry chute. He leaves. Jerry exits a bathroom, heads over. Gripping the lip of the chute, he's just swung a leg inside when the room COP appears around the corner, gun drawn.
</DIRECTION>

Obliging, Jerry swings his leg back over. But he sets his heel on a laundry cart, shoves it hard into the Cop. It gives Jerry a chance to swing the bed rail into the Cop whose gun skitters away as he tumbles back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry tries again to jump down the laundry chute, but the Cop is there, grapples with him. Jerry finally head- butts him. As the Cop falls back, releasing Jerry, Jerry falls down the chute. He jerks to a stop as the bed rail forms a crossbar over the mouth of the chute.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LAUNDRY CHUTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry dangles from his wrist. That hurt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamming his back against one side of the chute, his feet against the other, he inches his way up. As he grips the edge to get out, a face looms! Liza. Jerry loses his grip again, drops, jerks to another joint-wrenching stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALLWAY THREE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liza stands beside the semi-conscious Cop, looks down at Jerry. He looks up at her. At her mercy.

Liza turns, hears PEOPLE COMING her way. Deciding, she takes the key ring from the cop's belt, finds the handcuff key. She slides it into the cuff on Jerry's wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They share a long look. Click. Jerry drops. Liza's left holding the rail. She turns, sees the beds by the wall.

A cop at the door. Liza flashes her ID, enters. She heads to the nightstand, opens it. There's a key ring, a pack of gum and a worn paperback copy of Catcher In the Rye with the familiar crimson and gold cover. Liza flips through it. Certain passages are highlighted, others blacked out.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry and Liza by the window. Jerry hands her the front page of The New York Times. As Jerry scarfs bread...
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just look at it. Ten seconds and you'll be scared out of your mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
As Liza scans the paper, a waiter sets a small salad in front of her and a big bowl of spaghetti and sausage in front of Jerry. He digs in like a five-year-old.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(re: salad)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You worked all day for that? Lettuce, tomatoes, no dressing. That's what, you're punishing yourself, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up. An odd beat. Is Jerry on to something?
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(slurps noodles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Liza hands him back the paper.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing scary there. Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(scans it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm... Ahh...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(raises eyebrows)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooooo...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Liza waits as Jerry spreads out the paper.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More about life on Mars. From a rock they found on the South Pole. Explain that one to me. But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it with you and the space program?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And look here. Cease fire in Chechenia. That's good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the guys selling them weapons.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(scanning article)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to this, some gas company in Colorado. Their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive. They've accused the E.P.A. of, quote, 'turning a blind eye to the future.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry grabs a dollar bill from the tip of the adjacent table. He turns it over, points out the "eye" above the pyramid.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well that's the eye right there. Money. And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world. The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do they have a secret handshake?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry takes her hand. He shakes it, employing various complex machinations. Finished, he regards her intently.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
She laughs. He got her that time. But after a beat...
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So why are they after you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure. I think I figured something out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(lowers voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It must've been in my newsletter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What newsletter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry crosses his lips with his finger, shushes her. He motions her forward so he can whisper. She leans in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment -- a GUNSHOT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In one motion, Jerry stands, throws his chair through the plate glass window. As GLASS RAINS down, he's already got one foot out on the sidewalk. He reaches back for Liza.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Then Jerry sees the waiter, standing nearby, a bottle of wine in one hand, a popped cork in the other -- the source of the sound. Jerry looks back to Liza.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I'm a little jumpy. Who wouldn't be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're certifiable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believe you about what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry shrugs. As the manager storms over, Liza peels off a hundred dollar bill.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
(re: window)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will that cover it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head. As she peels off a few more...
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know that hour you gave me to impress you? How much of it is left?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JERRY'S VILLAGE BROWNSTONE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Liza enters by a window at the fire escape. Jerry follows. His side is obviously bothering him.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flesh wound. No big deal.

Jerry heads for the door to his apartment.

<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT 202 - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jerry and Liza enter. Closing the door behind them, he switches on the light. Liza looks from the filing cabinets to the silvery particle board covering the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this supposed to protect you from aliens?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry doesn't answer as he locks the door, picks the empty beer bottle up off the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Surprise me.

</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The whole kit and caboodle of 'em are British Intelligence agents. Spies. Jerry Garcia had a double- o rating. Just like James Bond.

<DIRECTION>
Jerry sits the beer bottle on the doorknob, turns, heads off. Liza looks at the bottle, then, "a la Bond"...
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Garcia, Jerry Garcia.

As he moves to follow...

</JERRY>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, coffee. If that's okay?
	</DIALOGUE>

Jerry looks back over his shoulder, smiles.

<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coffee's our friend.

KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liza watches as Jerry unchains the refrigerator. He misinterprets the look on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I keep the beans in the fridge. They stay fresher that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
As Jerry removes one of the stainless steel containers, Liza reads some of his magnetic poetry off the door.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must language produce a thousand knives and not recall a whisper?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then another)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love the delicate shadow of she wanting me to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
Liza smiles at Jerry who looks up sheepishly from the container. He's having trouble with the lock.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgot the combination... You want some grapefruit juice?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JERRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry enters with Liza. The photo of Lennon gives her pause. She looks at the surrounding files then watches as Jerry turns the mimeograph drum, starts printing something.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If my universe had a hub...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This would be it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry nods. Liza steps to the drafting table where Jerry has done several rough, but competent sketches of horses in motion. There's a book open to a photo of a horse and rider jumping a rail. Liza closes it, reads:
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Equitation.

</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
(re: sketches)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are these yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry nods, embarrassed. As he staples some papers together, Liza stops short. In the margin of one of the drawings are two small profile sketches of her. Eyes closed, it looks like she's sleeping.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here it is. Conspiracy Theory

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oliver Stone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stone is their spokesman. You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it? Stone's a disinformation flunky. The face that he's alive says it all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you prove any of this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely not. A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy. If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Liza flips through, reads the lead-in to one story aloud.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles. The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'

<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>

Jerry nods, goes about digging one up. Liza steps to a bookshelf and fifteen different copies of The Catcher in the Rye.

Strange. As Liza nods, Jerry opens to a particular page.

A beacon shines through the shattered window, but they're clear. Jerry shoulders the desk across the floor. He pulls a barely visible wire loop, opens a trap door in the floor.

Standing, Jerry hauls down on a handle attached to another thin wire. Really putting his weight into it.

Jerry dashes to a closet. Liza watches as he opens the closet door, strikes a waiting match. He lights a fuse which burns up toward a hole in the floor.

	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Liza stops short. The white light from the fuse illuminates the Wonderwall. Liza stares at a 6x12 painted montage. One image dominates. In fact, it's arresting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bliss: Liza in full equestrian fear, hands outstretched, head thrown back. Astride a winged horse. It soars over a gate and up into the heavens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry has eyes only for the fuse. As it disappears through the hole in the floor, it takes its light with it. The Wonderwall goes dark.

Branching off, the fuse runs into them, through them. Incendiaries ignite.

Jerry pulls a jacket from the closet, starts to pull it on. It's too dark to make out exactly what he's doing.

Jerry's wearing a fireman's greatcoat, pulls on a fireman's helmet. Realizing what she's seen, he's very embarrassed.

INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

No shortage of light up here. As the last man exit, it's become an incinerator. White hot flame shoots out. Paint peels. The housing of the typewriter melts. A locked METAL CYLINDER on the kitchen counter EXPLODES in a shower of popcorn. Polaroids blister. But more than anything -- files burn. As the sound of SIRENS builds...

EXT. STREET - OUTSIDE LIZA'S BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A drizzle has started to fall. For a street lined with parked cars, it has a rather desolate feel. There's a certain car -- a Crown Victoria. A silhouette behind the wheel. Liza's apartment is being watched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CROWN VICTORIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Agent Lowry. And in the back seat AGENT MURPHY. They sit in silence, a relaxed, practiced state of alert. Murphy frowns at the RAINDROPS which SPLAT the rear window.
</DIRECTION>
<MURPHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna take a piss in the alley before it starts to pour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURPHY>
<DIRECTION>
Lowry nods, keeps his eyes on the entrance to the apartment. Murphy opens the door. As he climbs out of the back seat, we see a black 9mm in a shoulder harness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few moments pass. Agent Lowry leans forward to look up to the dark window of Liza's apartment. Behind him, he hearts the back door open, Agent Murphy slide in the back seat. As Lowry leans back:
</DIRECTION>
<LOWRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's your bladder?

The barrel of Murphy's black 9mm is pressed squarely against the side of Lowry's head.

It's Jerry in the back seat! But Lowry's a pretty cool customer. He regards Jerry evenly in the rearview.
</DIRECTION>
<LOWRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lot of folks are looking for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOWRY>
<DIRECTION>
Lowry's hand inches toward a .45 on the front seat.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you must be the smart one. Hands on the steering wheel.

</JERRY>

A little nudge of the 9mm and Lowry does as he's told.

<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

<LOWRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're welcome. Where's my partner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOWRY>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like that. A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay. May have a headache for a few days. Are you here with honorable intentions?

</JERRY>
<LOWRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure what you mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOWRY>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.

</JERRY>
<LOWRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's ironic. Because we're here to protect her from you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOWRY>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're here because you figured I might show up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<LOWRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions? Are they honorable?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOWRY>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow. But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you. Does that seem honorable?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<LOWRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't know if --

Jerry creases the back of his head with the gun barrel. As Lowry slumps unconscious, Jerry starts out, then pauses.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>

It sure doesn't seem so. Till Jerry cocks back the hammer.

Jerry whacks him again. Jerry's about to go when the front door to Liza's building opens and Liza steps out in her running gear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry crouches, but he needn't bother. She's not looking his way. As she takes off down the street:
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit...

</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry pulls Lowry over to the passenger's seat, then climbs into the driver's seat. He starts the car, then rolls out after her.
</DIRECTION>

As he stops short, Lowry slams into the dash. He turns, rides along looking for a place to turn into the park. And then she's gone from sight. Jerry abandons Lowry and the car in the middle of the street and takes off on foot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Moving between the trees. Elusive. Tireless.

<DIRECTION>
As Liza exits the park, continues on her way, unaware that behind her...

Jerry collapses against the wall. Taking each breath like it was his last, he watches as she disappears from sight. Finally, as he staggers out of the park...
</DIRECTION>

INT. BARNES AND NOBLE BOOKSTORE (MANHATTAN) - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARNES AND NOBLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry walks down the street, reading.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A popular area, there are still quite a few people about. Suddenly the pages flutter in Jerry's hand. Trash swirls at his feet. He stops, slowly looks up as he hears the HELICOPTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Black, no running lights, equipped with a sound damper. It descends quickly over the intersection. Silky black cords drop. Traffic snarls as CLEET COMMANDOS slide down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four of them. Plainclothed with discreet com-headsets. Wearing jackets, we catch glimpses of the equipment slung on their hips, including machine pistols. Each has a 2X3 piece of paper taped to his wrist. Like NFL quarterbacks with the plays, except the papers are photos of Jerry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter is gone so fast some people haven't even noticed. The commandos disperse into the crowd, refer to their wrists as they advance in Jerry's direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry hightails it the opposite way, tries not to attract attention. He pulls up in front of a movie theater as a second chopper swoops in to drop four more commandos at the south intersection. The street has been sealed off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry stands there a beat, not sure what to do. Something makes him look across the street where CLEET #1 pulls up, looks over at him. As CLEET #1 refers to his wrist photo, Jerry dashes into the theater.

Nearly a full house. Jerry sits near the front, nervously looking back over his shoulder, watching the aisle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four CLEETs appear silhouetted at the entrance. As they start down, checking faces...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the manager drones, people head for the aisles. Jerry moves for the emergency exit. Sticking out like a sore thumb as the emergency door opens and a shadowy figure steps inside the alcove. A CLEET commando.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spots Jerry, starts forward.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEET_3>

	Bomb! There's a bomb in here!

</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
As the cry of "Bomb!" gets taken up, panic spreads. No one gets trampled, but the shoving is fierce. As the CLEETs fight their way down, Jerry heads for the rear exit. A few other patrons go that way as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - BEHIND THEATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry exits with a solid head-start, but as he turns there's a CLEET in the alley. Checking faces -- not looking Jerry's way yet. Jerry keeps close behind another patron, then darts out, swings the CLEET face first into the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the CLEET draws his machine-pistol, Jerry slams his face once, twice into the wall. As the CLEET drops, Jerry makes eye contact with a woman who watches aghast.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't like his looks. Did you?

As she shakes her head "no," Jerry continues on his way.

INT. LIZA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
She's asleep. All seems peaceful. Then, low WHISPERING. It STOPS, STARTS again. Low, conspiratorial, cabalistic. Liza tosses, turns in her sleep. A shadow seems to pass over her. But as she wakes up, the WHISPERING FADES.

Liza sits up, a bit spooked. She cocks her head, listens. Was that a click in the other room. Unsure, she gets up, heads for the door.

Liza returns from the kitchen, something in her hand. Stepping to the door, she first checks to make sure it's locked. Then she balances an empty bottle upside down on the knob. She looks at it a second, shakes her head.

<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials. But they're all part of two warring factions. One: families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing. Stability. Group Two: the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex. They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business. When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.

Jerry looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Answer me. Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it? You've been following me around. Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me? That's not love, Jerry. It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.

Jerry starts to run. Liza starts after him, but she runs into a commuter, then another. Jerry's lost in the crowd.

The subway is about to leave. As Jerry gets on, Liza spots him. The doors close. The train rolls. She moves alongside, tries to get his attention, but he won't look over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUBWAY TRAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry finally looks back. He sees Liza an instant before entering the tunnel, then a row of white strobe lights on the tunnel wall. Jerry tries to blink them out as the sound of conspiratorial whispers fill the train. He looks about. It's all suddenly unreal. Certain passengers turn their heads, leer at him.

	What I'm about to tell you is partially documented. The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't. For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.

Liza eases her little cell phone out of her pocket.

	There's a fraternity of secrecy. And anyone trying to expose it is labeled a hopeless paranoid.

<JERRY>

	But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else. So I started watching your father. I wanted to keep him safe.

</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
There's a sincerity in Jerry's voice that's hard to ignore.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone else might call it stalking. My dad felt it. He started carrying a gun.

<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

	He showed me. I visited a few times. Then one of Jonas's guys visited. When I arrived, your dad was dying.

</JERRY>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walters was their fall guy. Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear. Don't you see? Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison. He was looking into getting him out. He didn't believe the official story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<LIZA>

	Why not?

<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you get the picture?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your father, he was dying. He was worried about you. He took your picture out to look at it. He called you his baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Liza starts to softly cry.

<JERRY>

	Wait a minute --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
CLEET #1 shoves her back. Jerry dips, drives his shoulder into CLEET #1's back. He looks back over his shoulder at Liza. Not worried about himself.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
The CLEETs pound him. The chopper touches down, the door thrown open. As Wilson gets off, Jerry is hustled past him and onboard.
</DIRECTION>
<WILSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Liza, are you alright?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILSON>
<DIRECTION>
Wilson looks back as the CHOPPER MOTOR REVS, the skids lift off the ground. In the doorway, Jonas waves goodbye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter rises -- revealing CLEET #5, Clark and Piper standing beyond. They hold 9mms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As CLEET #5 SHOOTS Wilson TWICE in the chest, Liza turns and runs for the house. They FIRE at her, then give chase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HELICOPTER - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry struggles. Jammed into a corner, he watches after Liza, his face pressed against the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<JONAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've embarrassed me, Jerry. You've made certain people take notice of me who shouldn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONAS>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry's not listening. He only has eyes for Liza. Down below, her legs churn her toward the house.
</DIRECTION>
<JONAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've arranged for you to take the blame. Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.

	<DIALOGUE>

<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(chokes it out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've never seen her run.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Liza disappears as darkness swallows the scene. Helpless, hopeless, Jerry pounds his forehead against the glass. Jonas watches, amused, till Jerry finds the strength to lunge at him. As Jerry's driven down to the deck...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liza turns the corner, runs alongside with CLEET #5 closing. Liza throws a look back over her shoulder then ahead. The rotten planking covering the well looms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liza skirts one side, but CLEET #5 steps right into the middle of it. CRASH! As he disappears down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CORRAL FENCE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liza runs. As Clark closes, she jerks back the gate to the hot walker, continues as the aluminum bar catches Clark in the teeth. As he drops...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FURTHER BACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Piper steadies his aim on the fence, sites through a scope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INFRARED POV - LIZA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Running away FROM us, but an easy target.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PIPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Confident, his finger squeezes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INFRARED POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Liza is suddenly blotted out by a big green shape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mouth smashed, he's gotten up on shaky legs, only to have the back of his head blown off by Piper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Piper doesn't get a second chance as Liza disappears from view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LIZA'S FATHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liza hits the front steps. In stride, she picks up a porch CHAIR, flings it THROUGH a PICTURE WINDOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Piper follows behind as she enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark. Much to Liza's advantage. She makes it to the hall as Piper trips over a hammock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liza pulls open the drawer of the hall table, fishes out a .38, turns just as Piper turns the corner. Caught by surprise, he goes down as Liza FIRES all SIX ROUNDS. She HITS another SIX EMPTY CHAMBERS before she stops pulling the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LIZA'S FATHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Reloading, Liza looks out through the broken window. It's quiet. Peaceful even. The helicopter is gone. Just the CRICKETS. She disappears back inside.

INT. 12TH FLOOR - ELEVATORS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors open. Lowry, Liza, six "FBI" agents and a building SECURITY GUARD step off. Badges on jackets, MOVE WITH them as they stride the hallway with purpose. Suite 1203. I.F.M.A. Lowry and Liza wait impatiently as the Guard keys the door. Guns drawn, they burst in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INTERNATIONAL FUND FOR MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS - NIGHT

Stop short. The place is empty.

The dividing walls are even missing. The only thing that's here are some ladders, tarps and painting materials. Liza is stunned.

JERRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Strapped to a metal chair in front of blinding white lights. Only now, it's really happening. Jonas steps over, an electrode in either hand. Jerry's chin is down on his chest. He's already been through the ringer.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Monkey finger. Shoot Coca-Cola.

Gently, Jonas slides one of the electrodes under his chin and lifts his head.

</JONAS>
<JERRY>

Jerry squeezes his eyes shut. As tears roll down his cheeks, Jonas fires up the juice.

OVER the CRACKLE of ELECTRICAL CURRENT, the strap snaps taut as Jerry tries to reach through the ceiling for the moon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DECREPIT HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sink and dirty mattress on the floor. Two CLEETs drag in Jerry. Unconscious, he's dumped on the floor by a narrow heating duct. They leave, lock the door behind them. Jerry doesn't move, doesn't make a sound. A rag doll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DECREPIT HOSPITAL - DARKENED WINDOW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the sounds of the CITY, but it's impossible to tell where we are. Practically a show, Jonas stares out the window. A CLEET appears vaguely over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEET>

<LIZA>

	I'm going to find Jerry. I'm -- Who are you? One of them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
Liza looks ready to pull the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<LOWRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.

</LOWRY>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Jonas?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>

<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to find him. Because he'd find me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<LOWRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't go home. And don't go to work. Either one could be bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOWRY>
<LIZA>

<LOWRY>

<LIZA>

</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
She coldcocks him, the .38 across the back of the head. As Lowry goes down, Liza heads for the stairwell. As she disappears, Lowry gets up, clutching the back of his head. She should have double-checked.

INT. JERRY'S BUILDING - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ready for anything, .38 in one hand and a flashlight in the other, Liza walks the hall. She stops at a door draped with Arson Investigation Site tape. She wrenches down a nailed 2x4, steps between the others. Enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOWNSTAIRS APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liza closes the door behind her, shines the light. Debris has fallen through a hole in the ceiling. Liza steps through the rubble to the Wonderwall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sooty, singed, partially curled at the edges of the paper it was done on. Liza shines the light. She's as taken with it now as the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The more she stares at it the more frustrating it becomes. Fighting back tears, growling back her anger, Liza grabs a corner and tears, then tears again, trying to destroy this thing which affects her so.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she's done, the Wonderwall hangs in tatters. And as Liza tries to get a hold of herself, she realizes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a second painting behind the first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liza pulls down the tatters of brown butcher paper which made the first. The second is the POV of a room. In fact, it's entitled: "In My Room." In the b.g., a window. F.g., a sinister chair with straps, hooks and other exaggerated apparatus for keeping someone sitting there. Discarded, macabre syringes litter the floor. A flashing light partially obscures a face reflected in a mirror. Jonas?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The whole effect is unnerving, but tells Liza nothing more. Until... she takes a second look at the window. It's blocked by three red-and-white-striped bars. As Liza runs her hand over them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. QUEENSBORO BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liza pulls her BMW over to the side, gets out and goes to the rail. She stares across at the three red-and-white smokestacks of the Con-Ed plant. The view through the window in Jerry's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liza scans the riverfront buildings on Roosevelt Island across from the plant. There are only a few that would match and one stands out from the rest...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT (LATE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few lights burn, all on one half of the building. A security board at the desk, the doors are chained and padlocked shut. Liza stops across from a brass inlaid letters which identify it as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Germaine O. Nicols Mental ospital."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "H" is missing from "Hospital." Liza is about to continue when... enlightenment! Running her hand along, she alters the letters, blacking some of them out:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Germaine O. Nicols Mental ospital."

<DIRECTION>
The cook grumbles by. Liza ducks behind a dishwasher, looks across at a roach. As it twitches an antenna...

INT. MENTAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A nurse disappears, turning around a corner. Liza pads her way along. Looks into a room.

Three middle-aged men asleep on their backs, mouths agape, sleep obviously no release.

She turns right into an ORDERLY. Standing square, hands on his hips.

Collecting herself, she reaches into her pocket for her ID.

Liza starts down the hall with the Orderly following.

<ORDERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got some new patients last week. You want to see them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORDERLY>

Liza waves them off. It's hopeless. She stops at a chicken-wired window at the end of the hall, looks out. Light's about to break and Jerry's out there somewhere.
</DIRECTION>
<ORDERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I gotta get back to work.

GALVANIZED DOOR

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CLEET on patrol. He passes a doorway into an abandoned room. As he turns a corner, Liza steps out of the room, continues the opposite way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DECREPIT HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His feet braced against the wall, Jerry pulls on a PIPE under the sink. It GROANS, CREAKS, and then SNAPS. Water geysers up. Jerry sputters out of the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DECREPIT STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liza makes her way down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DECREPIT HALLWAY TWO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CLEET GUARD outside a door. He looks down as water pools at his feet. Turning, he sees it runs from under the door. There's a 5x5-inch window on the door, but the view is blocked by a hard, white surface. The Guard raps the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on there?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off no answer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the water coming from?

</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DECREPIT HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry holds a toilet lid over the glass. Another RAP.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Answer me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
The BOLTS BEING SLID BACK. Jerry stumbles as the door is pushed open. The Guard enters, leading with his 9mm.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had to see for yourself, didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
(re: sink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd you think that was going to get you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
The Guard is unaware that Liza has appeared in the doorway behind him. Jerry smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right where we are now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
The Guard steps forward to let Jerry have it. He freezes at the HAMMER CLICKING back on the .38.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
Cursing himself, the Guard lets the 9mm slip to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn around.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Guard turns. As he does, Jerry raises the toilet lid, cracks it down over the top of the Guard's head. The exertion sends Jerry sprawling, as well. He looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what do you think? Is something going on here or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DECREPIT HALLWAY TWO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry (armed with the 9mm) and Liza exit. Liza slides the bolts back on the door. Footsteps and voices ahead. Jerry leans on Liza as they start their escape in the opposite direction. They've just disappeared around one corner when Jonas and CLEETS #3 and #4 appear around the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<JONAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the guard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONAS>
<DIRECTION>
Slipping in the water, the CLEETS hurry forward. One of them looks through the window, scowls as the second unbolts the door. As Jonas sees the unconscious Guard and the toilet lid, he does not look happy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GERMAINE O. NICOLS MENTAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man approaches from one end of the sidewalk. Flip, the black owner of the newsstand Jerry frequents. No longer wheelchair-bound. As he converges with Agent Lowry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ENTRY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The old security guard watches a little TV.
</DIRECTION>
<TV_ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The President had left the area only moments earlier and is currently in Germany. Again, the quake in Southern Turkey measured seven-point-three on the Richter scale. Thousands are feared missing or dead...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TV_ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up as from outside, Lowry shoulders back the door, exposing the chain. Flip cuts through it with a portable torch. Lowery bursts through, passing the sputtering old security guard. The whole entry takes about two seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INTERSECTING HALLWAYS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry and Liza make their way along. Ahead, a CLEET crossing the intersection. SHOTS are exchanged. Liza and Jerry hug the wall, move back the way they came. As the CLEET gets on his headset, they duck down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EAST HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry, who knows where he's going, motions Liza ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Only a few steps and another CLEET ahead. More SHOTS FIRED and they duck down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUTH HALLWAYS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry takes Liza's hand and they run. Left here. Right there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EAST HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flip and Lowry, infiltrate. They exchange FIRE with a CLEET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERSECTING HALLWAYS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GUNFIRE is DISTANT here. Jonas gets the report from CLEET #4, who gets it over his headset.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEET_4>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's somewhere on the south side of the wing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEET_4>
<JONAS>
<DIRECTION>
(thinks a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know where he's going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONAS>
<DIRECTION>
Jonas strides away, CLEETS #4 and #3 hurrying to keep up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALCOVE/DEAD-END HALLWAY - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the end, a narrow alcove to the left.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a dead end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
A 2-foot by 2-foot sliding door on the wall. Padlocked. Jerry aims, SHOOTS the lock off. He opens the door to reveal a dumbwaiter.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I spent two years here. This used to bring the med-cart. Demerol. Phenobarb. It's Jacob's Ladder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry hits a button on the wall. Nothing. No power. Liza looks back over her shoulder at distant gunfire.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something's going on back there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! She spins as Jerry FIRES into the wall. He tears plaster back in huge chunks to reveal the dumbwaiter mechanism. A looped bicycle chain, running over teeth on a motor below and disappearing up a shaft above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He kicks the bottom loop off the motor.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in. I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get up there and we'll get it back down here for me. Now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Liza thinks a beat, then nods and climbs inside.
</DIRECTION>
<JONAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jerry, you continually amaze me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONAS>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry and Liza freeze. The voice is close. Liza starts to climb out, but Jerry holds her back, whispers.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Geronimo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
He shoves her back, hauls down on the chain. The dumbwaiter starts up.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Geronimo is down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's up. Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry hauls down again. Liza disappears from view. He clutches his side in pain. Then he hauls again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAD END HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLEETS #3 and #4 advance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUMBWAITER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
jerking upwards. Liza despairing.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jerry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
ALCOVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry hauls harder. Faster. Hand over fist. Determined to get Liza out of there.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too good to be true. Last thing I do. Like life pounding eggs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Up, up, up, the dumbwaiter goes. Finally, it won't go any further. It's out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAD END HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLEETs #3 and #4 move up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUMBWAITER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door won't budge. Liza leans back, FIRES a ROUND at where she guesses the lock should be. She throws the door up. The 4th floor. As she squeezes out...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALCOVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry holds the chain with one hand, FIRES through it with the 9MM. A tug and 60 feet of chain spools down at his feet. Liza's away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jerry smiles, CLEETs #3 and #4 appear behind him, each FIRING once into his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
4TH FLOOR - LIZA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reacting to the shots. Appalled at what must be happening.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jerry!

ALCOVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry hears her call, closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Liza...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry drops his gun, corkscrews down into a broken heap. His eyes flutter up as Jonas looms over him.
</DIRECTION>
<JONAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A patient man can accomplish anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONAS>
<DIRECTION>
4TH FLOOR - LIZA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liza runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAD END HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLEETs #3 and #4 turn as Lowry and Flip approach. As they head down to the end of the hall, Jerry's eyes flicker to the 9MM. As his hand inches that way...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STAIRWELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liza runs, possessed. Only this time she's running to something and not away. She stumbles, slams into the wall at the landing, continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAD END HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonas starts back for Jerry, stops short as he sees him, still on the ground, pointing the 9MM at him. CLICK. Jerry's out of ammo. Jonas continues toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1ST FLOOR HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liza comes off the stairwell. Runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CONNECTING HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLEET #3 goes down, SHOT by Lowry. #4 makes a dash for it, is pursued by Flip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAD END HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry, spitting blood, waits as Jonas calmly sets the barrel of his gun against Jerry's forehead. The coup de grace is imminent. Jerry's ready for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIZA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lungs ready to burst. She hurdles #3's body, turns the corner, screaming as she raises her father's gun.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
Jonas looks back over his shoulder just in time for a bullet to drill his forehead above his left eye. He's dead before he hits the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Liza is at Jerry's side. One look and she knows it isn't good.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help! Somebody help me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
He just looks up at her as she cradles his head.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't die on me, Jerry. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't promise you anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
She cries at the allusion, takes his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Top pocket... Go on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Liza reaches in, pulls out one of the "new" $100 bills. It's bloodstained.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember when you gave me that? A hundred dollar bill to get lost?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(re: bill)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it. My lucky charm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
As a tear rolls down Liza's cheek...
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They changed Franklin's portrait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think it's a conspiracy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Liza looks at the bill a moment, shakes her head, then:
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fred Mertz. It's Fred Mertz.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry smiles. Liza smiles back. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(almost apologetic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know why I love you. But I know that I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Liza lowers her head, her heart stripped bare.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(a sigh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now she tells me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Overwhelmed, Jerry squeezes his eyes shut. Liza turns back as Agent Lowry appears.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
(desolate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help him. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOSPITAL - AMBULANCE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A madhouse. Police arriving in droves. Jerry in the back of the ambulance. Liza watches, horrified, as his body jerks as they defibrillate him. The back doors close.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! Wait for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
She's restrained by Flip and Agent Lowry, tries to fight past them as the ambulance pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Overwhelmed, Liza collapses. As they hold her up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful day. Maybe not a bad place to end up after all. We COME UPON a particular stone, freshly turned earth on the grave. Jerry Fletcher. He didn't make it. Liza stands here all alone. Paying her last respects.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got away, Jerry. They'll never find you now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes well up with tears. Liza fights it off.

<LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
(deep breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get a hold of yourself, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZA>
<DIRECTION>
One last moment and then she turns and walks away. As she moves, the sound of FOOTSTEPS. On the FLOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

INT. STERILE HALLWAY (SOMEWHERE) - DAY

Agent Lowry strides down the hall, full of purpose. At an intersection, he's joined by Flip. The two of them continue, without speaking, to a door. They enter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STERILE ROOM (SOMEWHERE) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His chest bandaged, tubes running in and out, Jerry looks up as Lowry and Flip enter. He's weak, but very much alive. They look at him. He looks back as defiantly as his situation will allow.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flip. Howard Hughes gave you your legs back.

Flip doesn't even crack a smile.

</JERRY>
<LOWRY>

	Not to mention the fact that everyone thinks you're dead.

Jerry stares back. That may be the truth.

	I'll do it. On one condition. I want to make sure she's okay.

	We got someone watching her 24 hours a day. She --

EXT. OX RIDGE HUNT CLUB (CONNECTICUT) - DAY

<DIRECTION>
INT. OX RIDGE HUNT CLUB - BARN - DAY

Liza moves along the well-maintained stalls. One particular HORSE WHINNIES excitedly as she approaches. Liza stops to look him over.

<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	J.D., I'm back. If you'll have me.

The horse has to be the fabled Johnny Dancer. Their moment is broken up by a rough-looking GROOM.

Liza reaches into her jeans pocket, pulls out her trademark denomination: a $100 bill. But something hesitates inside her. She rubs her thumb over Franklin: Rosie O'Donnel or Fred Mertz? She pockets the bill, looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you help me out? Please.
	</DIALOGUE>

Liza gallops out into the sun. Feeling it, remembering, realizing just how much she missed this. But now she has it again. A gift.

Head back, she holds her arms out in hope and faith, very much like the painting on Jerry's Wonderwall.
