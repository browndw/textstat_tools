The screen is a microcosm of leaf, crystal drops of precipitation, a stone, emerald green moss. It's a landscape in miniature. We HEAR the forest. Some distant birds. Their sound seems to reverberate as if in a cavern. A piece of sunlight refracts within the drops of water, paints a patch of moss yellow. The whisper of wind is joined by another sound that mixes with it. A distant rustling. It gets closer and louder. It's shallow breathing. It gets ominous. We're interlopers on the floor of the forest and something is coming.

The girth of the trees is huge. Shafts of light illuminate motes of dust and turn leaves emerald where the sun breaks through. Sometimes there's ferns; rhododendron, sometimes pale grass and outcroppings of rock. These men run the forest streams, over boulders, fallen trees and down into ravines as if they own them. They do.

A long rifle in which is carved the name "Killdeer" is in his right fist. Indian tattooing on his chest. His name is NATHANIEL POE. He's a few years older than Uncas. The French and the French-speaking tribes know him as La Longue Carabine (Long Rifle). Other frontiersmen in New York colony and the Iroquois and Delaware-speaking tribes know him as Hawkeye. Sweat stains his shirt. He flashes through the tree branches disturbing nothing. Making no sound.

Captain Jack is standing on a box. Some women and kids mill around some tables and boards laid over barrels. Cooking fires. Smoke. Most but not all around Captain Jack are men, nine settlers, 3 hunter/trappers, eight Mohawk farmers in mixed European and native clothing. Off to the side are an English Lieutenant on horseback and a ten-man escort from whatever regiment's in Albany. A man named HENRI speaks in French. His son, MARTIN, translates.

These people are English, Scots-Irish and Dutch farmers; some French Huguenot "mechanics" (craftsmen). They're in shirt-sleeves and Indian moccasins & leggings. The Mohawks' vast lands and corn agriculture border the settlement. They 've been acculturated for over a hundred years. Some wear European calico hunting shirts. Their heads are shaved to scalping locks and many are tattooed. They've politically and commercially played France & England against each other very adroitly for over a hundred years because of their military power and geographic position. Their relations with working farmers and settlers and their families has been mostly one of co-existence because there's always been more than enough for all. This is a WPA mural of ethnic diversity and plurality of frontier America. The Europeans are former indentured laborers, farmers exiled by economics or religious persecution, frontier hunters and trappers ... working people.

Webb's Adjutants laugh uproariously at his wit. Heyward's stiff, perfunctory smile. He's been made the butt of the joke. He does not share Webb's derisive view of the French. Webb doesn't like Heyward's manner. We don't like Webb. Then:

A vegetable plot behind the Poltroon's house is a provincial substitute for a formal garden setting. Heyward and Cora sit on rough wooden chairs. Wind blows. In the background a servant hangs laundry. The white sheets billow. A table holds a tea setting. They're sitting close to each other, talking seriously and quietly. Duncan's jacket is removed. Time's passed. Long pause. Then:

Hawkeye throws Heyward a musket. Cora & Alice look towards Heyward. He looks at them: the women are totally terrified and do not move.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWKEYE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we are goin' to take you, we need to move. Fast ... And the fort is well off our course. So if you all rather wait for the next Huron war party to come by, we'll be on our way.

walking through a creek, stepping in the stream bed instead of on stones. The others follow. Hawkeye looks at Heyward.

	Yengeese no good in woods. Make more noise, I kill him.

Heyward spins. Hawkeye coolly watches Cora. Her attitude is hostile; aligned with Heyward. He turns away. Meanwhile ...
</DIRECTION>

UNCAS

stops, alarmed. Something in the air bothers him. Hawkeye smells it, too.

EXTERIOR FOREST, TREE LINE - GREEN BRANCHES - DAY

After we HOLD, we realize Chingachgook's been there all along. Hawkeye and Uncas join him where the branches meet the ground. Smoke drifts through the trees. Hawkeye sees and dips his head, then looks again ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR CAMERON CABIN - WIDE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burned, smoldering, having fallen in on itself. TRACK LEFT past what was the doorway. A dead child's hand protruding from the ruin. A fragment of a dress. Charred and smoldering wood. John Cameron's body in the wreckage. And then, through the collapsed posts and timbers, Hawkeye, Chingachgook and Uncas have advanced and are seeing what we've just seen; and then Cora and Alice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
approaches and is frozen in horror. Cora shields her from the sight. Cora is affected but confronts it directly.
</DIRECTION>
<HEYWARD>

	Anything to be done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEYWARD>

UNCAS

	All dead ...

HAWKEYE

	Movin' fast, not able to carry much ... this was a war party?

Chingachgook nods confirmation and indicates a direction in Mohican. The significance is very ominous to them. We don't know why yet. Chingachgook starts away ...
</DIRECTION>
<HEYWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let us look after them ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEYWARD>
<DIRECTION>
He starts approaching the bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<CHINGACHGOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>

Heyward stops. Hawkeye and Uncas follow Chingachgook, leaving the cabin.

	Let us go, miss.

<CORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference.

Hawkeye turns back and rapidly approaches her. She takes a step back, fearful.

	They are not strangers .... And they stay as they lay ...!

</HAWKEYE>
<DIRECTION>
CORA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
realizes Hawkeye knew these people and is deeply affected. She also realizes for the first time this is a whole new world with dynamics and complexities, behavior and rhythms she doesn't understand. He turns away from her and walks on. She hesitates a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE ON THE SMALL CLEARING IN FRONT OF THE FARMHOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Chingachgook and Hawkeye, extremely alert and cradling their cocked flintlocks, walk to camera, eyes sweeping the forest perimeter; they're followed by Cora, Heyward helping Alice and Uncas as rearguard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ruined cabin and the dead dream of a family smolders behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR GLADE - PROFILE: HAWKEYE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
moves through to where the trees seem sparse and are unnaturally white birch and some thin grass grows. The land rises into a mound. Chingachgook and the others avoid stepping on the grass and cross to the other side of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHINGACHGOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
mutters something to Uncas. He nods and disappears amongst the white birch, soundlessly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAWKEYE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
throws Heyward a blanket. Heyward spreads the blanket below the top of the mound and - maintaining silence - he gestures for Cora & Alice to rest there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE'S HEAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hits the blanket. She curls into a fetal position and she's out. Heyward is nearby on watch. Hawkeye has taken a position two-thirds of the way around the crescent shaped mound. Cora has sought him out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAWKEYE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
doesn't react as Cora enters. He's scanning the trees; not looking at her. They whisper ...
</DIRECTION>
<CORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you bury those people?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>
<HAWKEYE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWKEYE>
<CORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You knew them.

</CORA>
<DIRECTION>
Hawkeye looks at her and nods.
</DIRECTION>
<CORA>
<DIRECTION>
(stiffly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>
<HAWKEYE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well that is to be expected. My father ...

</HAWKEYE>
<CORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your "father"?

</CORA>
<HAWKEYE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWKEYE>
<CORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He did?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>
<HAWKEYE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. He said ... "do not try to make them understand you."
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWKEYE>
<CORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>
<HAWKEYE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. And "do not try to understand them. That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense ..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWKEYE>
<DIRECTION>
Cora's indignation is cut off because ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNCAS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
moving fast. He gestures back the way he came and it means they're in jeopardy. Uncas disappears around the mound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR BIRCH FOREST - TREES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing. Imperceptibly we move closer and start to see shapes blocking out part of the white birch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RED-PAINTED FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
white eyes. A ruff of red hair stands straight up at the back of the large man's head. Slit and monstrously elongated earlobes are weighted with silver. He's followed by others. Wary, silently, they hunt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEEPER: MORE OTTAWA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Towards the rear are two French Rangers ("Coureurs des Bois") from Le Regiment de la Sarre. They're bearded, dirty, dressed Indian-style in moccasins, leggings and breechcloths with hooded hunting shirts. There's nothing clumsy about them. They're the 18th century version of Special Forces who've gone indigenous. If they and the Ottawa find our people, it's all over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
seeing the red-painted Ottawa approach, starts to panic. Her hyperventilating and involuntary small sounds of fear will reveal their position. A hand covers her mouth and silences her struggling. WIDEN. It's Uncas. His other arm is around her, holding her, looking towards the advancing Ottawa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAWKEYE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
on his back, his tomahawk within reach on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OTTAWA & FRENCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
are fifty yards away from the crescent mound behind which lie our people. Mist envelops them ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHINGACHGOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His massive arms spread revealing his war club in his left fist; his fusil in his right hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAWKEYE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
waiting for the attack. Cora's eyes are anxious, but there's no terror there. Nathaniel's impressed with her cool. He hands her a pistol. She takes it. He listens for the soft drop of moccasined feet ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OTTAWA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
through the grass. Thirty feet away they stop. They're motionless. Then their leader gestures and they start backing out. The French Rangers continue towards the crescent. The Ottawa chief takes one's arm and stops him. The French Ranger whispers something inaudible. The Ottawa chief shakes his head, "Non. Pas possible ..." And means it. They retreat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEPERATE SHOTS: HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, CORA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
tensely monitor the Ottawa retreat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNCAS & ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slowly removes his hand from her mouth. She's a little shy, then she looks up, catches his eyes. Then she averts her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHINGACHGOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sees all of it; doesn't like it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAWKEYE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ottawa are gone.

<CORA>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did they turn back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>
<DIRECTION>
In answer Hawkeye looks behind & above her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
turns and makes out stilt platforms of skeletons and torn strips of buckskin silhouetted against the night sky in the distance. They have camped on sanctified ground, a burial place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORA & HAWKEYE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She thinks it would be a mistake to ever underestimate the skill of these men or the danger & complexity of this place. She hands the pistol back to him. Their hands almost touch.
</DIRECTION>
<CORA>
<DIRECTION>
(still pissed off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"We're a breed apart and we make no sense" ...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>
<HAWKEYE>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance ...

</HAWKEYE>
<CORA>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you so much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>
<DIRECTION>
Cora is angry. Hawkeye, staring at the trees, glances at her. She settles, looking at him. Her mood changes. Then ...
</DIRECTION>
<CORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You called Chingachgook your "father"? Where is your real family?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>
<DIRECTION>
Hawkeye's surprised by her question.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWKEYE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWKEYE>
<CORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>

<HAWKEYE>

</HAWKEYE>
<CORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you learn English?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>
<HAWKEYE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds ... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWKEYE>
<CORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>
<HAWKEYE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWKEYE>
<CORA>

	In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why were those people living in this defenseless place ...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>
<HAWKEYE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. So after seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's leave ... Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWKEYE>
<DIRECTION>
Cora sees the slate grey clouds and, in between, the fields of stars. She looks at Hawkeye; then again up at the night sky.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWKEYE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father's people say ... at the birth of the sun and of his brother, the moon, their mother died ... so the sun gave to the earth her body, from which was to spring all life. And he drew forth from her breast the stars. The stars he threw into the night sky to remind him of her soul.
	</DIALOGUE>

	So there is the Camerons' monument ... my folks', too, I guess.

pensive. Hawkeye's watching her. Her reaction is enigmatic. After a pause ...
</DIRECTION>
<CORA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London ...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... than any imagining could possibly have been ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>

She closes her eyes, turns slightly and prepares to sleep. Hawkeye is the one left staring into the birch forest, a little surprised. Some of his assumptions about her were wrong ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR FOREST - WIDE - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deep fog has set in. A hand entering the frame scares the hell out of us. It moves a branch aside. It's Uncas. Spread to the right is Chingachgook, far to the left is Hawkeye. They hike up a steep forested slope in the heart of the Adirondacks.
</DIRECTION>
<CORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Much further?

<DIRECTION>
Heyward looks at her. She's not kidding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE: HEYWARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
helps Alice. As he does, he stares at Cora's seperation and now her proximity to Hawkeye, who's walking on ahead, is something Heyward doesn't like. His dark thoughts are distracted by a FLASH of light and more ROLLING THUNDER.

<DIRECTION>
WIDE FROM THE FRONT - HAWKEYE

A new artillery duel erupts. The action is to the west side of the fort. On the north, the fire fight is reflected on the black water of Lake George in our foreground. Then a dark shape wiping to the right cuts off those reflections. We see in silhouette the outline of a birch canoe moving silently, barely rippling the mirrored surface of the lake.

Behind them is black water. Its surface is broken by the rising mass of Chingachgook, followed by Uncas and Hawkeye. Muzzle flashes from the cannon reveal the canoe and the forms of the girls further out. Chingachgook's war club is held low. The Huron senses and turns and Hawkeye's thrown tomahawk knocks him back. Hawkeye's knife flashes in the night. Chingachgook drives the war club up, smashing a Canadien onto the debris. The second Canadien jabs bayonet at Uncas, slashing his side. Uncas jerks him forward by the musket, folds him over and tomahawks him.

Hawkeye takes Cora's hand. Cora is awakening to a new spirit, a new wind blowing through a new land, a new self-determination ... She's drawn to this rough yet graceful man with his direct manner. Hawkeye settles against a wall. She leans next to him. Their shoulders touch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORA

To her everything about him seems to be somehow right. She's discovered that the passions and outrage that move him, move her ... And her readiness to give herself to what stirs the deepest resonances of her soul is the same as his.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAWKEYE
</DIRECTION>

looks at her. She's beautiful in the firelight. Cora's eyes find his and she folds into his arms. His lips find hers and tears stream down her face. She's suffused with an elation she can't explain.

Sachem gestures with his hand to Magua. Magua reluctantly stops advancing on Hawkeye. Heyward's French translation has faded to a murmur. We hear Hawkeye's English.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron.

Sachem reacts.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGUA>

(laughs)

	It made our French father happy to never have to fight the same Yengeese again. He told me this without telling me this.

</MAGUA>
<DIRECTION>
Hawkeye realizes this is true.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWKEYE>

	So the Huron are the servants of the French? To do what the French are shamed to do?

</HAWKEYE>
<MAGUA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Sachem)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one ... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.

<HAWKEYE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man? Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Like Francais Black Robes do? Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But sell the fur to the white man for gold? ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Sachem)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs? ... Magua's heart is twisted. He would make himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs? ... Magua's way is false. It is like the white sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness and shame. Is there another way? I don't know.

Cora is jerked forward by three Hurons. Magua grabs Alice. Cora strikes at Magua. He knocks her aside. Chaos & confusion. Meanwhile:

Those Hurons who hear, do so in deadly, boding silence. Magua and his fourteen hard core braves start out as ...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEYWARD

MAGUA

running forward past Five, confronts Uncas head on. It's incredibly fast.

UNCAS'

three tomahawk swings are dodged by Magua whose own knife streaks like silver flashes. Uncas, gashed on arms and chest, feints right and slams Magua with an open hand, closes and the men are intertwined steel and muscle ... and Magua throws Uncas. Going with him and rolling off Uncas, Magua's knife flashes into his armpit. Uncas' right arm is useless. He scrambles up. Next to the expertise of a mature warrior like Magua, Uncas' raw, young determination may not be enough.
