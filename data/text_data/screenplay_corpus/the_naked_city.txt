INT. DONAHUE'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAPTAIN SAM DONAHUE is at his desk, looking at a folder. He is a husky man of sixty with a wide, pleasant smile and an intelligent face. Seated in a chair nearby is Lieutenant Dan Mulvey, whom we saw, earlier, at breakfast. He is a short, middle-aged man, who might pass for a bookkeeper. His speech contains a bit of Irish and a lot of Brooklyn. He is smoking a pipe. He has a second folder in his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is nothing in the manner, dress or speech of either man to suggest the accepted notion of policeman or detective.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large office with several desks and chairs behind a wooden railing. Through an open door can be seen some of the cots of the dormitory where men on night duty sleep. On a bench talking to Ben Miller is Detective James Halloran, the tall, pleasant-looking young man whom we saw saying good-bye earlier to his wife. Mulvey takes his hat off a hat rack. He comes up behind the bench and pauses a foot away to listen to Halloran, who is talking seriously, with great interest in what he's saying.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLORAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	An investigation for murder is under way now in the city of New York. It will advance methodically, by trial and error, by leg and brain work, by asking a thousand questions to get one answer. Ever look for a needle in a dark house? You can find it -- if you're patient enough. Just get down on your knees, examine every inch of every floor of every room -- and you'll find it. The Homicide Squad, my friends, is made up of patient men. Ever work a jigsaw puzzle? Ever try to find a murderer? Ever play button-button?

Druggist disappears for an instant, returns with his prescription book, turns the pages until he finds the Dexter prescription.

as they enter. Rhumba music is coming over the radio. MRS. HYLTON is sitting by the radio, her head cocked to one side, listening to the music with obvious delight. She gestures for them to come in but continues to listen to the music, which is approaching the end of a tune. One foot is tapping out the rhythm. Mulvey and Halloran exchange amused glances, wait. The music ends, Mrs. Hylton switches off the radio, then jumps up and comes toward them, beaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is a woman in her late forties, no more than five feet tall, very slim, bright-eyed. Her speech, her gestures, her walk, are all very quick, vigorous; she is as close to being a hummingbird as any woman can be. She is dressed in an attractive, expensive house-coat and is wearing diamond rings on both hands, a diamond bracelet, a diamond clip in her grey hair.

Perelli leaves. Mulvey beckons to Halloran. He and Ruth get out of the car as Mulvey pays hackie. They start across the street, on the diagonal, toward the corner apartment house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT HOUSE CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulvey, Halloran, Ruth stop at a door. A spill of light underneath. Halloran rings the bell. They wait. He rings the bell again. They wait.
</DIRECTION>
<MULVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(calling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Niles!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVEY>

There is no reply. Mulvey takes the key out of his pocket. Halloran takes out his gun.

<DIRECTION>
INT. NILES APARTMENT - NIGHT

as Halloran, Mulvey, with Ruth following, burst in. Niles is on the floor, unconscious. A chair is overturned, the contents of a suitcase are strewn all over a divan.

<MULVEY>

	The window!

</MULVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Halloran races across the room to an open window, climbs out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Halloran jumps out, looks down. Four stories below he sees a shadowy, bulky figure, racing down. The sound of pounding feet on the iron grid work comes up. Halloran snaps up his gun, leans out, shoots. There is an instant metallic ping as the bullet hits the fire escape somewhere down below, then ricochets with a shattering of glass through a window in the house. Halloran starts to run down as a yell comes from below. Above the pounding of Halloran's feet we hear an angry man's voice.

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

We see the two running figures from the sidewalk below. Halloran is now at the fifth floor; the man escaping is just at the edge of the ladder which forms the last section of fire escape. He swings down onto it; it slides down to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARZA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
face bathed in sweat, eyes gleaming, chest heaving. He fires twice at Halloran; the bullets slam into the grid work, ricochet. Garza starts to run out of the alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARZA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
from Halloran's POV. Halloran stops running, leans out, shoots. Garza keeps running, disappears into alley. Halloran runs again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HALLORAN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seen from below. Lights are going on all over the house. There is a babble of talk and shouts. Halloran comes to the last section. He swings with it to the pavement. He runs down the alley out into the deserted street. As he looks down one way a voice yells to him. It is from a man in pajamas in the window of a house opposite.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>

Halloran runs around the corner. At the opposite corner is a subway entrance. He pounds down the street, runs down the subway steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM (SHOOTING UP) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Halloran leaps down the last few stairs, gun in hand. CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he vaults over the turnstiles. A train is pulling out of the station. The platform is deserted except for two elderly women coming out of the exit. They cling together, stare at Halloran in horror as he hurries through turnstile over to an elderly station attendant who has not moved out of his booth.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLORAN>
<DIRECTION>
(excitedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Police emergency! Is there any way of stopping that train at the next station -- keeping the doors locked?

<DIRECTION>
INT. NILES APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Niles is still on the floor, but there is a pillow under his head and his collar and tie have been opened. Ruth, on her knees, is bathing his face with a wet towel. A basin of water stands nearby. Mulvey is just crossing to the window as we hear shouts from the outside.

Niles says nothing. He is looking at Mulvey. Stoneman turns.
</DIRECTION>
<STONEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STONEMAN>
<MULVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lieutenant Mulvey of the Homicide Squad. Do you go by the name of Henderson?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly Stoneman seems to cave in.
</DIRECTION>
<STONEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STONEMAN>
<MULVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're under arrest for the murder of Jean Dexter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVEY>
<STONEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(with a low cry of horror)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! I couldn't do anything like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(swinging on Niles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If anyone did it, it was him!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(buries head in hands, sinks into chair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finished -- I'm finished now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STONEMAN>
<MULVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was your relationship to Niles and Dexter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVEY>
<STONEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(with a low cry of
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	shame, ripped from
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
his gut)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A lamb led to slaughter! An idiot robbed of self-respect, of manhood, of decency!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(half sobs; in a low voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I loved that girl the way a sick man loves alcohol or a narcotic. There was nothing right about it or good about it, only a sick hunger. I saw her a year ago in that dress shop. And from then on I was drunk with her, lost.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns on Niles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For six months now I've known they've been using me. I was their tipster -- me -- Stoneman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STONEMAN>
<MULVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVEY>
<STONEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't enough I poured money out on her. Jean was twisted inside, too, like me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with a bewildered cry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does life do to people that it can set up such unnatural hungers in them -- me for a woman like her -- and she for money?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gestures)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was a common thief.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at Niles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Both of them. They used my social connections. My wife is a partygiver. Jean'd find out from me who was to be there. And it was only after months that I realized that when someone came to my house, his apartment was robbed the same night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STONEMAN>
<MULVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you go to the police?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Stoneman gestures despairingly.
</DIRECTION>
<STONEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why doesn't a drug addict stop taking drugs? She kept promising me each time was the last. I believed her because I wanted to believe her. I believed her because I was afraid to go to the police -- afraid of the scandal. You can read about sick people like me in medical literature. Here I am. Look at me. I'm contemptible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STONEMAN>
<MULVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you arrange the robbery of your own apartment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVEY>
<STONEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I even came to that. I was frightened and I had to wallow in my own filth.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(jumps up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm so glad you came. Prison is much better than insanity -- and I'm half mad already.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with a groan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Stoneman, what have you become?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STONEMAN>
<MULVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What proof have you that you didn't kill Dexter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVEY>
<STONEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Proof?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(rubs hand over brow)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was someplace else -- Miss Owen -- my date book -- yes -- a birthday party -- at the Broughtons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STONEMAN>
<MULVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you testify in court that Niles and Dexter did these robberies?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVEY>
<NILES>
<DIRECTION>
(with a cry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never did!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NILES>
<MULVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVEY>
<STONEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, they were the fixers, the smart ones. They used me one way -- they hired other men for the actual robberies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STONEMAN>
<MULVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Stoneman rubs hand over brow.
</DIRECTION>
<STONEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Owen -- my practice -- Oh, don't cry...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(groans)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll call Dr. Grenard.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Mulvey -- beseechingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only don't let me have to see anyone... Not my wife... no friends... no lawyer. Just lock me up and hide me away.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly stiffens, looks around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me? Stoneman?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with a cry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's impossible. I won't have it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STONEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, with a distorted face, he hurtles himself across the room toward the large window that faces the city.
</DIRECTION>
<STONEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't have it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STONEMAN>
<MULVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grab him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Perelli and another officer make a lunge for Stoneman, but Niles is closest. Niles leaps for the doctor, tackling him just as the doctor hits the window pane. The glass is shattered, but the doctor -- a pitiful and forlorn figure -- is pulled back into a chair. He puts his head in his hands, sobs brokenly.
</DIRECTION>
<MULVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know much about medicine, doctor -- but I'm pretty sure that's one prescription never cured anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Niles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Niles. And as long as you finally made up your mind to cooperate, why not go all the way? You're not stupid. You're hooked now, and you know it. So why not spill the rest?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(quiet intensity)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who did the jobs for you? Who was it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVEY>
<DIRECTION>
There is a strained silence for a moment. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<NILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Willie Garza. He and Backalis. They wanted more of a cut from the robberies. Garza killed Jean; then later that night he killed Backalis.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(leans forward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I loved Jean. I didn't have anything to do with it. It was Garza... Garza... Garza...

INT. TENEMENT HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Halloran is walking up a flight of stairs. There is the SOUND of someone practicing scales on the violin. He reaches the landing, crosses to a door in the search for a number. As he leaves door we hear a voice from within:
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must practice more -- practice --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Halloran crosses to another door, listens, knocks. A deep, hearty voice answers.
</DIRECTION>
<GARZA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on in!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Halloran enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARZA'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cheaply furnished, two-room apartment. Garza is lying on the floor doing a wrestler's bridge by way of exercise. He is a very muscular man in fine condition. At the moment he is wearing only sneakers and tights. He swivels his head a little to one side to see who has come in, but he doesn't change his position. He has a face that combines toughness and shrewdness; he appears to be about thirty-five.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Throughout the scene we faintly hear the practicing of violin scales from the other apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<GARZA>
<DIRECTION>
(genially)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought it was the janitor for the rent. Who're you? Don't mind me. Just having a little work-out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA>
<DIRECTION>
As Garza says this, he swivels at the neck and turns his body and feet and head over, so that he is face down. His torso and legs have not touched the floor in the course of the stunt.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLORAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name's Hawkey -- I work up at Bellevue Hospital. Are you Willie Garza?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLORAN>
<GARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's me. Ever see me wrestle? I wasn't so bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(swivels body over)
</DIRECTION>
<HALLORAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I never did. There's a patient at the hospital gave me your address -- asked me to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLORAN>
<GARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA>
<DIRECTION>
He works his body up and down, exercising his abdominal muscles.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLORAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Backalis his name is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLORAN>
<DIRECTION>
Garza seems to pause for a second. Then he swivels over, face down.
</DIRECTION>
<GARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pete? What's he doin' in the hospital?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA>
<HALLORAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He almost got drowned. Fell in the river when he was plastered. Some guy on a tug boat fished him out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLORAN>
<GARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't say?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that Pete. Can't let the booze alone. So what does he want from me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(swivels around)
</DIRECTION>
<HALLORAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says he wants to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLORAN>
<GARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what he wants?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(lowers body to floor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA>
<DIRECTION>
Now Garza raises legs high, then does a snap up. He lands feet on floor.
</DIRECTION>
<GARZA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some condition I'm in, hey, brother?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(crosses to a chair for a towel)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't smoke, don't drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(rubs body with towel)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Pete wants money again?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes head... coming closer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what you can tell him, buddy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA>
<DIRECTION>
Now, from several feet away, Garza suddenly leaps like a cat. The heavy Turkish towel goes over Halloran's head. Garza grabs him, trips him, slams him savagely to the floor. In another second his legs have scissored over Halloran's and one hand holds Halloran's arm in a hammer lock.
</DIRECTION>
<GARZA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lay still or I'll snap your arm like a wishbone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA>
<DIRECTION>
His free hand explores Halloran's pockets, then finds the gun around his hip. He removes gun, presses it into Halloran's ribs. Then he disengages himself, gets up. Halloran slowly rises.
</DIRECTION>
<GARZA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Copper, ain't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA>
<HALLORAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLORAN>
<GARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just because I'm big, everybody thinks I'm dumb. I'm not dumb, I'm smart. Now how did I know you were a copper? Because nobody knows where I live -- not even Pete Backalis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA>
<HALLORAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're smart, you'll come down to headquarters with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLORAN>
<GARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha-ha -- that wouldn't be smart. You know why? 'Cause Backalis ain't in Bellevue, he's in the morgue.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(dangerously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA>
<HALLORAN>
<DIRECTION>
(obeying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be a fool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLORAN>
<DIRECTION>
From now on CAMERA becomes Halloran's eyes. We see only what Halloran sees -- a stretch of dirty wallpaper and a cheap reproduction of da Vinci's Last Supper thumbtacked to the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<GARZA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll prove I'm smart, copper. You know how? You're scared right now I'm gonna rub you out. But I ain't -- 'cause I'm smart. Ain't nobody can prove I rubbed out Backalis. So why should I knock you off? Rub out a cop an' you'll really get the chair. All I need to do is put you to sleep. Then I'm off. Try an' find me. This is a great big, beautiful city. Just try an' find me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
There is a grunt from Garza, the sound of a fist striking flesh. The picture of the Last Supper suddenly blurs violently as the CAMERA shakes. Then the CAMERA starts tilting towards the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<GARZA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a rabbit punch, Copper. It's strictly illegal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Again there is the crack of a fist. The screen goes black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STONEMAN'S RECEPTION ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulvey is at the phone. Perelli, Niles, and Dr. Stoneman are on their way out of the office.
</DIRECTION>
<MULVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, he signed it. Wait a minute, Ben.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Perelli; calling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep Niles away from the newspaper men.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And listen, Ben -- when Halloran calls in -- or Fowler or Constentino -- tell 'em that Willie Garza may be the gimmick in this case. So --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stops talking,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	listens; suddenly
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
snaps up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did Halloran call in? Was he alone?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(listens)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now get this -- send out an emergency! Rush every available squad car. Block off the street. Surround it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVEY>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up. Jumps to his feet. Starts running out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS RADIO ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A patrolman is crossing quickly from plotting table to radio operator at microphone. He gives operator a paper.
</DIRECTION>
<PATROLMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Emergency!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATROLMAN>
<OPERATOR>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Emergency... All squad cars on the East Side of 14th Street to the Williamsburg Bridge, from 1st Street to 5th Avenue, proceed immediately to Rivington Street between Essex and Delancey. Block off and surround both sides of the street. Institute immediate house-to-house search for --

INT. SQUAD CAR (PROCESS) - DAY

<DIRECTION>
swinging around in middle of street and then racing down Third Avenue with siren screaming. The operator's voice continued.
</DIRECTION>
<OPERATOR_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- two men -- Detective James Halloran and William Garza. Halloran is twenty- eight years old...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OPERATOR_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARZA'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Halloran is stretched out near wall, unconscious. Garza has put on a sport shirt and trousers. He still wears sneakers. The butts of two guns show above his belt, at waist line. He is stuffing four small chamois bags into both side pockets. He grabs up a sports jacket, puts it on. He opens a cupboard drawer, takes out a harmonica, puts it in a side pocket of his jacket. Then he goes out. The instant the door shuts Halloran sits up. The sudden movement makes him gasp with nausea. He remains still a second, then slowly pushes himself to his feet. On wobbly legs he starts for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRCASE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Garza is coming rapidly downstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARZA - DAY

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FIRST-FLOOR LANDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA IS SHOOTING UP as Garza comes down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: A police siren; a second, a third, approaching. Garza freezes for a second, then races down the last steps to the landing. He runs to the front door, flattens himself against the wall and glances out through the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TENEMENT ACROSS FROM GARZA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA IS GARZA'S EYES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A black police sedan is moving slowly along. A detective is questioning the two little girls who are playing jacks. One of them points toward Garza's tenement. CAMERA SWINGS to show cops and plainclothesmen leaping out of cars. CAMERA SWINGS other way to show Mulvey and others starting across street at a run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Garza turns, starts running toward back of hall. As he does so, he sees Halloran coming down last flight of stairs. Garza pulls out a gun but keeps running. Halloran hurtles down, swings out and around, trips and falls. At the same instant of his falling, Garza has swung around while opening the back door. He fires; the bullet shatters the window of the front door. Garza leaps outside. Halloran gets up, runs towards the back door. The front door swings open. Mulvey rushes in, gun in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MULVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy!

</HALLORAN>
<DIRECTION>
Mulvey runs after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACK YARD TENEMENT HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a mass of clotheslines, with wet wash hanging from every line. Garza is about to climb the fence at one end, when he spots Halloran in pursuit. He stops and fires another shot. Halloran falls flat on the pavement; then gets up untouched. He follows Garza over the fence. Mulvey appears at Halloran starts over. He changes course, runs out down a side alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the other side of the fence is a long alleyway, with ash cans and piles of junk in evidence. Garza runs down the alleyway with Halloran still in pursuit. Garza stops and fires again. Halloran drops behind an ash can as the bullet ricochets off it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. END OF ALLEYWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Garza climbs another fence, finds himself in back of a butcher store. He dashes into the store, with Halloran following a few seconds later.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUTCHER STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Garza runs through with gun in hand, followed by Halloran. The clerks and customers stare in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF BUTCHER STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is Delancey Street, a business thoroughfare. Across the street stands the approach to the huge Williamsburg Bridge which crosses the East River to Brooklyn. The street is crowded with automobiles. Garza races across. Halloran follows. Coming up behind Halloran is Qualen, the detective we saw earlier at Stoneman's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DELANCEY STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Garza disregards traffic and runs across. A truck swerves to escape hitting him. Another car jams on brakes. A third car crashes into the second. A traffic cop blows his whistle furiously. Halloran keeps after Garza. Qualen has caught up with Halloran now. Garza starts up the stone steps to the footwalk on the bridge. Qualen fires, misses. Garza turns, fires. Both Qualen and Halloran hurl themselves to sidewalk. Garza runs. They follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulvey, detectives, run up. Traffic is now stationary. Mulvey runs toward cop.

He runs to a radio car which swings into scene. Jumps in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRIDGE FOOTWALK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FRAMES the city. Suddenly frame is filled by sweaty, distorted face of Garza as he climbs onto footwalk. He turns violently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. QUALEN AND HALLORAN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
from Garza's angle. Garza fires, Qualen falls back down steps into Halloran's arms, almost hurling Halloran down. Garza turns, runs.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LONG SHOT OF BRIDGE SHOOTING DOWN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
showing bridge traffic disappearing. CAMERA picks out running men: Garza, Halloran, several cops. Then it picks out the squad car in which Mulvey is. The car races ahead of Garza, then stops. Men tumble out. Garza, seeing himself trapped, breaks for the subway tracks in order to cross to the other side. As he is climbing the fence, one of the squad car policemen stops running, kneels, aims a rifle. He shoots. Garza is hit, knocked over the fence and forward by the impact of the bullet. He staggers, trips over a rail, falls to his knees, slumps over -- and hits the third rail. There is a shower of sparks, his body leaps convulsively -- then is still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A siren WAILS, higher and higher. CAMERA TILTS toward buildings of Manhattan, showing sky above. Siren fades out.
