FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON A WOMAN'S FACE, BEAUTIFUL AND STRONG. SHE'S CRYING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KAT'S BEDROOM - NEW YORK CITY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman is KAT ELLIS, 30. Tears stream down her face as she sits cross-legged amid the detritus of a packing frenzy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is an unfortunate green bridesmaid's dress hanging on the back of the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat's pain is palpable. She buries her head in her lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the doorbell RINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat sits bolt upright, wide eyed. She looks around in disbelief. How did this happen? What is she doing on the floor?
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(sweetly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BIKE MESSENGER stands outside Kat's door. He busts a covert ipod dance while he waits.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Coming!

INT. KAT'S FOYER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat wipes her face and inhales, summoning deep calm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bike Messenger looks up as the door swings open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat is a changed woman. Nothing like the girl we saw on the floor. You'd never know she had been crying. Or that she even knows how.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so sorry. I wasn't quite ready for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Kat props the door open with her foot as she slides a plane ticket into an envelope. She scribbles a name on the envelope, seals it, and hands it to him.
</DIRECTION>
<BIKE_MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lady, you said this was a rush. I can't rush anything anywhere if you don't give it to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIKE_MESSENGER>
<DIRECTION>
Kat looks down at the envelope, she's still holding on to it.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a plane ticket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<BIKE_MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it is.

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to have to help me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
The Bike Messenger gently tugs the envelope out of her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
The Bike Messenger looks at her with genuine concern.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KAT'S APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Racing against time, Kat throws open a linen closet to reveal three neat rows of plastic bins, all perfectly labeled. Kat reaches into the bin marked "TRAVEL" and pulls out a prepacked toiletry kit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat pulls a box marked "LONDON" out from underneath her bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pushing aside an old private school uniform and some letters, she pulls out a worn London A-Z, a Ziploc marked "ADAPTERS," and her passport.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's about to close the box when she sees an old photo. In it, a GORGEOUS GUY kisses Kat on the cheek. He's holding the camera himself -- it's blurred and goofy, but full of love.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat jams it back in the box and shoves it under the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW YORK STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bike Messenger darts in and out of traffic, avoiding the throngs of NEW YORKERS enjoying this crisp fall day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KAT'S APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat races through her apartment, packing, cleaning, getting ready. Her place is small yet put together. It's Crate and Barrel meets Martha. But in a good way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KAT'S BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat, finally still, stares into the mirror as she brushes her teeth. There's a strange intensity to it, like she's scrubbing away the last of her distress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BROWNSTONE APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bike Messenger passes a waiting Town Car as he pulls up to a stoop. He hefts his bike, runs up the stairs, and slips the envelope into the door of...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BROWNSTONE APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tasteful flat. Stylish yet masculine. A MAN stoops to pick up the envelope. We don't see his face, just his ordered, minimalist apartment as he zips his carry-on and walks out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW YORK STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face obscured, the man steps into the purring Town Car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KAT'S APARTMENT BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TAXI DRIVER slams his trunk as Kat gets in. Kat's apprehensive face peers out the window as they pull away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JFK AIRPORT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ridiculously long line snakes towards the X-Ray machines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Latte in hand, Kat cuts right through the middle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irate PASSENGERS scowl at her. Kat does this every day. She should be used to the looks by now. She's not. She pointedly flashes the crowd her AIRPORT EMPLOYEE BADGE as she sails through security.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CUSTOMER SERVICE - JFK AIRPORT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat enters the Virgin Atlantic customer service hub. It's as cramped as it is busy. A FEMALE EMPLOYEE approaches with a question. Kat puts up her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm off duty. I do not exist. Don't even look at me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
The lady backs off. As Kat hurries away, a HARRIED EMPLOYEE matches her step and launches in.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIED_EMPLOYEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got a tour group from Taipei trapped in customs, a dead poodle in Cargo parked at T9, and a lost grandmother staggering around International asking for her mommy. Oh, and there's a guy on two who was stuck with his in-laws for a week because we couldn't get him out of Dulles. The in-laws aren't speaking to him anymore and, for some reason, he's pissed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIED_EMPLOYEE>
<DIRECTION>
Kat's trying not to get sucked in.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would love to help you. Sincerely. But my sister's getting married this weekend, I haven't seen my family in two years, and my flight leaves in fifteen minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
The Harried Employee looks like he's going to lose it. Kat struggles, then caves.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You take Taipei. Tammy's schnauzer just had puppies. Put her on the dead dog. Park reps with wheelchairs at every john in T8. If Grandma just got off a trans-con, she's gotta go sometime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Kat starts to walk away.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIED_EMPLOYEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about line two?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIED_EMPLOYEE>
<DIRECTION>
Kat spins around and glares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the phone, Kat is in the middle of saying way too much.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I completely understand, sir. You just want your in-laws to see you the way you see yourself. Or at least the way you would see yourself if you didn't feel so victimized by them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment, a CLIPBOARD manager walks by. He overhears Kat's diatribe and is incredulous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLIPBOARD Hello? Calls may be monitored for quality control?
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<CLIPBOARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over-share!
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Kat waves him off. Then, by rote:
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Rajagopal, we regret that you were snowed in at Dulles but snowstorms fall under a category called force majeure. Along with earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods. In short, we're not liable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Kat checks to make sure the Clipboard has moved on. Then, she continues, softly but very quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But just this once, I'm going to refund the full price of your ticket and credit you 10,000 frequent flyer miles. Thank you for calling Virgin Atlantic!

</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CABIN - PLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat sits in first class, absently scanning the safety card.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PRETTY WOMAN across the aisle notices and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<PRETTY_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your first trip?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRETTY_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kat realizes she's been reading the safety card. She laughs and puts it back in the seat pocket. As she often does, Kat feels compelled to explain.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hardly. My family moved to England when I was fourteen. My stepdad's a professor at University College, London.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going back for my sister's wedding...and the best man's my ex. In case I chicken out, I want to know where all the exits are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Kat eyes the front door, nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<PRETTY_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe in marriage. I believe in hot sex. Of course, that draws men to me like flies to shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRETTY_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kat doesn't know what to say, but then a HOT GUY walks up the aisle. Kat looks at the empty seat next to her and smiles at him. He returns the smile but sits next to the Pretty Woman.
</DIRECTION>
<HOT_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, my sweet darling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOT_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He gives the Pretty Woman a "madly in love" kiss. The Pretty Woman rolls her eyes to Kat -- what did I tell you?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GALLEY - PLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat is hiding out. She tries to calm her nerves as a MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT pours her a cup of water.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not a knuckler. I fly all the time. In fact, I transferred from Heathrow two years ago and now I run Bags and Nags here at Kennedy, so things are going really well for me. The reason I can't feel my legs is that any minute, my date is going to walk in that door. And I need him to look really, really good today.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish I couldn't feel my legs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALE_FLIGHT_ATTENDANT>
<DIRECTION>
Kat peeks around the corner and spots the back of the mysterious MAN from the opening as he loads the overhead bin above Kat's seat. Kat gasps, ducking back.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no. He's here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
The Male Flight Attendant looks out at the Man, who leans against Kat's seat as he chats with a FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT. Kat's in a panic.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>

He checks out the guy again.
</DIRECTION>
<MALE_FLIGHT_ATTENDANT>

Kat smiles, relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CABIN - PLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mystery man is NICK MERCER, 32, commanding and classy, yet somehow totally genuine. He carries his '40s-crooner good looks like he has no idea that men just aren't made that way anymore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick takes two glasses of champagne from the blushing Female Flight Attendant.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Lisa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
He turns around to take his seat and finds Kat standing there, awkwardly.

</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kat.

Nick kisses Kat warmly on the cheek and hands her a glass of champagne. Nick's totally at ease. This may as well be a candle-lit bar.

</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you found it okay. The airport. The plane, I mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick notices Kat's anxiety, tries to settle her.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really am sorry I couldn't leave earlier. I know you would have loved a few hours to settle in before the party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>

Kat melts a little. That's just what she was thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Work must be crazy right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick gives Kat a quizzical look. There's something going on here. Though it's not clear what. Kat fills the space.

(off his nod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mine's not like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
The Flight Attendant appears with a small tray. Kat notices the woman's cheeks flush as she fumbles Nick's drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick smiles warmly, but deftly ends the moment. He's like a famous person who has learned to manage his adoring fans with casual grace.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love my dad. But since he's my stepdad, he's technically not family. He's more like a hostage.

Kat tries to find her seat belt. It's under Nick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches beneath him, tentatively, then pulls back, embarrassed.

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My seat belt, it's....
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick pulls out the seat belt and hands it to her. Kat buckles up, checks that it's snug, then checks again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They sit in silence as the plane starts barreling down the runway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they pick up speed, Nick takes Kat's hand. She finds comfort in his touch, her need to talk abates momentarily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is safe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat closes her eyes as the plane levels off, then peeks over at Nick, who's calmly staring out the window. She closes her eyes again, this time for good.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. LONDON - ESTABLISHING - DAY

Nick and Kat wait at the baggage claim. She looks at his tie, then down at her dress. They are the exact same color.

<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(concerned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please tell me you're not wearing that tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Her dress is indeed the exact same color as Nick's tie.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's no big deal. Really. It just looks like a tailor cut off a yard of my dress and made your tie out of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick doesn't get it. He heaves one of Kat's suitcases onto a trolley full of matching suitcases.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get me wrong, matching's fine. It's "matchy matchy" you've got to watch out for.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(re: outfits)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is matchy-matchy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>

Nick, amused, tugs the last of the bags off the carousel and adds it to a pile of what appears to be an entire floor model of matching luggage.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think we look like we're trying too hard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like we're trying too hard to look like we fit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick laughs at Kat. Then fixes her with an intense stare.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll teach you a trick. If you look people in the eye, they'll never even notice what you have on.

Kat, overwhelmed by his charisma, is mesmerized.

She expertly slides off the first dress while simultaneously pulling another one on -- not an inch of skin shows.

She struggles as the train rocks back and forth.

ANOTHER WOMAN, PULLING OFF HER DRESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AMY'S BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman is Kat's sister, AMY ELLIS, 28. She graces a bath mat in all her infinite nakedness. Totally nude, she gently places her veil on her head and begins the ablutions of a Greek goddess. A dot of bath oil, a pure white towel, one squirt self-tanner, one squirt lotion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, she pulls out a bottle of olive oil, pours two drops into her hands and rubs them together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she stares in the mirror, regarding herself with a look so blank it could be anything from admiration to revulsion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, a KNOCK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The groom, EDWARD FLETCHER-WOOTEN, 31, enters, wearing a robe. He flashes Amy as he does a silly dance then smothers her inside his robe. Amy giggles and tries to break free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At first she's laughing, but then she turns on a dime and shoves him off more forcefully than she meant to.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him on the lips, trying to cover, and shoos him out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUNNY'S DRESSING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mother of the bride, BUNNY ELLIS, 60, drops her robe on the floor. She is about to put on a bra when she catches her reflection in a full-length mirror on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is momentarily surprised by what she sees. She turns and faces her image. This is not the woman she is in her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is an old woman with uncooperative skin. With one swift movement, she slams the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELLIS HOUSE - ST. JOHN'S WOOD

The father of the bride, VICTOR ELLIS, 65, wearing only a pair of socks, walks downstairs. He's completely comfortable in his nakedness and trots around as if he's fully clothed.

He sings to himself. The words of the song are incomprehensible but he sings with an unrestrained Sinatra sass.

Victor enters the kitchen, opens the fridge and starts scrounging. Inside the fridge door, Victor bends over and his bare butt sticks out. As he closes the fridge door, we cut to...

<DIRECTION>
A SHOWER DOOR SLIDING OPEN.

<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFFREY'S FLAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, the best man, JEFFREY JOHNSON, 31, the guy from the snapshot under Kat's bed, glistens with a post-shower flush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey towels off with a miniscule washcloth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stepping out of the bathroom, Jeffrey notices an 18-year-old NYMPHETTE watching him through her kitchen window. He crosses to the window but instead of closing the blinds, he opens them wider and jumps up onto a pull-up bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Nymphette blushes and looks away. As he starts pumping and his manhood rises dangerously close to frame, we...

Upscale cars deliver upscale people to this stately hotel in Central London.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY - LANESBOROUGH HOTEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick pays the BELLHOP, who trolleys away their bags. He turns to find Kat. She's wearing the red dress. The Zitty Teenager was right. It's really hot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat starts doing a yoga breath of fire, trying to relax.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick takes Kat's hand and pulls her close.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay, hon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Kat nods, clearly not okay. Nick smooths a piece of hair behind her ear. There is a practiced intimacy to the way he touches her and Kat is almost settled by it.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure I can do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick moves towards Kat as if he's going to kiss her, but then he whispers in her ear.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're never going to be sure of anything, but we still have to go inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, Kat's mother appears.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Baby love, my baby love."
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
A few BRITS dart looks at this very American display.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Mom. This is not the time to be yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Bunny folds Kat and Nick into a drunken embrace. Bunny gives Nick the once-over.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Nick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And who might this be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNNY>

Kat's mortified but Nick quickly saves her.

<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the new guy.

<DIRECTION>
(kissing Bunny)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's great to meet you.

Bunny throws Kat an unsubtle, "I'm impressed" look and leads them into the party.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LANESBOROUGH HOTEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bunny, Kat and Nick emerge into a sea of Burberry, floppy hair, and unspoken judgments. Bunny turns to Nick and Kat, all business.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a marathon, not a sprint. After welcome cocktails, you've got the hen party. Tomorrow, there's a picnic and the rehearsal dinner and since you've conveniently left no margin for jet lag--

<DIRECTION>
(squeezing Kat's cheek)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need you to hydrate, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNNY>

Nick and Kat are stunned. Bunny hops away as Victor approaches. Kat throws her arms around her stepfather.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad!

</KAT>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, kiddo.

	Meet Nick.

</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
They shake hands. Just then, Kat's sister, Amy, dressed to the nines, strikes a pose in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm getting MARRIED!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
As Kat and Amy squeal loudly and hug, Victor leans into Nick.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I find a good, strong drink helps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Nick smiles, looks at Victor's glass.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I get you a refill, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Victor hands Nick the glass.

<NICK>

Nick heads toward the bar and Victor turns to Kat.

<VICTOR>

Kat smiles, appreciatively.

<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Yellow Pages.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Victor laughs. Across the room, Bunny has found a microphone. She taps a knife on the side of a glass to get everyone's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome, friends and family!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Then she taps the mic, which squeals.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON KAT, panic stricken.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweet Jesus, who gave that woman an amp?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
ON BUNNY, drunk with happiness.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor and I would especially like to thank our out-of-town guests for coming to celebrate with us as we welcome Edward and the Fletcher- Wootens into our family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA ID's LYDIA and GEORGE FLETCHER-WOOTEN, 60's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George shifts uncomfortably. Lydia waves as though addressing a room full of her subjects.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON JEFFREY, searching the crowd for someone. His eyes land on Kat. She doesn't see him. He stares at her meaningfully.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's funny. We always thought we'd marry off Kat first. We came close once, but that crashed and burned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Nervous laughter from the crowd. Kat smiles through the pain. Jeffrey winces sympathetically. His mind working, he spots a piano nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still, we had reason to hope. She was always one of the more "active" girls at the American school, and that's saying a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a loud, lovely arpeggio from the piano. Bunny looks over, surprised. Then she smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON JEFFREY, sitting at the piano, playing.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay. I get the hint! Anyway, imagine our surprise when Ed moved in next door and fell in love with...the girl next door. Our Amy. Lucky for us, he had no idea it was an unforgiveable cliché.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(raising her glass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A toast to the bride and groom to be. Congratulations, babies!

Everyone claps as Jeffrey plays a final flourish.

INT. NEAR W.C. - LANESBOROUGH HOTEL - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat is sneaking towards the ladies room when Jeffrey comes out of the men's room. Their eyes meet. Both stop dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neither can find words or even a smile. Kat pretends that seeing him isn't a gut-punch, forces a silly grin.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for, you know, with the piano.... It was really.... Hm.

Kat slithers past Jeffrey into the W.C.

INT. W.C. - LANESBOROUGH HOTEL

Kat wills her breath back. She turns on the water as if she were washing her hands. Then she confronts herself in the mirror and applies a coat of lipstick like she's putting on a suit of armor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEAR W.C. - LANESBOROUGH HOTEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey, a dashing Brit, is not a man who likes to wait, but wait he has. Kat emerges from the W.C. as if she hadn't seen him before.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Katmandu.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
As Jeffrey kisses her on the cheek, Kat's eyes close and she takes in his smell. It's like coming home. She doesn't want it to, but something inside her stirs.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look well, Gorgeous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
All he has to do is look her in the eyes and her big plans fly out the window. Kat blushes.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seeing you again....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, TJ, 30, Kat's cousin, appears, wrapping Kat in a hug. TJ's deb-of-the-year perkiness is undercut by her Longshoreman's tongue.
</DIRECTION>
<TJ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You haven't visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TJ>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have more than one gynecologist?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<TJ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. You've got to play them against each other. Otherwise they think you're easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TJ>
<DIRECTION>
TJ turns on Jeffrey like she just realized he was there.
</DIRECTION>
<TJ>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, asshole, since you dumped my cousin brutally and without cause, you won't mind if I steal her away?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TJ>
<DIRECTION>
I have all kinds of interesting
</DIRECTION>

things to tell her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ darts Jeffrey a dirty look and drags Kat away.

	Don't worry. I'm so over him.

	By the way, do you know if he's seeing anyone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
They spot Nick talking to Bunny, surrounded by OCTOGENARIANS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't look the least bit lost. In fact, he's charming the Dockers off them.
</DIRECTION>
<TJ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why waste ten more seconds on the slimy limey when Mr. Tie-Me-Up-Tie-Me-

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON NICK, listening patiently as Bunny pours her heart out.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After Kat's father died and I married Victor, I was so desperate for my little girl to love him. It never occurred to me that she might love him more.

ANGLE ON KAT AND TJ, still staring at Nick.

	Therapist.

<AMY>

(O.S.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I have that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Kat looks over and sees Amy. She puts her drink on the bar, but Amy can't quite reach it from her stool. Amy makes an exaggerated reaching gesture and whimpers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick takes note as Kat slides the drink closer. Amy sips it through the straw without picking it up.

	You know what I love about all this?

	Exactly! Today's my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day.

As Amy gloats, Ed dances over. He's a refreshingly unaffected upper-class Brit.

Amy kisses him on the lips.

Ed lifts Amy off the stool and spins her around. He does an awkward dance move and steps on her toe.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See what happens when you put off dance lessons til two days before the wedding?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Ed looks to Nick for support.

A beat as Jeffrey watches the party. He sees Kat and Amy at the bar and slowly turns to Nick. With difficulty, he begins to unburden himself to his new therapist.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just, there's this girl I care for -- God, I suppose I could even say I love her -- and the bugger is, of course, she's here with someone else. Bollocks!

Nick stops Kat and faces her. He is quiet but intense.

Kat takes a deep, calming breath.

A charming period house in a row of identical houses. You'd never know where the Americans lived but for a conspicuous boat trailer parked in the driveway.

Victor and Bunny try to help Nick unload Kat's many bags from the taxi. He won't let them. As Nick lugs the bags up the driveway, he reads the name, "JACK SHIP," off the back of the dilapidated cabin cruiser.

	I'm not as square as my daughter thinks.

</BUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
As Kat's parents walk away, Bunny flirtatiously sidles up to Victor and pulls him into their bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She must have drowned her rules in the Chardonnay.

</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
With that, Kat closes the door.

<DIRECTION>
INT. KAT'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door CLICKS shut and the happy couple separates instantly. Kat to one side of the room, Nick to the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat's childhood bedroom has an aggressively floral decor.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about the creepy room. I went through a painfully earnest Laura-Ashley phase.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Kat takes a brown envelope out of her purse, opens it, and removes A STACK OF HUNDREDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hands the pile of money to Nick.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Count it. Six thousand even.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick doesn't look at the money, just tucks it into his bag.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I trust you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Kat almost lets it go, but then...
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, count it, anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm compulsive and weird?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick humors her. Pulls out the stack of bills and counts it.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Six thousand, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>

	On the nose.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tell you what, because you're so cute, I'll take care of our incidentals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(wryly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That won't be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No offense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. Hell, I've never paid for it. But please don't feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Kat walks over to an old dollhouse. Its rooms have been gutted, their mini furnishings replaced with a teenager's cassette-tape collection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat pulls out Guns and Roses' "Appetite for Destruction" and opens it. There's no tape inside, just some nicotine patches. Nick watches as she opens one up and slaps it on.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You quitting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm desperate to start but I don't have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I can't get enough of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick notices an ‘80s poster of two guys with guitars, all big hair and laser light shows.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick thinks about those names for a second, then his face twists.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Air Supply?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Embarrassed, Kat hastily rips down the poster and stuffs it in the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My parents had a German exchange student a few years back.... He must have left it here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick hides a smile as Kat ducks into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KAT'S BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat has left the door open a crack as she gets ready for a shower. Unbeknownst to her, Nick watches from the bed, enjoying the ritual.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone knows their greatest hits but some of their lesser-known ballads are surprisingly poignant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Inexplicably, Kat stands on her tiptoes as she looks into the mirror. It's a little thing, maybe the tiles are cold, but it gives her an innocence that makes Nick smile.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's cute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is?

</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You stand on your tiptoes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Kat looks down, she never noticed before.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it an old habit from ballet class or a childhood spent walking on eggshells?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
She throws him a glance, impressed with the sharpness of his mind.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never took ballet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles and kicks the door closed with her foot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KAT'S ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick hangs up his tux. It's definitely not a rental. Kat comes out of the bathroom, drying her hair with a towel.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever done anything like this before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A weekend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A wedding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick thinks about that. Kat wonders what's taking him so long.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Though strangely, I've done quite a few funerals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Kat makes a face.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not the way you're thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think that's disgusting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Kat immediately backpedals.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not you. You're not disgusting. You're lovely. Just the idea that they'd bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didn't...who never.... I mean, someone's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. Imagine facing it alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Kat blanches.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. I'm a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This happened to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick laughs at her. Kat pulls something out of her purse.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I ask you something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick sees what she's unfolding. It's a crinkled New Yorker article. The artsy photo shows the FACE OF A MAN, blurred against a neon cityscape. The title: "Discretion Assured: Diary of a Male Escort."
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you know that was me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a friend at the magazine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(sharply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your "friend" guaranteed my anonymity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick shakes his head at her and pulls off his shirt. Kat instinctively looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can look. It's part of the package.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Kat can't tell if he's joking. She sneaks a look as Nick disappears into the shower. Wow. Kat looks down at the papers in her hand. She moves towards the bathroom but at the last minute, shies away.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you grab my shampoo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shampoo, got it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Kat grabs the shampoo and rushes into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KAT'S BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without looking in the shower, Kat hands him the shampoo and hurries out, way too quickly. Nick peeks out of the shower curtain. She's gone. He shakes his head and closes the curtain. Suddenly, Kat reappears. She stands by the door.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The part where you were a sexual surrogate and then started to, um, freelance. Is that really how it happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Kat pretends to straighten things up as she moves closer to the shower.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldn't be violated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Kat's totally engrossed now. She closes the toilet lid and sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick pokes his head out.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick sees that Kat's heartbroken for him, feels bad.

<NICK>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just screwing with you.

Kat throws a towel at him.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you thought I'd respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Kat gives him a dirty look, then examines the article again.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This part here. You say, and I quote. "Each woman has the exact love life she wants."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That seems like a pretty broad generalization.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick steps out of the shower. Kat, her eyes at the level of his manhood, covers her subtle jaw-drop. Nick wraps a towel around his waist as Kat tries to pull it together. She looks down at the article, tapping it indignantly--
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.

</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First of all, it's never out of the blue. And second of all--

Nick levels his gaze at her.

Nick shrugs and walks out of the room.

INT. STAIRWELL - ELLIS HOUSE - LATER

Nick and Kat walk downstairs, ready for a night out. Kat's wearing an over-the-top sexy golf outfit -- pleated mini skirt, tight white oxford, plaid vest. On the bottom step, Kat stops short.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>

Nick looks at her like she's crazy.

Nick drives while Kat navigates. They crawl down a small street, which bustles with activity. PATRONS of London's many pubs spill out onto the pavement.

	I love that you're asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?

Nick doesn't say anything for a moment. Then he pushes her up against the car. It's a gentle movement, but firm. Kat breathes in sharply from the power of it.

Cheering, the girls blow out their shots and do their best to down them in one go. Just then, Nick walks in.

All eyes are drawn to him. The WORLD SLOWS as he beelines for Kat. He hands Kat her purse.

INT. THE COCK & BOTTLE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick is surrounded by women and completely at ease. Amy's drunk and pouty. TJ stands between Kat and Amy. Oblivious to the brewing tension, she's eating beer nuts and staring at Nick.

<TJ>

Amy appreciates it less. She suddenly wails.

A DOZEN MEN down their shots. Jeffrey immediately refills their glasses with tequila. Alcohol and alpha abound. Nick walks in the front door. He takes off his suit coat and tries not to feel like the chaperone at a frat party.

Things have gone way downhill -- or uphill -- depending on how you look at it.

	Is it ‘drunker' or ‘drunker-er'?

The bar erupts in CHEERS but Kat is left worried, troubled by Amy's confession. A beat, then she downs her shot.

EXT./INT. LONDON STREET [DRIVING] - LATER

The bachelorette girls ride home in "The Pub Prowler." It's a senior citizen med-van that's been pimped out with a full bar and an all-shag-all-the-time interior.

The girls are drunk and rowdy. Kat climbs up behind the DRIVER and taps her on the shoulder.

--Kat jumps out of The Pub Prowler and clumsily slots her ATM card into the machine.

--Kat checks her lipstick in The mirrored security camera of a different ATM machine then flips through a stack of credit cards. She pulls out a different card and slips it in.
</DIRECTION>

--ECU on screen: MAXIMUM WITHDRAWAL £200. Kat's at another ATM. In the Prowler, a couple of girls heckle passers-by as Kat rifles through her cards, desperate for some un-maxed plastic.

Kat and Amy stand in the driveway. They watch as the Prowler pulls away. Amy is about to head next door, when she turns to Kat.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a great party. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>

Amy reaches out to hug Kat. Kat wasn't expecting the hug and it's awkward. Amy senses it and pulls away.

<AMY>

	God, Kat! Please. Don't be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.

Kat wants to say more but Amy is already walking away. Kat turns towards the house and just catches the light shutting off in her upstairs room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALL - ELLIS HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat shuts the front door. She leans against it for a moment to get her balance, clear her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - ELLIS HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat sits at the kitchen table, a glass of water in front of her. She downs three aspirin and stares into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALL - ELLIS HOUSE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat starts up the stairs. The first step CREAKS loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Remembering countless school-age sneak-ins, Kat flattens her foot against the back of each step and soundlessly walks up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KAT'S ROOM - ELLIS HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick is asleep in Kat's bed, bare-chested under a single sheet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA FINDS Kat standing with her back to the door, staring at Nick. Nick stirs, opens his eyes, and rises onto one arm.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Kat walks to him, takes his hand.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhhh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DRIVEWAY - ELLIS HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat leads Nick down the driveway towards the BOAT TRAILER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On it, the twenty-six-foot CABIN CRUISER with peeling paint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat unbuttons the weathered cover and peels it back. She climbs up a ladder and hoists herself into the boat. Nick smiles at the strangeness of this, then climbs in after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the cabin, Kat flicks a couple of switches and a row of lights flicker on. She flicks another switch and a piercing sea-horn BLARES the "William Tell Overture." She scrambles to turn it off and checks the house for activity. A dog BARKS in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Relieved, Kat pushes a tape into an old radio. MUSIC limps through hollow speakers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat leads Nick into the cabin and onto the bed. Without taking her eyes off him, Kat starts to slowly undress. Her shirt drops to the floor. Then, a moment later, her skirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat breathes deeply then reaches behind her back and flicks open her bra. We watch Kat's face as she lets it fall to the floor. Kat is indeed a woman who doesn't do naked -- this is killing her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the bed, Nick doesn't say anything, just watches. Kat wants to read something into his stare. Longing, desire, anything. But he's utterly inscrutable. It's both unnerving and extremely sexy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat steels herself and removes her underwear. She loses her nerve momentarily and pulls them up again. Finally, she slips them off and tries not to laugh as she scurries onto the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hovering lazily in the waking dream of interrupted sleep, Nick gazes at Kat. In a trick of light, the cabin windows glow liquid, as though the moon were reflecting off water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick runs his hand across Kat's waist. She's trying to hold back. He knows it and likes it. He takes her face in his hands and kisses her. It's amazing. A different kind of kiss. They pull back and look at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In one swift movement, he flips Kat underneath him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the space between them collapses and they attack each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DRIVEWAY - ELLIS HOUSE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat's house beams in the scarlet light of dawn. Two BIN-MEN walk down the driveway toward the bins. They grab three bins and drag them noisily past the boat parked in the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON Kat and Nick, asleep, their faces pressed up against each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PULL BACK to reveal Kat and Nick entwined, naked. We PULL BACK further to reveal that they're covered with a fleece blanket and a pile of life vests.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick opens his eyes and looks at Kat, who is as calm and content as we've seen her. Then, he realizes where he is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's like waking up in a strange hotel room, only weirder because it's a boat...in a driveway...in London.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick carefully extricates himself and begins to dress. We've seen this scene a thousand times before, but Nick's escape is breathtakingly precise and practiced.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DRIVEWAY - ELLIS HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick climbs down the ladder of the boat just as the Bin-Men are returning the empty bins beside the garage. Nick gives them a nod.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
The guys nod back and finish their job as Nick sneaks toward the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - ELLIS HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor and Bunny sit at the kitchen table. Victor's buried in the International Herald Tribune crossword puzzle. Bunny looks out the window and sees Nick creeping towards the house, shoes in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She still thinks we don't know about the boat thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Victor looks up from his paper. He sees Nick, snorts, and goes back to his crossword.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOAT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat's eyes flutter open. Her hair is plastered into an impromptu quasi-beehive. She looks down at her "pillow."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a buoy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat suddenly sits bolt upright. She grabs a life vest to cover her naked chest and looks around in horror. Then her eyes widen as she remembers the rest of the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DRIVEWAY - ELLIS HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat slinks towards the house, retreading Nick's walk of shame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - ELLIS HOUSE

<DIRECTION>
Victor looks up from his paper and sees Kat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DRIVEWAY - ELLIS HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat's almost to the house when she hears a loud, POUNDING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up to see HER FATHER tapping on the window and laughing at her. Kat's mortified, but can't help smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She waves and keeps walking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KAT'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat looks around frantically for something. She finds her purse and checks to see if the ATM money is still there. It is. She breathes a sigh of relief, then, hearing footsteps, hastily stuffs the wad back in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick opens the door, carrying a breakfast-in-bed tray. Kat spins around, guiltily.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't sure what works for you, so I've got a pack of Saltines, a bottle of Pedialyte -- preferred by infants and rock stars -- an eggand- cheese sandwich, a black coffee, and a Bloody Mary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Kat slumps onto the bed. She hasn't gotten her land legs back yet.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is really sweet of you, but I need to ask you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(desperately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick is taken aback. He sets down the tray. He's not sure what to say, then makes a decision.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Kat looks surprised, then skeptical.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at him long and hard.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whether it's true or not, thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Kat disappears and Nick bites into a Saltine as the shower HISSES on. Then something catches his eye. It's Kat's purse lying next to the bed. Stuffed on top,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WAD OF MONEY. His brow furrows, Nick picks it up and leafs through the stack of pounds and euros.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KAT'S BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the shower, Kat lets the scorching water punish and purify her.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Startled, Kat peeks her head out of the shower curtain and sees Nick holding the pile of money.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Shoot. I--
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
She retreats into the shower, yanking the curtain closed.

<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (mouthing words)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit! Shit! Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>

Nick pulls open the curtain and Kat instantly stops her pantomimed self-flagellation.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this for last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Naked in front of Nick, Kat is trying not to flinch.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't want you to think I was expecting anything to be free or that I was expecting something at all. Well, clearly I was expecting something or I wouldn't have stopped at all those ATMs on the way home.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the way, would it have been enough? I mean, if something had happened. Which it didn't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Kat wants to slip down the drainpipe. Nick looks at her, considers his words carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't they have a limit at those machines?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Now Nick has to really try to stifle a laugh. Nick puts the money on the sink. He goes to leave, then turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're three hundred short.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
With that, he walks out. In the shower, Kat gently bangs her head against the tile. She looks down and notices something.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And my Brazilian wax looks like... Brazil.
	</DIALOGUE>

Nick and Victor are eating breakfast, the newspaper spread out between them. Victor's still working on the crossword puzzle.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You a boating man, son?
	</DIALOGUE>

Victor's expression is inscrutable. Nick weighs his options and then--

<NICK>

	I am now, sir.

Just then, Kat walks in with an air of feigned nonchalance.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.

</KAT>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>

Kat throws him a look. He chuckles. As Nick gets up to get himself some orange juice, Kat corners him behind the refrigerator door.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(hushed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? That's a down payment on a Ford Focus!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not dollars. Pounds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick pours a glass of juice and offers it to Kat. Kat shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My rate isn't arbitrary. It was determined by prevailing market conditions. By the way, it includes oral. That's the extra three hundred.... Pounds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles and sips his juice. She is outraged by his presumption--
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what if I didn't want you to...to do that to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.

</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But nothing did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yup. That's why you get to keep your money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick walks away. Sits down next to Victor. Kat glares daggers at him. Nick smiles and toasts her with his juice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, Amy enters in a flurry of cheerfulness, as if last night never happened. Bunny follows, carrying a clipboard.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Ginger! Hey, Gilligan! How much do I love all this? I'm going to get divorced and remarried over and over again so it'll last forever. Kat, be a sweetie, and go help with the rings. No way Jeffrey's going to get it right.

Amy breezes out.

Kat's stung. Nick watches out of the corner of his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could you say that? Of course it's not about me. It's never about me when she's in the room because you two are on a special team. You might as well have Tshirts made up.

Kat lowers her voice.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>

Bunny looks over at Victor.

Bunny squeezes Kat's cheek and kisses her.

As Bunny walks out, Victor raises an eyebrow, then goes back to his crossword. Kat stands a moment, feeling awkward.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, then. I'll catch up with you at the dance thing.... Sweetie.

Nick gives Kat a casual nod. She exits. Behind the BUSINESS section, Nick's face is a mask. Then he smiles. This girl is nuts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A door BUZZES.

Kat enters and approaches SAL, 60, a tough-talking, Cockney teddy bear.

He smiles and heads into the back. Kat casually looks into the counter. Her face is blank as she scans row after row of engagement rings.

Sal reemerges with two ring boxes. Kat takes the rings and smiles.

Nick smiles enigmatically. Then without warning--

NICK SPINS KAT AROUND, THEN REELS HER IN TIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a hyper-romantic cinematic flourish,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FLOOR SWELLS AND THE WALLS DISAPPEAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music sharpens as if it's no longer coming from an old record player but from a classic MGM soundtrack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick and Kat are weightless as they glide across the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes stay locked on each other as though it were this connection, and not gravity, that keeps them on earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat and Nick seem to slow down but the world stays at normal speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SONJA, astonished. She stops and watches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON AMY AND ED, as they notice what's going on. They stop dancing and stare, too, slacked-jawed, as Nick and Kat float past, completely wrapped up in each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick and Kat are incredible together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music CRESCENDOS as Nick gracefully spins Kat to a perfect stop.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>

	So you can't dance, eh? Bloody liar.

Victor tows the boat with an annoyed Bunny in the passenger seat. As they pull out of the driveway, they wave to Nick, who sits on a stone wall in front of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick talks on his cell phone, Kat's bags piled high next to him, as Pigeons walk and flap around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat appears carrying two bottles of water. When Nick sees Kat, he hangs up too quickly. Kat pretends not to notice.
</DIRECTION>

She eyes the pigeons suspiciously.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pigeons creep me out. They're like dirty doves...plotting something.

Nick doesn't acknowledge her joke. Kat sneaks a look at him.

A small boathouse sits at the edge of a charming lake that borders the main property. Nearby, "Jack Ship" struggles to say afloat as PASTY KIDS sun themselves on the moored junker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ed mans an elaborate grill as GUESTS in summer hats mill about.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT A PICNIC TABLE, Victor plays poker with Nick, Kat, and TJ.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the pile of money in front of him, it's clear Victor's kicking ass. Victor throws in ten pounds.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I might just call you... but if I did...I would lose... because my hand blows.

Nick looks down at his money. Ten pounds. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a HUGE WAD OF CASH. Everyone is in shock but he doesn't notice. He strips off a hundred, tosses it in the pot, and takes back sixty.

<NICK>

Nick lays down his hand. THREE KINGS. Victor shakes his head. Nick glances at Kat. She twinkles at him, then lays down a LOW STRAIGHT.

Nick smiles at Kat and heads toward the boathouse. Kat watches with a hint of apprehension.

	Right, then. I'll get you a Tofurky Burger instead.

Amy turns around and looks at the tiny boathouse. Although it had looked perfect to us before, under her gaze, we see all the cracks and dirt.

	Actually, I do.

Nick and Kat walk back to the main house. Side by side, they cut through a picturesque glen. Nick shoots Kat an anxious glance, deciding whether to reveal what he knows.

Kat catches him and smiles back, sweetly. Nick takes her hand and kisses it, surprising her. His eyes turn back toward the house but he doesn't let go of her hand.

INT. BATHROOM - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - NIGHT

Kat is getting ready. She's up on her tiptoes, doing her make-up in the mirror. The radio is blaring Air Supply. Kat sings along, passionately, embarrassingly.

Victor smiles, he knows what Nick's talking about.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember the day I met Kat. It was in New York. I'd been dating Bunny for a few months, and she finally trusted me enough to introduce me to her kid. So I'm over at her place and in walks this little monster that won't stop talking.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(remembering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She hands me a walkie-talkie made out of an orange juice can and drags me over to her fort. The fort was this lop-sided mess of blankets and the walkie-talkie almost took my ear off, but she was having the time of her life.

At the center of it all, Nick is quietly relishing being a part of this family dinner. Kat and Nick make eye contact.

<DIRECTION>
Bunny's voice cuts through the din like a knife--
</DIRECTION>
<BUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I blame Tony Pee-Pants!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNNY>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Nick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She tells this story at every major holiday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<BUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why should this be any different?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(taking Nick's arm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Nick)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I blame Tony for why my two girls can't seem to get along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat and Amy moan, here we go.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, don't deny it. You barely tolerate each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNNY>
<TJ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's true. All you have in common is that you both secretly want to be me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(raising her glass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cheers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TJ>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(to Nick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<BUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they haven't made up since.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Amy rolls her eyes, saves them all from Bunny by telling the story herself.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apparently, Kat and I were inseparable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<BUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If Kat ate a banana, Amy threw it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNNY>
<TJ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If Amy threw it up, Kat ate it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TJ>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia is vaguely disgusted. She pulls a face. Bunny waves a hand in front of her eyes. This story always kills her.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was fourteen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You practically bribed him with your erector set.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(aside, to Kat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fourteen and he's hoodwinked by a an erector set?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say he was worth it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
They share a private smile.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever. The point is, Tony ended up with a chair in his face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<BUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(in her defense)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was plastic. And child-sized. But there were some stitches involved.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNNY>
<TJ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like fifteen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TJ>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<BUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I don't bake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNNY>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Victor laughs, remembering. Bunny hits him on the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He chuckles again.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should have seen his face--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he makes a surprised face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then, boom. Right in the kisser.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<BUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to my little angels?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Amy and Kat both ignore their mother, who's misting up.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's with the nickname?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
They all think about that.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have absolutely no idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone laughs.

EXT. GARDEN - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Many of the guests have gone. Empty bottles of wine litter the table. Only the immediate family, TJ, Nick and Jeffrey remain. Jeffrey's still drinking heavily and Kat's not at the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WINE CELLAR - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat pulls a bottle of wine off the top shelf just as someone comes up behind her. Kat feels a hand on her back, spins around and drops the bottle. Jeffrey reaches out and grabs it before it drops. She looks at his somber face, takes the bottle, and sets it back on the shelf.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, let's do this. What's the big confession?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARDEN - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick looks for Kat. Concern crosses his face as he notices that Jeffrey's gone, too. Nick picks up a couple of empty wine bottles off the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick drops the bottles into a recycling bin then looks over at the basement door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WINE CELLAR - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick stands at the top of the cellar stairs. He's eavesdropping, partially concealed by the half-open door.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, in a way, you were right. The prob was, you were in love. I wanted to be. But I wasn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT WITH JEFFREY AND KAT:
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I'd have confessed, you would have forgiven me. But the truth is, I didn't want to be forgiven. I sort of just needed it to end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
Kat processes Jeffrey's words, tries to be open.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bollocks, I'm sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax. Take a breath and just say it. It's no big deal. I promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brilliant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But not anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you were right -- it is why I brought Nick with me...because I wanted to drive you insane. To torture you slowly, for the entire weekend. But then something happened. I started to fall for him. And now, and I hope this doesn't hurt your feelings, now I'm sick of you and me, of our story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick, almost giddy with happiness, moves away from the door, then back towards it again. Finally, he closes it quietly and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Downstairs, Kat takes Jeffrey's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the past. It's nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then let's go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I slept with your sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shagged Amy. Two years ago. That's why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
Kat stares at him, blood pounding in her ears.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last Christmas when Ed proposed, I realized...I'm in love with her. I can't lose her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
She feels like she's trapped in a horror movie. She's got to get out of here. In a daze, she turns around and heads toward the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Good lord, say something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
You said I should tell you the truth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat stops dead, her jaw stiffens. When she turns and looks at him, her face is filled with loathing.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasted two years grieving this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Kat laughs. It is so close to tears, that the sound catches in her throat. She shakes her head, wearily, and mechanically walks up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARDEN - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat emerges like a sleepwalker. She looks for Nick, doesn't find him anywhere. She drifts toward the table. Jeffrey appears in the doorway behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ is the first to look up. She sees Kat's face, sees Jeffrey, and knows what happened. TJ goes to Kat.
</DIRECTION>
<TJ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no. He told you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TJ>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You knew?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<TJ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TJ>
<DIRECTION>
Kat shakes her head and looks past TJ to Amy. Amy meets her sister's gaze and instantly gets it. Desperate to keep this from Ed, she heads Kat off.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't say anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Kat looks at Amy like they've never met. Amy's eyes are wild, silently pleading.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Kat has never felt more alone. She looks everywhere for Nick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finally emerges from the house and comes to Kat's rescue, folding her in his arms. Kat holds onto him for dear life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then--
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Nick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe you told her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Kat pulls away from Nick, confused. As she stumbles backwards, all she sees is Nick's face. All she hears is Amy's voice, miles away.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said your job was discretion. You couldn't wait until you got back to New York?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Bunny and Victor watch, confused, as Kat runs out. Nick runs after her as Ed approaches Jeffrey.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey looks straight at his best friend.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<ED>
<DIRECTION>
(skeptical)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't look like nothing.

Jeffrey puts his arm around Ed.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now is not the time to catch on.
	</DIALOGUE>

(re: Ed's empty glass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is, however, time for another round.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat staggers down the moonlit lane. She's barely staving off a breakdown. Nick runs up behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kat!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Kat charges forward, blindly, as Nick follows.

	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>

Kat's anger swells, she spins around.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?! I can't believe I trusted you! How could you not tell me!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick sees the pain in Kat's face. It's pain for Jeffrey, for the past.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(angrily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, Kat. What did you want me to say? That your sister slept with your fiancé? That everybody knew and no one respected you enough to tell you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick is not used to being angry. He grows uneasy, hedges--
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides, you hired me for my discretion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've always got that to hide behind, don't you? It's just business!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning, we'll go back to the real world and...and you'll be hiring me for your best friend!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Kat's face fills with hurt.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, come on. Did you actually think we'd be boyfriend and girlfriend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
This stops Kat a moment, then--
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I don't know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. It's your job. It's who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're judging me?! Oh, that's a good one. You're lying to me, you're lying to your family, and you're lying to yourself. But you're going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Each wants the other to fight for it. But neither does. Kat gives up.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now you'll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick's had enough. He turns and walks away, leaving Kat stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - LATER

<DIRECTION>
The party is over, the house lights low. Moonlight washes over Nick as he carries his packed suitcase to his car. Ed comes out of the house, jogs up to Nick.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll just check into a hotel.

</NICK>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be ridiculous. It's late and the place is empty. Just take my car.

Ed hands him a set of keys.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what's going on with you two, but I'm sure it'll work out. You couldn't be more perfect for her if she picked you out of a catalogue.

</ED>
<DIRECTION>
Nick smiles, wearily.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, man.

Nick tosses his bag in back and gets in the car.

INT. SITTING ROOM - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat stands at the window, her eyes puffy. She watches as Nick drives away, then she turns around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her mom and dad wait in the darkened living room. Kat tries to be strong, but then she goes to her father, burying herself in his arms. Bunny hides a pang of disappointment as she gently touches Kat's head.
</DIRECTION>

Kat straightens up her room. A KNOCK on the door and Amy walks in.

Kat keeps cleaning up.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wanted to say thank you. For not outing me in front of Ed. I want to tell him. Just not on the night before our wedding. With these kind of things, timing is everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Kat turns on her sister, she's smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. You should really time it right so when he hears that you repeatedly screwed his best friend, he doesn't feel like the world is collapsing around him and there's no escape because you tricked him into marrying you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Amy wasn't ready for Kat's intensity, she backs towards the door.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what? I'm not having this conversation right now.

</AMY>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, disappear. We've been walking away our whole lives.

Amy turns around and faces Kat, willing to hear anything.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not even going to discuss the fact that you screwed my fiancé because you've always been a spoiled, amoral, little princess.

</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Amy looks horrified but Kat's not backing down.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I put up with all of it because I really believed that deep down, you loved me and you were a good person. I really thought you deserved someone like Ed. God I envied you guys. Somehow, he made your selfish bullshit seem okay. Almost endearing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Amy looks at Kat with tears in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>

Kat looks at her sister, sadly.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, Amy. Your wedding will be perfect. Tomorrow, I'll smile and say all the right things and you'll deal with Ed when you're ready. But right now, tonight, I can't pretend it's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Amy, stricken, exits. As she leaves, her shoulders start to shake. She is crying. Kat's reflex is to go to her, but she stops herself. It's too soon to forgive. She walks over and closes the door.

Kat's eyes flutter open. She's not refreshed and she doesn't feel better. The only thing that's changed is that it's morning. Kat looks up at the ceiling.

Kat draws in a long breath, trying to summon some semblance of joy.

</KAT>
<BUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave?

	<DIALOGUE>
	You and Amy. Reunited.

INT. CHURCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A series of images as Wedding preparations transform the austere church. A carpet is unrolled down the aisle. A bouquet is affixed to a pew. Programs are laid out.

A HAND ZIPPING UP A SUITCASE.

Limos wait outside both Kat's house and the house next door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bunny fusses with Amy's dress as they walk toward the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor and Kat follow, arm in arm.
</DIRECTION>

ANGLE ON VICTOR AND KAT. Victor looks at Kat, who is trying to be brave. It's almost working.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANNEX - CHURCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy nervously fusses with her dress when Kat walks in. Kat stops when she sees her sister, glowing in a beam of dusty light. It takes Kat's breath away.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. You look beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, you're my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because you've been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldn't outshine me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesn't feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I don't know, but your misery just isn't working for me anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Amy tries to keep up her tough attitude but when she levels her gaze at Kat, her eyes cloud with a regret deeper than we thought her capable of.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a horrible thing I did to you. I'm really sorry.

</AMY>

ON KAT as this sinks in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHURCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat pushes open the heavy church doors. Organ music floods out as Kat surreptitiously looks up and down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor appears behind her. Kat looks at her dad and forces a smile. Victor knows she's upset.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So why'd you let him go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well, then. It probably won't work out.

Victor stops and faces her, his voice full of meaning.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I read a fascinating article in the New Yorker once and this guy said: "Every woman has the exact love life she wants." You know what? I agree. And I refuse to believe that this is what you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Kat is overwhelmed but Victor continues.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever since you were a little kid, you've been trying to please other people. And in return for your services, all they've done is disappoint you.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So tell me, is this the guy for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>

Kat thinks about this.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.

Kat looks at him gratefully and makes a silent decision.

INT. CAR [DRIVING]

Kat speeds down the road in her parents' car. The empty boat trailer clatters behind her.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CHURCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy watches through a crack in the door as the GUESTS take their seats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANNEX - CHURCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy paces nervously. Ed knocks and enters, covering his eyes so he doesn't see her dress.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mother said you'd like a quick word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
Amy takes Ed's hands away from his eyes. From the look on her face, Ed knows something is wrong.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WOODS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat races through the woods, trying to keep her dress from catching on the branches that whip at her on all sides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHURCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Guests are all seated now, and the organ has begun its mood music. In the atrium just outside the church, the entire wedding party, minus Amy and Ed, is gathered, waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOATHOUSE - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat bursts into the clearing, her hair tousled, her dress nightmarish. She tries to catch her breath as she looks up to the porch of the boathouse. This is supposed to be the part where she sees Nick and they live happily ever after.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOATHOUSE - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat desperately searches the rooms of the boathouse. By the time she gets to the kitchen, she knows it's going to be empty. She opens the door, anyway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick's gone. On the kitchen table, a brown envelope. Kat picks it up. Written on the front: KAT. She turns it over to open it. On the back it reads: "IT'S ALL THERE, TRUST ME." Kat laughs at how well Nick knows her. Her eyes fill with love.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. CAR [DRIVING]
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the car, Nick's face is stoic as he drives, his carryon on the seat next to him.

<DIRECTION>
INT. ANNEX - CHURCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy faces Ed, her eyes red and puffy.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was too scared to tell you. I thought you'd never speak to me again. I'm so sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Ed is reeling, he just stares at Amy, saying nothing. Amy's finally doing her penance. The silence is killing her.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say something. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.

Ed shakes his head, trying to understand.

<ED>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
Ed staggers towards the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHURCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ed slams the door on his way out of the annex. He charges up the aisle, past the pews full of guests.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guests MURMUR in surprise. Ed picks up speed. He's like a heat-seeking missile that's found its mark:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JEFFREY, stands at the back, chatting up a DUMPY BRIDESMAID.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns just in time to see Ed running up the aisle. TJ spots Ed, too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey's seen this movie before –- he knows he's about to get his ass kicked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey drops everything and starts running. At that moment, TJ grabs a FLOWER GIRL and uses the little girl to trip Jeffrey. He falls, scrambles back up and keeps running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat trudges up the church steps, her head down. Just then, the door bursts open and Jeffrey flies out of the church and races down the street. Moments later, Ed explodes from the church and takes off after Jeffrey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat watches them run down the street, confused, then goes inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. CAR [DRIVING]
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick's staring straight ahead when something
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STREAKS PAST HIS WINDOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick thinks he's seeing things, looks in the rear-view mirror to investigate. Just then, ANOTHER FORM STREAKS PAST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick looks out the back window and sees Ed chasing Jeffrey down the street. Nick shakes his head, but keeps driving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This family is not his problem anymore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick wills his eyes to stay on the road, but then he can't help it. He looks into the rear-view mirror again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almost despite himself, Nick throws the car into a U-turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He catches up and pulls alongside Ed, who's still chasing Jeffrey.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Ed looks over at Nick, but keeps running, his tuxedo flailing. Nick keeps pace.

	I look like a total wanker, don't I?

</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Ed keeps running.

Ed finally stops running. Wheezing, he bends over to catch his breath. Nick pulls over.

Nick and Ed pull up to the church. Nick turns off the car.

Neither one of them gets out.

They sit in silence, the church looming in front of them.

Ed's clearly struggling. Nick lets him talk.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

	I forgave her when I thought it was just some bloke. Bugger it. Why Jeffrey?

	I've had her up on a pedestal ever since...since the day I put her up there. It's going to take a long time for me to get over this.

</ED>
<DIRECTION>
Nick tries to find the right words of encouragement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, he takes his best shot.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think about it this way: you get to spend the rest of your life having make-up sex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>

Ed thinks on this a moment. Then he turns to Nick.

Kat pushes open the heavy doors to take one last look. She steps outside and the door closes, revealing--

They take each other in.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When we were fighting last night, it hit me. No one had ever cared about me as much as you cared about Jeffrey. That's why I was so angry. I'm sorry I took it out on you -- I didn't mean to hurt you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then, I was going to get out of here and leave you alone, but halfway to the station, I realized--

</NICK>

From inside, the WEDDING MARCH begins to play. Nick takes her face in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd rather fight with you than make love to anyone else.

Kat is speechless. Nick leans down and kisses her like he's going to keep on kissing her forever. But then, he breaks away.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I should go.

INT. HALLWAY - CHURCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick and Kat stand in a dark doorway, facing the closed door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They share a secret smile in the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, the USHER opens the door and Nick leads Kat down the aisle. As they walk, they exchange sidelong glances.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both are as nervous and excited as school kids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them, Victor and Amy beam as they await their turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick leans over and whispers in her ear.

In the background, Amy and Ed stand at the altar. They hold hands tightly, grateful to have lost and found each other.

All around her, she sees faces: Mom, Dad, Amy, Ed, TJ. Kat looks down at a crumpled scrap of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been working on this speech since these two got engaged. It was supposed to be touching and funny.

<DIRECTION>
Kat looks at Nick. He doesn't have to do anything. He just is support.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I'd come back to England and have an epiphany. I'd see Amy and the perfect thing would pop into my head and it would encapsulate how and why I love my sister. But I came home and everything was a mess and the truth and beauty line was all I could come up with.

Everyone clinks glasses. A few people sniffle or kiss their dates. Kat and Amy hold each other's gaze. Nearby, Bunny watches her little girls with tears in her eyes.

The STAFF has already started packing up. Ed's Father whispers something to the BANDLEADER and pulls his wife out on the dance floor. He spins her around as "Ma Vie en Rose"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
begins to play. She smiles, happily, as they dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ed tries to keep a very drunk Amy away from the present table. Slouching on the piano, TJ makes out with her date, Woody, the bartender.

Kat smiles mischievously. Nick pulls her close. He's finally going to tell her.

<NICK>

	You know why I never tell the real story of how I got into this?

Kat shakes her head, "no." Nick swings her around in an elaborate dip and kisses her on the neck.

	Because it's boring.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Now if you want to hear a good story, let me tell you the one about how I got out of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Kat and Nick smile at each other as their dancing grows more effortless. In the background, Ed tugs a half-opened present out of Amy's hands and puts it back on the table. She jumps up on his back and he happily carts her off to the loo.

As the first star appears in the night sky, the music swells and we slowly make out the sounds of the greatest make-up sex of all time, echoing in the distance.
