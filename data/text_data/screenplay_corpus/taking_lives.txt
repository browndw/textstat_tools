INT. BUS STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSE: 17 YEARS AGO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Small, Canadian, rural. Just the Native American CASHIER jotting down sports stats from the paper. MARTIN, 16, enters. Slight, pale and frail, new clothes, a tag still hangs from his stiff work jacket. Martin stands in front of the Cashier a beat. Nervously tugs an earlobe.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir. Sir, may I have a ticket to Montreal please?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CASHIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need a ticket to Montreal.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CASHIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Montreal?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CASHIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forty-three dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Martin pulls out an envelope filled with crisp twenties and carefully counts out three. The Cashier gives Martin his ticket and change. Points at a bus outside. The DRIVER loading bags.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A half dozen PASSENGERS. Martin steps aboard, takes a seat. DAN SOULSBY, Martin's age, sits next to him, offers a hand. Martin shakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dan Soulsby.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin. Nice to meet you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where you heading to?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Away from here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Dan produces a couple beers from his pockets. Offers Martin one.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pisswater.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least it's cold pisswater. Here's to getting away.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They CLINK CANS. The Driver enters the bus. Unlocks the airbrakes. Puts the bus in reverse, gives it gas. BOOM! The ENGINE throws a rod. Horrible GRINDING. Smoke wafts into the windows. The Driver KILLS the ENGINE. Silence. Martin and Dan trade looks.
</DIRECTION>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(bummed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gonna take all day to get another bus here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Martin sighs, looks out the window.

<DIRECTION>
WHAT MARTIN SEES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car rental place.

Martin fingers the envelope of cash in his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a license?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had one. They took it away.

<MARTIN>

	I got one. Let's go.

INT. RENTAL CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dan drives. JOURNEY ON the RADIO. Martin checks out Dan's guitar. Dan shows Martin his teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See that? They're all fake.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You take a hockey puck in the face?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A fist. My stepdad socked me. I flew across the room and dented the sheetrock in the kitchen. My mom saw everything and still took his side.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got cracked good.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate that guy. Two hundred pounds of worthless grease.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why'd he hit you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wrecked his sixty-five Mustang and his boat in the same week. His babies. I totaled them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would have popped you too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was worth it. But I didn't deserve the tour in hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Dan rubs his close-cropped hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't ever go to military school if you can help it. It sucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I jumped the wall two days ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You going back?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm done with that racket. I'm going to Seattle and playing music.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Martin tries the guitar, he's not that good.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know some chords.

The land rolls endlessly. Martin drives. Dan plays his guitar. He's really good.
</DIRECTION>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the next Billy Squire. Krokus will be opening for me one day.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
POW! The CAR HITS a BOTTLE. A front tire deflates. Martin guides the crippled vehicle to the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The middle of nowhere. Martin flips a coin. Heads.
</DIRECTION>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Dan hauls the spare from the trunk. Sets the jack under the bumper. A PICKUP TRUCK approaches. Still a mile away. Martin watches Dan lean in the trunk for the tire iron. The pickup gets closer, a big one. Heavy with bags of animal feed. Speeding. Martin looking at Dan's back. Martin shoves Dan hard, into the highway. In front of:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GRILL OF THE PICKUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM! It plasters Dan. He goes over the hood, SHATTERS the front WINDSHIELD. Bounces off, spins like a rag doll into a ditch. The pickup has lost control, it rolls. Several times, a heaving mass of steel. CRASH! The TRUCK folds itself around a husky tree. No survivors, that's clear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can't believe what he has just done. He takes in the carnage, tugs at his ear.

A large Ferry plies the unstoppable waters. Gliding toward skyscrapers.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. FERRY PIER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The signs in French. Crowded with PASSENGERS waiting to board. As more PASSENGERS pour off the just-docked ship. A WOMAN runs through the crowd. Terror etched in her face. She knocks aside several PEOPLE. Runs toward a row of restaurants. Even in her turmoil, she is patrician, elegant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PIER-SIDE CAFE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two BEAT COPS eat at an outdoor table. Laid back. The WOMAN approaches them, frantic.

<WOMAN>

	I just saw my dead son get off the ferry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The COPS trade looks.

INT. MONTREAL PD OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An INSPECTOR pours the Woman tea. She has calmed down. He takes his pen, looking at her statement.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need to open that grave. It can't be my son in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I lost my mother two years ago. Every day I think I see her. Driving to work in the car next to me. At mass. Shopping, I see her, but this is someone else's mother. You see?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Woman lays a hand on his arm, looks him in the eye. There is something formidable about her.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inspector, I'm saddened by your loss and touched by loyalty. But let's focus on the matter at hand. He walked right past me. We made eye contact. I know he recognized me. It was my son. A mother knows these things. I will sign anything, I will swear before a judge. And thank you, I do have all my faculties and friends who can vouch for my character.
	</DIALOGUE>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you talk to this man, he is a man now?
	</DIALOGUE>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Of course he's a man. He'd be thirty-two. And no, I did not speak with him. I ran.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(low, serious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inspector, my son was very, very disturbed. He had serious emotional problems. I assure you he was.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is. Is a dangerous person.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He hands her some forms.
</DIRECTION>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madame. The police department cannot resolve your problem. You need to get permits from the coroner and health and safety department. You pay for an exhumation. You have someone qualified examine the remains. If it is the wrong body, the Forensic Examiner will confirm there is a problem and call us. Then we open an investigation.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Quebec City police will investigate. He is buried there, no?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Woman bristles. Stands, takes the forms.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Inspector. He is not.

Deep woods. In the mountains. Near a roaring river. A log vacation cabin is being erected by CONSTRUCTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WORKERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BACK HOE digs a trench. The scoop snags something -- a wetsuit -- worn by a long dead corpse, twirling slowly, hanging from the bucket's steel teeth. The BACK HOE OPERATOR jumps off the huge machine, stares at the headless body he has just dragged from its grave. Workers gather and gawk.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRACE VANDERHOLT lies in the grave where the body was discovered. It has been excavated by criminologists, the soil sifted, the grass and brush removed. Grace sits up. Grace holds out her FBI creds, shielding her eyes from the bright light.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, I'm supposed to be here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK. The LIGHT goes off. REVEALING Laval and Reynaud.
</DIRECTION>
<INSPECTOR_LAVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Agent Vanderholt, we requested your help. I'm Inspector Laval, this is Inspector Reynaud.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. Look, I'm not ready to talk to you guys yet. I need a little more time here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Reynaud and Laval trade looks, walk toward two UNIFORMS guarding the site.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grace lays back down. Sighs. Concentrates on the sounds. The RIVER. WIND in the trees. Then: LAUGHTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.).
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you mind trading one liners somewhere else? I need to hear the natural sounds. I appreciate it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The policemen have gathered in a chummy knot. Laval gestures for them to walk down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON GRACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steps out of the grave. Sits by it. Writes some notes. Everything glistens in the moonlight, alive. Grace takes it in for a beat. Then: HOWLING, the lonely song of a distant WOLF. Grace rises, crosses to the river, to a big gravel bar. Used as a campsite complete with a large fire pit. Grace sits by the fire pit. More HOWLING, CLOSER this time. Grace looks down river, SEES the glowing eyes of a TIMBER WOLF staring from a clump of trees. The animal stares a beat, then runs off. Grace has the chills. Grace walks quietly toward the trees. Grace just a few feet away. RUSTLING. She cautiously moves aside a sapling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVERBANK - GRACE'S FLASHLIGHT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TIMBER WOLF nestled amidst the trees gnaws on something; a HUMAN HEAD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVERBANK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grace stands there alone, the wolf is long gone. She stoops, pushes aside brush. She finds a hollow under some roots. Grace CLICKS on her FLASHLIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT SHE SEES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A human skull stares up from the hollow. Picked clean, weathered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DIRT ROAD IN THE FOREST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laval and Reynaud, and the two UNIFORMS smoke and joke. A quiet beat as the WIND picks up. Their cars up the road in the b.g.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOMETHING MOVES in the woods. Inspector Reynaud draws his Glock. SHUSHES the men. A beat. MOVEMENT. Laval signals for the men to spread out. Holsters are UNSNAPPED. Reynaud is all eyes and ears as he picks his way toward the trees. GRACE emerges from the trees, a laser-aiming dot on her forehead. She REACTS to Reynaud, raises her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't shoot, I'm on your team.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Reynaud holsters his gun. The men relax. Grace takes Inspector Laval aside.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call who you have to call. I found his head.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Laval REACTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gloved hands carefully remove the skull from a box. The MEDICAL EXAMINER places the skull on an exam table and begins cleaning it. Grace walks around the headless body. The wetsuit has been removed, the body has been autopsied. Headless, skeletal hands, the legs are surprisingly well-preserved. DIRECTOR GILLET is tall, heavy, smoking a cigar. He's a cop's cop and all-around nice guy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR_GILLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't tell you how excited we are to have you here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You only have one victim. Usually there's two or three by the time I get called in.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTOR_GILLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This case made page one of the Globe. The tabloids say there is a headhunter on the loose. The Mayor wants closure. That's his vacation house they were building. I get calls from supervisors I didn't know I had.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You clear the Mayor?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTOR_GILLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We cleared the Mayor. He read the article on you in Newsweek and insisted we fly you up. The papers say two campers had a drunken fight and the loser lost his head.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTOR_GILLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't solve crimes anymore, I balance budgets.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was not a heat of the moment killing. And the victim was buried complete with head. The grave was five-foot ten. The victim's height. With square corners. Dug with a shovel the killer had the foresight to bring.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTOR_GILLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirty-five detectives searched the area Saturday. My investigators think you're a witch.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been called worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Medical Examiner finds two small holes in the skull, waves the PHOTOGRAPHER over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR_GILLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeez. Look at that, looks like he got ice-picked.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She simulates fangs with her hands, they match marks on the skull.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. A large canine did that. Probably an old or sick timber wolf that couldn't hunt. It dug up the body and chewed off the head. It felt safe in the trees, away from the riverbank, away from the other wolves.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Medical examiner looks at a chewed vertebrate.
</DIRECTION>
<MEDICAL_EXAMINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd say you're right.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(into tape recorder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Postmortem scavenger damage to C-1.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Medical Examiner examines the skull's teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<MEDICAL_EXAMINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The victim was afraid of dentists. Bad teeth.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Inspectors Laval and Reynaud enter. Both give Grace wary nods. Inspector Laval hands the Medical Examiner a paper bag marked HUMAN REMAINS.
</DIRECTION>
<INSPECTOR_LAVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was a meter from the skull. At soil level.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Medical Examiner opens the bag. Removes a wig. No, not a wig; someone's ponytail and leathered scalp. Tangled with the hair is a braid of green nylon cord tied to two pieces of broomstick. The Photographer SNAPS some shots. The Medical Examiner gingerly untangles the cord.
</DIRECTION>
<MEDICAL_EXAMINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Grace crosses, grins. Grace studies the cord, noting the intricate knots.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bingo. That's your murder weapon.
	</DIALOGUE>
<INSPECTOR_LAVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It might be trash a camper left.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Look at it, braided parachute cord, two pieces of broom stick. You approach the victim from behind, loop it around his head and hold on for all your might. The more the victim struggles, the quicker he passes out. And now you have convenient handles to drag around two hundred pounds of dead kayaker.
	</DIALOGUE>
<INSPECTOR_LAVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is a theory.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's exactly what it is. A theory. That evidence supports. When the suspect is in custody you can ask him yourself what happened and you won't need me. Inspector.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Laval bristles, he crosses to check his cell messages. Gillet looks at Grace, at the cord. Turns to her quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR_GILLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Laval and Reynaud are my stars. Very smart, very persistent investigators. On the street; they're magnificent.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can see that Director. You're lucky to have them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead, Director, say what you have to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTOR_GILLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the expert. If you have any suggestions on how to proceed...
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. A forensic anthropologist can draw the victim's face based on the skull. I know someone at Quantico who can do it by tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTOR_GILLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have people.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call 'em. Then show the results to everybody around who was selling outdoor goods two years ago. You have his initials; MRC, inside the wetsuit. The long hair is distinctive, someone may recognize him. It's a semi-long shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTOR_GILLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that's bread and butter detective work. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(checks his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The long table is crowded. Inspectors Laval and Reynaud. Three more POLICE OFFICIALS. A pair of CITY COUNCILMEN. Grace sits next to Gillet.

<COUNCILMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You found the skull. Incredible.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a case once where wild dogs had removed remains.
	</DIALOGUE>
<COUNCILMAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I can tell my people there isn't a headhunter running around the wilds of Quebec?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No headhunters, sir. However, a killer is out there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<COUNCILMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Director Gillet. Do you have the victim identified?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTOR_GILLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No name yet, sir. We have someone from the University recreating his face from the skull.
	</DIALOGUE>
<COUNCILMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, after two years, has nobody reported him missing?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wasn't missed. He had no family, or moved often. He had the musculature of a serious outdoorsman. He spent a lot of time in his kayak.
	</DIALOGUE>
<COUNCILMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The big question is who killed him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Always is, sir. I can give you a rough profile; white male, thirty to thirty-four. Has some college but no degree. Neat in appearance. At least six feet tall. Very intelligent. Charming when necessary. He uses murder as a tool, probably in furtherance of a criminal endeavor. He's killed before and will again unless caught.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Laval and Reynaud write furiously. Gillet is impressed. As are the Councilmen.
</DIRECTION>
<COUNCILMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>

	So before he died he got his paychecks, paid his taxes. Patronized sporting goods stores. And had long spending gaps where he was enjoying the great outdoors. That pattern continues a year after his death. He gets some paychecks. Rents an apartment. Buys a three thousand dollar kayak. Pays his taxes. Dead and buried and still paying his taxes. Then everything stops. Last Visa charge was to Travelocity for a plane ticket to Mexico city.

	I bet Monsieur Edwards is in a deep grave with square corners like Messieurs Kohler and Ford. Which looks like all the victims. Maybe he's subconsciously killing himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Grace finds a guitar case. Opens it. It's a mobile office; it has postage stamps. Postcards. Assorted stationery, different address labels. Neat, organized. Holiday cards. A CD titled: "Learn Flamenco Guitar." Hundreds of practice signatures. Forged documents. Victim's personal effects.
</DIRECTION>
<INSPECTOR_LAVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll take that with us.

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put a number and seal on that case.

<DIRECTION>
Reynaud SNAPS pictures of the guitar case. Grace is absorbing everything this little apartment can tell her. Bonding with the space. She smells a pillow. Thinking.

	Ever see a Hermit crab?
	</DIALOGUE>
<INSPECTOR_LAVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a crab that lives in the shells of dead sea snails.
	</DIALOGUE>
<INSPECTOR_LAVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, yes. They have one big claw and curl up tight.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Laval takes a long, sharpened screwdriver from his jacket. Begins prying off a door molding. Grace sits at the kitchen table.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When they outgrow an old shell, they search for a new empty shell, crawl up to it and quickly switch. They live in these beautiful shells because they have these soft ugly bodies. They couldn't survive without the shells. Neither can the guy we're after.

Laval exposes several MINI DV and MICRO-CASSETTES hidden under the molding.

Surprisingly clear video shot with a long night-vision lens. TODD FORD exits the 24 Hour Gym, gets in his car.

The Director, Grace, Reynaud and Laval watch the video on the TV. Director Gillet turns it off. He is not in a good mood and that has Laval and Reynaud on edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR_GILLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could have had him this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
<INSPECTOR_LAVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Director, please. We are getting close. The hairs recovered from the apartment match the hairs recovered at the crime scene on Ford's body. We found hours of video like that of the victim. He has been following him, filming him for weeks. He tapped his phone and has recordings of Ford's calls. Even a CD with copies of Mr. Ford's E-mail folders.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With that much detail, you could become anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTOR_GILLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So he hunts people and wears their lives as a kind of trophy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More like a kind of camouflage.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTOR_GILLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's his real name?
	</DIALOGUE>
<INSPECTOR_LAVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Someone died last night because the asshole we're after isn't in custody. It's happened to me before and I'm sure it will happen again. It's a pretty miserable feeling.

	Mr. Ford worked as a cruise-ship musician. He would walk around and play his guitar on the decks at night.

	Life is pretty cold sometimes. Man's just trying to spread a little music and gets murdered.

<INSPECTOR_LAVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He targeted Mr. Ford the night before he was supposed to get on a plane and meet a ship in Aruba.

	Only the new improved Mr. Ford was going to meet he ship.
	</DIALOGUE>
<INSPECTOR_REYNAUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think he has a plan B?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I doubt it. He's been so meticulous and effective in the past, I bet he's never needed one. We can assume he has all sorts of fake IDs and passports. Disguises. But that's not enough for him, he has to be someone else. He gets off impersonating people. And he knows his current persona is compromised.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Laval and Reynaud have stopped eating, are looking at her.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

	<DIALOGUE>
	You're always thinking. Save something for tomorrow. We have three boxes of evidence to go through.

<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty cavalier attitude for a man who just got his ass chewed by his boss.

<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Overpriced folk art. Is it the work of a soul that has suffered? Sure. Are his explorations as an artist groundbreaking? No.

<COSTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ouch. And I was going to send you two and charge them to your Amex.

<COSTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Medical school. Before I dropped out. I had a moment of clarity: in anatomy class I realized I'd rather draw bodies than cut them up. And when I realized I couldn't make art, I decided to sell it.

<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some journey.

<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. Any activity on Edward's accounts?
	</DIALOGUE>
<INSPECTOR_LAVAL>

Grace trades Reynaud for the front page.

	I couldn't sleep.

	Our suspect kills Kohler on the river, lives his life a year, kills Edwards and assumes his ID for a year. Then he stalks Ford, kills him but is interrupted by Costa. Think he's pissed at Costa?

	By three minutes. They were very different boys.

	To lose one son so young, then to lose the other two years later; to think you've lost him. That must have been devastating.

Mrs. Asher lights a cigarette. Crosses to the window, so poised, so tragic. Grace studies her with a critical eye.

<MRS_ASHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reese was very charismatic and outgoing. Martin was introverted. He never thrived like Reese. He was a very disturbed young man. Reese was Martin's world. Martin never recovered his equilibrium after we lost him. He changed. Martin began to intimidate me. He could be very menacing. He began imitating Reese at school and that lead to fights with other students. At sixteen he stole some jewelry that was very precious to me and ran away. A few days later the Thunder Bay police called and said my son had been killed changing a tire.

	She's a very slick woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She didn't have one picture of Martin. Not one. Even cut him out of the old yearbooks. And she had a basement door like a vault. She's hiding something. In the basement of her house. What is it, ten minutes away from here? Her house.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Laval looks at Grace, decides he can trust her.
</DIRECTION>
<INSPECTOR_LAVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If she's under our protection and something happens to her house, her belongings, the department could be liable. There could be a lawsuit.

INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grace descends CREAKING STOPS. Shining her light around. Old boxes. Furniture. Forgotten things. Dust. Grace is looking for something and she's not sure what. She spots a door chain. She moves some boxes. Finds a leather razor strop hanging next to a small door. Grace's hand undoes the chain. Lifts the latch and opens the door as rusted HINGES SQUEAL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTIN'S CELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grace moves aside cobwebs with her big flashlight. The room is tiny. Exposed joists overhead. Grace sits on the cold concrete. A sleeping bag rolled in the corner. One wall is just chicken wire. Her flashlight beam stabs at the yawning darkness beneath the house. There is a public school desk chair combo. The name MARTIN neatly carved into it, then scratched out. A broken light bulb overhead, its wires running to a corner of the house. Grace cautiously unrolls the sleeping bag. A pair of socks, underwear, T-shirt neatly folded inside. She rolls it back up. Finds a large jar, picks it up. Very old feces inside, a makeshift toilet. She sets it down. Grace pulls the door shut. And turns off her flashlight. Pitch black. So quiet. She sits there, in the musty little cage. Listening to her BREATHING, to her HEART BEAT. So lonely, so frightening. A tear rolls down her cheek. She SNIFFLES, wipes away the tear. A beat. Grace hears SCRATCHING. She clicks on her light.
</DIRECTION>

INT. MARTIN'S CELL - NIGHT (PRESENT)

Grace REACTS, nothing is there. Chuckles for scaring herself. Grace feels the chicken wire. MORE SCRATCHING. Grace freezes. Listening carefully. Mice? SOMETHING moves closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She swings her flashlight on: TWO FIERY EYES. WHAM! Something big slams into the chicken wire. Teeth flashing, GROWLING. It's a BADGER. Grace almost shoots it. The fearless beast GROWLS. Grace kicks the door open and runs out of there.

Nobody is there. Then: MARTIN ASHER exits Costa's office. Closes the door. APPROACHES CAMERA, nonchalant. His face is clear; the piercing eyes, the sharp features. Asher EXITS FRAME.

Ultra-hip. The dance floor THROBS with CLUBGOERS. THE DJ THUMPS a EUROBEAT. Costa sits at the bar. PEOPLE all around him, jostling to buy drinks. Two busy BARTENDERS sling booze. Costa finds the noise and crowd absolutely nerve- wracking. He twirls the ice in his Scotch with a finger. Staring at the clock. 1:31 AM. He's nervous, sweat beads his forehead. A big BARTENDER, an undercover cop, pours Costa a Scotch.

Costa cautiously pushes open the door. Stepping inside. Dingy tiles. DRIPPING FAUCET. Several stalls. The room seems empty. Costa swallows, bends down. Checks under the stalls. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing... Then. Something. At the far stall. A pair of men's shoes. Black. Polished. Facing the stall door. Waiting... Costa freezes. Backs away as... The stall door slowly swings open. HINGES CREAK. A foot, a trouser cuff. A leg stepping out...

	So who was in Asher's grave?
	</DIALOGUE>
<INSPECTOR_LAVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dan Soulsby. He went missing from the Alberta Military Institute two days before the accident.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure Soulsby's death was a homicide, Asher saw the opportunity and took it. He became Soulsby and bummed around Seattle for a couple years.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTOR_GILLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why is Asher after Costa? Why isn't he in Mexico getting a new face?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Costa saw him. Costa caught him in the act, caught him being Martin Asher. Seen first by his mother, then by Costa. For the first time he's failed at taking a life, and since we found the apartment, he can't be Edwards. To be seen, to be recognized, is a horrifying thing to Asher. He has no identity and wants it that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTOR_GILLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is the real Mr. Edwards?

<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Likely dead and buried south of the border somewhere.

Director Gillet taps out his pipe. Looks at a new, more detailed portrait of Asher.

<DIRECTOR_GILLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you contacted the clinic?

<INSPECTOR_LAVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. They are also 'no questions answered.' Mr. Kohler suddenly paid off his credit card bills, thanks to money from Edwards.

<DIRECTOR_GILLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep's the collection agencies off the trail. How do we flush Mr. Asher?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's focused on Costa. Who fits the profile of Asher's victims. He went on Costa's computer and E- mailed copies of Costa's files to an E-mail account in Denmark. Constant threat of discovery, Asher will become more disorganized.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Laval and Reynaud agree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR_GILLET>

<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm trying to get into the show, but I mean. What is this? It looks like somebody napalmed the Garden of Eden.

	Mangos. Ripe mangos hanging on a branch.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Now she sees it.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Okay. Why the borders? Almost every painting has one. Was he in prison or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Costa REACTS, impressed by Grace.
</DIRECTION>
<COSTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most people don't notice. This is from his prison series. He could see a mango grove through his cell window. He made some of the pigments himself. From flowers. From his own blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was his crime?
	</DIALOGUE>
<COSTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He attacked his neighbor with a machete. There was a woman involved.

Grace sips her drink, letting herself relax. She enjoys Costa's company.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He had a lot of lovers, didn't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
<COSTA>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now he's dead and you get rich?
	</DIALOGUE>
<COSTA>

<ELEGANT_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John, it's amazing tonight. I want to cry, I'm so touched.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Grace watches her hand linger on Costa's arm. And is amazed that she feels jealous. She catches Costa's eye.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Costa, I would like to discuss an arrangement for the series.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Elegant Woman REACTS.

<DIRECTION>
(aside to Costa)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The thing we were talking about the other day, well I'd like to proceed. Hell, I'm sick of making two percent in the market.
	</DIALOGUE>
<COSTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dick, they're yours.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<COSTA>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Costa takes a leak. He's in a good mood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The window above the stalls is open. The noise of the PARTYING CROWD on the sidewalks outside. Costa finishes, washes his hands. Pauses. Smoothes his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOMEONE BEHIND HIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Costa looks in the mirror and REACTS. MARTIN ASHER stares at him from the mirror. No doubt who it is. Asher is wound tight, not at all happy.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put your hands on the wall.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Asher jams a gun in Costa's back. Costa is very scared.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Please be cool with that. I don't wanna get hurt.

<COSTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yessir. I apologize for everything you think I may have done.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ASHER>

Asher running. Gun in his pocket. Elbowing his way through the crowd. Asher REACTS. He sees the gauntlet of UNIFORMS and PATROL CARS blocking the intersection ahead. Asher shoves his hand in his pocket...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM! BOOM-BOOM! POP-POP-POP!

Thunderous GUNFIRE. Grace hits the deck. The Uniforms hit the deck. The CROWD SCREAMS, CLAPS and WHISTLES. It's not gunfire...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TILT UP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIREWORKS unfold in the night sky like giant flowers of fire. Rivers of sparks. Grace recovers her feet with palpable relief, she thought she was dead for a second. Grace looking around for Asher. Laval reaches her.

The SLIDING GLASS DOOR to the balcony has been shattered. Below and beyond is a long rooftop. Madly lit by a swirl of bright lights. A huge outdoor dance floor throbs with energy in a park along the St. Lawrence River.

DANCERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIND GRACE --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She and Reynaud scan the moving bodies for Asher. Grace GLIMPSES the back of Asher's head. Grace and Reynaud tear through the crowd like bulls, working together, a bonding moment. Asher is an arm's length ahead of Grace. She reaches out, her fingers snag the cloth of his shirt. Asher turns...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IT'S NOT ASHER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grace shoves him aside and moves on. She SEES a disturbance up ahead. Grace shoulders her way through the crowd. Grace and Reynaud converge on the disturbance. They cleave through ONLOOKERS to reveal...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two drunk COLLEGE JOCKS slug it out. Grace looks around; no Asher. Angry, frustrated, Grace grabs one of the Jocks, hurls him to the ground. Six UNIFORMS swarm in and arrest the two Jocks. Reynaud throws up his arms in frustration. He looks at Grace, they know they've been beaten.

Some dude with his shirt off grinds on three HOTTIES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUSH IN ON THE DANCER.
</DIRECTION>

It's Asher. His face is an evil green from his mane of pilfered gel glow necklaces. Red plastic cup in hand, Asher enjoys the boisterous anonymity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ASHER'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dangerous and cold. They track Grace as she moves through the crowd. Asher grabs one of the hotties, begins making out with her. Grace searching the crowd. Scanning faces. Grace passes within feet of Asher. Asher smirks. Now another hottie wants a kiss. Asher complies.

	He was in my bathroom and none of you could stop him. I need to leave town.

Costa scoots aside a pile of clothing. The newspapers. Cool art, sketches, images all over the walls. Reminiscent of Grace's hotel room. And a very cool view of downtown. Grace taking everything in. Art books, sketch pads. Piled high on the desk. She looks at the ceiling. SEES notes and sketches taped up. Grace laughs to herself.

Grace turns and REACTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Costa has been standing there. Listening. He tries to read Grace's expression, worry etching his face. Grace is looking at Costa, her mind racing a million miles an hour. Grace's world crumbles as she puts it together.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you Martin?

	Good idea. Don't hurt me.

BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR_GILLET>

Upscale Euro-hip. Hart SLAMS down the phone. Shoves a gun in his belt and exits.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>

Asher, his face obscured with a sweatshirt hood, pulls Todd Ford from the trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>

(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Ford murder was staged and I missed it. Asher drove Ford's car there with Ford unconscious in the car. Ether maybe, GHB. Something that disappears. Asher works out, heads to the parking lot. Pulls Ford out of the trunk. And strangles him. He left a couple of Hart's hairs on the body.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Mr. Hart, not Asher, murdered the Montreal Inspector, correct?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Hart thought Costa was systematically destroying his life. Hart's violent explosion was inevitable.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SENIOR_AGENT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could Asher plan on Hart snapping like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He couldn't. My guess is Asher intended to kill Hart and make it look like suicide. The authorities would find the body and close the Martin Asher file.

	It wasn't?
	</DIALOGUE>

Grace gets in her car.

Grace slaps him. Asher pulls her into a chair. CLICK! Grace is now cuffed to the chair. She struggles futilely against the cuffs. Asher catches his breath.

Grace looking at him. Still astonished to see him. Her arms behind her back, her belly is so vulnerable.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How the fuck did you find me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ASHER>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
<ASHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever since I met you, you're all I can think about. I had a way of life. And I can't go back to because of you. I want you in my life, Grace. Please listen to me, Grace. I have a proposal.

Asher takes out a couple passports, a pair of driver's licenses.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You become her. I become him. We are married, see?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<ASHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have the babies. We raise them. However you want. I just want to be with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Grace looking at Asher, not sure whether to laugh out loud or start crying. He seems edgy; he needs her decision quick.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happens if I don't want to assume this woman's identity and raise my babies with a serial killer?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ASHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grace, don't be morbid. If anyone can deal with this, you can. I know you felt what I felt. It's real.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Answer my question.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ASHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll shoot you in the head and burn this place down.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Grace reacts. She can respect that. Grace looking at Asher. He's scary, feeding off some fantasy about her.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll do what you have to do. I can respect that. How do you know it's still real? Maybe it's gone. What we felt.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Grace tilts her lips, looking in his eyes. Asher leans over to kiss her. Slow, delicate. Asher kneels beside her, the kisses become hungry, desperate. Grace's eyes are so open, so vulnerable.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, I missed you so much.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Asher leans in to kiss her... Grace head-butts him. CRUNCH! Smashes his nose. She drives her feet down and her shoulder into his chest. Asher, already on his knees, falls back. Grace scrambles over him, gets out of the chair. She shoulders over the kitchen table... There is a holster mounted underneath the table. Grace turns her back so she can grab the gun from it. Grace REACTS. There is no gun in the holster. Asher looking at her, matter of fact:
</DIRECTION>
<ASHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I searched everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Asher stands, reaches for the Glock on the counter. Grace can't let him get it. She lunges at Asher, collides into his knees, hurting him.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn you!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Asher grabs a large knife from the butcher's block. THWACK! Plunges it into Grace's belly. Grace GASPS, looking at the knife embedded in her stomach. A beat as Grace and Asher stare at the knife. Grace uses the pause to kick away from Asher. She gets on her feet and runs from the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OLD FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grace exits the kitchen door, running with her hands cuffed behind her. Running for her life. She runs for the nearby woods. Her shoes CRUNCHING through a layer of fresh ice over old snow. Fighting for balance. POP-POP-POP! Asher OPENS FIRE on her from the house. BULLETS HIT the ice around her. Grace runs into the woods. Branches sheathed in ice. Smacking her face. Asher exits the house, FIRING -- POP-POP-POP-POP! BULLETS EXPLODE the ice around Grace. She dives to the ground. She takes the opportunity to move her handcuffs from behind to in front. She unties and removes the heavy prosthetic belly she wears. Grace is not pregnant. She pulls the knife out. Grace runs deeper into the woods. Asher running in the woods behind her. The gun in his hand at the ready. Asher is hunting. He intends to kill her.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep fucking running, Grace, you're only going to die tired!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ON GRACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Running. Batting away ice-covered branches. Drenched with sleet. Hypothermic conditions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OLD PRIVATE ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grace emerges from the woods. Running along the icy road. She slips and falls. Cuts her hand on the ice. Grace stands, and keeps running, her hand bleeding, the knife getting slippery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ASHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gaining on her. Grace slips again, scrabbling on the ice, trying to keep moving. A slow motion nightmare. Here comes Asher. No mercy. He aims the gun at her face...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grace raises her hands to protect her face... POP! Asher FIRES. DING! The BULLET intended for Grace's forehead hits the knife -- RICOCHETS into the trees. A beat. Grace looking at the now-creased knife. Asher's gun is out of rounds. The slide is locked back on an empty chamber. SWICK! Grace slices Asher's legs with the knife. Slices each shin deeply.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Asher kicks the knife from her hand. Then kicks her in the face. He tries to kick her again but she grabs his leg. WHAM! Asher slips, hits the ice hard. Grace is on top of him, wraps the handcuffs around his neck. Wraps her legs around his body. Grace chokes Asher for all he's worth. His eyes bulge, his face reddens as he meets the same fate as his victims. Asher has a seizure as his oxygen depleted brain dies. Grace doesn't let go. A long death embrace. Finally, when she is sure, Grace releases from Martin Asher's body. She checks his pulse. He's dead. Grace stands. The rain falling on her. Ice and moonlight. Grace spits blood, looks around. Looks at Asher's corpse.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>

	Better you than me, asshole.

Walks back toward the house. Alone. Strong. Whole.
