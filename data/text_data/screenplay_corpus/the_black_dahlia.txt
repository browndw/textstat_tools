CREDITS ROLL OVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Black and white newsreel footage from the 1930s. Clips from prize fights featuring two different boxers against various opponents. One a light heavyweight--pure finesse, a counterpunches; the other, stouter and stronger, a headhunting puncher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The intercutting of the two fighters suggests a possible showdown at the end of the newsreel. No such luck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END CREDITS

CLOSE UP ON:

A TRIPLE CARBON LAPD "INCIDENT REPORT" FORM trapped in an old Corona typewriter. The keys pound letters into the blank spaces.

INCIDENT: THE ZOOT SUIT RIOTS...JUNE 10, 1943... REPORTING OFFICER...DWIGHT "BUCKY" BLEICHERT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOYLE HEIGHTS - EVERGREEN AND WABASH - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WORLD WAR II ERA PERSONNEL CARRIER transports twenty silent LAPD officers into the heart of downtown Los Angeles. The sounds of glass breaking and men screaming serves as backdrop for their arrival.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We focus in on BUCKY BLEICHERT, 26, (The counterpuncher from the newsreels) as he jumps from the carrier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky's minus his gun but plus a WWI tin helmet and a three pound truncheon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUCKY'S POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hundreds of in-uniform GI's use baseball bats and two-by- fours to beat the shit out of Zoot Suit-wearing Mexicans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Most of the cops wander to the edge of the race riot and hobnob with the pockets of MPs and Shore Patrol who've chosen to "restore order" by cheering on their countrymen against the outnumbered but equally fierce zooters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sailors shatter streetlights and shop windows. Darkness falls quickly on what Bucky rightly realizes is chaos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Bucky's RUNNING--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
away from the action...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
down a side street and onto a
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUIET RESIDENTIAL BLOCK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slows to a jog, trying to gather his thoughts. And then a voice:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bleichert! Bleichert!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A BUNGALOW COURTYARD - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A POLICE OFFICER has THREE MARINES IN DRESS BLUES and ONE ZOOT SUITER cornered in a center walkway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The marines swipe clumsily at the officer with their two-by- fours as he bobs back and forth on the balls of his feet, dodging the blows like the ex-fighter he is.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I already knew him by reputation, had our respective records down pat: Lee Blanchard, 43-4-2 as a heavyweight, formerly a regular attraction at the Hollywood Legion Stadium.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OVER>
<DIRECTION>
The terrified Mexican stands frozen on one side of Blanchard, trying to avoid the entire mess as the policeman parries the marines' blows with his own truncheon.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE_BLANCHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Code three, Bleichert!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE_BLANCHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky runs into the courtyard and immediately wades in, fending off the marines' blows to jab at them with his stick.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he knew me, Bucky Bleichert, light- heavy, 36-0-0, ranked tenth by Ring magazine in 1937 fighting no-name opponents in no-man's-land division.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OVER>
<DIRECTION>
On instinct, Bucky drops his baton and begins wailing on the marines with his fists, connecting hard punches with soft midsections.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_OVER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In our first year at Central we'd never spoke--but people spoke of us. Opinions about a fantasy Bleichert-Blanchard fight, and who would win.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OVER>
<DIRECTION>
And now Blanchard moves in, lashing vicious truncheon blows to the shoulders of the marines, sending them one by one into a heap.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_OVER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd heard almost all of 'em: Blanchard by early KO; Bleichert by decision; Blanchard stopped on cuts--everything but Bleichert by knockout.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OVER>
<DIRECTION>
The marines reduced to rubble, Lee Blanchard turns his attention to the Zooter: he slaps handcuffs on him and leads him away. He motions for Bucky to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lee turns back to the marines:
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To the halls of Tripoli, shitbirds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
One of them flips Lee off. The Zooter kicks him in the chest as Lee pulls him away from them, laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three men start back toward the riots. Gunshots can be heard. Palm trees blaze up into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (re the Zooter)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Bucky Bleichert, meet Senor Tomas Dos Santos, subject of an all-points fugitive warrant for manslaughter committed during the commission of a Class B Felony. Snatched a purse off a hairbag and she keeled of a heart attack.

Tomas Dos Santos cuffed by his ankles to a radiator. The three men are on their second fifth of Cutty Sark swiped from the kitchen cupboard.

Dos Santos sings a drunken Spanish version of "The Chattanooga Choo Choo" before slumping to his side and passing out.

Bucky covers him with a blanket.

Lee gets up and wanders into the living room. From the kitchen Bucky watches Lee stare out at the flames.

AS WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL

<DIRECTION>
Tomas Dos Santos dying in a large Plexiglas GAS CHAMBER. Bucky stands in the back of the room, forcing himself to watch. He can't stand it and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE FRONT ROW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lee also watches, elbows on knees and chin in hands. He can't stand it, either. He stays.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE HALLWAY AFTERWARDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky watches from afar as men in suits shake Lee's hand and brush imaginary lint off of his BRAND NEW SERGEANT'S STRIPES. Their eyes meet briefly as Bucky retreats to daylight.

AN OLDER OFFICER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
walks by the rookie and rolls his eyes. Catching Bucky's look, the cop throws him a shadow punching one-two. Bucky smiles thinly. Returns to his paperwork. Then another cop passes by and breaks into a bob-and-weave. Bucky looks puzzled and annoyed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs a third cop walking by (TOM JOSLIN).
</DIRECTION>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somethin' up, Tommy?

Bucky nods.

<TOM>

Bucky shakes his head, dismissing the whole thing.

<DIRECTION>
INT. THE RADIO PATROL CAR - ANOTHER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky drives on as the rookie talks and talks...
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Warrants was local celebrity as a cop. Warrants was plainclothes without a coat and tie, romance and a mileage per diem on your civilian car. Warrants was going after the real bad guys and not rousting winos and wienie waggers in front of the Midnight Mission.

All the remaining eyes are on him.

<LEE>

A flicker of anger in her eyes.

Bucky and Lee break into laughter. Bucky sticks out his hand. Lee takes it.

a bony old man sits in a broken chair, aiming a BB pistol at some balsa wood airplanes scattered in the yard.

ON BUCKY'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
disgust and sadness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is DOLPH BLEICHERT, Bucky's father. Bucky approaches, pulling a chair up next to his father. Up close it's even worse: white skin stretched tight over blue veins, yellow rimming his rheumy eyes. Flecks of dirt and vomit on a filthy shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<BUCKY>

He aims the BB gun and fires at an airplane: the gun's empty.

Bucky enters the house. Half-eaten cans of beans on the dining room table, an entire legion of broken balsa wood airplane kits. Alley cats wander in and out of the kitchen, nosing their faces into open tuna fish cans...

BACK ON THE PORCH

Dolph leans on the porch rail. Bucky returns.

Bucky on the phone.

<BUCKY>

Three police cars converge on the scene and a gun battle ensues... Two of the bank robbers are shot as the third man (the one carrying the money) jumps into the truck.

**The general fight storyline is this: a very even and brutal match see-sawing back and forth, Bucky doing all he can to make it into the middle rounds. Somewhere around the fourth or fifth round his competitive juices take over and he begins trying to win at all costs. The two men hurt each other badly, and in the eighth round it's anybody's fight. Bucky punches toe-to-toe with Lee, abandoning his strategy. Lee knocks Bucky out.

Coleman's pulling into the parking lot of THE POLAR PALACE, an ICE SKATING RINK. They follow.

INT. ELLIS LOEW'S OFFICE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lee and Bucky enter the Loew's inner sanctum where they are joined by Russ Millard and Harry Sears. A stack of L.A.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heralds sit on the desk, the top one folded to the headline: "Criminal Division's DA to try for Boss's Job in '48 Primary?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky's look of disgust says it all just as Loew walks into the room--

Lee pulls the car into the parking lot. Jumping out of the car--
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This grand tour stuff's for shit. I'm callin' in some favors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
He heads to a payphone and beings pumping coins into it.

BACK IN THE CAR - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lee gets back in the car. He's pale, sweating.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>

Lee and Bucky roll up on four men loitering on a corner. Three are black and one is white.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hopheads. Let's shake 'em for an address or a name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
As Lee and Bucky exit the car, the four men immediately start the slow walk to the wall, arms over their heads. The white guy glances at Lee:
</DIRECTION>
<WHITE_HOPHEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the---Blanchard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE_HOPHEAD>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up, shitbird.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Lee pushes him closer to the wall and starts frisking him. Bucky starts with one of the other men, pulling out some marijuana cigarettes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of the corner of his eye, Bucky sees the black man closest to Lee reaches for something shiny in his belt--
</DIRECTION>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Partner!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky pulls his .38...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WHITE GUY swings around and LEE SHOOTS HIM twice in the face--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FIRST BLACK MAN pulls a SHIV free and BUCKY SHOOTS HIM in the neck--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER OF THE MEN goes for his trousers, fumbling for something as BUCKY SHOOTS HIM THREE TIMES.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bucky duck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky hits the cement and gets an upside down view of Lee and the last man drawing guns on each other--Lee's three shots cutting down the man before he can fire his tiny derringer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky pulls himself to his feet, stumbling past the blood- covered sidewalk and vomits in the gutter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM THE DISTANCE: THE SOUND OF SIRENS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky pulls out his badge and pins it to his jacket pocket. Behind him, Lee is busy turning the dead men's pockets inside out--scattering shivs and reefers onto the sidewalk away from the blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the while Lee cries like a baby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE 77TH ST. DETECTIVES' STATION - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky and a Detective exit a de-briefing room. Bucky looks worn but composed.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for your time, Officer. And your police work, as well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
They pass another de-briefing area where Lee sits with another Detective. Lee looks terrible, muttering and shivering.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your partner's taking this hard.

</DETECTIVE>
<BUCKY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<DIRECTION>
The detective nods sympathetically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lee and Bucky walk up the front steps where they're met by Kay. She runs to Lee and embraces him.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh baby. Oh babe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
She escorts him into the house. Bucky sees a newspaper on the front porch railing. The evening edition of The Mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Boxer Cops in Gun Battle. Four Crooks Dead."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Publicity boxing photos accompany a full-page article. Bucky begins to read it when he hears from inside:
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave me alone! You'll never fucking understand--
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
A door slam. Soon after the sound of Lee's motorcycle roaring off... After a beat Kay comes outside and sits down next to Bucky.
</DIRECTION>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He knew one of the guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<DIRECTION>
She nods.

<KAY>

	Bobby DeWitt gets out in a week, Dwight. We're on edge. He swore at the trial he was going to kill Lee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can take care of Bobby DeWitt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lee's scared. You don't know Bobby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know as much as I need to know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<DIRECTION>
Kay gives him a look: that's what you think. She gets up and goes inside. Not knowing what to do, Bucky continues reading the paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky wanders inside, obviously fidgety and not wanting to go home. He putters around their living room. From the back of the house Bucky hears the sound of A SHOWER RUNNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky walks back to the bathroom, drawn there by the sound of the drumming water. The bathroom door is open, an invitation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops at the threshold of the bathroom. His POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kay stands in the shower, curtain open for Bucky's benefit. She faces him and he takes in the view of her nakedness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her attitude is not one of seduction, however, her expression passive and fixed even when their eyes meet. She pirouettes for him, showing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SERIES OF OLD KNIFE SCARS CRISS-CROSSING HER BACK FROM THIGH TO SPINE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The history of Bobby DeWitt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky backs away, retreating as he chokes back tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky's awakened by the phone ringing. He pulls the receiver off the cradle but leaves it on the nightstand. From the receiver he barely hears:
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rise and shine partner!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky grabs the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<BUCKY>

	Lee? You okay?

<LEE>

	Sure. Ran Mulholland at a hundred and ten. Played house with Kay all day yesterday. Feel like doing some police work?

Bucky and Lee pull up to a mangy apartment building.

INT. RAYMOND NASH'S ROOM - SOON AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They push the door open to reveal a filthy little flop littered with muscatel short dogs and used rubbers.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okie trash.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
They poke around for a minute, finding nothing. The smell is awful. Bucky goes to a window and pulls it open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV OUT THE WINDOW:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN A VACANT LOT ACROSS THE WAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cluster of uniformed cops and men in civilian clothes stare at something in the weeds. A CORONER'S VAN parks next to three black and whites and two detectives' sedans.
</DIRECTION>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lee.

Lee goes to the window.

</DIRECTION>

Lee and Bucky sprint out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE VACANT LOT - 39TH AND NORTON - SECONDS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Photo men have already begun fanning out and taking photos. Bucky sees Harry Sears take a shot from a hip flask in full view of other officers. Lee and Bucky elbow their way to the front and see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nude, mutilated body of a young woman, cut in half at the waist. Another wide cut down her center reveal an empty cavity--her organs have been removed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her face has been bashed in and her mouth cut ear to ear in a leering smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even the experienced cops are rattled by the scene. They point and whisper and generally begin to fall into disbelief and disorder when
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUSS MILLARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
whistles harshly with his fingers in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSS_MILLARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before this gets out of hand let's put the kibosh on something. If this gets a lot of publicity we're going to get a lot of confessions. So we keep some things quiet. This girl was disemboweled. You keep this information to yourselves. Not your wives, not your girlfriends, no other officers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSS_MILLARD>
<DIRECTION>
The men all nod, coming together as Millard takes control.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSS_MILLARD>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No reporters view the body. You photo men, take your pictures now. Coroner's men, you put a sheet on the body as soon as they're done. Set up a perimeter six feet back. Any reporter crosses it, arrest him.

<DIRECTION>
Millard and Bucky look dawn the street to see cars swinging onto Norton, beelining for the commotion. Reporters and photographers begin pouring out of their cars, quickly coming up against a line of cops keeping them from the body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky makes his way over to Lee, unable to stop staring at the body.
</DIRECTION>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Junior Nash, remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't do this.

Along a bench, five derelict-looking men are manacled to a bench. A cop walks by, notes Bucky's confusion:

	Here's what she wasn't. She wasn't raped, she wasn't pregnant, dried semen indicates voluntary intercourse within the last week...She took what I'd call a gentle whipping in the last ten days...In terms of the nitty-gritty...She was probably tortured with a knife for thirty- six to forty-eight hours before death. The cause of which is either the mouth wound or more likely she was beaten to death with something like a baseball bat.

<VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used a Warrant cops special prerogative and issued an APB on Lorna Martikova aka Linda Martin. I wrote up my day's report, omitting Marjorie Graham's lead on the old dyke. I didn't need Ellis Loew quashing it along with the skinny on Betty as the part-time prostie.

Bucky stands just inside the door watching Lee study the photos, Kay a pace or two back, smoking nervously. Neither of them seem to notice him. Finally Kay sees him:

	Theory on, teach.

</LEE>
<KAY>

EXT. 39TH AND NORTON - DUSK - LATER

Bucky cruises by the crime scene. Rubberneckers gawk around the vacant lot while vendors peddle greasy food and cheap portrait glossies of the Dahlia in a black dress.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CENTRAL DIVISION BULLPEN - BUCKY'S DESK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky sits at his desk staring at RAYMOND NASH'S MUGSHOT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS EYES DRIFT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WAGER POOL SIGN-UP LIST POSTED ON THE WALL: a crude felt craps table with various betting spaces: "Solved--2 to 1", "Random Sex Job--4 to 1", "Uhsolved--Even Money", "Boyfriend(s)--l to 4"...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next to it are TWO HALVES OF A BLACK DRESS on separate hangers...a crude joke.

Bucky opens up his desk drawer and drops the Nash mugshot inside. He dials the phone:

INT. THE SWANK SPOT LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

<DIRECTION>
A dimly lit LESBIAN BAR. Butch women in GI khakis mix with soft girls in cashmere skirt suits.

Bucky approaches a bartender. The woman sizes him up and slides him a whiskey.

<BUCKY>

INT. A DIFFERENT LESBIAN BAR - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time an Olde English motif. Bucky sips another free whiskey as a dozen more women pass the photos around. Bucky watches their reactions closely but doesn't see anything out of the ordinary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes another shot of whiskey and heads out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:

<DIRECTION>
INT. LAVERNE'S HIDEWAY - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tropical motif. Faux bamboo wrap-around booths shield women snuggled deep into the dark corners.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bit buzzed and embarrassed to have to go booth to booth and break up couples, Bucky slowly makes his way around the bar with the two photos. More of the same...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches a woman polishing glasses at the bar. Slides over the photos.

	Black Dahlia.

<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about this girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<DIRECTION>
The bartender picks up the card and squints at it. Bucky sees a flicker of recognition in her eyes. She hesitates--
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never seen her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
He leans over the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you fuckin' lie to me. She's fifteen fucking years old. So you come clean or I slap a contributing beef on you, and you spend the next five years servin' raisinjack to bulldykes in Tehachapi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<DIRECTION>
The bartender looks again at the ID card.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A couple times. Two, three months ago. Just to cadge drinks off the sisters, though. She liked boys, I'm sure. And not the Dahlia. Never.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
Out of his peripheral vision Bucky sees another woman just starting to sit down on a bar stool but at the last minute, change her mind and make for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A baby spotlight catches her face; a fleeting resemblance to Elizabeth Short.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky takes a deep breath, counts to ten and then goes out after the woman.

<DIRECTION>
Bucky cruises by, catching her license plate and writing it on a pack of matches from LaVerne's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In his rear view mirror he sees her exit the car, a striking figure in a sharkskin suit. He watches her walk up the enormous lawn and into the home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A PAY PHONE - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky reads the license plate into the phone. He receives information back and writes it onto the matchbook, as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky lies in his bed, staring at the ceiling. His bedside light reveals a still life: Elizabeth Short's mug shot photo tucked underneath the matchbook. The cover is flipped open and we can see written: "Madeleine Cathcart Sprague".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUCKY'S CAR - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky's listening to The Dexter Gordon quartet on the radio when the tune is interrupted by a feverish voice:
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We interrupt our regular broadcast to bring you a bulletin. A major suspect in the investigation of Elizabeth Short, the raven-haired beauty known as the Black Dahlia, has been captured! Red Manley, a Huntington Park hardware salesman and one of the last men to be seen with the Dahlia, was captured early this morning. Currently being held at Hollenback Station--

INT. OUTSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM - CONT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seems like every cop in town has jammed themselves into a small corridor, watching Russ Millard interrogate RED MANLEY through a one way mirror. Manley is carrot-topped, 25, and scared shitless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Millard's soothing voice can be heard through speakers.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like I said, Robert. We're doing this because you didn't come forward.

</MILLARD>
<RED_MANLEY>

	I've told it three times now. I didn't want my wife to know I was chipping her.

</RED_MANLEY>
<MILLARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you said you didn't chip on her. Betty wouldn't put out. That's no reason to hide from the police.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLARD>
<RED_MANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dated her down in Dago. I slow-danced with her. It's the same thing as chipping.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_MANLEY>
<MILLARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you wanted to fuck her, didn't you?

All of the cops outside laugh.

</RED_MANLEY>
<MILLARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you were in the Army band. You get angry?

<RED_MANLEY>

	I told you. I didn't kill her.

Millard straightens up and turns to the one-way mirror. He tugs at the knot of his tie. Soon after he slips out of the room and Harry Sears slips in.

Bucky turns to Lee.

BACK INSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry leans close to Red, tapping the sap on the table. His stutter completely gone.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY_SEARS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanted some fresh gash, and you thought Betty was easy. You came on strong and that didn't work. You offered her money. She told you she was on the rag, and that was the final straw. You wanted to make her bleed for real--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY_SEARS>
<RED_MANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No no no. Not Betty--
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_MANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry SMASHES the sap onto a glass ashtray, shattering it. Red bites down on his lip, cutting it.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY_SEARS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You plied Betty with drinks, got her to talk about her old boyfriends and came on like a pal, like the nice little corporal willing to leave Betty to the real men, the men who saw combat--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY_SEARS>
<RED_MANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No--
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_MANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry SMASHES the table again.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY_SEARS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You took her to a toolshed, maybe one of those abandoned warehouses out by the old Ford plant in Pico-Rivera. There was some twine and lots of cutting tools lying around, and you got a hard-on...

</HARRY_SEARS>
<RED_MANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No no no--
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_MANLEY>

Again Harry smashes the table. Red almost topples his chair backwards out of fear, only Harry's hand an the back slats keeping it from going over...
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY_SEARS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Reddy, yes. You thought of every girl who said "I don't suck", every time your mommy spanked you, every evil eye you got from real soldiers when you played your trombone in the army band.

Harry smashes the sap down the table once more and then hurls the whole thing over onto its side.

Red fumbles out of the chair onto his knees. He clasps his hands together--

<RED_MANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want...

</RED_MANLEY>

He begins to weep. Completely broken.

Harry turns to the one way mirror, looking straight out at his audience: self-loathing etched into his flabby, juicehound face.

He gives the thumbs-down sign and walks out of the room.

	All I know is you should keep an eye on Loew and his boys. I didn't put it in my report, but Betty sold it outright when she needed money bad enough, and Loew's been trying to keep it kiboshed so it'll look better if he ever takes it to trial.

<LINDA_MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was...cadging at a bar in Gardena. This Mexican man - Raoul or Jorge or something - starting talking to me. I thought I was pregnant, and I was desperate wicked bad for money. He said he'd give me two hundred dollars to act in a nudie film.

Linda looks sadly at Bucky.

<LINDA_MARTIN>

</RUSS_MILLARD>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think she's covering on the Mex angle. Maybe she knows him and doesn't want him taking a smut rap. Maybe he's white. The TJ stuff is sound, though. I'd detach Meg Caulfield from Wilshire Clerical to play cellmate for a day.

A projector and screen has been set up. All the big-wigs are present: Ellis Loew, Jack Tierney, Thad Green and Chief of Police C.B. Horrall. Millard, Harry and Lee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A clerical assistant threads the projector as Bucky settles into a seat next to Lee. On Lee's lap is a newspaper with the headline: "Boulevard-Citizen's Mastermind to be Released --LA Bound after 8 years of Custody"
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Bucky's about to respond when the lights dim and a blurred image hits the screen. It begins to focus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A title: "Slave Girls From Hell"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The movie: A big high-ceiling room with Egyptian hieroglyphics on the walls. Pillars shaped like coiled serpents are stationed throughout the room; the camera zooms in for a close-up of two inset plaster snakes swallowing each other's tails. The snakes dissolve into Betty Short, wearing only stockings and doing an inept hoochie koochie dance...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An audible breath in the muster room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hand reaches into frame, passing Betty a large cylindrical object: a dildo, scales covering the shaft, fangs extending from the circumcised head. Betty puts it in her mouth, sucks it, eyes wide open and glassy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An abrupt cut: Linda Martin, naked, lying on a divan. Betty enters the frame with the dildo; she puts it between Linda's legs, pushing it inside her. Linda rotates her hips, trying her best to fake ecstasy instead of pain and sadness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another cut: Betty mouthing the words "No, please" to the camera. A hand pushing her head down towards Linda's crotch. Betty tonguing next to the dildo...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK ON THE MUSTER ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The atmosphere is somber, but calm. The film continues...

	Long shot, Chief. Harry and I are headed down to TJ tonight. The Mex doesn't play as the killer. But maybe he showed it to someone--
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSS_MILLARD>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Lee jumps up, standing in front of the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who gives a fuck if he didn't kill her! I've sent Boy Scouts to the green room for less than this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>

He yanks down the screen with a crash and storms out of the room. The movie continues on the chalked up blackboard.

</DIRECTION>
<ELLIS_LOEW>

	Goddammit, Blanchard! I got you Warrants. You're my man, and you made me look like a fool in front of the two most powerful men in the Department. If you weren't Mr. Fire you'd be suspended from duty already. You've gotten personally involved in the Short case--

Bucky refocuses on the scene as Fritzie returns, wheeling the sheet-covered table Bucky'd seen before. He whips off the sheet revealing:
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BEDROOM - LATER

Bucky tries to talk but she puts fingers to his mouth. Mouth to his fingers. She undresses him. Slowly she touches him, easing him, bringing him back to earth, back to humanity. To her.

EXT. THE COAST ROAD - NEAR ENSENADA

Bucky approaches Ensenada. The trickle of families headed north has now becoming a roadside migration march. Every fifth of sixth marcher carries a torch or lantern.

EXT. THE CITY LIMITS OF ENSENADA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky cruises slowly into town and the most blatant shakedown he's ever seen:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rurales in brownshirts walk from peasant to peasant in the northbound migration line, taking money and attaching tags to their shoulders with staple guns; plainclothes cops sell bags of beef jerky and dried fruit, putting coins into dispensers attached to their belts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two Rurales pull a man out of line and beat him senseless with the butts of their sawed-off shotguns.

Velvet wall hangings depicting Jesus decorate the entrance hall. Blackshirts lounge on converted pews, a huge carved cross on the front desk betrays its altar origins.

Cn a far wall: boxing publicity stills. He wanders over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE WALL OF STILLS:

A row of light-heavies: Gus Lesnevich, Billy Conn, and Bucky. Three stills over, next to Joe Louis, is Lee's photo. They all look so young...So good...

Bucky walks into the biggest sewer you have ever seen. The bar is a urinal trough where marines and sailors masturbate while going down on nude women squatting on the bartop. Blow jobs are being dispensed underneath tables facing the bandstand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up on the stage a man in a Satan costume is fucking a woman on a mattress. Next to him, a donkey with red velvet horns pinned to his head eats hay out of a bowl while drunken servicemen shout "Donkey! Donkey!"

Bucky is accosted by a disgusting old woman.

He dodges down an alley and cuts down another street, breaking into a slow jog.

And suddenly it's there--sunburned pink skin, blond hair and stitch scars on the eyebrows.

Lee Blanchard. Lee Blanchard. Lee Blanchard.

And Bucky's in Dolphine's truck while Dolphine's screaming for him to wait and Bucky slams the truck in reverse, knocking the burning cross to the ground and grinding out out of the sand onto the road, heading north and leaving Dolphine and Lee alone at the grave...Heading north like a refugee...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Detectives comb through a murder scene as Bucky collects latent fingerprints off doorknobs. No one pays him any attention. He's been relegated to the worst kind of purgatory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE KITCHEN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky and Kay drink coffee and read the morning paper. She absently strokes his free hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky intently reads the front page.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The headline reads: "CITY COUNCIL INVESTIGATES '20s BOOM BARONS FOR SHODDY HOME CONSTRUCTION".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Underneath, a picture of Sprague and Mack Sennett posing in front of the HOLLYWOODLAND sign.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's startled by Kay tapping her finger on the photo.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That reminds me of something, Dwight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky tries to hide his panic.
</DIRECTION>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Floorboard's loose near the closet. Think you could fix it?

</KAY>
<BUCKY>
<DIRECTION>
(relieved)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, babe.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello...Hey Vic...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky writes something on a piece of paper. Hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<BUCKY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotta go. Work-up on a probable gunshot suicide.

	Hancock Park.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A COLONIAL MANSION - JUNE STREET - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky rings the bell. He's dressed plainclothes and carries a technician's canvas bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An attractive woman in her early fifties opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Officer Bleichert. LAPD. My I express my condolences, Mrs.--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jane Chambers. Condolences accepted. You're the lab man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He nods yes. She lets him in and he follows.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE_CHAMBERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the study in back of the dining room. You'll see the police rope. If you'll excuse me, I'll be in my garden.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE_CHAMBERS>
<DIRECTION>
He notices for the first time she's dressed for gardening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE STUDY - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky steps over the police rope and into the study. A large desk chair lies overturned an the ground next to A TAPE OUTLINE OF A BODY. Three feet away lies A SHOTGUN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the chair the brown spattering of blood and brains decorates the white wall and crown mouldings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SERIES OF SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Bucky measures the splatter marks on the walls, scrapes tissue from the muzzle of the gun, dusts it for latent prints, etc. At the end he wraps the gun in a plastic bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Bucky steps over the police rope and walks back towards the main foyer. He stops short.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE OPPOSING WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hangs a disturbing PAINTING: the portrait of a clown, a young boy done up in court jester's garb. His body is gnarled and hunched. He wears a stuporous ear-to-ear smile that looks like one continuous deep scar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is eerily reminiscent of Elizabeth Short's death wound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooked, Bucky pulls his eyes away and settles them on nearby family photos--two young women linked arm in arm.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE_CHAMBERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The other survivors. Pretty aren't they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE_CHAMBERS>
<DIRECTION>
She arrives next to him, dusty with soil.
</DIRECTION>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like their mother. How old are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<JANE_CHAMBERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty-one and twenty-three. Are you finished in the study?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE_CHAMBERS>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Tell whoever cleans it up to use pure ammonia...
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those girls and that family. How do you know them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE_CHAMBERS>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did a little work for them once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<JANE_CHAMBERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Consider it lucky if it was a brief encounter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE_CHAMBERS>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<DIRECTION>
The hallway phone rings. Jane moves to answer it.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE_CHAMBERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back to condolences. Thank you for being so nice, Mr.--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE_CHAMBERS>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bucky. Good-bye, Jane.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Good-bye.

INT. THE CRIME LAB - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky writes up a report. VIC pokes his head in.
</DIRECTION>
<VIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You finish working up the suicide, Bucky?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIC>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Pretty routine. Whattya know about the husband?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<VIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eldridge Chambers? Widow said he was depressed, failing health. The terrible burden of all that money'll get you every time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIC>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wonder how he made it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<VIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No mystery there. Real estate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIC>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE GARAGE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The garage door is open to the evening air. Bucky's heavy bag and speed bag hang on hooks. Bucky leans against a stool, a large box open on the work bench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE BOX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky brushes aside a clutter of junk and pulls out A PHOTO ALBUM. He opens it and begins flipping through: articles and photos concerning Elizabeth Short. MOSTLY PHOTOS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's like a man in a mid-life crisis fantasizing about his high school sweetheart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OFF ONE OF THE PHOTOS WE DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ELIZABETH SHORT CASTING SESSION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Elizabeth Short...Screen Test #5"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rambles on, almost oblivious of the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH_SHORT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I had a fiance, Captain Matt Durand. He was in a tank battalion. A Commander. He had...the fiercest blue eyes. Like the deep water you see from a fishing boat...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH_SHORT>
<DIRECTION>
She's lost in thought...we're not sure whether this is a scene, her real life, or just a sad lie...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE NOISE OF A CAR APPROACHING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky drops the album back in the box as Kay's car pulls into the driveway. He covers it back up.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
<DIRECTION>
(getting out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm...looking for the hammer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<DIRECTION>
She points over his shoulder to the hammer hanging in plain view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BEDROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky kneels on the ground near the closet, toolbox next to him. He pulls on the floorboard, it flexes and squeaks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He uses the hammer to pull the board completely off. He squeezes wood glue around the edges and is about to replace the board when something under the floor catches his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into the hole, pulling out STACKS OF HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS BOUND WITH RUBBER BANDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spies another scrap of paper in the hole...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE KITCHEN - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kay pours two scotches.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dwight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
She carries the scotches into the bedroom and finds Dwight sitting on the floor, staring at thousands of dollars in cash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He holds a paper money band inscribed: "$100...Boulevard- Citizens Bank..."
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>

<BUCKY>

Lee and Bucky, their first day as partners...

</LEE>

<DIRECTION>
Bucky staring back into the hole in the floor...
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>

Lee leads Kay out of the courtroom.

<DIRECTION>
BACK ON THE SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Kay leans down next to Bucky, gently putting her hand on his shoulder...
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then last year...the fourth man--the driver--he heard Bobby was getting paroled. He threatened to tell DeWitt that Lee framed him. He wanted money we didn't have. Ten thousand dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever. Were you ever...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<KAY>

	He used you, Dwight. He did. Forgive him everything else. But don't forgive him for that. Ever.

She reaches for his face and he pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLO-MO CLOSE-UP...

as the crumpled money drops down into the hole in the floor, into the blackness...
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky, stripped to bare chest, attacks the heavy beg.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fire and Ice. The hero and the snitch. Bank robber and his best friend the bumfuck detective. Triggerman. Stooge. Weak point in a fairy tale triangle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OVER>
<DIRECTION>
He lashes into the heavy bag with a series of brutal left hooks. Kay stands in the door, watching him. Her eyes red from crying.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_OVER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would forgive Lee the bank job. And I thought I'd forgive Kay her role in keeping it from me. But the basic rule of Homicide applied: Nothing stays buried forever. Corpses. Ghosts. Nothing stays buried forever. Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OVER>
<DIRECTION>
Kay turns around and shuts the door behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JANE CHAMBER'S GARDEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky and Jane drink iced tea. A glorious garden behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE_CHAMBERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. What brings you around again? Considering a courtin' the old rich widow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE_CHAMBERS>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not that old. And you're not very widowed.

</BUCKY>
<JANE_CHAMBERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You either are or you aren't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE_CHAMBERS>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You seem to be doing all right.

	Eldridge had cancer. I half expected it. We weren't that close anymore...You married?

</JANE_CHAMBERS>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how well do you know the Spragues?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<JANE_CHAMBERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eldridge and Emmett went way back. They served on the California real estate board together. But Emmett was a bit of a crook. My husband got him kicked off the board for building dangerous buildings under phony corporations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE_CHAMBERS>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your husband sounds like a good man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<JANE_CHAMBERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He had his moments. Most of it was out of guilt. He owned slum blocks in San Pedro. When he learned he had cancer, he really started feeling guilty. He voted Democratic last year. Even went in and had meetings with the City Council. I'm sure he gave them dirt on Emmett.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE_CHAMBERS>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I read an article in the paper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>

</JANE_CHAMBERS>
<BUCKY>

	Maybe your husband--

</BUCKY>
<JANE_CHAMBERS>

	My husband was rich and did a mean Charleston. I loved him until I found out he was cheating on me. Now I'm starting to love him again. How strange.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE_CHAMBERS>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not so strange.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<DIRECTION>
They watch each other, enjoying each other's company. A strange emotional peace.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE_CHAMBERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're very accepting of other people's frailties. You're young. You should have illusions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE_CHAMBERS>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a cop. Illusions aren't standard issue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<JANE_CHAMBERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how'd a cop get mixed up with Madeleine Sprague? It was Madeleine, I assume?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE_CHAMBERS>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky's gut clenches.
</DIRECTION>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I stopped her at a red light. One thing led to another. Why do you assume it was Madeleine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<JANE_CHAMBERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't play dumb, Bucky. The girl's a roundheels. Always has been.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE_CHAMBERS>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jane. Don't be catty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<JANE_CHAMBERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. She can't help it I'm sure. She probably inherited it from her mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE_CHAMBERS>

Before Bucky can press Jane stands up with the tray of iced tea. The visit is over.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE_CHAMBERS>

<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God that is spooky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<JANE_CHAMBERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Valuable, too. Eldridge bought it for my birthday a couple years ago. I hate it. Want to take it with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE_CHAMBERS>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<JANE_CHAMBERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, then. You were my best condoler.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<DIRECTION>
Jane gives Bucky a warm handshake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE STREET - HANCOCK PARK - SOON AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky pulls out of June Street, and passes Muirfield. He slows for a moment, squinting down the street, trying to discern the Sprague mansion. He drives on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hang on the sign for Muirfield Avenue as the day turns to night...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And down Muirfield Road, we see Bucky's car parked in the shadows. Watching the Sprague house. A voyeur.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky sleeps soundly as Kay readies herself for work. She watches him for a moment, considering whether to wake him. She decides not to and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The minute she goes, Bucky opens his eyes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MUIRFIELD ROAD - HANCOCK PARK - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky spies on the Spragues. He digs back into his seat as Madeleine comes down the walk and puts mail in the mail box. Just for a second it looks like she sees him...maybe not...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRIME LAB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky dozes, his tie almost catching on fire in a Bunsen burner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE MUIRFIELD ROAD STAKEOUT - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky leans against the window, propping himself up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Madeleine's Packard pulls out and roars up the street. Bucky guns his car to follow...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky follows the Packard into a crowded GI bar parking lot. He parks a distance away. But as he watches Madeleine get out of her car he is staggered:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's ELIZABETH SHORT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Or, more accurately, it's Madeleine dressed up exactly like the Dahlia in one of her famous portrait photos. Slinky black dress, upswept hair, down to the yellow barrette. She strides into the bar...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky ducks into a smoke-filled GI bar where a commotion is already taking place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Madeleine is surrounded by soldiers fawning all over her. Other men simply point and whisper--her Dahlia act isn't lost on anybody. Bucky slides into a booth in the corner to watch. He signals for a drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four bourbons later. Bucky watches as Madeleine settles into a more intimate conversation with one soldier. Bucky downs his drink as Madeleine grabs the GI's elbow and escorts him out of the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky sits in his car in the parking lot watching the soldier loiter outside of A motel room. Madeleine returns from the office with the key and lets the two of them in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches as the light goes on; and then off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S BEDROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky comes into the bedroom to find Kay waiting up for him.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>

</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
He's on top of her, his bourbon stained kisses go and down her neck and her breasts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She responds, but not quickly enough for him. He rushes into her before she's ready. Still, she tries to be there for him, hoping to catch up with his lust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't. And they both know it. They embrace, trying to cover up the hollow awkwardness with familiar affection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It doesn't work...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THAD GREEN'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky sits at Thad Green's desk, penitent.

<THAD_GREEN>

INT. A LIQUOR STORE DOORWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky and a large black man come tumbling out of the liquor store throwing vicious punches at each other.

Bucky in his patrol car. The night a hot sweat. He listens to music on his radio and watches two hookers dance on the corner, waving at cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SCRAGGLY OLD WINO staggers up to the women, stumbling around them, dancing with them. They sneer at him, tell him to beat it.

<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE PATROL CAR

<DIRECTION>
Bucky flashes his headlights at the bum. The bum ignores him. Bucky flashes them again, annoyed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bum looks into the glare and flips Bucky off.

INT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - MORNING
</DIRECTION>

Bucky stands in the middle of the living room, cataloguing the little things. No periodicals on the coffee table, half the record collection gone, no candlesticks.

He picks up the largest chair (Lee's favorite) and throws it at the wall. Next, Kay's rocking chair shatters the glass cabinets. The coffee table goes through the front window.

Bucky yanks out all the drawers, turns over the bed.

IN THE BATHROOM

he takes a pipe wrench to the sink, crushes the mirror with one blow...

	She was a terrible actress. I'm sure folks've told you that. She'd practice in front of the john mirror. Once or twice she got me in on it...Reading parts with her for some audition. She stunk. Even a parent could tell. What Beth was good at was writing. All her teachers used to say that. Not that a grease like me'd know the difference. Maybe she coulda written for the pictures.

Bucky sits at a light, staring north. Scaffolding drapes the Hollywoodland sign. Movie lights have been set up, capturing the event on film.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His attention turns to Christine's Photoplay on the seat next to him; the weekly rag is open to an ad for the Mack Sennett revival:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A reproduction of the Hollywoodland sign across the top of the page, and below it the words "Keystone Kops at the Admiral Theater--Air conditioned!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below that a still from a Keystone Kops movie, registering huge and loud and wrong: Three Keystone Kops standing between pillars shaped like snakes swallowing their own tails; a wall inset with Egyptian hieroglyphics was behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unmistakably the background that appeared in the Linda Martin/Betty Short porn film.
</DIRECTION>

Cars honking behind him. Bucky's transfixed by the image. The light is green.

EXT. A WOODED AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky and Russ play a flashlight over a piece of paper, like two men consulting a treasure map in the woods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the background is a tiny bungalow with the windows blown out and the door hanging off its hinges.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if my hunch was right, we wouldn't have to look any further than one of Emmett Sprague's condemned bungalows. One that was isolated...abandoned...

They walk on, leaving this particular bungalow behind.

EXT. A STREAM - WOODS - LATER

Bucky shines the light in a running stream as they follow it deeper into the night...

<DIRECTION>
Bucky and Russ round a bend in the stream and see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SKELETON OF A BUNGALOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
teetering on the edge of the stream. Empty window and doors hover over a rotting porch like skull sockets over a death leer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bucky and Russ feel it, tensing up as they approach. They pick their footsteps carefully through the broken porch and step into the abandoned house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BUNGALOW - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A scattering of trash in the front room, animal shit, a bicycle tire, rags.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They move through the house, each roam, each closet and corner creeps with potential violence. Still, nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the kitchen:

Bucky joins Russ at the back door, the screen rotted off. Through the empty window they see:
</DIRECTION>

AN ALUMINUM GARDENING SHED, the door wide open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
You know it before they even get there. But as soon as they step inside...

INT. THE GARDENING SHED - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They know something bad happened here...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Half the room is taken up by a mattress, its blue ticking stained dark brown with blood. A gas lantern sits in the corner, leaning against a stack of blood-spattered books, including a copy of Gray's Anatomy and Victor Hugo's The Man Who Laughs along with a clutch of pornographic pictures.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSS_MILLARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God help her.

Bucky's already pulling on a pair of rubber gloves from his SID days. For the first time we notice he's carrying his forensic kit.

	I stayed with her that night and dreamed of all the bullshit that would never happen. Not if I wanted to keep my job at all.

</KAY>

He absorbs the blow and waits for her to continue.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was going to leave no matter what. I didn't know if I was ever going to see him again, and I wanted him to be comfortable if such a thing was possible. Dwight, he knew I was in love with you, and he wanted us to be together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't leave, he ran. He ran from the bank job, ran from the frame on DeWitt. He knew who killed Elizabeth Short and fucking ran away! This whole time. You both knew everything--

	<DIALOGUE>
	Adios yourself back to the Halls of Tripoli, shitbird. I've got business with the lady.

</DIRECTION>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been pointing my gun at a lot of people this week. But I haven't had much of a chance to shoot anybody. Whattya think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKY>
<MADELEINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you'd rather fuck me than kill me. But you don't have the guts to do either. You're a boxer. Not a puncher.

<DIRECTION>
He cocks the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<BUCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How 'bout the Mexican accent you used when you hired the private dick to track down Lee. Let's see the make-up job. Let's see the fucking dress, mamacita, that you wore when you chased after poor daddy's money. Tell me something--you shoot Lee yourself?
