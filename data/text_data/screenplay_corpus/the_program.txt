	<DIALOGUE>
	Allright, bowl bid ridin' here for E.S.U. Fourth down on the Georgia Tech 18. 4 ticks left. Kane sets 'em down.

</SPORTSCASTER_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
INSTANT CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LINE OF TAPED KNUCKLES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
smashing into the mud, as a football OFFENSIVE LINE comes set, frosted breath steaming across to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DEFENSIVE LINE digging in, ready to explode.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON JOE KANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
E.S.U. quarterback, barking signals. The ball is snapped, and we go to SLOW MOTION as the lines crash together in the slop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe rolls to the right, looking downfield. A huge DEFENSIVE END bears down on him. Joe jukes. The end whips on by, grabbing for jersey, slipping off. But big NUMBER 75 is closing the gap. On the run, Joe releases a desperation pass toward the end zone, just as 75 catches him and buries him face-down in the swamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We FOLLOW THE BALL, spiraling through the slanting rain. RAY GRIFFEN, black running back, glances back for it, two DEFENSIVE BACKS with him. All three leap in unison, climbing as high as they can, clutching, clawing for the ball. The ball floats down, kisses off the tangle of fingers, splashes to the ground, and rolls to a stop in the mud. Incomplete. The BANG of the final gun snaps us back to LIVE ACTION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe on his knees in the muck, stares at the goal line, then drops his head in defeat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SAM WINTERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Betraying little emotion, Coach SAM WINTERS, wiry, intense, early 50's, takes off his headset, lets it drop, heads across the field.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER_1>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coach, this is the second year in a row you've failed to go to a bowl game. Do you feel your program's in decline?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER_1>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coach Winters stands outside his office surrounded by reporters, a bouquet of microphones stuck in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
(keeping his cool)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we're just a young team on the verge. We'll be back in a major bowl next year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
Elsewhere in the locker room, we pick up a weary, mud- splattered Joe Kane taking off his pads in front of his locker. ALVIN MACK, black linebacker, comes by. Alvin exudes danger; big, fast and hostile on the field, slightly surly, a sense of repressed anger off it.
</DIRECTION>
<ALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good throw, Joe. It was there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALVIN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So was half their team.

(trailing off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
ON COACH WINTERS AGAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
still fielding questions.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You still need a deep threat or a breakaway back to go with Joe Kane. What are you gonna do to address this need?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER_2>
<COACH_WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
(a little edgy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop wastin' my time talkin' to you guys for a start.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
As Winters gets up to go, we hear:
</DIRECTION>
<WILSON>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not gonna lead you into the fog here, Sam...
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
INT. CHANCELLOR WILSON'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHANCELLOR GRANT WILSON, 60, grey-haired eminence, sits behind his desk. Seated across from him are Coach Winters and GALEN HOWARD, 50, the Athletic Director.
</DIRECTION>
<CHANCELLOR_WILSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm concerned about our Program. It's always been a source of pride to our students and alumni, but two straight so-so seasons are having a damaging effect on our fund-raising, both public and private.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHANCELLOR_WILSON>
<WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
(half-joking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then stop raising the entrance requirements on me. We never could have gotten Alvin Mack in here under the new guidelines.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<CHANCELLOR_WILSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As Chancellor, my first responsibility is to the academic interests of this University.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHANCELLOR_WILSON>
<DIRECTION>
Wilson points to a representation of a football field affixed to the wall. A football rests on the 40 yard line, which is marked 160 million. The end zone (60 yards away) is $400,000,000.
</DIRECTION>
<WILSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At a time when we're committed to a 400 million dollar building program, alumni donations are down 15% the last two years. Because they've also voiced their displeasure to their legislators, we can expect a corresponding drop in state funds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILSON>
<HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Athletic Fund is suffering too. Season tickets sales are off, merchandising's slow...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOWARD>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You layin' all this at my door? There's been a recession on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<CHANCELLOR_WILSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but the heaviest drop has been from the big donors, the 100,000 dollar club. These people are recession proof. They sit in my box every game, and they're much more generous when we're ranked and going to bowl games. Two of them, as you know, are on the Board of Regents, including the Chairman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHANCELLOR_WILSON>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you trying to say to me, Grant? After 12 years, my job's in jeopardy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<CHANCELLOR_WILSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not prepared to discuss your job right now; I just want you to be aware of the situation. The alumni and the legislature are unhappy and they vote with their checkbooks. I don't pretend to be an expert on football, Sam, and I'll deny that this conversation ever took place, but I do know we need to win next year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHANCELLOR_WILSON>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coach Winters flanked by two assistant coaches, HUMES and CLAYTON, walks down a cavernous tunnel beneath the stands to a waiting car. At the end of the tunnel, a scarecrow EFFIGY of Coach Winters hangs from an overhead pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
(ignoring the effigy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tickets are in your coat. Itinerary and player profiles are in your briefcase. We got a 9:00am tomorrow in Philly with this kid Darnell Jefferson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
Coach Winters stops, looks up at the effigy. Humes and Clayton fear an outburst, a display of rage.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like I've lost weight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
That's it. He strides on. Humes and Clayton race to catch up.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAYTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This kid's the gamebreaker we've been lookin' for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC STARTS. TITLES BEGIN.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Had a 108 yard kickoff return against Taft. Michigan's been down to see him twice.

</COACH_CLAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ST. LUKE'S HOME FOR BOYS - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Winters, Humes, Clayton and Joe Kane sit across from DARNELL JEFFERSON and REVEREND WALLACE in a tattered parlor room. Other boys of various ages and color look in from the adjoining door. Darnell is black, good-looking, street-hip, the letters D.J. shaved in block letters into his fade.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darnell, you have the potential to start for us as a freshman. That 108 yard kickoff return you made against Taft? One of the greatest runs I've ever seen a high school player make. Now, Michigan is set at tailback for two years. You won't play till you're a junior. With Joe here gettin' you the ball, runnin' 28 Thunder right, you'll be All-American with us as a Sophomore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<REVEREND_WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but I'm really more concerned with Darnell's education. He came here late. He's got some catching up to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVEREND_WALLACE>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believe me, education is the first priority in our program. That's why all the players are smarter than me. After all, a football coach is smart enough to understand the game, but dumb enough to think it's important.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
This gets a little chuckle from the Reverend. It was intended to.

EXT. RURAL SOUTH CAROLINA TENANT FARM - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Two rooms. Dirt floor. Two-foot Christmas tree on an apple cart. Alvin Mack's MOTHER opens a Christmas present as Alvin and his TWO SISTERS look on. It's an ENGRAVED LIONSHEAD DOORKNOCKER, the kind you'de find on the door of an affluent home. The inscription reads THE MACK'S. Alvin's mother thinks it's beautiful, but isn't sure what to do with it.
</DIRECTION>
<ALVIN_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's real pretty, Alvin.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COACH WINTERS' HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Winters' daughter LOUANNE, 20, is on the phone with her father. Louanne is sexy, clothes too tight, but good-natured, somewhat needy and loyal as a labrador. She holds a hopelessly out-of-style sweater her dad's given her for Christmas.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(lying)

INT. SMALL BRICK HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe sits on the couch with his older brother, FRANK, watching the bowl game he would have been in, had E.S.U. won their last game. His FATHER, a grizzled man in his fifties, nods in and out in a tattered armchair. All three have been drinking beer, their empties scattered around. Frank tosses Joe an Iron City beer.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have another Vitamin I, Joey. Didn't think we'de see you here this Christmas, little brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE_S_FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
As Joe's father heads for the kitchen, he hangs his empty beer can, by the pull tab, on a branch of the Christmas tree. We see that the whole tree is covered with cans.

</DIRECTION>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coach Winters has been telling me about you. I'm looking forward to seeing you when you come to visit. I'll be your guide. You are coming to visit aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DIRECTION>
We PULL BACK and REVEAL Autumn in an office with 15 other telephones, a coed on every one. ASST. COACH MYERS supervises with a clipboard of names and numbers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TUNNEL OF WOLFDEN STADIUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe leads Darnell down to the end of the tunnel, where Autumn is waiting. He introduces them. She's even more attractive than Darnell thought she'd be.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes Darnell's hand and leads him out onto the field where he's greeted by the E.S.U. BAND playing the school fight song. The CHEERLEADERS whip into action, legs kicking, pom-poms whirling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The band parts and Darnell walks out into the 90,000 seat stadium, an awesome sight for any young man. Autumn points to the giant DIAMOND VISION SCOREBOARD. Darnell's name and picture appear. The stadium P.A. ANNOUNCER cuts in.
</DIRECTION>
<P_A_ANNOUNCER>

Romantic, Ivy-League look, lit by soft-glo footlights. Darnell and Autumn walk, side by side, stopping outside Autumn's dorm.
</DIRECTION>
<DARNELL>

</DARNELL>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope so, Darnell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DIRECTION>
He leans down to kiss her. She hesitates, not sure about this, then comes forward, kisses him on the lips, starts to let it deepen, then breaks it off.
</DIRECTION>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DIRECTION>
As he watches her go up the steps, we go to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BOYS HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Early February: It's National Decision Day and Darnell's home is under seige. Reporters. Microphones. Television cameras. Darnell steps out onto the porch wearing an ESU jersey with #1 emblazoned on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you know where I'm going and what we're indubitably going to be.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hot, late summer day. Over the deserted Quad, we see the title: 6 MONTHS LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It fades and we MOVE TO REVEAL a city BUS pulling up at a curb adjacent to the Quad. Off steps Darnell, carrying one battered suitcase. Joe Kane and BUD LITE KAMINSKY, offensive line tackle, are there to greet him.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BROWNING ATHLETIC DORM - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Joe and Bud usher Darnell into his room.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's your room. If you need anything call the hall manager.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE 911 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

College hang-out, bar, catering to athletes and their admirers. A black HARLEY DAVIDSON, driven by Joe Kane with Darnell on the back, pulls up at the curb. They get off, head inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE 911 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe and Darnell pass a table of three girls, conspicuous among them is Louanne Winters. Joe and Darnell give her a nod and proceed on to a table where three fellow players wait: Bud Lite, BOBBY COLLINS, good-looking, silver-tongued ladies man and 2nd string quarterback, and STEVE LATTIMER, heavily muscled, surf-punk defensive end. Between them is a large pitcher of beer.

	</DIALOGUE>
</LATTIMER>
<DIRECTION>
Bud takes a good-natured swipe at him. Lattimer deflects it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe notices Bobby looking over at Louanne. She gives Bobby a surreptitious little wave to come over and sit with her. He gives her the "just a minute" sign.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You still seein' Louanne?
	</DIALOGUE>

</ALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Joe drains his beer, pours another. Lattimer starts to read form the article.
</DIRECTION>
<LATTIMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to this. "E.S.U. has a solid nucleus returning, but the Timberwolves, coming off two disappointing seasons, will only go as far as the strong right arm of Heisman Candidate Joe Kane will take them." That right, Joe? You gonna lead us to the promised land?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LATTIMER>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna lead... but can you follow?

EXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd from the 911 (Bud, Alvin, Lattimer, Darnell, Bobby and Louanne) follow Joe down the hill behind the bar toward a busy two-lane highway. Joe, a little drunker than the others, starts HOWLING at the moon like a Timber Wolf. The others join in.

<DIRECTION>
JOE'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cars and trucks blast toward us, roar on by, right on top of us, honking, spraying grime, shaking the asphalt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud and the others on the side of the road are increasingly worried now.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck this shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Pissed off, Bud sprints out to the white line. The draft- wake of a passing truck almost blows him over.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Joe, that's enough. Let's get the hell outa here. What if somebody drifts or crosses the line to pass?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter, Bud? Can't you follow?
	</DIALOGUE>

Bud hesitates a second, scared, but stung by this dare.

	<DIALOGUE>
	God-damnit, god-damnit. Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Bud can't fight it. He lies down on the line, his head touching Joe's feet. Joe begins to HOWL again. Bud joins in. Alvin and the others can't believe it.
</DIRECTION>
<ALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Startin' to look like a loaf of Wonder bread out there.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeh, and there's nobody from the Defense out there.

</LATTIMER>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby and Lattimer look at each other a beat. Time to ante up. Both turn to Alvin.
</DIRECTION>
<ALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you lookin' at? You think you're bad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Alvin snorts in disgust and starts out onto the blacktop. Bobby and Lattimer smile, go to follow. Louanne grabs Bobby, holds him back.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(vaguely sexual)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby, be careful, o.k? Please, be careful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby smiles, grabs her ass, pulls her to him, gives her a long, passionate kiss, then sprints out to the white line, leaving her breathless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alvin, Bobby and Lattimer lie down in front of Bud. Now there's a line of five, a human highway median. Everybody scared shitless, howling their lungs out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louanne and Darnell watch from the side of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This guy do this kinda shit a lot? They never mentioned this in recruiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Joe laughing wildly, jumps up and they all scramble back to safety. Out of breath, but pumped up, they exchange exhilarated high fives. Alvin just shakes his head.

<DIRECTION>
INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Twenty freshman football players, including Darnell, are scattered at tables around the room, writing furiously in test booklets, as a PROCTOR paces the room. Darnell starts to write an answer, stops, stumped. Worried, he looks at the clock, goes on to the next page.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darnell and Joe walk across campus. Darnell carries a gleaming, chromed TROPHY with a football player on top. He's still thinking about the test.
</DIRECTION>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know... I left a lot of 'em blank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, you'll do all right. Lotta people don't finish.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeh.

</DARNELL>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doin' with the trophy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coach Winters asked me to bring it to the meeting. I don't know what for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Darnell sees Autumn walking across the Quad.
</DIRECTION>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see ya at the meeting.

<DIRECTION>
(handing him the trophy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take this for me, will ya?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Joe starts to protest, but Darnell is already off, racing across the Quad, quickly catching up with Autumn.
</DIRECTION>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Autumn, hold up! What're you doing here? I thought students didn't come back for two weeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<AUTUMN>

(rather coolly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came back early to see a friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DARNEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're looking fresh, Autumn. A package of pulchritudiness. What about getting together later tonight? Maybe get a pizza? They got pizza in this town don't they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNEL>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about tomorrow night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think it's a real good idea for us to see each other, Darnell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter? I'm not good enough for you all of a sudden? Too young, is that it? I'm not, ya know. They held me back a year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's not that... I've got a boyfriend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you have this boyfriend when you showed me around?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<AUTUMN>
<DIRECTION>
(reluctant to admit it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, it didn't seem to bother you then. I'm willing to overlook it now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was mad at him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I caught him with another girl. A white girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you're still with this nigger?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<DIRECTION>
She nods, slightly embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I got to get going, Darnell. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to lead you on. I'm glad you came here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DIRECTION>
She starts walking away.
</DIRECTION>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. I can at least walk with you, can't I? Nothin' wrong with that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<DIRECTION>
She speeds up. He speeds up.
</DIRECTION>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm in a hurry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can keep up. I run the forty in four-four.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<DIRECTION>
She's just about to say something when RAY GRIFFEN arrives. Ray's the starting tailback, black, handsome, clean-cut, well-spoken, middle class.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Autumn --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
This is exactly what Autumn didn't want to happen. Ray and Darnell eye each other like a couple of roosters.
</DIRECTION>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Ray. This is...

</RAY>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. That's why they recruited me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Autumn can't believe he said this. She starts to interject something to break the tension, but never gets the chance.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The two guys they recruited before you are handing out Gatorade now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(making the jerkoff motion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better start strengthening your wrist.

<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll see.

<DIRECTION>
(departing, to Ray)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Give my best to Miss Lilly.

Autumn's mortification is complete.

EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Establish the new, modern KELLER CENTER, home of the E.S.U. Athletic Department.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KELLER CENTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The football meeting room. A quarter amphitheatre. The Freshman, including Darnell, down in front. Nervous, talking very little, eyes playing over the pictures of former E.S.U. greats arranged on the Wall of Honor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them, the Upperclassmen, bantering, conversation punctuated with laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A door opens. The Assistant Coaches file in. The room hushes immediately. Coach Winters walks in. The Upperclassmen break into applause; the Freshmen quickly take their cue and join in.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good to see you again, gentlemen.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(catching sight of Darnell)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jefferson, either take off the earring or put on a dress.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
The upperclassmen hoot, as Darnell, embarrassed, takes off his earring.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanna talk a little about what we're trying to do here. There are many highly respected people who feel football is about preparation for life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
The players nod reverentially at this established axiom of the football cannon.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These people are full of shit. You see, football is not like life.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's better. More exciting, more intense, more fun. In life, people are always wondering how they measure up; whether they're getting ahead or fallin' behind. In football, you know. Every week you get a chance to show what you're made of, a chance to demonstrate the physical and personal qualities that all those poor bastards who can't play this game are left to agonize about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
Spreading smiles all around. It's good to be a football player.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last year we didn't make enough of those chances. Last year everyone felt we let the school down. Fuck the school. We let ourselves down.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to the Wall of Honor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We let down a great tradition, a 120- year-old Line of Champions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
The smiles are gone. Lots of set faces now. Shame. anger, retribution.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any football program worth the name is a special brotherhood, an elite corps of warriors, a select group of knights. That first time our starting unit takes the field, the first time we huddle up; that's our inner circle, that's our Round Table. If I were an upperclassman, I'd be real nervous about my seat, cause we got some very talented new-comers this year. Guys who want a place at the Table.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the trophy one of our freshman, Darnell Jefferson, won as a Pennsylvania State High School First Team All-American. You know what this says to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
The freshmen are hanging on every word.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a god-damn thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
He smashes the trophy on the podium, breaking it in half, shattering the base. Darnell and the other freshmen are agog. The upperclassmen stifle laughs, particularly Ray Griffen.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
(to the freshmen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody here was a high school All- American.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to all the players)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever any of you have done before is out the window. We're startin' over. Ground zero. The Table is empty. Are you ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
The upperclassmen nod, steely, purposeful. We go to the freshmen. They're not so sure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. E.S.U. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

Passing drills. Joe Kane takes a snap, fades to pass, throws an out. The ball sails two feet over the receiver's head. Joe's angry with himself.
</DIRECTION>
<COACH_CLAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
(to Winters)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's too pumped up. Tryin' to win the damn Heisman on every throw. I'm not sure he's ready for all this hype.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COACH_CLAYTON>
<COACH_HUMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little late to be worryin' about that. If we don't follow up the Sports Illustrated cover with something, it'll look like we didn't believe in our own player.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COACH_HUMES>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, Joe's a tough kid. He'll be allright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scrimmage. Joe hands off to Darnell. He sweeps right, cuts it up, blows past the end. In a spectacular display of broken field running, Darnell breaks to the sideline, cuts back, eluding the corner back, and stiffarms the safety. Alvin, pursuing the play, finally tackles him from behind, stripping the ball at the same time. There's a wild scramble for the fumble. Darnell is crushed under the pile, as the defense recovers it, ruining an otherwise brilliant run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The players unpile to reveal Darnell, writhing on the ground, the wind knocked out of him. Ray Griffen runs by to take his place.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIFFEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, nice writhing, Jefferson. You got all the moves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIFFEN>
<WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting to the team)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Allright, move it up. Let's go, 15 yards, run the next play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
The scrimmage moves up 15 yards leaving Darnell behind. Winters sprints over to Lattimer, grabs him by the face mask.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut the necktie tackle horseshit. You think you're in some kinda highlight reel? He left you huggin' air. Target his guts. Drive right through his abdomen. I wanta see snot bubbles in his nose. I wanta see shit in his underwear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
Lattimer nods chastised. Winters moves over to check on Darnell.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You injured, Jefferson, or just hurt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DARNELL>
<DIRECTION>
(gasping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're hurt, you can still play. If you're injured you can't. Are you hurt or are you injured?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'm just hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O.k., then get up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
Winters extends a hand. Darnell grabs it, struggles shakily to his feet
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice run. Think what it coulda done for us if we still had the ball.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(handing him the ball)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a football. I want you to carry it with you wherever you go. Never let it out of your sight.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the rest of the team)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any of you see him on campus, take a swipe at the ball. Try to knock it out of his hands. Recover it.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If anybody, but you, returns this ball to me, you'll wish you'de never been born.

<DIRECTION>
Winters, mad as hell, is berating his assistant coaches who are sitting, cowed in his office.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see tackling, but I don't see hitting. I see effort, but I don't see ferocity. What do you think, they're gonna motivate themselves? Football's just a game to most of these kids. This is our program, our livelihood. It's our job to make them care as much about it as we do. Make them hate me if you have to. It'll bring them together, give them a focus. So get off your butts and put the fear of God in these guys.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dead tired players toweling off, dressing. The trainer's room is crowded with aching, cramped-up, contused players. Across the way, Lattimer lifts weights, alone in the weight room. Clayton and Humes consider this from outside Winters' office.

Winters, who's heard all this, comes by.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides, it's not that hard to put on 35 pounds in a summer, if you really hit the gym.

Winters walks on into his office. Clayton nods, realizing this subject is now closed.

INT. DARNELL'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darnell walks in, wrung out from the day's practice, stumbles to the bed where he sees something that stops him - lying there is his PENNSYLVANIA STATE ALL AMERICAN TROPHY. Coach Winters actually smashed a replica. A smile appears on Darnell's tired face.

</LATTIMER>
<ALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Long as you're in the program, they'll get you through. Maybe not with a degree, but they'll keep you eligible. Just don't do nothin' embarrassing they can't cover you for.

</ALVIN>
<LATTIMER>

</ALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Darnell's stung by this. He'd like to think of himself as capable of more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Coach Winters appears at the door, a surprise visitor to the training table. All the players wearing baseball caps, quickly doff them. Winters is angry.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter with you guys? You're supposed to be a team. Winning depends on thinking and acting and going to war together. But you don't even eat like a team. You eat like two teams. A white one and a black one. What do I have to do? Make out a seating chart? Now get up. Move around. Mix it up. Now!

The players all look at each other, then reluctantly get up and change tables. Darnell sits next to Joe.

He turns and walks on out. Immediately, the players begin to drift back to their old tables.

INT. WEIGHT ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Joe, Bud Lite and Bobby Collins, all suffering from various aches and pains are getting Naperson and analgesic balm out of the non-prescription drug cabinet. Joe pops a Nap and looks across to the weight room where a stunning co-ed CAMILLE SCHAEFFER works a knee lift. Camille's the perfect marriage of Southern patrician beauty and athletic confirmation. Joe leaves the others, heads over, pokes his head in.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, I don't date football players. They're all full of themselves. I saw you on the cover of Sports Illustrated, so you're probably worse than most.

Camille stops her knee lift, turns to Joe. We think she's going to fire on him. Wrong.

SMASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMILLE - TENNIS COURTS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
smashing a two-fisted forehand right at us, grunting with the exertion. Joe scrambles to get it back, but Camille's a world-class player. She attacks with a vengeance, blasting every shot ala Jimmy Connors, as Bud Lite and Bobby Collins watch, amazed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We begin a SERIES OF CUTS detailing Camille's relentless dismantling of Joe: Camille drilling a backhand down the line, Joe barely getting it back to the net. Camille hitting a powerhouse service ace, Joe lunging and whiffing the return. Camille crushing another forehand. Joe crushes it back, sends it over the fence and into the parking lot. Camille serving again at match point. Joe pops up a weak return. Camille puts it away with a powerhouse overhead, the ball almost knocking Joe down. He flings his racket against the fence. Camille comes to the net to shake hands, but Joe hangs back.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for the game, Heisman. You took it really well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<DIRECTION>
And she walks away along to the net. Joe goes after her, pissed.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this Heisman crap?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Camille's taken aback, not realizing she'd struck a nerve.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say anything about being a Heisman candidate. I don't go around strokin' myself about it. So what's this shit you're givin' me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... I'm sorry... I just figured you were probably kissin' yourself in the mirror every morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<JOE>

	You figured wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Now Joe walks away and Camille goes after him.

<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what do you want, an apology? I just gave you one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want a rematch.

</JOE>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A rematch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some other sport. I took my beating. You owe me one. Either that or we go out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Camille considers, tries to figure out what she'd dislike least, knowing it'd be cheap to choose neither.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll think about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<DIRECTION>
Camille walks off, disappearing through the gate. Joe walks off in the other direction. Bud Lite and Bobby follow.

INT. ACADEMIC ADVISOR'S OFFICE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darnell sits across from WILLIAM SMITH, Academic Advisor.
</DIRECTION>
<ADVISOR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darnell, I've reviewed your placement test and I'm afraid you failed to meet our entrance requirements in two areas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADVISOR_SMITH>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does that mean? I can't play football?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<ADVISOR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It means you're going to have to take some remedial classes, what we call "zero level" courses. Specifically Math 0 and English 0.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADVISOR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
Darnell is clearly deflated by this painful indication of his academic standing.
</DIRECTION>
<ADVISOR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't get college credit for them, but they will help you prepare to take the Placement Test again at the end of the quarter. If you pass at that time you'll be able to officially enter the university and take college level courses. You'll still be able to take an American History survey course, but it won't count on your record until you pass the Placement Test. But first things first. To start, I'm approving a tutor for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADVISOR_SMITH>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A tutor? I don't need no tutor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<ADVISOR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any tutor. And yes you do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADVISOR_SMITH>

INT. ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A meeting of the football brain trust; Coach Winters, Athletic Director, GALEN HOWARD, a publicist, SHARON BRAVER, and the Sports Information Director (S.I.D.) LARRY NICHOLS. Also present is Joe Kane, somewhat discomfited at being the center of all this attention.
</DIRECTION>
<HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think both Joe and the university are best served by a straightforward Heisman campaign. Nothing too gimmicky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOWARD>
<BRAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've compiled a mailing list of around 1300 opinion makers; newspapers, football writers, and sports anchors. First we send them a packet on Joe and his achievements. Bio, stats, plus human interest stuff; commitment to academics, charity work, etc. Then we update it each week with a postcard. Heisman voters hate opening envelopes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAVER>
<DIRECTION>
Joe is increasingly uneasy with all this.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't really done any charity work...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<BRAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gonna start. We've got some things lined up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAVER>
<NICHOLS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unfortunately, because we weren't in the top 20 last year, we only have one network T.V. game to give Joe national exposure. Although it's a good one; Michigan. But we'll also be taping all our other games and buying satellite time. That way we can produce our own highlight package and interview pieces and send them out to T.V. stations all over the country for their sportscasts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICHOLS>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any questions, Joe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
If Joe was uneasy before, he's overwhelmed now. He tries not to show it. After all, who could turn down a Heisman campaign? Still it's a megaton of pressure.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, no... I just... you really think I got a shot to win this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell, yes. Plus it's a good thing for the program. Publicizes the school, gives a boost to recruiting, and it's a great thing for you. Jumps up your draft position, the size of your first contract, everything. It's a hell of an opportunity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<NICHOLS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All you gotta do is back it up on the field, and we have no doubts about that, cause we know "Kane is Able."
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICHOLS>
<DIRECTION>
Nichols holds up a black CAMPAIGN BUTTON with the phrase "Kane is Able" enblazoned on it in gold letters. This gets a rise out of everyone except Joe, who's still not sure about all this.
</DIRECTION>

The phone rings. Camille, who's been asleep, rolls over and answers it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

	Then I'll pick you up tonight at 6:00.

INT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Autumn sits at a tutorial table, looking at her notes. She becomes aware of someone approaching. She looks up to see Darnell.
</DIRECTION>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Autumn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Darnell. What are you doin here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My advisor says I need a tutor. Ya know, just to get me over a couple rough spots.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(showing her a paper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw your name on this list. I figured if you couldn't keep my attention, nobody could.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Darnell, but I've already been assigned. You're gonna have to find somebody else. I'm tutoring Scott Sherman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not anymore. I asked Coach Winters to switch us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coach Winters wouldn't do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeh he would. I'm a bigger prospect than Sherman.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing across the way)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a lineman on the scout team.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Autumn looks back to where Darnell is pointing. Sure enough, SCOTT SHERMAN is hard at work with another Tutor. Autumn can't believe it. She tries to compose herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darnell sits down across the table from her.
</DIRECTION>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon Autumn, you could teach me some real erudition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<AUTUMN>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to whisper, pissed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you stop using those big words. It sounds ridiculous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>
<DIRECTION>
(serious about this)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What doya mean? I'm improvin' myself. I learn a new word out of the dictionary every day. Mendacious, pejorative, antithetical, commensurate...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you don't ever use them right. Pretending to be smart is not the same as being educated. Or erudite. It's just a con. And it makes you sound stupid, no matter how big a prospect you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DIRECTION>
Darnell is genuinely hurt by this dose of reality. His customary bravado melts away.
</DIRECTION>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O.K... even more reason for you to be my tutor. You already taught me something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Autumn, disarmed by his sudden humility, has no real rebuttal. She would have had to tutor him anyway, but now she's having trouble being angry about it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALVIN MACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At another table, looking distracted and bored as his TUTOR reads his history assignment to him. Alvin takes out a walkman and puts the headphones on. WE HEAR A HORN BEEP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMILLE'S DORM - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camille comes out the front door, summoned by the horn. She stops at the sight of something. We REVERSE TO REVEAL Joe on his Harley.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We goin' on that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeh. I thought we might take a ride.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I promised my dad I'd never get on one of those.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you, one of these trust- fund princesses? It's fine for me to play a game I don't know, but I ask you to try somethin' different and you hide behind your daddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He holds out a motorcycle helmet toward her, daring her. She burns, but her competitiveness makes it impossible for her to decline this challenge.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMILLE>
<DIRECTION>
(snatching the helmet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. But we go slow. No cowboy stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe smiles and kicks the starter. Camille climbs on and they roar off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just outside town. Joe and Camille come down the highway at moderate speed. Camille's hanging on for dear life, but we can tell she's enjoying it.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This speed, o.k.?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeh, fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe immediately accelerates, throwing Camille's head back. Her SHRIEK is lost in the whine of the engine, as they speed away from camera.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Slow down, damnit. Joe... Joe!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<DIRECTION>
They approach a high-banked turn, beyond which appears to be a long, sheer dropoff. Joe looks back at Camille, smiles devilishly, not looking where he's going. Camille sees they're heading straight for the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMILLE>
<DIRECTION>
(freaked)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe, look out!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<DIRECTION>
Too late. Joe brakes, fishtails, but goes over the top of the bank, off the edge, flying out into oblivion, Camille screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON HARLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it plops down onto a wide LEDGE not visible from the road, three feet below the top of the bank. Joe lands it, skids to a professional stop, breaks into raucous laughter. Camille jumps off the bike, scared stiff and livid with anger.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could you do that, you stupid punk? It isn't funny, god-dammit, you coulda killed us! You're crazy, you know that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it easy. I've done that a hundred times. No big deal.

	Oh, yeh? Then why are you shaking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(embarrassed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know... I guess cause I've never done it with someone else on the bike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just wanted to scare me. Are you happy now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeh, pretty much. And the scream was even better than I thought it'd be. Every dog within hearing distance wants to mate with you now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Camille's ready to throttle him, then something catches her ear. Sure enough, there are SEVERAL DOGS BARKING in the distance. Joe smiles at her. She looks away, still angry, but amused in spite of herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROADSIDE BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Working class, sawdust floor, George Thoroughgood's "Who Do You Love" on the jukebox. Camille and Joe are sitting in a booth. Joe putting away the beers.

<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	No, my dad owned a place like this.

</CAMILLE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your dad? You mean he owned a chain of these?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not everybody with a Southern accent has their own plantation. My dad could never afford to send me here. I learned to play tennis on public courts. Mighta been able to play pro someday, if I hadn't hurt my knee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're just a scholarship jock like me.

Joe gets up, takes Camille's hand and pulls her to her feet. They dance to a slow song.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're crazy for jeopardizing your scholarship and a pro future by jumping motorcycles off of highways.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just tryin' to keep my edge, Camille. The other guys look to me cause they think I'll do anything. I lose that, I'm just another guy, and we all get our ass kicked.

</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
Joe hesitates a second, then reluctantly hands over his motorcycle keys.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you, as long as you're in this program, you don't take unnecessary risks off the field. A man in contention for the Heisman Trophy should be able to remember that.

</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't know that much about him. He was off in Detroit workin' in a car plant when I was born. Got laid off, tried to rob a jewelry store to get us some money. He died in prison. Some kinda heart problem.
	</DIALOGUE>

Autumn wasn't ready for this level of hardship. She tries to press on gamely.

	How about your mother?

</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounded more interesting than the truth. My mom took a vacation to Chicago when I was 12. Never came back. Don't know who my dad was.

Autumn's anger melts away in the face of this painful truth.

</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I started hangin' with the J.B.M., gang-bangin'... Did some time in the Hall. Reverand Wallace saw me playin' football on a juvenile probation team. Took me in, got me into high school. Only reason they accepted me was 'cause I could play football. Sorta like here. Football saved my life. I'd be nowhere without football.
	</DIALOGUE>

Autumn just nods, still trying to take this all in.

	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DIRECTION>
Autumn rips free of his grip, and walks out of the party too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darnell sits alone on a bench under an old Willow, just staring out at the night. He hears a voice behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So where you wanna go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns. It's Autumn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The party's still in full gear. Ray is now chatting up a few of the groupies. Joe and Bud Lite sit off in a corner. Joe's knocked back several beers. He's a little tipsy, and lost in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe she's out with some guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who? Camille? I don't think she's the type to screw around on ya. Shoot ya, maybe...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wouldn't be screwing around. It's not like we're going together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe's gaze falls on a sultry brunette, SHERI, at a table across the way. She's eyeing Joe big time. She wants him. He stares back at her. She doesn't blink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camille, carrying an armload of books, comes down the library steps, having been studying late. As she heads for her dorm, she sees Joe and Sheri going across the Quad; Sheri draped around Joe, nuzzling him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe looks over, spots Camille, stops; surprised, embarrassed to see her. They exchange a look. Camille, upset, turns and wheels off. Joe wants to say something to her, but can't get it out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON DARNELL AND AUTUMN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We don't know where yet, but they seem to be slipping and sliding, clutching on to each other.
</DIRECTION>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right, nobody would ever see us here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK TO REVEAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near closing time. Darnell and Autumn lurch and stumble around the ice, collapsing against the boards now and then. There are few other skaters at this hour.
</DIRECTION>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I figure the key is to go places only white people go. Next time we'll go bowling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Autumn laughs, as the house lights start to blink, indicating it's closing time.
</DIRECTION>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Plus I saw this in Rocky. I never believed a guy who was supposed to be an athlete would skate that bad, but now I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<DIRECTION>
They make their way to an opening in the boards, stumble over to a bench, begin to unlace.
</DIRECTION>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, that was fun, sort of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were pretty good for the first time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's not really my first time. My dad took me skating once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He used to play ball for E.S.U., didn't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, how'd you know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw his picture on the Wall of Fame. You got his eyes. Luckily, you didn't get his thighs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<DIRECTION>
She laughs, looks at him a beat, starts to come forward to kiss him. He puts a finger to her lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make sure you mean it this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<DIRECTION>
She hesitates a beat, then comes forward again. They fall into a deep kiss. We PULL BACK to LONGSHOT. Two people alone in the expanse of the ice rink. The lights flicker and go out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WEIGHT ROOM - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camille, unable to sleep, enters in her workout clothes. Languid, melancholy, she goes to the treadmill, as Joe comes out of the steam room with nothing but a towel around his waist. Both are surprised to see the other.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doin' here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Couldn't sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just sweatin' out some of the beer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Camille just nods. Long, silent pause.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't go home with her. I thought about it... but I didn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You drink too much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns, starts toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't I what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go home with her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know... I guess I figured maybe there was somethin' goin' on between you and me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Camille hesitates, not sure whether to believe him, then gets off the bike and walks toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why'd you pick her up in the first place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was drunk... I needed some company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CAMILLE>
<DIRECTION>
(angry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Company? Yeh, I can see you havin' a real far-ranging discussion with Sheri.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, ya know, physical company... I was... I just needed to pounce on somebody I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Camille, really steamed now, snatches the towel from around Joe's waist, leaving him naked.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why can't you pounce on me? Aren't I good enough to pounce on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<DIRECTION>
Camille snaps the towel at him, driving him back. Joe's totally thrown by this reaction in her.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you're more conservative... classier... you're not that kinda girl...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
She snaps the towel again, backing him against the training table.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMILLE>
<DIRECTION>
(insulted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know? You've never slept with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<DIRECTION>
She pounds on his chest, pushing him back on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What makes you think she's such a great ride?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(climbing up on top of him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm prettier, my legs are longer...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pulling down her leotard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got better tits.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(exasperated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would you go to her, when you have me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know I had you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CAMILLE>
<DIRECTION>
(softer, leaning close)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well you do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her a beat, then pulls her mouth down to his. They fall into a long, white-hot kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TRAINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe and Camille are making love passionately, energetically. Camille, still worked up, rolls up on top.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMILLE>
<DIRECTION>
(between kisses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shoulda looked for me at the library, or don't you ever go there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(rolling back on top)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I go there. I got a 3.2 in Political Science. I just don't go there on Saturday nights.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<CAMILLE>
<DIRECTION>
(rolling back on top again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a paper due Monday. What'de she do? Sit on your lap or just give you the nail-me stare?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up, Camille.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe rolls back on top, the momentum carrying both of them off the table and out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HUGE LECTURE HALL - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some 100 students are taking a history test in blue books. A T.A., checking attendance, walks up to Louanne. She's uneasy as the T.A. checks his chart.
</DIRECTION>
<T_A>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</T_A>
<LOUANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby Collins.

</LOUANNE>
<T_A>
	<DIALOGUE>

Louanne knows she's in deep trouble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COACH'S VIDEO ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A high-tech room full of video machines and monitors used to run simultaneous views of different positions during the same play. A grim-looking group of assistant coaches approaches Winters as he runs through and reprograms the images on the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAYTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coach, we, ah... got a problem with Bobby Collins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAYTON>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<CLAYTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He talked... a friend... into taking a test for him and got caught. They had a new T.A. in there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAYTON>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the penalty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<CLAYTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, the rules say automatic expulsion for both of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAYTON>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fortunately, we've got friends on the Board of Regents. I think we can beat this if we really go to bat for him. We got Mack off when he turned in that other guys term paper.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what kinda idiot would do something like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<CLAYTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I guess Bobby figured he was gonna flunk...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAYTON>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mean Bobby. I mean what kinda guy would be dumb enough to take a test for him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<CLAYTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, well... it wasn't a guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAYTON>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A girl? Typical Collins. He must have banged her until she couldn't think straight. Who was it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<CLAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
(barely able to get it out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was... Louanne.

Winters' face goes dead.

INT. COACH WINTERS' DEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Winters, enraged, is venting his spleen at Louanne.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, Louanne, how could you be so stupid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<LOUANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... he was behind, he needed help. I'm sorry. I just...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUANNE>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry! You're sorry! You've destroyed my credibility at the University, my authority with the players... Christ, it looks like I'm running a dirty program. And Collins of all people! What the hell's the matter with you, Louanne?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<LOUANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(crying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know... I thought he... loved me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUANNE>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Loved you? He loves anything that winks back, the little rat bastard. And what are you gonna do for school now? I use my influence to get you back in, it'll stink to high hell. The press'll crucify me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<LOUANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get in someplace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUANNE>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, Louanne, I told you to stay away from my players. That was my cardinal rule, stay away from the damn players...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<LOUANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've always been good enough for you. Good enough to devote your life to. Why aren't they good enough for me? Or are they too good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUANNE>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're changing the subject, Louanne. We're talkin' about you breakin' the rules.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<LOUANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you ever break the rules just a little? Didn't you tell me once that 90 per cent of the schools obey the NCAA rules, and the other 10 per cent go to bowl games? Was that just a joke?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUANNE>
<DIRECTION>
She gets up and walks out of the room. Winters closes his eyes and slumps down on the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STUDY HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darnell sits at his table waiting for Autumn. Autumn storms in, obviously upset about something. She slaps a corrected test down in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You seen this? You got a D on your math test.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeh, I kinda figured that. I had some trouble on this last part...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We went over that last week, Darnell. What is this time we spend in here? Just a joke to you? I don't even think you've been listening to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been listening to you, baby...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't call me baby. I thought you wanted to learn. But if all you wanta do is fake your way through, then get another tutor to waste time with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Autumn, we just had a good time, and now you're gettin' all nuts behind this. It's just one test.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So far, it's the only test. I want you to study this whole chapter. By yourself, without me here. When I come back, we'll discuss it. Be ready to do problems based on it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever you say, Teach.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(big grin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't wish to be cast in a pejorative light, so I'm dedicating myself to achieving on a level more commensurate with my abilities.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head and walks away. Darnell's grin fades. He looks at his test, a hint of tears in his eyes. He's embarrassed and deeply worried.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FOOTBALL LOCKER ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The players are dressing for Monday practice, but it's strangely subdued. Bobby Collins opens his locker to find a BULLET-RIDDLED PRACTICE JERSEY hanging inside. Immediately the rest of the players burst into raucous laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD_LITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coach'd probably shoot ya lower.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD_LITE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the room goes silent. Standing in the doorway is Coach Winters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He says nothing, looks around the room, the players avoiding his gaze. His eyes come to rest on Bobby. Bobby tries to hide the shirt, but Winters has seen. Winters just stares at Bobby a beat, then.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You all played a fine game on Saturday. Take the day off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
With that, he turns and walks out the door. The players remain silent. Bobby throws the shirt in the trash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOUANNE'S SORORITY HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Winters walks in the front door, past the desk, up the stairs and down the hall to his daughter's room. She's packing her things. He goes over to her, takes her in his arms and hugs her tight. Neither speak. A tear rolls down Louanne's cheek. Hits the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HALL OF ATHLETIC BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A very nervous Bobby Collins comes down the hall and knocks on Coach Winter's door.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon in, Collins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COACH WINTER'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby enters and stands across from Winters' desk. Winters doesn't invite him to sit.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Coach, I just want you to know I'm really sorry about this whole thing with Louanne. I was real glad to hear she's gonna be goin' to junior college here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
(cutting him off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby does. Instantly.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could easily take your case to the Board of Regents. You've had no prior infractions and I could argue that you were under abnormal pressure.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I won't. You embarrassed me, you embarrassed my family, you embarrassed the program. As of now, you are no longer a member of this university or it's football team. Clean out your locker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby just stands there a beat, in confusion and disbelief. There is no wavering, no sympathy in Winters' eyes. Finally, dazed and disoriented, Bobby turns and walks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Joe is posed in front of the school library, one of it's more photogenic buildings. T.V. sportscaster LYNN SWANN and his video crew wait to interview him as a MAKEUP GIRL finishes applying makeup to Joe's face. Publicist Sharon Braver watches like a hawk.
</DIRECTION>

An assistant marks the take, and Swann turns to Joe.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A phalanx of photographers crowd around, snapping away as Joe goes through passing drills.

	...knowing that you're going head to head with Heisman rival, Tim Waymen?

</SWANN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY, THE PRESENT AGAIN
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>

<DIRECTION>
INT. T.V. STUDIO - NIGHT

</BRAVER>
<SWANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?! What's the problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANN>
<DIRECTION>
Braver takes Joe aside, talks to him confidentially.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you're saying is true, of course, but I don't think it's the message you want to send.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAVER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PIZZA PARLOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe and Camille are sharing a pizza, but not alone. A video spotlight shines on them, as yet another crew rolls tape.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAVER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It makes you seem a little nervous. Like the pressure might be getting to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAVER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - THE PRESENT AGAIN
</DIRECTION>
<BRAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This game is nationally televised, so most Heisman voters will be watching. I think a more casual approach is better. Modest, controlled, casual.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAVER>
<DIRECTION>
Joe nods and heads back in front of the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<SWANN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Braver, irritated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge bonfire burns, as a large segment of the student body has gathered in front of the Timberwolf statue. The cheerleaders, all wearing "KANE IS ABLE" buttons, whip the crowd up, as Joe is introduced on the podium.
</DIRECTION>
<SWANN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you feel any added pressure this week, knowing that you're going head to head with Heisman rival, Tim Waymen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANN>
<DIRECTION>
The cheerleaders begin to chant, "Let's go, Joe." On "Joe", they assume the Heisman trophy pose. Joe seems slightly embarrassed by it all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - THE PRESENT AGAIN
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>

Camille stops, turns back, sees Joe headed for the tracks, starts to worry.

Joe reaches the grade and steps into the middle of the tracks facing the oncoming train. Horrified, Camille runs down the embankment toward him.

As the train approaches, it's horn blaring, Joe lies face down on the tracks, his hands gripping the railroad ties. Camille arrives at the bottom of the hill in time to see the train race over him. She falls to her knees screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under the train, we see Joe desperately hugging the ground, head down, toes dug in, hands clutching the ties. It's like a tornado under there, dirt debris flying everywhere, his clothes flapping wildly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train passes. Camille looks up, afraid to breath as Joe lies motionless on the tracks. Suddenly he stirs, pushes himself up to his knees. She lets out a scream of joy, races toward him, as he gets to his feet, stumbles off the grade. She hugs him to her, tears streaming down her face, helps him over to the embankment.

My dad, brothers, uncles -- we all drink and sooner or later we all fuck up. My dad went the longest. Waited till he was playin' triple A ball, before he hit the wall. Sometimes I feel like I'm just waiting for my turn. The better I do, the closer it gets.

Joe's P.O.V. through HELMETCAM. He pushes the lunging safety away, turns back just in time to be blasted by the OTHER SAFETY he never saw. Joe is knocked down, over the goal line and out cold. The crowd goes wild.

Joe fakes to Darnell, fades to pass. The Michigan cornerback comes on a blitz, locked on Joe. Joe starts to roll, but knows the corner will catch him. On the run, he launches the ball toward Darnell.

	The edge in the much ballyhooed battle of the quarterbacks would probably have to go to Michigan's Tim Waymen who threw for 2 touchdowns, and ran for another. Joe Kane accounted for three E.S.U. touchdowns, but had that crucial interception in the waning moments. And that proved to be the difference.

Not the 911 we saw earlier. Joe sits at a table in the back, with Darnell, drinking tequila with a beer chaser. Both are down in the dumps. At a nearby table there's a group of TOWNIES and their GIRLFRIENDS.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coupla real college heroes, huh? Tearin' up the town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First time I ever lost a girl and a game on the same day. Guess I never really had the girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Joe looks up to see one of the townies' girls, DEBBIE, giving him the once over and a little smile. Joe smiles back, not really interested. Debbie's BOYFRIEND notices.
</DIRECTION>
<BOYFRIEND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know that guy?

</BOYFRIEND>
<DEBBI>

	Then why you smilin' at him?

</BOYFRIEND>
<DEBBI>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBI>
<BOYFRIEND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what? So you go and smile at him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOYFRIEND>

The boyfriend, drunk and looking for trouble, goes over to Joe's table.

<BOYFRIEND>

<BOYFRIEND>

	Wise guy, huh? Mr. bigtime quarterback. The one who choked his ass off today. You got nothin' better to do then look at my girlfriend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOYFRIEND>
<DIRECTION>
Joe says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<BOYFRIEND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Heisman, I'm talkin' to you. You too good to talk to me?

</BOYFRIEND>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not even interested in talkin' to you.

	You think you're a bad ass? You think my girl's hot for you? Take your pads off, you're just another pussy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOYFRIEND>
<DIRECTION>
Joe gets up to go. The boyfriend grabs him, Joe pushes him away. The guy charges Joe. The bar owner rushes to the phone as a full scale brawl begins. Joe takes a blow, knocks the boyfriend back into a table, knocking beer bottles to the floor. The boyfriend falls on one, opening a deep gash in his shoulder.

	<DIALOGUE>
	The guy went for me first. What was I supposed to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't make any difference. It made the papers, all the wire services. The guy had to go to the hospital. Worst of all they got you on drunk driving. You had a blood alcohol level .50 above the legal limit. We can't smooth that over, Joe. It'd look like we were sprayin' Pledge on bird shit. We had to agree to send you to Rehab.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rehab? I'll be a god-damn joke. You can't do this to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was the only way we could get them to drop the assault and D.W.I. You go to trial on those, we lose you for a year, and risk NCAA investigation. C'mon, lotsa athletes have been through Rehab.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not in the middle of the season. Not in the middle of a Heisman campaign.

</JOE>
<WINTERS>

	You'll only miss four games. You'll be back in time for the last one, Georgia Tech, and a Bowl if we get there. Plus, you've still got your senior year.

	Yeh, but what will I come back as? What kinda player?

	Darnell, I'm sorry about Saturday. It was an awkward situation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTUMN>
<DARNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't awkward. It was educational. I realized how you see me. I'm good enough to tutor, to go places with, but not to tell your father about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARNELL>
<AUTUMN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not it. It's just that my father expects me to be with somebody like Ray. He wouldn't understand us.

INT. JOE'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe finishes packing his bags. He sees a picture of Camille on the dresser. Picks it up, looks at it a beat, drops it in the trash. He carries his Heisman cardboard standup into the shower, pulls out a match and lights it. He watches it catch fire, then grabs his suitcase and walks out of the room. We hold on the burning standup, as flames lick at Joe's smile.

</HOWARD>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's he wanta do now, cut practice down to once a week?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, he's happy with the way the season's gone so far. The Alumni have pretty much stayed off his back, but with Joe out now, it could all be up for grabs again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOWARD>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He thinks he's gonna have trouble marchin' the ball down the old fund- raisin' board, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>

<HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The facts are, all we have left are freshman quarterbacks, and nothin' I saw at practice today, convinced me that any of them are ready to step in.

	Look, just because you're Wilson's boy all of a sudden, doesn't mean I'm gonna let him make me look like a fuckin' whore.

</WINTERS>
<HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't give me that high and mighty shit. There's a lotta people on the bubble here. Four straight loses and we're out of bowl contention. How's that gonna make you look? If you're too stupid to consider your own situation, then maybe you oughta think about your assistant coaches. They've got families to feed too.

INT. BOARD OF REGENTS HEARING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The seven members of the BOARD OF REGENTS sit on one side of a long rectangular table, the Chairman in the middle. On the other side are coach Winters, Bobby Collins, the President of the Faculty Senate, EDWARD LEARNIHAN, Academic Advisor, ARTHUR SHANE, President of the Student Body, RICHARD FOWLER, and Galen Howard. Fowler is addressing the board.
</DIRECTION>
<FOWLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Therefore, I respectfully submit that Bobby Collins should not be given special treatment just because he's a football player. Would a regular student get a reinstatement hearing if they'de been caught cheating? Nobody's talking about letting the girl who took the test back in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOWLER>
<DIRECTION>
Winters could kill this kid.
</DIRECTION>
<LEARNIHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's also instructive to look at some of the courses this young man has taken. Beginning Golf, Voice and Speech Improvement...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEARNIHAN>
<SHANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to point out that Mr. Collins was still on schedule to get his degree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANE>
<LEARNIHAN>

(pointing to Collin's transcript)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In what, Swimming Pool Management?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEARNIHAN>
<CHAIRMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like to respond, Coach Winters?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAIRMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Winters rises, sweating, less from nervousness than from the odious nature of what he has to do.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know much about all this other stuff, but I do know the punishment should fit the crime. Cheating's bad, but I don't think it deserves a life sentence. Here's one of those athletes who takes college level courses, who wants to graduate. I think Bobby Collins made a big mistake, but he's already been suspended for several weeks. He's served his time. I think he deserves a second chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<LEARNIHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like Alvin Mack? We gave him a second chance and since he's had 5 incompletes, 4 withdrawals and still reads at a fourth grade level. You're using his body to make money for the Athletic Department -- you, yourself, are making three times what the Chancellor is -- but obviously no one is making an effort to see that this kid gets an education.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEARNIHAN>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's helpin' to pay for your physics lab too. If you're willin' to go without a new office, maybe I could hold him out a few games. Save his body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<CHAIRMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAIRMAN>
<SHANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alvin was way behind in school when he got here. You can't make up for, in four years, what it took 18 to create.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANE>
<LEARNIHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then he should never have been admitted in the first place. It's not fair to other students who worked hard to get here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEARNIHAN>
<HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it fair to exclude kids who come from inferior schools? You hold everybody to the same standards, you're discriminating against the poor kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOWARD>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most of my players are farm boys, inner-city kids. Football is their deliverance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<LEARNIHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Deliverance from what? A valid education?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEARNIHAN>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You throw Bobby Collins and Alvin out, you take away their futures. In Alvin's case you probably cost him a couple million dollars in the pros.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<LEARNIHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this is not a football vocational school. It's an Institute of Higher Learning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEARNIHAN>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeh, but when was the last time 80,000 people showed up to watch a kid do a chemistry experiment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<CHAIRMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, please, let's get back to the business at hand, Bobby Collins. As you know, I played football here. And I remember how hard it was to practice and then study when you're dead tired. So I have some sympathy for this young man. But I never cheated, so the real question is his character. Since you know him better than anyone else in this room; and having talked to him and observed him over the last several weeks, do you feel he's learned his lesson? In other words, can you vouch for his character?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAIRMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Winters would rather cut off his own head with a razor blade.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
(it's killing him)

<DIRECTION>
Coach Winters is in his video alcove watching footage of his upcoming opponent -- it's like he's looking through it though, his mind elsewhere, something boiling up inside him. Suddenly, he smashes his fist into the screen, breaking it into pieces. His hand bleeds. He doesn't care. He just sits there and seethes.

Joe gets unsteadily to his feet. He feels sick. Winters reaches out to shake hands. Joe does not reciprocate. Hides his right hand behind his body.

	Shit, Lattimer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
Alvin pursues the play as the ballcarrier heads for the corner, then suddenly cuts back. Alvin has overrun the play slightly. We go to SLOW MOTION as he turns and is hit with a wicked CRACK-BACK BLOCK by the guard he taunted. Alvin's leg flexes at a horrifying angle. We HEAR THE SNAP of bone and tendon, as Alvin plummets to the ground, writhing in pain, grabbing his left leg.

The E.S.U. defensive line digs in. Lattimer tries to suck up his remaining strength.

Iowa runs a blast to Lattimer's side. He fights through one block, the ballcarrier coming right toward him. They meet in a titanic collision at the goal line. The back keeps driving, twisting. Lattimer tries to hold him, but weaker than he was on steroids, is unable to. The back falls over the goal line. Touchdown. IOWA 13 E.S.U. 10.

Lattimer hangs up, picks up a HYPODERMIC. Stares at it a second, sweat beading on his forehead. Then plunges it an inch deep into his thigh. Pulls it out, sits on the bed a beat, then picks up a barbell and begins to pump it furiously, biceps bulging.

They break and the E.S.U. offense comes to the line. Collins calls signals. We go to SLOW MOTION as he fades to pass. Darnell fakes a block, then rolls out for a screen pass. Georgia Tech's defensive line comes hard. Bobby flips the ball over the charging defenders. Darnell catches it, gets a good block from Bud Lite, then tucks in behind Ray who is out ahead blocking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's only one linebacker to beat and Darnell will be into the secondary. Figuring Ray will block the guy, Darnell begins to look for the safeties. Ray, however, barely brushes the linebacker, who doesn't even break stride. He lowers his head, and drives into Darnell, his helmet hitting the football. Fumble! There's a scramble. The Yellow Jackets free safety comes up with it.

Darnell cuts it up and blasts over the safety at the goal line. Touchdown, E.S.U.

The Georgia Tech quarterback fakes to his fullback, hands off to his TAILBACK on the countertrap. The tailback runs behind his big, pulling tackle, both right at Lattimer. Lattimer takes on the tackle, sheds his block. The back lowers his head, starts to power into Lattimer. Lattimer lets out a fierce yell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smash! Lattimer explodes into the tailback, the collision lifting the back off the ground, whiplashing his neck, vibrating his helmet. Lattimer's legs churn, driving the tailback back and into the ground. We see the back's face. There are snot bubbles in his nose. No first down. No way.

Darnell fields it at his 12, starts toward the right sideline, where hemmed in, he looks like dead meat. Suddenly, he reverses his field, racing for the opposite sideline, where a picket line of blockers awaits him, if he can get there. He turns on the jets, barely beating two tacklers to the corner, and then turns it up the left sideline, picking up a wicked series of crack-back blocks, until he's finally run out of bounds at the Yellow Jacket 35 yard line.

Joe starts to call signals as Bud Lite sings "Bali Hi." We go to SLOW MOTION as the ball is snapped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Georgia Tech defense fires off the line, throwing everything at Joe. Joe drops back five steps. Bud Lite picks up a blitzing linebacker, knocks him over a fallen player. Joe looks for Darnell in the corner, but another pass rusher breaks through, forcing Joe out of the pocket. It's wartime as tackles and blockers collide, hand-fight, go down, scramble up, collide again, all in pursuit of Joe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darnell, realizing Joe's in trouble, breaks off his pattern and heads to the center of the end zone. Joe dodges one tackler, shakes free of another's ankle tackle, heads back for the center of the field. He spots Darnell breaking between defensive backs. Just as he's buried by two massive linemen, Joe fires a rocket down the middle toward the sliver of open space that Darnell is heading for.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ball barely clears the hands of a lunging linebacker. Darnell and two defensive backs, one from each side, close on the ball as it cuts through the air, a perfect spiral. Darnell dives. The two defensive backs dive. The ball passes between their outstretched hands by a fraction of an inch, landing in Darnell's. He clutches it to his chest, rolls over, holds the ball up for the ref to see. Touchdown! This time Darnell does go into his touchdown dance.
