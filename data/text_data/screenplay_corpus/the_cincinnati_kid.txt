:SC: FADE IN: SERIES OF ESTABLISHING SHOTS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exterior scenes of St. Louis, particularly the riverside industrial district. Even more important to establish than the place is the time: end of summer, 1936. Election posters would help, with the Republican ones stressing such themes as "Burst the Roosevelt Bubble," "Save the American Way of Life," "Vote for Landon and Knox."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FACTORY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the most typical scenes of the day: a mass picket line outside a textile or shoe factory. And the picketing is anything but peaceful; the demonstrators are in direct conflict with the police, who are trying to keep an entrance open for strike-breakers. Whatever the general action, a small segment of struggle breaks off from it, and it is this that our CAMERA picks up: some police chasing some pickets or some pickets chasing some strike-breakers, the one faction pursuing the other up an alley with violent intent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A couple of the pursuers catch up to the pursued and assault them with clubs or other weapons. The fighting is bitter, dirty and noisy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN IN SLEAZY RESTAURANT NEAR RAILROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The eight men gathered here in a game of five-card stud are clearly removed from the struggle outside, even though the SOUNDS of it are very close, coming through window opening on the alley. In fact the noise is so loud that the DEALER of the hand in progress reacts in annoyance.
</DIRECTION>
<DEALER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody shut the goddam window. Let a man think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEALER>
<DIRECTION>
The player nearest the window shuts it. The Dealer, who also owns the restaurant, is the talkative type of poker player. Except for THE CINCINNATI KID, the other men at the table look like hoods of one sort or another: gunmen, labor spies, extortionists, what have you. The man who fancies himself the toughest of them all is named DANNY, and he and The Kid have almost all the money on the table between them, about a hundred dollars in front of each. No other player has more than a few dollars left, and now, as fifth cards are dealt, there is about forty dollars in the pot. Only four men are left in the hand.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Interested?

</DANNY>
<FIRST_PLAYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wouldn't call you if I had a pair higher'n sixes. Which I ain't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_PLAYER>
<DIRECTION>
He turns over his cards, leaving it up to The Kid.
</DIRECTION>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't seem like he'd bet out without something better than the sixes, does it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(fingers hole card as if to fold)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cost me every cent I've won since yesterday afternoon.

(studies Danny's face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I tell you, I got this stubborn streak. Call the ninety-four dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<DIRECTION>
He counts out the money, which is almost all he has.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(indignantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't have better than a pair of kings!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm not claiming anything that fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns over an eight,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	making a pair of
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just enough to beat the pair of sixes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You seen my hole card, you bastard!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating Dealer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was dealing them high.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Attending to first things first, The Kid has been pulling in the pot, adding it to his own stake, and pocketing the total. Now as Danny accuses him again, The Kid looks him squarely in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You stole that dough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You better watch those loose lips of yours, you want to have any teeth left behind them -- Buster.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<DIRECTION>
He stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wouldn't of shelled out ninety- four bucks --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I called you on account of I didn't think you had another pair or another six and I know a punk like you would get greedy and try and buy the last hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<DIRECTION>
He walks off, disappearing through a door marked "MEN."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MEN'S ROOM - THE KID AT MIRROR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is waiting when the door opens abruptly, and Danny appears, his right hand in his coat pocket. The Kid's hand goes to his own pocket and as he whirls around, a straight razor appears in it, its blade snapped open. Pushing Danny to the wall with one hand, he keeps him pinned there with the razor in the other, while he bolts the door. Danny gets his right hand out of the pocket with a gun in it, but The Kid moves the razor blade against his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<DIRECTION>
As the gun clatters to the floor, and the others force the door, The Kid takes a step backward to provide enough momentum, then swings at Danny's middle with his left, dropping him, then jumps up on the wash basin and wriggles his way out through a window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSE: MAIN TITLES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny recovers his balance and his gun, unbolts the door just before it is smashed in, and runs with the others to get out of the building and after The Kid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY BACK OF RESTAURANT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The conflicting parties from the picket lines have moved on. The Kid drops from the window to the ground and starts to run toward the railroad yards. A few moments later, Danny and four other poker players appear and run after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RAILROAD YARDS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chase across the tracks goes on behind the Credits. The Kid's pursuers split into two groups to cut him off, and they seem to have succeeded in cornering him against a track on which a passenger train is bearing down, headed for the station. His dubious chance of escape depends on his getting beyond this track in front of the train, which, with a burst of speed, he manages to accomplish just in time. The passenger train divides The Kid from his pursuers, and we PAN with the train into the depot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNION STATION, ST. LOUIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train slowly stops. Amid all the atmosphere of arrival in a day when the Pullman car was still the ultimate in travel, LANCEY HODGES appears on a platform, takes his bag from the Pullman porter and passes it on to a Red Cap before he has descended the steps. He walks with other passengers and Red Caps toward the center of the station.

	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOOTER>
<KID>

	But then everybody'd see he wasn't right and it wouldn't prove nothing. Listen, we got to have it understood. If he's not right, we call it off till he is.

He looks at her fondly and, for one fleeting moment of weakness, is actually tempted to tell her about Lancey. But it is too sharp a break with tradition.

INT. KID'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is night and the room is lit only by a single lamp where Christian sits in her nightgown on a chair by the window, turning over the pages of a mail-order catalogue. In f.g. The Kid lies on his back under a sheet on the bed, his eyes closed and his hands clasped tensely behind his neck. He opens his eyes and turns to look at her. The movement catches her eye, and she instantly stops turning the pages, afraid the noise has disturbed him.
</DIRECTION>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right. You don't have to act like a cat. You're not bothering me.

	Why can't you sleep?

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stands up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you have a nice hot bath? I could give you a rubdown and then you could have a nice hot bath, and then maybe you could sleep.

She waits at the foot of the bed for him to come slowly to a decision.

<KID>

	'Kay. Can't hurt to try it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<DIRECTION>
She goes into the bathroom, where she turns the water on gently so the tub will take a long while to fill. Then she takes a bottle of alcohol from the medicine chest and returns to the bedroom with it. She stands in front of him waiting for him to move, but The Kid is singularly listless. Not till she sets the bottle down does he respond by turning his face to the pillow. She goes right to work on his shoulder muscles, and she seems to know what she is doing.
</DIRECTION>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you do with yourself this time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last night I went to a movie with The Shooter's woman. French movie.

</CHRISTIAN>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In French?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They had the words in English at the bottom of the picture. But The Shooter's woman knew what they were saying without it. Pig's woman or somebody told me she went to college.

<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Majored in man-eating.

<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know you ran with The Shooter's woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got to be kind of friendly when you both were in that three-day game down to Cairo. 'Course she's older'n me.

<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And been around more. A lot more. What was the movie like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Weird. It wasn't a straight story where you knew whose side you were on, the way you do in regular pictures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTIAN>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	American pictures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. There were lots of things I didn't understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTIAN>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was it about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there's this town in Europe a long time ago where they get a message from a Spanish general he's coming to spend the night with his troops. So all the men are scared silly about what the soldiers will do to them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTIAN>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing weird about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But all the wives and daughters tell the men to go hide somewhere and let them bargain with the enemy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTIAN>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That don't make much sense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. The way they handle it is they go to bed with the Spaniards. And the next morning the soldiers go off peacefully and everybody's happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTIAN>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Including the husbands and fathers? Don't they suspect?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's part of what I wasn't sure of. I guess they know what went on but they care more about their safety and their money than they do about their honor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTIAN>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then they got their heads screwed on straight. Honor's just an idea. You can't see or feel it and you can't eat it and you sure as hell can't get any mileage on it.

She slaps him on the rump and straightens up.

Christian, humming softly, turns off the water, takes a large towel from a rack and puts it on a stool by the tub where it will be more convenient for him. She lingers to test the water with her finger and do anything else she can think of to assure maximum comfort for her man. Then she steps back into the bedroom. The sight of him makes her advance cautiously and confirm her suspicion that he is asleep.

INT. SHOOTER'S APARTMENT

MELBA, The Shooter's woman, is sitting up in bed working on her eyebrows and listening to MUSIC turned up LOUD on a radio. The bedside phone RINGS, barely audible above the radio. She answers it.

</MELBA>
<DIRECTION>
She gets no answer, which is no wonder in view of the noise from the radio. But the radio is across the room and it's slightly easier for her to get out of the side of the bed she's on, and go to the door of The Shooter's room. She opens this and we see The Shooter in bed in his own small quarters, reading a magazine. He turns around inquiringly.
</DIRECTION>

The Shooter picks up the phone but before he speaks into it, he pantomimes to her that he won't be able to hear over the radio. She seems to regard the request as an imposition but she does go grudgingly to the radio and turns it down a little before she returns to her bed and her cosmetic chore.

I told him a man couldn't ask for a better guarantee of a fair-and-square game than having The Shooter deal it. So if you're willing, we're meeting at two o'clock in the afternoon. Ask for Mr. Schlaegel's suite at the Park Sherman... Good. I'm glad you can do it, Shooter. Be a pleasure to see you again...

It is midday outside but the window shades are tightly drawn to keep the daylight from disturbing The Kid, who is still asleep.

Lancey, Shooter and five other men are sitting in comfortably padded chairs around a well-appointed poker table. Everything about the game is in sharp contrast to the one The Kid played in. It is played with chips - expensive ones; there are a couple of bottles of wine on ice, fine cigars, a tray of sandwiches, etc. Lancey's opponents are all wealthy types; two of them could be Texas oil men. The youngest, a good- looking man of thirty, is BILL SCHLAEGEL. The Shooter, as nonplaying dealer, distributes fifth cards to the four remaining players in the hand, and both Lancey and Bill end up with four cards of one suit showing.

She closes the suitcase and puts on the one dress she hasn't packed. The Kid, dressed now, watches her for a moment then goes to the bottom drawer of the dresser and opens it to reveal a stack of money under a shirt. He takes five clean twenty-dollar bills and counts them on to the top of the dresser, snapping the crisp leaves gambler style. Then he stoops down again and takes out two more twenties, adding them to the pile.

He doesn't actually hand her the money. He leaves it on top of the dresser and she goes over and takes it, folding the bills and putting them in her change purse. The Kid picks up her suitcase, and she leads the way into the other room. At the front door she stops and looks back at the little apartment for a moment.

Lancey gives him a quick look, finding this a bit thick.

CAMERA PANS ahead of them to a group consisting of Hoban; HOBAN'S WOMAN, still sexy in her forties; PIG, whose name could derive with equal justification from either his looks or his manners; and SOKAL, who talks colloquial American with a Central European accent. The group as a whole is notable because its members have not risen to their feet with everyone else, because all the men are basking in the sun with their shirts off, because they view the action on the field with detachment, and because, nevertheless, they are constantly placing bets on details of the game. Now, as people around them resume their seats, Sokal is able to confirm that the fly ball has been caught.

	Yeah, he's going to give you trouble.

INT. CORRIDOR, PLUSH HOTEL - FELIX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is standing by an elevator in f.g. keeping watch on a row of room doors including the site of the poker game. FELIX is an impressive physical specimen whose capacity for brutality is masked by a quiet, deferential manner. When he sees a door open, he moves so as to be out of The Shooter's sight as the latter comes toward him. It isn't until The Shooter rounds the corner in f.g. and presses the button for the elevator that Felix makes his presence known.

	Excuse me, Mr. Shooter, sir, but Mr. Schlaegel asked me to remind you how eager he was to see you.

	Of course. Any other attitude, you're degrading the woman. You're not treating her as a person with a mind of her own, but as somebody's property.

</MELBA>

Again she presses close to him and again he savors her for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only thing is, it's different with The Shooter than anybody else. He's so straight, I got the obligation to be straighter with him than other people. So do you. On account of we both owe him plenty.

A family dog completes the picture. Bill continues to feed the baby as he hails The Shooter.

As soon as his wife is gone, Bill goes right to the topic he doesn't want to discuss in her presence.

	Betting interest?

	Jack Doyle in New York is giving twelve to five on Lancey. Same odds in Reno. I've taken fifty thousand of it so far.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifty thousand!

<BILL>

	I'll probably go for more but I didn't want to rock the odds.

<SHOOTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew you liked The Kid's style but why you going in so deep?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOOTER>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two reasons. First, I want to see that smug old bastard gutted worse than he gutted me. Second, as long as that's going to happen, I don't see why I shouldn't make some money out of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<SHOOTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But how can you be so sure? The Kid could do it, we both know that, but --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOOTER>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Could" isn't good enough for a man who hates to lose money as much as I do. He's going to need help -- from the best man with a pack of cards between Omaha and New Orleans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<SHOOTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a chance, Bill. You ought to know I never ever use what I got with the cards for nothing but tricks and dressing up a game.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOOTER>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, I know it. That's why you're the man they choose to give them a square deal. That's what makes it so perfect. Nobody'll be looking for it.

</BILL>
<SHOOTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's out. Out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOOTER>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The great thing is they'll be so close, The Kid won't need much. Three or four key hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<SHOOTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Understand this, Bill. I'd like for The Kid to win, and I sure as hell don't want to see you lose all that money --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOOTER>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I did, I'd have to collect that twelve grand you owe me. Not myself. My collection agents. You knew poor Wildwood Jones, didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<SHOOTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK but I'm paying it off! It's comin' in ain't it? Six grand already.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Bill, you got to listen to me --!

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't. It's quite the other way around. You have some delusion you're a free agent, but you're not. I own you.

</BILL>
<SHOOTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For God's sake --!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOOTER>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up. I'll cross the twelve off the books and give you ten thousand dollars in cash. And you can tell The Kid if he needs more of a stake, I'll put it up.

The Boy stands perfectly still for a few seconds, then begins to shake the can with corn in it. After a bit he brings in the shale stone can with the other hand to chord and accent the rustle of the first can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the same time he begins to sing a simple song in a pure, delicate voice. It is catfish music created on the spot and sounds strangely like the idle tunes Christian likes to hum.

<DIRECTION>
Christian comes around a curve in a path on one side of the house, carrying two five-gallon milk cans slung in a yoke over her shoulder. A little dog YAPS and runs from the front door of the house to the front gate. She looks in that direction and CAMERA MOVES to include The Kid as he unlatches the gate and walks toward her. After a moment's hesitation, she moves to meet him, gliding on her bare feet to keep the water in the cans from slopping out.

</MRS_CRAIGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Christian crosses to the drain sink near the pump and turns her back. Mrs. Craigie lifts the cans off the yoke on to the drain board. She and Christian each take a can and pour the water from it to prime the pump.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We lost suction on the pump right in the middle of canning.

The Kid looks at the stove with a couple of large steaming pots on it, and the table alongside with a half-dozen hampers of green beans.

As soon as they are finished with the pump, Mrs. Craigie and Christian turn to the table, where they begin to snip stems and cut beans before putting them into the pots on the stove.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CRAIGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know anything about canning, you know we can't stop now. If we'd been looking for company, we never would have started.

He is pitching manure from all over the cow-lot into a pile banked against the side of the barn, working a long-handled shovel with practised ease. He looks o.s. and sees The Kid approaching but continues his work as The Kid enters the SHOT. Nor does he stop shoveling while they are talking, except at moments of particular significance to him.

The two men are sitting just outside the kitchen, where Mrs. Craigie and Christian are pasting labels on the mason jars they filled earlier. The paste and some of the jars are just inside an open window on a shelf behind the men's heads. The light comes from a kerosene lamp inside.

<CRAIGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me get this straight in my head. Cards is all a matter of luck, who gets dealt the best ones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIGIE>
<DIRECTION>
The Kid stands up and selects six playing cards from a deck in his pocket. During the next few lines he uses the paste on the shelf to stick together three pairs of them so as to form three double-thick cards. One of these has two faces, another two backs, and the third a back and a face.
</DIRECTION>
<CRAIGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So when one of you professional gamblers sits down with a bunch of your -- what do you call them -- customers, clients?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIGIE>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The technical term is "suckers." Or "marks."
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>

	Their chance of winning is just as good as yours, except if you got a way to control it, who gets what cards. Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIGIE>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not right. That's cheating and it's not any part of what we're talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<CRAIGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then how do you win?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIGIE>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll show you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<DIRECTION>
He displays his three cards.
</DIRECTION>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see one of these cards is white on both sides, one is red on both sides, and the other is white on one side, red on the other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<CRAIGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIGIE>
<DIRECTION>
The Kid lifts a straw hat off a peg on the porch wall.
</DIRECTION>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This. I put the three cards in a hat and shake them up, and then I ask you to draw one card out blind. Put it face down on the table so neither of us can see the bottom side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<DIRECTION>
Craigie does as instructed. The ensuing dialogue assumes the card he picks is red on top; if it's white the words "red" and "white" will be reversed in the dialogue.
</DIRECTION>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, red on top. That eliminates the all-white card, right. So the card you've picked is one of two -- the all-red or the red-and-white. One out of two is an even chance, an even-money proposition. Right -- you follow me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<CRAIGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIGIE>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So if I said I'll bet you a dollar to seventy-five cents the other side of that card is red, you'd take the bet wouldn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<CRAIGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seems like. Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIGIE>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that answer makes you a sucker. Because the odds are two to one, the other side of that card is red, and I ought to be offering you a dollar to fifty cents instead of seventy- five.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<CRAIGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if there are just the two possibilities.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIGIE>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are three possibilities.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating card on table)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That can be the red side of the red- and-white card, or it can be either side of the all-red card. In two cases out of three the other side is red. And I'd win the bet from you two out of every three times we made it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<CRAIGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(dubiously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You would?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIGIE>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. It's obvious when I explain it, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<CRAIGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reckon so. Except if there's only two things that the bottom side can be, red or white --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIGIE>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take my word for it -- the odds are two to one. And knowing that is the difference between your gambling man and your sucker. Not who gets the better cards but who knows what the proper odds are. In a poker game there can be a million different situations, each with a different set of odds to figure. The man who ends up winners is the man who knows when to bet and how much...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<CRAIGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The sucker is still took advantage of, isn't he? The gambler knows something he don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIGIE>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure -- like if you grow better corn or raise a cow that gives more milk than the other guy's. Or two business men are in competition, or two lawyers are up against each other in a courtroom. Whatever your line is, the one who wins out is the one who knows his job better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<CRAIGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seems like there should be something else to it --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIGIE>

The sun hasn't risen yet as The Kid boards the bus for St. Louis outside the general store.

The Kid's bus crossing the endless plain in the afternoon sun.

The clock above the loading platform says it is a little after two in the morning as the bus pulls up, and The Kid, groggy from the long ride, gets out.

INT. KID'S APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He enters wearily, goes straight into the bedroom and collapses on the bed. After a moment he summons the energy to loosen his shoelaces and kick his shoes off. But that completes his preparations for sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHOOTER'S APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shooter is awake because he can't sleep, and Melba is awake because she is trying to persuade him to do what she considers prudent. He sighs deeply as she solicitously pours him a cup of coffee.

Lancey is also awake, confronting a row of medicine bottles. He finishes laying out an assortment of four different pills and capsules, pours himself a glass of hot milk from a carafe, and proceeds to take the pills one at a time, with a sip of milk after each.

INT. KID'S APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Kid, looking completely refreshed, is readying himself for the game. He has chosen casual, comfortable clothes, and now he collects three items to take with him: a large bottle of mouthwash, a green sun-vizor, and finally, his stake. When he withdraws the money from the dresser drawer, we can see the pile has increased in size. The Kid finds an envelope to put it in, and he is ready to go. He starts out but in the middle of the kitchen he stops to look at his watch. It is too early. He crosses to the stove, pours himself a cup of coffee, and sits down to drink it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LANCEY'S HOTEL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lancey has decided on a change of costume from his last game, and this time he goes for the old-fashioned velvet smoking jacket and silk foulard. Over this he puts on a light overcoat. Then he assembles medicines, toilet articles and money, putting them all into a small satchel. Finally, he puts on his hat and goes to the door.

</LANCEY>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA MOVES to take in the people around him, one after another. The Shooter is there, and Pig and Sokal and Hoban, and Melba and Hoban's woman and a couple of other women whose main attributes are physical, and Bill Schlaegel. Out of town representatives include LADY FINGERS, who is about fifty, down on her luck but still cheerful and remarkably energetic; and YELLER, a light-skinned Negro who has achieved stature in what is mainly a white man's world, through diplomacy and a quick wit. The room is the large living-room of a once splendid suite; there are enough chairs and couches around the walls to accommodate a good many spectators, while the middle of the room has been cleared for a round table with seven chairs.

The Kid would like these cryptic words explained, but Lady Fingers descends on him.

MED. SHOT - AT POKER TABLE - KID AND SHOOTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The old, solidly built wooden table has been covered with a white linen cloth on top of a blanket. The cloth is tied down under the rim so that the surface of the table is flat, tight and cushioned by the blanket. The Kid presses his fingers into it to test these factors.

	You both know Joe Hoban. He's a draw poker man, but clean and straight as they come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOOTER>
<DIRECTION>
Hoban comes into the SHOT with a dispatch case, which he sets on the table. He unlocks it with a key and turns it upside down. Thirty sealed decks of cards spill on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<HOBAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They come from the St. Louis Bridge Club, but they're poker size cards. They been bonded by the club steward and I seen him take them out of the safe. Shooter, Lady Fingers and me pick them up and come straight here with them.

</HOBAN>
<SHOOTER>

with the pile of decks and the empty dispatch case on the table in front of them. They start checking the decks one by one, each putting the ones he has covered in a pile for the other's consideration. They examine the seals and the cellophane visually, and they also sniff both ends for the odor of a hot iron. By the time they are through with this process; The Kid has found three decks he isn't satisfied with, and Lancy two. The Kid passes his three rejects to Lancey, who tosses them back into the dispatch case without looking at them. Then Lancey tries to submit his two to The Kid, but The Kid waves them away, and Lancey throws them, too, into the case.
</DIRECTION>
<LANCEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Kid, what's your game?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCEY>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the other four players, who have come up to the table, still not taking chairs until Lancey and The Kid have chosen theirs. Though Lancey's question is purely ritualistic, they look to The Kid for his reply.

THE PLAYERS - FEATURING THE KID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Kid has taken his roll from his pocket and is counting it out rapidly. The other players watch, interested to see how much he is putting out. After counting out one stack of thirty hundreds, he distributes the rest in stacks of twenties, tens and fives, folding each bill over once as protection against picking up more than one at a time.
</DIRECTION>
<SHOOTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, this is a game of five- card stud poker. There is no limit. A dead man has one half hour to raise his roll outside and get back in the game.

</DIRECTION>
<SHOOTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last and certainly least --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOOTER>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his money out without counting it, takes a deck of cards, rips the cellophane off it, takes the jokers and tosses them offhandedly to one side, not seeming to take aim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FEATURING THE JOKERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heads turn as the cards sail through the air in unison, landing inside The Shooter's familiar hat, which is resting crown down on the mantelpiece. The spectators gape at the display of dexterity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FEATURING THE SHOOTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to shuffle and all eyes are upon him, not from suspicion but from pure admiration. He is in peak form, shuffling six times, once for each player and then slapping the cards down before Lancey, who is to the right of him, with an empty chair in between.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - LANCEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He waives his privilege of cutting with a barely perceptible nod.

THE POKER TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shooter acknowledges the compliment with the same sort of gesture. Then he begins to deal in his magnificently precise way, pitching each card so that it comes to a stop six inches in front of the player's money and in clear view of everyone at the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - SHOOTER'S HANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With Sokal in b.g. It is notable that as The Shooter completes dealing hole cards and switches to the first up card, there is no visible difference in the motion of his hands. He calls the cards as he deals them.

The second round has been dealt. Sokal has a queen-eight, The Kid a pair of tens, Pig a king- seven, Lancey an ace- five. Yeller, like The Shooter, has folded on the first card. The Kid makes the same bet of twenty dollars, and the other three remaining players drop.

Unhesitatingly, The Shooter pulls in the cards, separates them into four or five piles, and tears each pile in two. He glances around, and Hoban comes up behind him. The Shooter hands him the torn-up cards and unseals another pack, going through the same routine of throwing the jokers into his hat.

It is around midnight, and there is a more settled look to the game; some of the players have removed their coats, and there is a good deal of smoke in the air. The Kid has a cup of coffee by him, presumably with brandy in it; Lancey has his frappe; Pig is drinking whiskey; the Shooter and Yeller have bottles of bear. It is the end of a hand. With about six hundred dollars in the pot, Pig, who has been called, turns over his hole card triumphantly.

He looks at Lancey with malevolence. Lancey turns over his up cards and tosses them in front of The Shooter. Pig suddenly lunges toward the cards, wanting a look at Lancey's hole card, but Lancey is too quick for him and pushes the cards into the pack The Shooter is assembling.

THE POKER TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is later in the morning. Three players are left in the hand on the last card: Yeller with nothing higher than a jack, Lancey with a king-queen showing and Sokal with an ace- king.
</DIRECTION>
<SHOOTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ace-king is the high man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOOTER>
<SOKAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoot the works.

(counts it out)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Nine hundred and thirty bucks.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What have you got?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCEY>
<SOKAL>
<DIRECTION>
(unhappily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't matter. If you can call me, you beat me. Ace-king high.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOKAL>
<LANCEY>
<DIRECTION>
(turning an ace)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ace-king-queen high.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCEY>
<YELLER>
<DIRECTION>
(to The Kid)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had them both with a pair of fives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YELLER>
<SOKAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Winds it up for me, men. And I can't say it's been a pleasure.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(despairingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That one I was sure I could steal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOKAL>
<YELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lancey has a built-in burglar alarm. I'm also withdrawing from the field of battle, gentlemen. Settle for the seventeen hundred I've already dropped.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YELLER>
<DIRECTION>
Yeller pulls in the money in front of him. There is now about $19,500 left on the table, $11,500 in front of Lancey, $8,000 in front of The Kid.
</DIRECTION>
<LANCEY>
<DIRECTION>
(to The Kid)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, just the two of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCEY>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, just the two of us. Deal them, Shooter Man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>

(TIME LAPSE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE POKER TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is around $1,500 in the pot. Shooter deals an unhelpful card to Lancey's pair of aces, and a nine to The Kid's king- queen-ten.
</DIRECTION>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cost you a grand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<LANCEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Compulsory call, Kid.

THE POKER TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last bet has been made and there is about $3000 in the pot. Lancey exposes his hole card.
</DIRECTION>
<LANCEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two pair, jacks up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCEY>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kings up.

THE POKER TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is $2500 in the pot. Lancey shows a pair of kings, The Kid an ace and three odd cards. The Shooter deals a nine to Lancey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE KID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is watching The Shooter intently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FEATURING THE SHOOTER'S HANDS - KID'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dealing motion looks perfectly legitimate as The Shooter gives The Kid an ace. Lancey's hand reaches into the SHOT to turn over his up cards.
</DIRECTION>
<LANCEY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Studded again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCEY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
THE KID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the money in slowly, his eyes on The Shooter. Now the distribution of money has been reversed. The Kid has something under $12,000, Lancey something under $8,000.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHOOTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He avoids meeting The Kid's gaze.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
THE POKER TABLE - FROM BEHIND THE KID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the fourth card Lancey shows a pair of sevens, The Kid a pair of eights and a ten.
</DIRECTION>
<LANCEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two thousand dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCEY>
<DIRECTION>
The Kid lifts his hole card and we see it is a ten.
</DIRECTION>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call two thousand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to watch The Shooter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FEATURING THE SHOOTER'S HANDS - KID'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again there is no indication of improper dealing as The Shooter gives Lancey an odd card and The Kid a ten, completing his full house.

She is in the final stages of undressing. CAMERA MOVES with her as she steps to The Kid's bedside and gets into bed with him. Having accomplished this without waking him, she speaks into his ear in imitation of a hotel phone operator.
</DIRECTION>
<MELBA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good afternoon, sir. It's exactly four o'clock.

He awakens in considerable confusion. Melba is amused by his difficulty in adjusting to his circumstances.

<THE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reach me a towel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
Melba, who is dressed again and applying her lipstick, comes into the SHOT, takes a towel from a rack and hands it to him after he opens the shower door. He gives himself a quick once-over with it, the secures it around his waist, steps out of the shower stall, and begins the process of shaving. Melba meanwhile finishes restoring her makeup.
</DIRECTION>
<MELBA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You any idea how much The Shooter has involved in this game of yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELBA>
<THE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If Schlaegel bet as much on me as I heard, I guess he'd pay a nice piece of change to be sure I won.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_KID>
<MELBA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's worse than that. Schlaegel staked him for three years. He has his hooks so deep in Shooter Man, he'll take out his liver when he pulls them out.

The Kid stops shaving and looks at her.

	You're still working for him. On my time you're still working for him.
	</DIALOGUE>

	What kind of switch is this? You criticize me for trying to chippie on him, then I get a little loyal and you're at me for that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELBA>
<THE_KID>

	No -- I don't hold it against you. You wanting to make things right for him -- but this game I handle my way -- win, lose, or draw.

<MELBA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believe me Kid there is too much at stake for us to rely on your doing it on your own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELBA>
<DIRECTION>
She has paused at the door to finish her sentence. Now she unlocks and opens it -- to Christian. Melba is so taken aback she can't do anything but stand there holding the door open. The Kid, in the bathroom in f.g., is similarly frozen in his tracks. After a moment Christian advances into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE - CHRISTIAN IN F.G.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scene as it looks to Christian is circumstantially incriminating. CAMERA MOVES with her gaze from The Kid to the one mussed bed, to Melba. The faces and the silence of the two people are even more incriminating than the circumstances.

	Hello, Kid. Hello, Melba.

She walks past CAMERA and a moment later comes the SOUND of the door closing behind her. The Kid, who has moved into the bedroom, crosses to his clothes on a chair, and picks up his undershorts and trousers. He returns to the bathroom, using the door for partial concealment as he removes his towel and puts on his shorts and trousers.

I mean if I'm any use to you at all, this is when it's most important.

<DIRECTION>
He looks at his hole card. It is still the queen of hearts. He has a full house, which has to be the winning hand unless Lancey had the audacity to bet out with a jack-seven of hearts, and to raise The Kid with a jack-ten-seven.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bet what's in front of me. Make it fifty-four hundred bucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
He counts out all his money except a few smaller bills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WATCHERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reacting.

<DIRECTION>
FEATURING LANCEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes his time before he responds.
</DIRECTION>
<LANCEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifty-four hundred bucks is a nice piece of money.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(counting it out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see the bet and raise sixty-seven hundred.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCEY>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly and deliberately, revealing nothing in his face, he reaches into his breast pocket and takes out a slim wallet and begins to let the bills flutter out on the table. The Kid looks at him frozen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHOOTER AND BILL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bill hisses softly into The Shooter's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kid has him, doesn't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
But The Shooter, like the Kid, is white-faced and frozen by the raise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE REMAINING SPECTATORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They crowd in close to the table: Hoban, Yeller, Bill, The Shooter, and Melba.
</DIRECTION>
<KID>
<DIRECTION>
(after a long moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm taking my half hour to raise my stake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<LADY_FINGERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I declare a thirty-minute break. Leave your cards and money on the table. The game will start again at five forty-five.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_FINGERS>
<LANCEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take your marker, Kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCEY>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can raise it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<LANCEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCEY>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Long as you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he raps the table)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<LANCEY>
<DIRECTION>
(turns up a heart seven)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Straight flush to the jack -- That's $6700 you owe me, Kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCEY>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - THE KID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is nothing to be gained from a poker face now, and he reacts with a stunned expression in which all the accumulated strain and fatigue is beginning to show. CAMERA MOVES among the spectators: Hoban and Yeller, who are sorry for The Kid and admiring of Lancey; Bill, who is all the more angry at his defeat because his hopes were up; The Shooter, who is a very unhappy man; and Melba, whose anger at the Kid is balanced by her fear of Schlaegel and what will happen to The Shooter and possibly to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE POKER TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lancey pulls in the money while The Kid stares at him dumbly. Lady Fingers riffles the cards.
</DIRECTION>
<LANCEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	New deck.

</LANCEY>
<LADY_FINGERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you playing, Kid? You got a half an hour to raise your stake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_FINGERS>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- I'm through.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<LADY_FINGERS>

(formally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, this game is over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_FINGERS>
<LANCEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're one hell of a poker player, Kid. That was a rough hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCEY>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<LANCEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the tab for the whole show?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCEY>
<DIRECTION>
As he settles up, the CAMERA FOLLOWS The Kid to his brandy bottle. As he pours himself a slug, Melba and Shooter join him.

<MELBA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had to do it, didn't you -- you had to go for it your own way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then, as The Kid doesn't answer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sonny, I hope you learned something. I know we sure as hell did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELBA>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Christian?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<MELBA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's gone. She's got too much sense to stick with a two bit loser.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELBA>
<SHOOTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, Kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOOTER>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should have known he had it, Shooter Man. I walked into it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<SHOOTER>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to grin as
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Schlaegel and Felix
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
move up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Kid, it's like I said -- you just wasn't ready.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOOTER>
<BILL>
<DIRECTION>
(to The Shooter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you ready, Shooter Man? We're having a meeting and I suggest you join us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
Shooter looks at him a moment and nods, and taking Melba by the arm, moves toward the door followed by Felix.
</DIRECTION>
<MELBA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why me -- I'm not part of this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELBA>
<SHOOTER>
<DIRECTION>
(jerking her forward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes you are -- you and your big mouth -- you're part of it all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOOTER>
<SCHLAEGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's right, my dear. Now run along with Felix. We're going to have a long talk about that big mouth of yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHLAEGEL>
<DIRECTION>
Melba starts to protest, but Felix jerks her out the door. Shooter hesitates, then follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DIFFERENT ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schlaegel turns to The Kid.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHLAEGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was wrong. I figured you for brains. But you're a loser, Kid. You had a chance to play with grownups and you ran.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then, as Lancey and Lady Fingers approach)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They weren't playing your game. They were playing mine. Think about that while you find a place to hide. But hide good, Kid -- because I got a message for you and I'm going to see it delivered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHLAEGEL>
<DIRECTION>
The Kid looks at him, looks at Lancey and Lady Fingers, wondering about what Schlaegel has said, angry about it.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
Schlaegel nods, moves to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lancey and Lady Fingers join The Kid.
</DIRECTION>
<LADY_FINGERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never thought I'd see the day. You raising tens on a lousy three-flush.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_FINGERS>
<LANCEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gets down to what it's all about, doesn't it? Making the wrong play at the right time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCEY>
<THE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
(sharply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what it's all about?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then, as Lancey looks
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	at him and doesn't
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
answer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were crazy -- odds are three hundred to one against.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_KID>
<LANCEY>
<DIRECTION>
(after a moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't play a percentage game. I play stud poker my way. And I got the money and you got the questions. Figure that out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then, not unkindly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're good. But as long as I'm around, you're second best, Kid... and you might as well learn to live with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCEY>
<DIRECTION>
The Kid looks at him and doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<LANCEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look me up if you're in Miami after Christmas. Stillson Hotel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCEY>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles his very pleasant smile and goes out the door.
</DIRECTION>

SCENE

<DIRECTION>
Lancey stops surrounded by a crowd of admirers offering their congratulations. The Kid watches for a moment then takes a long drink out of the bottle and eases through the crowd and out the door.

He turns a corner and there is a man blocking his path. Suddenly three men move in behind him. He turns, trapped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men are four of the original seven players he hustled in the opening scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOTE: During the progression of the game first one, then two, then all four men will be included among the observers. Always in the background, never positively identified. Their presence should be felt if not recognized.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it ain't Eric Stone, from the foundry. It's the Cincinnati Kid King of the stud poker players.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<THE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- not the King -- not much of anything right now.
	</DIALOGUE>

	We'll start with giving you back what you gave me.

<CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said good-bye.

	No -- it doesn't really matter.

Christian doesn't answer. She looks at The Kid for a long moment, then turns and goes. He watches her. She enters the cab and it leaves. The Kid just stands there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DIFFERENT ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny and the others move up around him. The Kid ignores them. After a moment Danny swings from behind and knocks him to the pavement. He lies there stunned for a moment. They look down at him. Then he comes up. He flattens two in the process of being badly beaten. They leave him.
</DIRECTION>
