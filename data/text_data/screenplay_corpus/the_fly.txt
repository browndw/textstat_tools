We open on a large white, pristine hall filled with people. We close in on two such people, SETH BRUNDLE and VERONICA QUAIFE. They are mid-conversation:

	What am I working on? Uh... I'm working on something that'll change the world and human life as we know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNDLE>
<VERONICA>

</VERONICA>
<BRUNDLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, you want me to be specific here, in this room, with, uh... half the scientific community of North America eavesdropping?

	Is there another way?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<BRUNDLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could come back to my lab. Listen, I'll make you cappuccino. I have a Faema of my very own. You know what that is? It's not the Dilettante's plastic kitchen model. It's one of those, uh... uh., uh, real restaurant espresso machines with a-an eagle on top and...

	You're not a very accomplished drunk.

</VERONICA>
<BRUNDLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, I'm always like this. It's, uh... motion sickness. When I was a kid, I, uh... puked on my tricycle. I hate vehicles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNDLE>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should I drive more slowly?
	</DIALOGUE>

</VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>
Veronica points toward a third object, covered in tarpaulin. Brundle reveals it as a third pod.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNDLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. This is the prototype of... those. The first one I had made. It, uh... it works, but it's clunky. I call them telepods. They're controlled by this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNDLE>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God for that. So, uh, what do they do, the phone booths?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<BRUNDLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Telepods. Uh... okay. I need an object. Um... say, do you have something, uh, on you that's... uh, personal... that I could use? Something uniquely you? Uh... an item of clothing or jewelry?

</VERONICA>
<BRUNDLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You get it, all right. You just can't handle it. Um... your stocking has just been teleported... from one pod... to another. Uh, disintegrated... there and re-integrated there. Mmm, sort of. It'll change the world as we know it, right?

As she speaks, Veronica pulls a dictaphone from her pocket and begins recording the conversation.

	How could you do this alone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<BRUNDLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't work alone. There's a lot of stuff in there I don't even understand. I'm really,uh... a systems management man. I farm... bits and pieces, uh, out to guys who are much more brilliant than I am. I say... "Build me a laser this, design me a molecular analyzer that," and they do, and I just stick'em together. But, uh, none of them knows what the project really is. So...

I don't have a life, so there's nothing for you to... interfere with. Research the background. Cover the process. The complete record of the most... earth-shattering invention ever. The one that ended all concepts of transport, of borders and frontiers, of time and space. And the book'll end... with me... transporting myself fifteen feet through space from one telepod to another. That's what's really missing... Wait for me that long.

	So, I asked the computer if it improved me and it said it didn't know what I was talking about. And that's made me think very carefully about what I've been feeling, and why. And I'm beginning to think that the sheer process of being taken apart atom by atom and put back together again, why it's like coffee being put through a filter. It's somehow a purifying process. It's purified me, it's cleansed me. And I tell you, I think it's going to allow me to realise the personal potential, I've been neglecting all these years. That I've been obsessively pursuing goal after goal.

	What? Heh. You know I just don't think I've ever given me, a chance to be me. But, of course Interestingly, and the exact same moment that I achieved what will probably prove to be my life's work, that's the moment when I started being the real me finally. Listen, not to wax messianic. It may be true that the synchronicity of those two events might blur the resultant individual effect of either individual. But it is nevertheless it is also certainly true, I will say now however subjectively; that Human teleportation, molecular decimation, breakdown and reformation is inherently purging. It makes a man a King. From the moment I walked out of the pod I felt like a million bucks. You know , I think I am gonna have a cemoli after all. Waiter! I mean, What an accomplishment. But, what have I really done? All I've done is say to the world, "Lets go, Move. Catch me if you can". Waiter. Jesus Christ!

	I think we must chronicle the life and times of Brundlefly, don't you? At the very least it should make a fabulous, Children's book. You seem tired. You got me there? How does Brundlefly eat? Well, he found out the very hard and painful way that he eats very much the same way a fly eats. His teeth are now useless because although he can chew up solid food, he can't digest it, solid food hurts. So like a fly, Brundlefly breaks down the solid with a corrosive enzyme, pleasurably called "Vomit drop". He regurgitates on his food, it liquifies, and then he sucks it back up. You ready for a demonstration kids? Here goes...

INT. BRUNDLES LAB- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are close on Brundle's fingers as they dance over the keys of the computer keyboard. Brundle has cut the fingers off a pair of yellow rubber kitchen gloves and jammed them down over his fingertips, so that his fingers won't stick to the keyboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU MONITOR which reads: GENE-SPLICING PROGRAM NOW IN PLACE. TELEPOD 1: TRANSMITTER POD SUBJECT A. TELEPOD 2: TRANSMITTER POD SUBJECT B. TELEPOD 3: RECEIVER POD FOR GENETICALLY FUSED A-B COMBINATION SUBJECT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pull back to see that in front of Brundle and his keyboard stand not two, but THREE telepods, the third one of a somewhat older and more handbuilt vintage than the other two- the original PROTOTYPE TELEPOD which has been sitting in a corner of the lab under a tarpaulin and was noticed by Veronica on her first visit to the lab. In TELEPOD A sits a monkey, in TELEPOD B an alley cat. TELEPOD C, the old prototype receiver, is empty. Brundle operates the machine. The monitor says, READY FOR FUSION Brundle presses the ACCEPT button. The telepods go through their normal disintegration routine as the animals' outlines appear on the monitor in split screen fashion. But now, as the reintegration process begins, a stream of data concerning this new experiment, the fusion of monkey and cat, floods the screen. The basic message that gets across to us through all the hi-tech compu-talk is: PERCENTAGE OF MONKEY-63, PERCENTAGE OF CAT-37. These numbers fluctuate as the machine tries to strike a molecular balance between the two creatures. Finally, an outline of the fused creature begind to form on the screen. brundle looks up to see the actual creature forming, and it is indeed grotesque: two heads- one monkey, one cat- at odd angles to each other, six legs which are not quite symmetrically placed on the monkey torso, cat tail. As the creature solidifies and the light goes off, it sits there in the telepod for a moment, half-reclining as though crippled. Brundle gets up, goes to the third telepod, and with great apprehension, opens the door. The thing just sits there, slumped for a beat, then SUDDENLY LEAPS UP AT HIM, its two heads SHREIKING! It jumps on his arm, clinging, snarling, then drops to the floor. The two heads begin to bite each other, blood begins to flow- the thing now running around in mad floppy circles, smearing blood everywhere. Brundle is horrified. He grabs a metal rod leaning in a corner and begins to smash at the deformed thing. He keeps smashing at it until it stops its hideous screeching and lies dead, mangled on the floor. Brundle wraps it up in a towel and throws it into the refrigerator. He draws the old torn sheet over the third telepod so he doesn't have to look at it again. Back at the monitor, the screen is flashing the words: FUSION SUCCESSFUL RECEIVER TELEPOD 3. Brundle puts his face in his hands for a few moments, then pulls himself together. He pulls the rubber fingertips off his fingers and throws them to the ground. Brundle has now developed some insect-like tics and mannerisms, his head twitching with nervous little jerks and his long fingers in constant motion. We see clearly now that all of Brundle's fly characteristics have been accentuated even further. The metallic-green hair which completely covers his face is much thicker than before, and the hernia-like bulge in his side is more protuberant now, stretched to the bursting point and obviously causing Brundle some pain. Brundle looks at the skylight. The sky is clear, the moon is a scimitar. On an impulse, he jumps up on the wall, sticking there for a beat. Then, with incredible agility, he ascends the wall, crosses the celing toward the skylight. ON THE CEILING Brundle glides on all fours, upside down, towards the skylight. Once there, he crawls into it and opens it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LAB ROOFTOP-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brundle clambers out of the skylight onto the roof. The night is gorgeous, clean and bright, the sky packed with stars. Brundle breathes deeply. He is still alive, isn't he? He can still respond to the beauty of the night, can't he?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MONTAGE- BRUNDLE'S TRAVELS- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow Brundle on his solitary sojourn in a MONTAGE SEQUENCE. He climbs walls with amazing ability, leaps from rooftop to rooftop, hangs upside down from ledges and lampposts, eavesdropping on the city life around and below him, the inhabitants unaware of the unusual and shadowy observer in their midst. He scurries along the girder of a bridge, gazing down on the traffic and the river below him. These moments should be poetic, even beautiful, joyous. The moon is luminous, the dark night exquisite. Resigned to his fate and momentarily forgetful of his future, Brundle seems to be reveling in his unique powers. A brief euphoric fling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO: Brundle leaps across a narrow alleyway to the wall of the building opposite him. He smiles with smug satisfaction at his feat, then suddenly winces, grabbing his side with one of his hands. WE HEAR A CRACKING, SPLITTING SOUND. Brundle muffles a startled cry, and losing his balance, slides several feet down the wall before regaining hold. He looks down at the huge bulge in his side and sees that it is starting to split open! Brundle is horrified and in pain. He starts to quickly move down the side of the building but the pain impedes his progress. He manages to get down at least another floor before he's hit with another sharp pain. He doubles up and his tenuous grip on the wall causes him to slide another several feet downward before he regains his grip. The side is gaping wide now and SOMETHING is starting to protrude. Brundle is in shock. another ripple of pain causes him to release his grasp entirely and he falls to the ground in a dirty narrow alley, where he writhes in pain, as a STRANGE, HAIRY STICKLIKE APPENDAGE--ACTUALLY THE BEGINNINGS OF A FLYLIKE LEG-- begins to unfold awkwardly out of his side.Despite his excrutiating pain, Brundle watches with fixated, wide-eyed terror at his latest transformation! The insect leg now begins to probe around, function like a real leg, almost with a mind of its own. Grotesque as Brundle has become, he can't accept the next step towards real insectness which this new leg represents. He screams at the leg.

</BRUNDLE>
<DIRECTION>
Brundle grabs at the leg, holds it, subdues it and then begins to gnaw at it with his teeth at its base, twisting himself into an agonized ball in order to do it. The leg begins to lever at his back, small hooklike protrusions all along its underside catching in the flesh of Brundle's back, tearing it in protest against Brundle's attempt at amputation. Finally, Brundle has severed the leg with his teeth. The leg drops off leaving a strand or two of stringy gristle hanging from the knobby stump in Brundle's side. The leg twitches on the ground, tries to extend itself. Brundle looks at the leg in shock, his eyes crazed, like an animal who has been caught in a leg-trap and has had to gnaw off the leg to be free. Brundle tries to steady himself, then staggers away down the alley. As he goes, he wipes the insect blood from his lips with his two forearms In exactly the same way that flies clean their faces.
