INT. CAMPUS REHEARSAL ROOM/ANGLE ON JOAN SPRUANCE AND HELEN DEXTRA The latter on crutches, a cast on her leg. They stand center stage, their texts resting on music stands. Seated off to the side, are two male soloists (VINCENT GALLARDO & KENNETH DOWLER). Behind them a chorus of men and women, waiting, as:

INT. CAMPUS REHEARSAL ROOM/ANGLE ON CONDUCTOR He begins to sing aggressively over the duet. He suddenly drops his hands to his side. The organist discontinues and the voices of the soloists trail off:
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spruance, would you like to show me where it's marked smearing here...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hitting at the score)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... because I swear, I don't see it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. I didn't know I was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<LEWIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Also, I'd be mildly content if I could have a little less delirious self-appreciation and some small regard for remaining somewhere in the vicinity of the goddamned note.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIE>
<DIRECTION>
He returns his attention to the score. While Joan grumbles to Helen, a late arriving member of the chorus (EDDY REVERE) can be seen taking his seat amongst the others:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't smearing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sssh, come on now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm telling you, this is personally motivated. Since I moved out he's been doing this, making remarks and being... incredibly pricklike...
	</DIALOGUE>
<LEWIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, if our lovely soprano would like to stop grumbling for a moment, I'd like to take it once again.

<JOAN>

	See what I mean?

	Pardon me?

	I said fine, let's do it again.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She speaks emotionally, hoping to solicit sympathy:
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He never says, 'Honey I love you, you're doing a great job.' I don't feel he respects me as a person and I'm just not that happy with the stature of our relationship.

<THERAPIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I want you to look at Harry and tell him how you feel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THERAPIST>
<DIRECTION>
She turns her gaze to EUGENE EARL AXLINE, alias HARRY BLISS. He sits in an adjacent chair, an abject hostage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Discomforted by her flinty stare, he glances away, to the window where the faint sounds of the CHORAL REHEARSAL can be heard.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel like he's not plugged into my needs, and I'm not getting enough positive feedback...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Harry shakes his head, shifting about uncomfortably.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, look at him shaking his head.
	</DIALOGUE>
<THERAPIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let's see what he wants to say here. Harry, how do you feel when she brings out this material?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THERAPIST>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do I feel? I feel she just overheats on every little side issue, and when I go to try and communicate with the woman, for some unknown reason she doesn't believe a damn thing I say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh that's a lie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See what I mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you know what this whole thing hinges from? He came to rent a building from me which is now his place of business...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what, he's not interested in that, that's not what he's asking.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Therapist)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See what she does? She wants to dig up and haul out miscellaneous things that's got nothing to do with this. I mean, I agreed to come here, okay, but I have to tell you, Iwo Jima's got a lot of faulty notions in her head about me that....
	</DIALOGUE>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, there. Right now. That's another thing I want to interject...
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon me, I was making a statement here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<THERAPIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, let's try and hear each other out if we can. Go on, Harry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I forgot the upshot of what I was saying, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, this syndrome where I've asked him to address me by my given name and he just goes on ignoring my wishes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<THERAPIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright. Look at him and really tell him how you feel about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want you to ever call me Iwo Jima again!
	</DIALOGUE>
<THERAPIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a legitimate request, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Harry begrudges a slight nod.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you can't call me Adele, don't call me anything at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<THERAPIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So? Can you look at Iwo Jima, Harry, and tell her...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She darts a confused frown at the Therapist.
</DIRECTION>
<THERAPIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better yet, can you take her by the hand and say, 'I hear what you're saying'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THERAPIST>
<DIRECTION>
Reluctantly, he reaches over and takes her hand, mumbling something which though indistinct, causes Adele's features to pucker with emotion and brings her to the edge of tears.
</DIRECTION>
<THERAPIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. That's good... because there's a lot of love here, isn't there.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CAMPUS PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joan, moving with nervous alert, approaches a Mercedes sedan parked next to an Econoline van. Placing her key in the lock, she notes a flyer on her windshield. She removes it, glancing briefly at this heading in bold type: WOMEN - DON'T LIVE IN FEAR. A low RUMBLING sound causes her to lift her gaze over the top of the car, where an attack shepherd (DUKE), slowly unsheathes his teeth and fixes her with a threatening stare through the closed window of the van. Her eyes drop down to the legend on its door panel: House of Bliss Shepherds - Peace of mind - Twenty-Four Hours A Day - Call 7-A-T-T-A-C-K.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT Harry and Adele moving toward the parking structure:

	Daddy, do you want this marriage to work or not.

<DIRECTION>
A bus stop poster advertising a current knife-kill movie entitled Blood and Kisses. A woman in jeopardy, with the obligatory expression of helpless terror on her face, flees from a menacing male figure wielding a bloodied knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD/INT. JOAN'S CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joan is stopped at a signal, frowning up at the malevo- lent message on the bus stop poster. The light changes. A CAR HORN breaks her disturbed reverie and she proceeds through the intersection.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT ESTABLISHING.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT FOLLOWING WITH Joan as she enters the foyer and moves along a first floor hallway to her apartment. She turns her key in the lock, opens the door, then steps OUT OF VIEW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Joan stands briefly in the dark, apprehending something untoward. She reaches to a wall switch, turns on the lights and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The living room has been completely savaged. Pictures have been pulled from the walls, books have been swept from the shelves, chairs are upended and area rugs lie rumpled and dislocated. A vase of flowers atop a grand piano is overturned and water from it stains the polished surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her gaze moves to a bank of windows overlooking a garden patio. The glass pane in one of them is broken and the window stands partly open. ON Joan's stunned reaction as she fearfully scans the room. Then she suddenly reaches to the front door, opens it and disappears into the hallway, shutting the door after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOAN'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - DAY A detective (MELVENOS) moves about, glancing at the devastation. Joan, seated on a couch, addresses him: (In the b.g., Helen Dextra stands on her crutches near the piano, and beyond her a FINGERPRINTER dusts for prints around the frame of the broken window.)
</DIRECTION>
<MELVENOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure nothing of value has been removed from the dwelling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVENOS>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, nothing. That's what's so disturbing. I mean, why would someone do something like this...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<MELVENOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you have quite a nice little mess here.
	</DIALOGUE>

(poking his toe
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

on the floor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It kinda looks like somebody doesn't like you, doesn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, somebody doesn't like me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Fingerprinter interrupts:
</DIRECTION>
<FINGERPRINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not much on the window. A few partials and a bunch of smears.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MELVENOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check out the bedroom.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As he moves to the hallway leading to the bedroom:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think this is someone I know?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MELVENOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's explore that. Have you had any recent trouble with anyone?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
Helen hobbles INTO VIEW, seating herself in a nearby chair.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVENOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone whose displeasure you might've incurred in some way?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Now thoroughly paranoid, she frowns down at the carpet, scanning her memory for the commission of some past offense.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVENOS>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For instance, just the other day we had a homicide concerning a dispute over a parking space.

</MELVENOS>
<MELVENOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not married, I take it.

Her mind is still off searching for enemies and she fails to respond:

<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's in the process of a divorce.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MELVENOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about him?

<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about him? He's our conductor, he's an artist and not someone who'd ever...

	Andy, this is not the most opportune time. I happen to have had a burglary in here last night...

<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So could I just call you later?

<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Read what? I don't know what you're talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm talking about the book I've written about Red and me, that I sent you a copy of, is that so hard to follow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no. You've written a book about Red Layls.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not just about him, Joanie, he's only one of many episodes in my life, you know that. Have you got a Perrier?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't. Let me just call you at home later.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to be home. I'm checking into a hospital to have a bone spur removed from my foot. Then I'm going to New York, to meet with a top publisher...

	I wanted to ask you, if there's somebody, who for some unknown reason, doesn't like me, what do you suggest I do?

	I might put some bars on the windows.

	Because I actually go miles out of my way to avoid conflictual situations.

<DIRECTION>
INT. JOAN'S APARTMENT - DAY Helen, now captive to Andy's epic, is seated next to her on the couch, attempting to listen politely to a tale without an end:
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And to top it off, my lawyer said, 'Don't worry, they're just pissing into the wind...'

<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uhm-hmm.

	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon me, but I don't care what he said. My apartment, as you can see, is a complete shambles, I have a terrible headache, I've been informed that somebody doesn't like me, and I really don't want to stay here by myself!

He goes back to reading. June returns to the bench, lies down again and starts grumbling:
</DIRECTION>
<JUNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, you said you were going to get me a little Honda Elite to tool around in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't give me a bad time, lard. I've got enough trouble with Iwo Jima and her complaints, alright? Now the woman doesn't even believe you're my niece.

</HARRY>
<JUNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm not.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not the point I'm making.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly irritated, he begins fumbling through a pile of bills on top of the desk:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what's gonna happen if I can't pay these damn breeders and get some adult dogs on the premises? Pretty damn quick, some asses are going to hit the pavement, believe me.

</HARRY>
<JUNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So? I'm sick of dog turds anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He scowls at her, then looks out the window:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, here I am, sitting in the center of a lot of wealth, the escalation in crime couldn't be better, and I'm not turning a damn nickel on it...

He catches sight of something outside:

INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joan is seated at the piano, playing Ravel's "Reverie." She breaks off as she sees a dark young man (BALTO) move past the living room window. She resumes playing until her attention is once again drawn to the window, where a middle-aged Hispanic woman SOCORRO moves past in the opposite direction with a young man, who now carries a suitcase. She rises and crosses to the windows to see them get into a gaudy low-rider and begin backing down the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joan hurries out of the house and runs down the drive- way toward the low-rider calling out:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Socorro!! Wait a minute! I want to talk to you!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Low-Rider comes to a stop. Joan approaches the pas- senger window and leans down to Socorro:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, Socorro, but do you mind if I ask what's happening, why are you leaving?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SOCORRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No se, lo siento.

<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, what's going on, are you bringing her back later or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BALTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, Monday I bring her back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Monday? But this is Thursday, I can't stay here alone 'til Monday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<SOCORRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Si, lunes, lunes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOCORRO>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my understanding that Socorro lived here, otherwise, I would've made other plans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<BALTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but she got her time off, too, man, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Joan straightens up, sighing angrily and looking up at the house:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, this is just glorious.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The low-rider moves down the driveway and as it disap- pears onto the street, Joan moves to an electric box atop a metal column at the edge of the driveway. She presses the button and looks at the gates. They remain open. She steps over to the gates and tries to close them manually. The locking device fails to engage and a portion of it falls off into the bushes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE As she leans down to look for the fallen part, a pickup truck can be seen parked down the street. The back of the driver's head (BUTCH GABLE) can be seen and on the side panel of the truck are the words "Canyon Tree Surgeons."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Giving up on the gates, Joan turns and moves with evident reluctance up the driveway, passing a three-car garage in which her Mercedes and another car hidden under a trap can be seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT TRAILER MUSIC. Joan is asleep on the bed. Lying beside her is a fireplace poker and a mallet meat tenderizer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the dark room, a trailer of Blood and Kisses plays on the TV screen. The scantily-clad woman previously seen on the bus stop poster backs away from a steadily- stalking camera. Her eyes widen in the familiar expression of helpless terror and as she opens her mouth to scream: Joan flinches and sits up. She turns the TV OFF, which descends into a wooden console. At that moment, there is a VOICE from outside the bedroom window:
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Andy!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
In the vicinity of the bedroom window, a man in work clothes can be seen pounding on the glass as he continues yelling:
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Butch! Get your ass in gear and say hello to your old drinking buddy!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She calls loudly out to him:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Andy's not here!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He moves to the glass facade and peers inside, looking for the source of the voice:
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, who are you, honey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's out of town, and there happens to be several other people in here trying to sleep, so...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whyn't you come out and say hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you please go away!?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, stick your head out the door an' let's see what you look like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, but if you don't leave, I'm going to call the Foothill Patrol.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, fuck you, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
He cups a hand over his crotch and, sticking his tongue out, flicks it in an obscene manner across his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tch, where does she find these people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead an' call 'em, bitch, I don't give a shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He leans down, picks up a dirt clod from the flower bed and throws it toward the window:
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll just come back and kick your ass in for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Joan moves along the windows with her weapons in hand, watching as Butch wavers erratically up to the driveway where the previously seen pickup can be seen. She waits until he gets in and drives off, then she moves back into the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joan, pacing about in nervous distress. She stops abruptly, throws her weapons onto the bed and moves purposively to her handbag. Rummaging through it, she finds the House of Bliss flyer, unfolds it and looks at the reassuring photograph of Harry and Duke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - CLOSE ON DUKE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Posed in an alert stance, Duke breaks into a run, loping gracefully across the lawn to Harry, where he assumes a sitting position upon the command:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Duke, platz!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Joan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Always the name first, and then the command.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She stands off to the side, repeating the command and studiously writing it down in a small notebook.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, in regard to any aggressor seeking to give you a bad time, I want to show you what you can expect from a dog of this caliber.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He takes hold of the dog's muzzle, lifting the lips to reveal the large scimitar-like canines:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we have the dog's arsenal, so to speak. The animal is trained to apply pressure to specific points of the body until the bone is more or less crushed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(releasing the muzzle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If the attacker is bearing a weapon of any kind, be it a gun, a club, a knife or what-have-you, the dog will, excuse me for saying...

<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh god, what if I don't want him to do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want him to do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I just want him to scare someone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believe me, this will scare them, as well as incapacitate their mind and any ability to maneuver against you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I have an extremely sensitive reaction to dog dander, so maybe I shouldn't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me ask you something. I like to get a general picture of the individual situation I'm working with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses to light a cigarette, making a quick, reflexive appraisal of her contours as he does:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you married, single, living alone or with some other party?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm in the process of a divorce and I moved up here because my apartment was burglarized and...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly mistrustful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm not entirely alone, there's a housekeeper here, and several friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, the hills are hit heaven as far as burglaries go. And right up on Mulholland is where they found the fifth victim of the Westside Slasher...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, please, don't tell me about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believe me, I know what you're up against, being an attractive, and I take it, unattached woman, such as you are...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(flicking his cigarettte away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we're going to remedy that situation right now, and get you to feeling as safe as a little baby, alright?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's enough for a start on the basic control commands...

He scans the grounds for signs of something we as yet know nothing of:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>

</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/EXPANSIVE GARDEN AREA - ON JOAN AND HARRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She holds Duke on a short lead, and as they move along a wooded area of the grounds, he leans in close, directing her in confidential tones:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright now, Joan, give him the command, 'Duke, wachen sie.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Duke, wachen sie.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. The dog is now on alert.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As they walk, Harry glances about, impressed with the appearance of wealth inherent in the house and grounds:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is really a nice piece of real estate you've got here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(tense and distracted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not mine, it's my sister's.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, it's your sister's.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And where's she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(looking down at Duke)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I doing this right? Shouldn't I be prepared for something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never look at your dog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never look at your dog? Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
They move forward a few feet, when Harry, now slightly behind Joan, makes a covert hand signal in the direction of some trees several yards ahead of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
June, in a padded attack suit, suddenly jumps out from behind the trees, assuming an aggressive stance and emitting a repertory of menacing sounds.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Duke, fasse!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Duke responds immediately, lunging toward June, pulling Joan along with him. June screams and starts to run away. Harry moves after Joan, yelling ahead to June:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit, June, don't exhibit fear until I tell you!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing the dog still in pursuit, June ignores the command and as Duke continues to tow Joan behind him:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get him under control now, Joan.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am...

<DIRECTION>
(struggling with Duke)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good boy, be nice.

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give him the off command!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I forgot it! You tell him! Duke, stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
He hurries up behind her, grabbing her around the waist to anchor her and addressing the dog:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Duke, aus!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The dog instantly assumes a sitting position. Joan, out of breath and exhilarated with fear and excitement, turns to Harry:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My golly, that was incredible. I love this dog. Did you see that? I can't believe how strong he is. I felt like a rag doll...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ordinarily I wouldn't do this, even on a temporary rental basis, because he's the absolute top security and attack dog in the country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She lays the pen aside, studying him with evident interest as he looks at a photograph of Andy and a man on a hunting safari in Africa.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this your sister?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No kidding. Your sister's involved with Red Layls? This guy's gotta be one of the five or ten richest men in the country, with business connections all over the place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Feeling slighted, she watches him move to a picture of Andy descending the steps of a plane with Layls watching her on the tarmac.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she's your sister. That's amazing. I mean, this is an individual I'd really like to meet sometime.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He leans in close to a photograph of Andy in a bikini.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, look at that figure. I have to say, your sister is really an attractive looking woman.

<DIRECTION>
ON DUKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lies on the lawn, secured to the base of a tree by a long leash. Eddy moves INTO VIEW and stepping over to Duke, leans down as though he intends to pet him:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to see Joan approaching with a paper cup filled with water.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do what?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not supposed to look him straight in the eye.
	</DIALOGUE>
<EDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a dog you can't look in the eye, Joan?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not just a dog. He's a Schutzhund trained attack dog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<EDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He steps back from the dog as Joan leans down to give Duke some water from the cup.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was told to avoid a direct gaze and always look at the base of the right or the left ear.
	</DIALOGUE>
<EDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to go to all this trouble, I've offered to stay up at your sister's with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't tell you how mad I am at Lewie, that I have to leave him out here, tied to a tree...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<EDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, you're stubborn, Joan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not stubborn, I'm so accommodating, it's sickening.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She pats Duke on the head and stands up:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you won't tell me what's really bothering you. Why don't you confide in me anymore?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<EDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No you don't. Come on, talk to me. Let's go have a drink after rehearsal.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(reluctantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A WOMAN chorus member sticks her head out the stage door:
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddy, you better come, he's rehearsing the tenors!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<EDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm coming...!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then to Joan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about tomorrow night then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Let's say maybe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<EDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(slightly annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well don't go out of your way, Joan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDY>
<DIRECTION>
He moves quickly toward the rehearsal room. Immediately afraid of his displeasure, she calls after him:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddy? Tomorrow's fine. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Before disappearing into the studio, he makes a gesture acknowledging her capitulation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - LATE DAY Harry, Joan and Duke following, moves along the glass facade, inspecting, then assessing the security status of the house:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'd have to say this place is a snap to break into.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew it. I shouldn't have moved here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. The dog'll take care of anyone trying to get inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She moves down into the living room, crossing toward one of the couches, with Harry following:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what to do. Maybe I should move into a motel.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you don't have to do that. This is just some ding-dong that's trying to scare you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well he's succeeded.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you don't want to give off that impression, by acting too timid or afraid, because that's what invites an aggressive attitude from certain types of men.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't invite this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For instance, don't go mincing along, taking mousey little steps, and waving your hanky, because you're drawing a target on yourself if you do...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let's see. Just walk back and forth the way you normally do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(stands up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I don't normally walk back and forth, but... okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She attempts a few steps then stops abruptly:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, I can't do it with you watching me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, but keep in mind that you want to exhibit a very confident attitude. Look like you know what you're doing and where you're going.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uhm-hmm.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just remember to stop short of appearing a little dykey, because that's not attractive.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I thought that's your point, no to attract...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, you always want to remain a little bit attractive. Otherwise that can set somone off too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is just impossible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She moves back to the couch and sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just can't win.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure you can, it's just a matter of degree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well darn it, I give up...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Dropping her head into her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moves over to her
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and touches her
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry but this is really getting to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
He sits down next to her:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell you what. Let me take you out of here, buy you a drink, and see if we can't get your mind off these kind of things.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's very sweet of you, Harry. I'd like to do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. YAMASHIRO INN/PAVILION - LATE DAY (Japanese "MOOD MUSIC" over), featuring a morbid, nearly suicidal saxophone solo:) John and Harry seated at a table. She is well past the loosening effects of a second glass of wine, is not unaware that Harry is looking at her:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lights a cigarette. As she reaches to her glass, his eyes follow the motion of her hands. She looks in front the window:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long have you been divorced?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'd say seven or eight years, around there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so you like, well, assuming you live a single existence, I mean most men don't seem to enjoy that, I've read.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She lifts her glass, takes a sip, then sets it back down:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to tell you the truth...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he pauses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been observing your hands, and I have to use the word exquisite.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Well...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
Embarrassed by the compliment, she reaches to her glass and nearly knocks it over, spilling a bit of wine onto the tablecloth and is relieved to find him gazing off and unaware of her gaffe.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're probably quite a singer too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking back to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to come down and catch you sometime.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, anytime. Do you like Classical music?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very much. Even to the degree that when it's playing on the radio, I sometimes have to turn the damn thing off.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Thinking he is revealing a peculiar brand of wit, she laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just mean it starts to get to me too much. I can't swallow my saliva.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I shouldn't have laughed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, symphonies, operettas, poems, things like that. All those type of things really get to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(looking intensely at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uhm hmm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
A JAPANESE HOSTESS appears at the table, bowing reveren- tially and gesturing that their table is ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. YAMASHIRO INN/RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joan and Harry at a window table. A number of serving dishes and plates on the table indicate the completion of their meal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is flushed from the wine and exhilarated by her response to Harry:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're full of surprises, Harry, you know that? That you've actually read Dante's Divine Comedy I mean...
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it was a while back there that I did, yeah...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know that part? 'Yet as a wheel moves smoothly, free from jars, My will and my desire were turned by love, The love that moves the sun and other stars.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He nods, while Joan, hoping to disguise the extent of her emotions, looks down and begins moving her wine in circles:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For some reason, the sublimity of that always touches me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. YAMASHIRO INN/FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT Joan and Harry come down the steps of the Inn. The sun has gone down and the lights of the city have come on. Under the following they cross the driveway to a low fence railing off an Oriental garden.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, it's very sad. I look at my sister and all her marriages and affairs, not to mention the mess my own life is in, and I think it's very sad and very bleak that men and women can't manage to be friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It depends on the man and woman you're talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They arrive at the fence and as she speaks she rests one of her hands on the railings:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a tragedy that sex is often such a barrier to friendship between men and women.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There I disagree with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He places his hand over hers. She remains silent a moment, restraining her response to the gesture. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know Dante and Beatrice never slept together.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(catching himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah, I forgot that part.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, anyway... I shouldn't have had so much wine... because I prefer to go a little slow here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can go as slow as you want... why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think men and women can be friends?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah, absolutely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/FRONT YARD/DRIVEWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joan, accompanied by Duke, moves down the driveway to a mailbox in front of the broken gates. She pauses to lavish the DOG with an exuberant display of affection and finds herself intimidated as he responds by leaping about and BARKING joyously:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright now, don't play too rough.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The excitement has unleashed Duke's libido and as she tries to resume her mission, he makes a few attempts to rise against her flanks. Just before she approaches the mailbox, he manages to grip his paws around one of her thighs and unmistakably begins to hump her:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, Duke, don't do that, that's not nice. Now sitz. And behave yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He sits, panting, with a furtive expression on his face, watching as she steps over to the mailbox and opens it. She takes out a number of letters and sorts through them as she starts back to the house with Duke following. They are in the main addressed to Andy, but in amongst them she finds a bank statement addressed to her, as well as a letter with her name written in pencil on the envelope. She opens it, takes the contents out and stops suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON JOAN'S HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
holding a woodcut with a foxed edge revealing it was torn from the pages of a book. It is of a woman kneeling with her head on the block, while above her a hooded executioner stands with an ax in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMPUS CONCESSION AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joan and Helen, seated at a table near the concessionary building. The latter sits, tense and disturbed, an uneaten sandwich in front of her, as Helen reads from a list of suspects. (Lewie can be seen at another table, seated across from a bearded man. The other members of the Chorale, including the male soloists, are variously seated, moving about, or lounging on the campus lawn, having their lunch.)
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Lewie. Mad at me.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PERUSES Lewie.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't want a divorce. Maybe he's trying to scare me, or punish me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Helen leans her head in close to Joan's:
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's definitely not Lewie.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not exactly a disinterested party. You're always promoting his cause...
	</DIALOGUE>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Number one, I've known the man for fifteen years, number two, he... loves you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She glances at Eddy, then consults the list: ON EDDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
seated on the lawn nearby, paring an apple with a Swiss Army knife:
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Eddy Revere, a little moody, but a good friend and very reliable.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO HELEN
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An opinion I don't share, but... What do you think about Vincent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
ON VINCENT GALLARDO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gesturing expansively, as he relates some incident to his table partners:
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has a terrible temper. We know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO HELEN
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Vincent Gallardo. Doubtful. We've never had an unpleasant word.' Aren't you lucky. 'Kenneth Dowler...'
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
ON KENNETH DOWLER He stands with a styrofoam cup in his hand, coming on to one of the members of the female chorus:
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Always trying to connect with me, proposing private rehearsals at his apartment.' You know what he asked me yesterday?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO HELEN AND JOAN
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What my cup size was.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(back to the list)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Steve Jewel! Who's Steve Jewel?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My piano tuner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he weird or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well everyone appears weird to me right now. So I put every possible name down, except for one, who happens to be post- burglary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Helen returns to the list, tapping her finger on one of the names:
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's him, the tree surgeon. He sounds very suspicious...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just don't tell Lewie about the phone message or the thing I got in the mail, because he'll just use it to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I already did.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Helen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAMPUS REHEARSAL ROOM - NIGHT Joan and Lewie stand in the doorway of the rehearsal room. (A portion of the Chorus Membership are seated in chairs, and some, including Eddy Revere and Helen, show occasional interest in the intense exchange taking place at the door:)
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm extremely concerned about this situation. I don't want you living alone up there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She regards him suspiciously. He modulates his voice to a more persuasive and intimate tone:
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now come on, wouldn't you feel much safer if you moved back into our house?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I wouldn't feel comfortable about doing that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LEWIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come here...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes hold of her arm and moves her out into the hall:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darn it, Lewie.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LEWIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Are you afraid of your responses to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tch...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIE>
<LEWIE>
<DIRECTION>
(amorously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you resisting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are very upsetting, really shitty circumstances I'm dealing with and I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<LEWIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know how hard all this has been on me? Do you think it's that easy for me to admit I want you back?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Couldn't you spare yourself then?
	</DIALOGUE>
<LEWIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you seeing anybody? Just tell me that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIE>
<DIRECTION>
She rolls her eyes, sighing impatiently.
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, you're not the abstinent type.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, don't judge me by your scrotal excesses, Lewie.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LEWIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you're seeing somebody.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(suspicious again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you spying on me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<LEWIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. Be open about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(kisses her
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	on the neck,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIE>
<DIRECTION>
Her gaze meets Helen's, who, misconstruing the situation, makes an "OK" sign, delivering her semiotic sanction to the happy reunion in the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(back to Lewie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, I am seeing someone, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls back, narrowing his eyes at her:
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe you. Who is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside Joan and Harry dine. The patio is lit only by candles on the table. Socorro enters the living room with a tray holding a coffee urn and cup and closely tailed by Duke. She moves toward the patio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/PATIO - NIGHT Socorro sets the tray down and departs for the kitchen with Duke again falling in behind her. Joan begins to pour their coffee, glancing inside the house to see... Socorro turning lights out while the indefatigable Duke tries to mount her. Uttering some impatient complaint, she swipes at him with a napkin and the two move OUT OF VIEW THROUGH the kitchen door.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I hate to mention this but we're having a slight problem with Duke.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hands him a cup)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He keeps getting up and trying to ride on one's extremities.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh don't worry about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Especially Socorro, who can't speak English, let alone German, and sometimes she has to go pulling him from room to room like a vacuum cleaner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that's just normal in most of your adult males. Some percentage of the time they're gonna attempt to make these vulgar motions on your person.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He places his arm on the couch behind her:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just have to be very firm and stay on top of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
In the sky beyond the hills a helicopter beams its light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (SOME TIME LATER) Joan and Harry are seated on the couch having coffee as they listen to a CHOPIN NOCTURNE. He is doing his best to emulate her posture of thoughtful intensity as she listens, but as he steals a look at her his adult male impulses causes him to shift about slightly. She looks over at him:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not affecting you too much, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's very nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Chopin, a nocturne.

He reaches over and runs his hand slowly down her back.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I should say something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the problem though, I want to be honest with you...
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He leans over and kisses her. After a moment she breaks off:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I recently realized something about myself. That I've slept with a number of men in my life just because I didn't want them not to like me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(not averse to
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	being one of

<DIRECTION>
them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uhm hmm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the thing is, I didn't like most of them that much, so why did I care whether they liked me or not?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I'm not one of these guys who's going to look upon you as an object.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I know, that's not what I'm saying...
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I look upon a woman as a whole.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I'm saying is I don't know if right now I might not go to bed with you because I don't want to be alone, so I thought maybe we... could try to explore other modes, or...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Other modes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, there are other ways of being intimate, that people don't even realize.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uhm hmm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which doesn't mean I'm not attracted to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you don't want me to bring you around.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Other modes is fine. You don't have to be shy with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moving closer to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been asked to do do every kind of thing in the book.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her once more. Her response, is far less tentative. As it begins to border on the ardent, she breaks off again:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, it's so hard to pioneer in this area... when you keep doing that...

INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Joan and Harry tussle about with abandoned fervor under the covers of the bed. A fire is burning in the fireplace. Presently, the PHONE RINGS, followed by:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please leave a message after the tone... Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>

The BEEP is followed by Andy's voice, in some waning stage of sedation, coming from the phone speaker:
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Joan? It's Andy... Are you there?

</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>

	There's no phone in my room, or cable TV. I've had to sneak into this cell next to me, with some poor lithium zombie lying here like a comatose cabbage...

<DIRECTION>
INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - BACK TO HARRY AND JOAN her expression shows some concern:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I better take this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to move closer to the phone, hindered by Harry's weight.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this is the lengths this assassin is willing to go to suppress me, because he does not want me to have my book.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry, excuse me, it's my sister.
	</DIALOGUE>

He moves off of her and she leans across his torso, pinning him to the bed as she addresses the speaker:

	Where are you? Are you in New York?

	No, that's what I'm telling you. I went into the hospital first, for one day, just to have a simple bone spur...

</JOAN>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, you told me that, but where are you now?

	Andy, wait a minute...
	</DIALOGUE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you understand the implications of this, I have no underpants on, and absolutely no recourse to my rights!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Joan sits up, and in her alarm is unaware that one of her hands grabs hold of a swatch of hair on Harry's chest, causing him to wince:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God, this is because of Red, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it's because of Red, isn't that obvious!?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Evidencing interest in their exchange, Harry manages to reach to his cigarettes on the night stand.

	And if he and that fuckface lawyer in his paid employ, think they can ... Wait.

Joan turns to Harry, a stricken look on her face:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I supposed to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	... because I'm sure there's some simple explanation...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
She is cut short by the abrupt sound of the PHONE HANGING UP on the other end. Again, she turns to Harry:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What should I do? Should I call the police?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

EXT. FREEWAY/INT. JOAN'S CAR - NIGHT Harry is none too happily confined to the passenger seat as Joan, white knuckling on the wheel, obsesses on Andy:

<JOAN>

	I told her she shouldn't do this, I mean, to be so maniacally obsessed with this soul of mud that she'd even want to write a book about him, is beyond me...

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well the guy must be doing something right to have amassed that amount of wealth.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But she does this, you know, she just periodically drops the entire weight of her life on me like a ton of bricks.

<JOAN>

	Yes, please, anything.

INT. MOUNT HAVEN HOSPITAL/RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT Harry stands scowling for effect, his arm around Joan. A MALE ADMISSION'S CLERK sits at a computer behind a counter, keying up a file, then reading if off the screen:

<A_C>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ellerman, Antonia. She was admitted on the third of the month and was signed out at 3:45 P.M. on the fourth, by her personal physician...

<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know he was her physician?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell, I could come in here and say I was a doctor an' sign somebody out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And even if he was a doctor, it doesn't mean he was my sister's doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<A_C>
	<DIALOGUE>
	According to this he was her doctor.

</HARRY>
<A_C>

	There's nothing on here about her foot. It says 'observation for clinical depression.'

</A_C>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a lie. She was in here for an operation, then she was drugged and taken out of here against her will.

	That couldn't possibly happen, we have very strict regulations about...

EXT. MOUNT HAVEN HOSPITAL - NIGHT Harry and Joan, moving toward the hospital parking lot:

	I've got a couple of ideas here. First, we want to try an' connect with Red Layls.

<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't want anything to do with Red, I'm terrified of him.

</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing to be afraid of, believe me.

	I mean, you hear all kinds of things, about government kickbacks, and Panamanian drug couriers and...

	I know these type of guys. You take away their money and their power, and what are they.

The ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal Harry seated at a table next to a plate glass window, reading the above paper. The view is inclusive of The House of Bliss across the street. He lowers the paper as a waitress (VITA) appears with a Silex of coffee. She sits down opposite him, refilling his cup and addressing him in a familiar manner:

<VITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, go ahead, I've gotta hear this. Who is it this time?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's not what you think. This is a very unique individual I'm talking about. Plus there's a mind there, as well as a body and a face.
	</DIALOGUE>
<VITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't I hear this before, about the hostess at Denny's, that was a college graduate and had a mole like Elizabeth Taylor?

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that's him. How do you think I could get a hold of him?

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE OF BLISS/PARKING LOT - DAY Harry stands back, uneasily regarding the smoked windows and the sun flaring off the glossy surfaces of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Presently, the passenger door opens and L.N. MONCRIEF, a barely discernible presence in a suit blending in with the dark interior of the car, addresses him by name:
</DIRECTION>
<MONCRIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Bliss, I'd like to have word with you, if I may.

EXT. HOUSE OF BLISS/ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA makes a SLOW CIRCUIT around the Continental, taking in an aerial protruding from the trunk, and below it a license plate with the word "TYPHON" on it. The MOVE CONTINUES, briefly SCANNING a driver with a nasty recidivist face, seated behind the wheel, and as we come full circle, the passenger door opens and Harry gets out. He slams the door and steps back, angrily glaring at the car. The hydraulic window opens and Moncrief looks out at him:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're talking to the wrong godammed party, you know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MONCRIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's in your best interest to hear me out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you hear me out, friend...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes note of the driver (STURGE) coming around the front of the car. He stops a few feet off and unbuttons his jacket, revealing the cross-strap of a shoulder holster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry steps over to the window, leans down and communicates in more politic tones:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I happen to have a very high regard for this party. And maybe I even have some feelings of a personal nature here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MONCRIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I don't want to appear to be taking unfair advantage of you...

</MONCRIEF>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamned right.

</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Moncrief reaches into a briefcase, takes out a folder and makes reference to its contents as he speaks:
</DIRECTION>
<MONCRIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But in developing certain information on you, it's come to our attention that your name isn't Harry Bliss. That in fact, your name is Eugene Earl Axline...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute.

(looks up at Harry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... seem to be somewhat interested in your whereabouts.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Harry stands up, leaving the vulnerable area of his stomach framed in the passenger window. When he leans back down, a deeply conflicted expression is apparent on his face:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, that's not necessarily entirely accurate, I mean, I don't know where you come up with these so-called facts, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(at a loss,

his head)

	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't go sneaking around, stealing this lady's property.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONCRIEF>
<MONCRIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to pose that the name and reputation of this very decent man, is not the property of Mrs. Ellerman, or her sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a voucher from the folder and sets the file aside:
</DIRECTION>
<MONCRIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it's my hope that we can avoid any unpleasant eventualities, either for you, or for someone you have such admirable feelings toward...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONCRIEF>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, 'unpleasant'?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MONCRIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean that Mr. Layls is prepared to do whatever it takes to confiscate this document. And if you'd like to be of some assistance to us, by finding it and turning it over to me, he'd like to offer you this very generous gift.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He holds the voucher out to Harry who avoids looking at it:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ, I hardly know the woman. I'm just renting a dog to her, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at Moncrief)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of a person do you take me for?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Harry stands in the parking lot, watching as the Con- tinental drives off. He starts to move toward The House of Bliss, then stops and opens the voucher, braving a look at it.

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you come in here, por favor?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As Socorro comes to the landing, Joan indicates one of the open desk drawers:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I-am-looking-for-my-sister's-book.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Socorro steps closer and glancing into the the now disorderly contents of the drawer, shakes her head defensively:
</DIRECTION>
<SOCORRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No es mi.

Socorro smiles apologetically:

	No se, no entiendo...

Continuing to mumble some disclaimer, she moves out into the hallway and disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY Joan rifles through the drawers of a small escritoire against the back wall of the bedroom. Then she moves toward the dressing area giving off to the bathroom, and stops as she sees the top rung of a ladder just visible above the bottom ledge of a window adjacent to the shower. A small section of glass has been removed, just large enough to permit the entry of hand to the window lock.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE OF BLISS OFFICE - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry behind his desk, irritable, avoiding eye contact with Joan, who is seated across from him on the window bench. (See Appendix for new items, visible on the crime collage behind Harry.)
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told this detective I wanted to press charges against Red Layls, for abducting Andy, for burglarizing my apartment, for breaking into her house...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh come on, you're way off.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that he's been trying to scare and intimidate me in case I might have read something in her manuscript that he doesn't want anybody to know. And you know what he said? That I haven't given him probable cause to even go and question Red Layls, or his lawyer...
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, he's right, I could've told you that. This is a man who goes fishing with the President, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(grabs a pack of cigarettes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a little high up to go around burglarizing people and sending them nasty notes. So why don't you just ease back on this thing for awhile...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(lighting up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Life's too godammed short.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do that, Harry. This is my sister. I can at least make out a missing persons report on her, and then I want to talk to the private detective friend of yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm trying to chase the guy down, okay? But don't go and make yourself sick...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He begins pushing the paraphernalia around on his desk:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, Jesus, why don't you just get this damn thing and hand it over to me and I'll give it to these guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean to Red?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, to Red, or whoever...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well if I ever find, it, that's the last thing I'd do with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit, you're making my work more difficult for me, you know that!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this, have I come at the wrong time or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tell you what the hell to do and you don't listen to me!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Joan looks down at the floor, attempting a drollery:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, someone abates your maidenhood and suddenly feels they can start ordering you around.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not ordering you around. I'm just giving you my opinion. And maybe I get tired of hearing about this stuff all the time, this book business, this manu-whatever, and Red Layls, and your sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Well...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(deeply hurt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry if I've overtaxed you with my problems, Harry, but I never asked you to consider them a part of your work.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stands up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So why don't we speak when you're in a better frame of mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As she crosss to the door, Harry stands up:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah honey, now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw honey yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
She disappears into the reception room and can be heard going out the door. Harry moves to the window, unhappily watching as Joan gets into the Mercedes and drives off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HARRY again seated at his desk. He stares out the window, in the throes of a moral conflict. Then making some sudden resolve he opens a drawer, takes out an envelope and a paperback book and lays them on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP ON PAPERBACK The price sticker is still attached above the title: Dante's Divine Comedy - Simplified Edition. He opens the book, removes the Typhon voucher from between its pages and begins addressing the envelope with the information on the check. Then he puts the voucher into the envelope and seals it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - EVENING Harry, envelope in hand, moves with determination down the block from his building. He approaches a mailbox, pulls the handle on the letter drop and inserts his hand inside the chute. He holds it there a moment, seized by indecision, and then brings his hand back out, still holding the envelope. Turning around, he angrily stuffs it into his back pocket and heads back to the House of Bliss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT Joan, carrying two glasses of beer, crosses to exit the kitchen, the ubiquitous Duke trailing after her. She pauses to address Socorro, at the service island, vigorously hacking at the pink cadaver of chicken and tossing the dismembered pieces into a stewing pot:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Socorro, please-keep-the-dog ... el perro, in... in piso inferior, por favor... exercise room... Tiene allergy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<SOCORRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, si. Duke, venga aqui.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOCORRO>
<DIRECTION>
Duke returns to the kitchen and Joan moves into an enter- tainment alcove off the living room. Helen is seated on a couch, eating a slice of pizza from a delivery box on the coffee table, her attention on the TV, where a talk show is in progress:
</DIRECTION>
<HOST>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (over above action)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... And now I'd like you to meet the director and the star of the smash hit movie, Blood And Kisses. So let's give them a nice warm welcome...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/DEN APPLAUSE OVER. On a large TV screen, where a fervently solicitous HOST addresses the DIRECTOR. Seated beside him is the Actress previously seen on the billboard and in the movie trailer of Blood and Kisses.)
</DIRECTION>
<HOST>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before we begin, why don't we show the audience a clip from the movie. Do you want to set it up for us?

<DIRECTOR>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must say, this is a dazzling piece of work and you two are a dynamite wedding of talents...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Joan hands Helen one of the glasses, then sits down beside her. Under the following, she picks up a pen and leans over the police document now resting on the coffee table.
</DIRECTION>
<HOST>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I hear you're a little sensitive about the criticism you've had about the amount of sexual violence and nudity you have in the picture...

<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Any scars, marks or tattoos.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (overlapping her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well it's absurd. In the first place, I didn't invent this genre. And it happens to be a tradition in this kind of film that women make more interesting and exciting victims than men do...
	</DIALOGUE>
<HOST>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I understand...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up from the document to the screen. Then both women look at each other with their mouths open:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And secondly the violence directed at Mimi's character is an essential component of the story, and is not in any sense of the word, gratuitous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the Host turns to the Actress:
</DIRECTION>
<HOST>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, Mimi, now what about you. That scene where you run nude through Times Square with those multiple knife wounds all over your body. That must've been horrendous for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ON JOAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she throws the pen down onto the coffee table:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Assholes.

INT. HOUSE OF BLISS - REAR APARTMENT - NIGHT June, lying on a studio couch with a remote control in her hand, looking at the Actress:
</DIRECTION>
<ACTRESS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and that scene came directly after the gang rape in the elevator.
	</DIALOGUE>

Harry steps INTO VIEW, only half-listening and grumbling:

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's her problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ACTRESS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what's she complaining about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACTRESS>
<DIRECTION>
He holds out his hand to June, requesting the remote control:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me that. Iwo's got some shit she's looking at...

<DIRECTION>
And Kisses!)
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I come over here to look at the ball game and you give me these clowns.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A COMMERCIAL comes on. June hands him the remote and he sits down on the couch, channeling to a BASEBALL GAME:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, what's wrong with these women.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JUNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want a know something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't want to hear the truth, that's what disturbs me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JUNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's some people that don't treat me like you do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You tell them the truth and they come at you with a cleaver.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNE>
<JUNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know one guy that says very complimentary things to me, like that I have nice features and a sense of humor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNE>
<JUNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some guy I met, that likes me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her, then reaches over and places a hand affectionately on the nape of her neck:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to leave me, lard, just after I've broken you in, and taught you the fine art of dog training?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNE>
<JUNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(waits for a response, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As if you cared.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes his head and sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Women.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the score?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joan and Helen enter the garage. Joan gets into the driver's seat and closes the door, while Helen maneuvers on her crutches around to the passenger side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INSIDE JOAN'S CAR Joan turns the IGNITION ON and as she starts to buckle herself in, her eye catches the movement of something at the back of the garage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From behind a sheet of plywood resting against the back wall of the garage, and just visible in the darkness, a man's hand can be seen reaching to the handle of an ax in amongst other gardening tools in an iron rack. Helen opens the passenger door and Joan whispers to her:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Helen, quick, get in the car!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Helen leans down and looks in at her:
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Looking in the direction of Joan's gaze she sees the dark figure of a man wearing a hood over his head, stepping out from behind the sheet of plywood, holding the ax in his hand and as he moves toward the front of the car, she screams. He lifts the ax over his head and swings it down vio- lently, cleaving the blade into the hood of the Mercedes. (From inside the house, DUKE can be heard BARKING furiously.) Joan leaps from the car and in stark terror, runs out of the garage toward the house. Stopped by the sounds of HELEN'S HYSTERIA, she turns around to see her, hampered by her crutches and unable to move. ON the hooded man's eyes, shifting their homicidal intent from Helen to Joan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joan runs back into the garage and frantically tries to pull Helen away from her death grip on the door handle. The man begins stalking around the front of the car toward her. She grabs one of Helen's crutches and raises it up as if to hit him. As he steps back to the ax and tries to extract it from the hood, she suddenly rushes at him and begins belaboring him with the crutch. He lifts an arm to fend off the blows while his other hand con- tinues to tug at the ax handle.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Helen! Help me!
	</DIALOGUE>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't! I can't move!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Raising both arms to protect himself, the man is forced to give ground, moving further back into the garage, with Joan continuing to batter at him. Then in a sudden burst of rage he grabs hold of the crutch, yanks it from her grasp and lunges at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/HALLWAY AND STAIRS - ANGLE DOWN HALL CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Socorro exits her bedroom to the hall and heads down the the stairs to investigate the cause of DUKE'S BARKING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/EXERCISE ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Socorro steps into the room. The door automatically closes behind her. Duke, in a frenzy, leaps at her, then runs toward the glass doors. He hurls himself at the glass, then returns to Socorro. Thinking he's gone rabid, she screams and tries to hide behind one of the weight racks. The above course of procedure continues, with Duke trying desperately to indicate his intentions, chasing Socorro around and over the press benches and exercise paraphernalia.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/GARAGE - NIGHT (Helen SCREAMING OVER:) The hooded man has Joan up against the garage wall. One of his hands is on her throat and the other is held over her mouth. In the struggle, she manages to sink her teeth into his hand. He pulls it free and hits her across the face. She reaches to a flower pot on a potting shelf and pole-axes him on the top of the head. It staggers him briefly and enables her to move out of his grasp. She immediately grabs an iron rake from the garden rack and turns fiercely toward him. Now standing, vanquished, breathing hard, and apparently having had enough, he begins to back away from her. When he reaches a safe distance, he turns and moves quickly off, disappearing into the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - SOME TIME LATER Joan, her garments soiled and disheveled from the pre- vious scene, comes from the vicinity of the front door, closely followed by Duke and Harry:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you have the damn dog with you, that's what he's for!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you, he was in the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell good is that! You have to have him with you at all times!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
As they move into the living room, Helen, wearing Joan's chenille robe, her hair wildly askew, can be seen in the kitchen area, holding a bottle of liquor in one hand and searching through a cupboard for a glass.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't have him with me all the time, he's killing my mucous membranes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't I tell you, right from the start, it's very dangerous to fool around with people like Red Layls!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No you didn't, I said he was dangerous, and you said he wasn't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but that's before he tried to part your hair with an axe!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if it was him. Maybe it was this tree surgeon...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to move toward the bedroom and he stops her:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. How tall was he? About six one? Kind of ugly?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Helen, now with a drink in her hand, steps INTO VIEW behind Harry:
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was about your height.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, he wasn't, he was much taller.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well let's not quibble, for god sakes. The man is a complete maniac...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Harry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And excuse me for saying, but this isn't a job for an amateur...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But wait, he couldn't be the same man who burglarized my apartment, because that's before I came up here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget about him. I know what I'm talking about...
	</DIALOGUE>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joan, if you don't call the police, I'm not staying here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the drink out of Helen's hand and drains it while Harry continues:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guy like Red Layls have hit men working for them, that drive them around and do their dirty work for them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee whiz, first it isn't Red, now it is Red. I can't keep up with these sudden reversals.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright... I'm calling a cab.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ON Helen, as she clumps away in the direction of the guest bedroom:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM AND BATHROOM - NIGHT Harry sits on chaise trying not to catch glimpses of Joan, who is changing her clothes in the closet. The mood is more subdued.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I think? It's more than one person.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not more than one person. I'm telling you who the hell it is!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I don't think Red would have someone sing into my answering machine...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON CLOSET Joan sticks her head out door.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't seem like something he'd do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit, Joan!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She steps out of the closet and comes toward the bedroom, dressed in one of Andy's negligees.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, what is this?! I can't say anything to you anymore, you're so darn touchy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can mention anything you want, honey. I'm just trying to keep you from turning up face down, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, I can't leave you up here alone now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She moves toward the bed, aware of Harry staring at her.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Andy's --
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's very becoming on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She sits down on the edge of the bed, looking over at him.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Maybe I don't quite fill it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes you do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
After a brief moment:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
He remains seated, looking at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches to the answering machine on the night stand, disconnects it, then once again looks over at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and comes over to the bed and reaches a hand down to touch the side of her face. She looks up at him:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes his hand, he sits down on the bed beside her and they begin to make love.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/DRIVEWAY - NEXT DAY Harry stands watching Joan. She pulls the Mercedes half- way out of the garage and stops the car to call out to him:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do now? Are you going to leave?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm going to skip down the hill, take care of a few things, pick up some clothes...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you be back for dinner, around 7:00?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She waves to him and pulls the rest of the way out of the garage, revealing the ax handle still embedded in the front of the car, its handle sharply angled up from the hood like a soup ladle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: Harry steps toward the car. H: "Let me pull that thing out of the hood for you." J: "Later, I don't have time right now.") She blows him a kiss. Then moves down the driveway toward the gates. He stands watching until her car disappears. Then he moves to front door of the house and finds it locked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving around to the side of the house, he unbuckles his wrist watch and puts it in his pants pocket. Then he steps up to the service porch door, sees Socorro inside putting clothes into a washer and raps on the glass panel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles in recognition and opens the door for him:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SOCORRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ella no esta aqui.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just want to look for my...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating his wrist)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... watch, I think I left it...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing toward the living room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SOCORRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah si, es okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOCORRO>
<DIRECTION>
She steps out of the way to let him in.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Soco.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANDY'S DEN/UPSTAIRS LANDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry searches through the file cabinet then moves over to the desk and as Joan had done previously, goes through the drawers. Duke sits in the doorway, watching him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE UPSTAIRS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens and inspects the contents of the same drawers and cupboards Joan had searched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duke follows Harry's every movement, as he engages in a deft, professional search of the bedroom. He goes through the bureau drawers, the closet shelves, a pair of suitcases, then crosses to one of the two nightstands. Finding nothing in the drawer, he moves around to its mate on the other side of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON HARRY He opens the drawer, glances inside and starts to close it when he sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV OF DRAWER A gift envelope with his name on it rests on a small wrapped box. He picks it up, opens the envelope and takes out a plain white card with a handwritten message on it:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON CARD "Thank you for everything you've done for me, Harry, and mostly, for being in my life. I love you, Joan."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry sits down on the bed, feeling the utter deficiency of heart implicit in this act of treachery and deception. He stares blankly into space for a moment. Then he puts the card back, picks up the box and without removing it from the drawer, gives it a little shake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ADELE'S FRONT LAWN - LATE DAY Adele stands playing a garden hose over the lawn. Two pop-eyed little DOGS YAP and mill about her legs. In the b.g., Harry's van can be seen in the driveway, and presently he appears from the side of the house, carrying a suitcase and a few items of clothes. As he moves to the van and opens the door, her attention is drawn to him:
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry! What the hell do you think you're doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
He sets the suitcase down, lays the clothes over it and crosses the lawn to her:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just got a phone call, honey, from a prominent entertainer up in Vegas, a very well-known singer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is it, Paul Anka?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a rock star, you probably wouldn't know the name. Anyway, I gotta run a couple a dogs up to him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, it's T-minus zero and counting, Harry, on this whole shitty deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now Iwo, don't blow this way out of proportion. You think I want to do this. I need the extra cash right now, believe me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you leave, I'm getting Top Lock to come over and change the front and back doors!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I'm only talking about a short period of time here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming at the dogs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ming! Tippy! Shut up!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean it! You get in that van, and I'm taking my building back and putting in a Fingernail Salon!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on now, honey, don't say things like that...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He puts an arm around her, giving her a perfunctory hug:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's not make a big issue out of it...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(kisses her on the cheek)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Without waiting for a response, he moves back across the lawn toward the van and is stopped mid stride as a strong spray from the hose hits him squarely on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT They are finishing dessert and coffee by candlelight. Joan's hands encircle Harry's wrist with a new watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HARRY AND JOAN Seated at the dining table. He is deeply morose and makes a half-hearted attempt to enthuse as she tries to secure the clasp. (The empty box and the card rest on the table next to the watch he used to deceive his way into the house.)
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's really very nice looking, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you like it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I do. Very much.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She finishes securing the watch.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're welcome.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah it's great and it's something I really needed, so...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He leans over and kisses her on the cheek, then picks up his fork and begins poking with disinterest at his food.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joan's eyes remain on him, trying to divine his mood:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is anything wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She resumes eating. Then, desirous of drawing his atten- tion, she fixes her gaze on the table top and smiles pensively, making the assumption that he is looking at her. When no response is forthcoming, she attempts a verbal solicitation:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(without looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're probably wondering why I'm smiling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over at her:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just thinking that I find this moody side of you very attractive.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, uh-huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In fact, if you want to know, and I can see you're dying to...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reaches over and caresses his back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I completely adore you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, same here, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you all wet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
He lays his fork down and tries to make an awkward and difficult excursion into the truth:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, there is something I feel I gotta say here, Joan, that's been preying on my mind. Something I maybe should've handled a bit differently with you from the start, about this particular situation I'm in...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What situation?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you recall I mentioned to you a while back, that I was finished...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Socorro steps INTO VIEW, addressing Joan with great excitement:
</DIRECTION>
<SOCORRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Senora, ven rapido. Mira que estoy en las noticias de la televicion!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOCORRO>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... with a certain relationship, and I, more or less, am, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She motions Joan to follow and disappears into the kitchen. JUMP CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/DEN/KITCHEN AREA - NIGHT Joan and Harry, looking toward the television set. Socorro stands next to the screen, pointing at herself, a small figure near the front door of Andy's house. In the f.g. a television REPORTER addresses the camera:
</DIRECTION>
<SOCORRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mira, alli estoy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (over the above)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Regarding an earlier press release announcing Mrs. Ellerman's intention to publish her book, which purportedly contains several explosive details concerning Redmon Layls' controversial business dealings.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Harry coughs loudly as Moncrief appears, standing outside a government office building, encircled by a picket of microphones attached to a number of floating hands.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Layls' lawyer, Laurence Moncrief, had this to say when asked if he was concerned about what might be revealed in the Ellerman book:
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<MONCRIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no knowledge whatsoever of Mrs. Ellerman's so-called book, or her alleged disappearance, which appears to have all the ear marks of a publicity stunt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONCRIEF>
<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Harry, outraged)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you believe this?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns contemptuously back to the screen. The Reporter now stands in the f.g. of a three-story build- ing. SLIGHTLY OUT OF FOCUS, but discernible over its entrance, are the words: Monroe Park Center.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Recent reports of Layls' failing health were denied by his personal physician, Dr. Park. When questioned in a phone interview, he responded that the elusive billionaire...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
As the Reporter continues, Joan moves closer to the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... was recovering from quote, 'nothing more than the treatment of an ordinary virus.' Meanwhile...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She points to the sign over the building's entrance:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you see that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...this seems to be another intriguing episode in the stormy career of Andy Ellerman, one-time Washington playgirl and erstwhile companion to one of the country's wealthiest men... This is Heidi Robles reporting to you from Monroe Park Center in San Dimas...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Monroe Park! That's the name of the man who checked Andy out of the hospital!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure that was the guy's name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes it was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
She looks quickly back to the screen -- a commercial comes on.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did she say? San Dimas?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then to Harry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's San Dimas?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
Without waiting for his answer, she strides across the room:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's call the T.V. station and find out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is not the way you want to go about this, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As she moves OUT OF VIEW into the living room, he turns to Socorro:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell her, Soco. She shouldn't mess with these people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT Joan comes out of the bedroom with her purse and jacket and with Harry following, crosses the living room:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you just once take the benefit of my advice?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First you tell me I go around acting too timid...
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but this is a whole different situation here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now when I suddenly feel like I could save the Pope in an earthquake, you start trying to...
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is not the Pope we're talking about here, believe me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's just a figure of speech.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They disappear out the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/DRIVEWAY & GARAGE - NIGHT Joan comes out the front door, Harry moving along beside her, as she moves crossing briskly toward the garage:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit, Joan, these people are holding all the cards. They'll probably throw you into that bughouse with your sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She begins moving a little less purposively than before:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to go there and call 'em a bunch of names, throw a lot of accusations at them? They don't care. People with that kind of money behind them, with their kind of connections, they never go to jail, you never see them behind bars.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They stop in front of the garage where Joan's car is parked:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I getting through to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She nods.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Though evidently very troubled, she nevertheless goes into the garage, opens the driver's door and gets into the car.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>

	Jesus Christ.

EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT The Mercedes moves along one of the surface streets with the ax handle still protruding from its hood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLLOWING ON the car as it enters a ramp and pauses before merging into the dense traffic on the eastbound Hollywood Freeway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FREEWAY - SERIES OF SHOTS - JOAN'S CAR ON FREEWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOAN'S MERCEDES (FREEWAY) - NIGHT Joan, staring grimly out the windshield as she snails along in the right-hand lane. Harry begins shifting fitfully around, grumbling:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is just nuts, what you're doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you stop trying to undermine me every inch of the way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing out the window)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at this goddamned traffic.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, I didn't ask you to drag along with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the one that's dragging along.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing at a semi in front of them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go around the goddamned truck.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell me what to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, just let me drive the goddamned car, that's all I ask.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why should I let you drive?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? I'll tell you why, because you're a terrible driver, that's why.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, now all the ugly little truths are coming out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You operate this vehicle like it was a cane with a red tip painted on the end of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't talk to me, Harry. I mean it, just don't say another word to me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
He angrily folds his arms across his chest, assuming a sullen silence for a moment. The traffic has come to a grid-lock stop, raising their anxiety levels:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was doing just fine until you started in on me...
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing at the ax)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Driving around with a goddamned ax stuck in your car...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now look at me. I've got purpose tremors...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He suddenly opens the door, gets out and moves to the ax handle. Joan watches as he makes several unsuccessful attempts to pull the ax out of the hood of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FREEWAY/INT. JOAN'S CAR - NIGHT He gives up and moves back to the passenger door, passing a man in an adjacent car, looking curiously from the ax handle to him:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is something the fuck bothering you, pal?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He gets into the Mercedes and slams the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MONROE PARK CENTER/PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joan moves quickly through the parking lot and onto a walkway leading to the hospital entrance. Harry, trailing behind, calls up to her:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I at least offer some advice?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Just barge into the place, honey, and play the big hero.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pauses for a response)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When he tells you your sister's not there, what're you going to do, cry?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She stops walking and as he moves up beside her, looks defiantly at him:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
REMOTE ANGLE ON HARRY AND JOAN He takes her by the hand and leads the way over the grounds toward the rear quarters of the hospital.

ON Harry and Joan, as he tries several locked doors before finding one that gives entrance into the hospital.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. M.P. CENTER/UTILITY AREA - NIGHT They step inside a narrow hallway leading to one of the main corridors of the hospital. As they edge past a laundry cart outside a utility room, Harry releases her hand. She moves ahead, then experiencing a sudden loss of nerve, stops and looks back to see Harry rummaging through the dirty laundry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. M.P. CENTER/HALLWAY - NIGHT Harry, in a white doctor's jacket, with Joan at his side, move through a corridor. As she glances nervously about, then at him:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't going to work. You look like a busboy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They approach a nurses' station and Harry steps forward to address one of TWO NURSES behind the counter:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, Nurse...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT ON Harry, Joan and Nurse One. Presently the Nurse ges- tures to a stairwell leading to the second floor. Joan and Harry move in the direction indicated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving into the stairwell.
</DIRECTION>

INT. M.P. CENTER/STAIRWELL TO 2ND FLOOR HALL PICKING UP Harry and Joan moving down the above hallway, looking at the room numbers:

<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you know what you're doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. Just do what I told you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They approach room 206. (In the hallway outside the adjacent room, an old man in a hospital gown is seated in a wheelchair. He wears a stingy-brim hat on his head and reads a pamphlet entitled "Colostomy and You.")
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry reaches to the door, opens it, ushers Joan inside and is about to follow, when:
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE_ONE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor! Just a minute please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE_ONE>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY'S POV - NURSE Approaching up the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE He takes a few steps towards her, assuming his all-purpose scowl:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the problem, dear?
	</DIALOGUE>
<NURSE_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're trying to contact Doctor Park, just to be sure he's authorized you to examine Mrs. Ellerman, because you know, we have to follow certain...
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand. You're doing your job.
	</DIALOGUE>
<NURSE_ONE>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to look around him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did your assistant...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She had to step inside for a moment, to relieve herself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. M.P. CENTER/ANDY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT Joan is now wearing Andy's hospital gown, while Andy is hastily buttoning herself into Joan's blouse:
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if this little kinglet of corporate shit thinks he can get away with this, he's greatly mistaken. Just wait 'til he hears what I'm going to come out with now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Joan thrusts her skirt at Andy:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put this on.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember when he passed me off as staff and I was put on official government payroll all through Maui and the Yucatan Mission?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't. And hurry up, will you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And as Andy steps into the skirt, Joan takes over the uncompleted buttoning chores:
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes you do, remember, when I almost died of the vomito negro? Well that's when he was doing all that illegal oil drilling off the Mexican Gulf...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to look critically at her face in the mirror:
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you got any lipstick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. M.P. CENTER/HALLWAY - NIGHT ON Harry and the Nurse, as before:
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I assume you're a fairly recent associate of the doctor's?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE_ONE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's very correct.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<NURSE_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uhm hmmm... What do you specialize in?

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd say female troubles, mainly.

</NURSE_ONE>
<NURSE_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, so Dr. Park feels there's a gynecological involvement here.

EXT. M.P. CENTER/PARKING LOT - NIGHT Harry, outside the Mercedes, glancing around furtively, while inside the car, Andy continues to perseverate about Red Layls as she struggles out of Joan's clothes:

<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this man, who wouldn't know the truth if it came up and spit him in the eye, is accusing me of lying...

	You know what that prick had his lawyer say to me?

</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry lays the skirt on the hood of the car and begins getting out of the doctor's jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That I was a pretty, grudge- bearing little malcontent, grasping at some splinter of celebrity for myself at his expense. Can you believe that?

As he moves out of sight, her attention is drawn to the sound of MUFFLED VOICES in the hallway. In a panic, she starts toward the bathroom, changes her mind, moves to the bed and gets into it. As the door begins to open, she grabs one of the pillows and quickly covers her head with it.

A sleek black car with opaque'd windows pulls into a parking slot several yards away. A faded male beauty, somewhere in his 50s, gets out of the rear passenger door and as he moves to the walkway leading to the hospital grounds:

She quickly rolls down the window and angrily addresses him:

<MONCRIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before he arrives, I'd like you to take a look at a list of certain deletions and expurgations, which if agreed to...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He removes several typed pages, stapled together and looks down at the pillow covering Joan's face:
</DIRECTION>
<MONCRIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Red is, very generously, I think, prepared to offer his sanction to a sanitized version of your book.

<DIRECTION>
No response. Moncrief glances over at Sturge, standing near the door, then back at the figure on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<MONCRIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you should know, that if you push this too far, you run the risk of having him withdraw his consent to your well-being.

(pauses, then)

	I don't think we want that, do we, Andy?

Before Joan can respond, she crosses to take her belongings from Sturge, and as she moves toward the bathroom:

JOAN'S POV

of the beleaguered maiden she hoped to rescue, pausing on her way, to lean down and kiss the cheek of the dragon she meant to slay.

<HARRY>

	Look, you know, you live a life, honey, you make some mistakes. You get married for maybe mutual benefits, or business considerations weighing on you at the time, and because you don't think the right person is ever going to come along.

Harry lays a hand on Duke's head, half-heartedly acknow- ledging the dog's devoted greeting, then he moves with him toward the van. On his way, he glances somberly over his shoulder at the house. In so doing his gaze falls on the ax embedded in the hood of the Mercedes. He stops and walks back to the car. Once again, he takes hold of the ax handle and makes several attempts to dislodge it. In a final Arthurian effort, the blade yields and he pulls the ax free. He suddenly steps back away from the car, as a steamy spray of hot radiator water spurts up from the gash in the top of the hood. Then he glances guiltily toward the house, and moves to his van with Duke following.

	Don't make me have to get legal with you, Harry. You sold me the animal, then as a personal favor, I let you borrow him, to demo to some V.I.P.. that probably don't even exist. You haven't been straight with me, man.

Duke jumps into the back of the van. Inside is a large wire travel kennel with another German shepherd inside. Lee removes the leash from Duke and gestures at the other dog:
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you take this dog, Harry. He's green, but maybe you could do something with him.

(closing the van)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sell him for a pet.

As Lee starts to walk past him, Harry detains him, indi- cating the words on the side panel of the van:

	Do me one favor, will you? Say 'owner' if you want to, but don't say 'trainer.' I trained that dog.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate living here now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to move to a small town, where it's friendly, and everybody knows each other, and there are no bars on the windows...
	</DIALOGUE>
<EDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the milkman's a child molester.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Eddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs, then:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDY>

	Well, it's true. It doesn't matter where you live. Shit happens.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
HIS POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sports car is in between the van and Eddy's Jeep. From the higher vantage point of the van, he has a clear view through the rear window of Eddy's Jeep and just before it makes a right-hand turn onto a northbound street, Joan can be seen leaning over to Eddy, placing her face close to his.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS/INT. EDDY'S CAR

<DIRECTION>
Eddy and Joan are now midway above the city. They drive in silence for a while, then he begins what seems to be a casual reminiscence.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember when we were on tour in Japan, in '86?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDY>

<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you be more specific?
	</DIALOGUE>
<EDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had a few drinks in your room. And a certain intimacy took place.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She appears uncertain that she shares the same memory.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And when I asked to see you the next night, you know what you said? You were too tired and sleepy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was witty of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<EDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you weren't. Because an hour later, you went into Lewie's room and you didn't come out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you remember, I was in love with Lewis around that time, which I confided to you, so you did know...
	</DIALOGUE>
<EDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not the reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDY>
<DIRECTION>
She sighs impatiently, then:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, if I remember correctly, we only kissed. But if that led you to believe something that hurt you in any way, I apologize.

</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
He returns his hand to the steering wheel. She looks at him, with a slight smile, waiting for him to elaborate, then:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, am I supposed to guess, or are you going to...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She breaks off, suddenly aware that the teeth marks are her own:

<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Eddy.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. DIRT ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Jeep pulls off Mulholland and onto a dirt road, lifting a haze of dust into the car's headlights, appear- ing and disappearing in the switchbacks, Harry's van can be seen, following.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DIRT ROAD - EDDY'S JEEP - ANOTHER ANGLE ON JEEP - NIGHT The Jeep continues on the winding road, nearing a promontory high above the city.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DIRT ROAD/HARRY'S VAN - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT The van bounces and skids. The green shepherd in the bed of the van pants nervously, looking at Harry struggling with the steering wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DIRT ROAD/IN EDDY'S JEEP - NIGHT The Jeep pitches about on its shocks as it moves up an incline graded slightly higher than the one already giving Harry trouble. Eddy shifts into four-wheel. Joan, jostled about by the uneven surface beneath them, looks over at him:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you do these things?
	</DIALOGUE>
<EDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you deserved it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't deserve it. I've always thought of you and treated you as one of my closest and dearest friends...
	</DIALOGUE>
<EDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I use to think very highly of you, too, but now I don't like what I see. In fact, it's been very disturbing to me, Joan.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pauses, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very disillusioning. To see that before you've even gotten rid of Lewie, you've started up with some other man.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddy, I want you to take me home now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DIRT ROAD/HARRY'S VAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wheels of the van loose traction. Harry gets out and looks up toward the taillights of Eddy's Jeep, disap- pearing in the hazy distance. He looks for a rock and finding one large enough, wedges it under one of the rear tires. Then he quickly gets back into the van.

INT. EDDY'S JEEP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddy and Joan. Under the following, his hand reaches down to something lying out of sight to the left of the driver's seat:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, there's so many things about me you have no idea of. You never ask me about my life or what I'm thinking, because you have no interest...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I do. You can tell me whatever you want to, but let's go back down to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDY>
<DIRECTION>
She breaks off as she catches sight of a knife held in his left hand.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creative things, and dreams, and feelings I have, that Lewie or anyone else in your life, are not capable of...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She suddenly reaches frantically to the door handle and tries to get out. He grabs hold of her arm and pulls her back into the seat:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? You're not genuinely interested. You're not at all sincere, Joan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDY>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<EDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You present yourself like you are, but you're not...

<DIRECTION>
(moves his face closer to hers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you think I know that, better than anybody?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes her arm and places it around his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<EDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to listen to me, and I want you to kiss me. And this time, like you mean it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDY>
<DIRECTION>
He brings his mouth close to hers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DIRT ROAD/EDDY'S JEEP - NIGHT The driver's door suddenly opens and Harry, in the heat and fury of his jealousy, instantly begins berating her:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, what is this! What the hell are you doing with this guy!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches in and pulls Eddy away from Joan.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry, look out!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The warning is simultaneous with an attempt by Eddy to stab him with the knife.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs Eddy's arm and in hauling him out of the car, rips loose the sleeve of Eddy's shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DIRT ROAD/EDDY'S JEEP - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddy and Harry, the latter finding himself engaged in a violent scuffle with a man larger than himself and possessed of the prodigious strength of the psychotic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joan hurries around the car. Harry, his cheek cut, is trying to force the knife out of Eddy's hand. She looks toward Harry's van, parked several yards behind Eddy's car and immediately runs over to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON VAN She pulls open the door and addressing the dog inside, points toward Harry and Eddy:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Duke, fasse!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
The shepherd jumps out of the car, runs past her to the nearest bush and lifts his leg on it.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
She runs back to the two men and hurls herself at them, causing all three of them to land in the brush on an incline at the side of road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A frantic free-for-all takes place on the precarious footing of the hillside, with Joan alternately pulling at one and pushing at the other. The intensity and violence of their struggle is such that she is knocked further down the incline. Harry, quickly glances down the hill to see if she is alright and is left open to severe blow by Eddy, who breaks free and runs to his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry pursues him, catching him as he tries to get into the car. He pushes him against the door and they begin battering each other with a series of punches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SHEPHERD, wanting to join in the excitement, leaps about them, BARKING joyously. Then finding Eddy's sleeve, he takes it in his mouth and begins shaking it vigorously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joan, her hair fretted with twigs, climbs up over the edge of the hill. In the b.g. behind her, a HELICOPTER APPROACHES. She looks toward Harry and Eddy trading blows, then climbs up the rest of the way, and as she gets to her feet, she picks up a stone and throws it at them, yelling:
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bastards!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The search beam of the COPTER spotlights Joan. She is bent over, picking up sticks and stones and as if routing a deadly enemy, she begins hurling them, as well as a series of invectives, at the lights of the city below, her words barely audible over the sound of the ROTORS. The beam sweeps from her, to pick up Harry and Eddy and an AMPLIFIED, God-like voice comes from above:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you people doing down there?

Joan turns back to Harry. He holds the now unconscious Eddy by his shirt front and resuming his accusations, starts to move toward Joan:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you crazy?! What are you doing, running around with a guy like this!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She raises her arm, ready to hurl the last stone:

	You maniacs!! You liars!! You shits!!
	</DIALOGUE>

</JOAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not bothering her, godammit, I love her!!

Harry lets go of Eddy and leans down to pick up the knife, gesturing it at the helicopter:
