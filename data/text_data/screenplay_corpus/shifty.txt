INT. COACH / MOTORWAY. MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the back of the coach we see a lone passenger. His eyes closed, head drooped. Suddenly he raises a hand and rubs the bridge of his nose. It's no use, Chris, 25, can't sleep. He pulls up a set of head phones, puts them on, and presses play on his MP3.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COACH. MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Long shot from the front of the coach, the driver's gruff face to the left, empty seats filtering away from camera, Chris' head peaking above a back seat. We hear the music from his MP3 begin to play. It's Noel McKoy's "Brighter Day", a northern soul track that's reminiscent of Motown and comparable to the vocal sound of Marvin Gaye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The track will play over the following opening scenes, the credits fading subtly in and out in white text.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris walks along a residential road, in his hand a piece of paper with a scribbled address. He finds the right house. He stands there for a moment then hits stop on his MP3. Our soulful soundtrack comes to an end. He pulls down his head phones, walks to the door and knocks gently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING
</DIRECTION>

Shifty stands at the table sorting through letters. He hears the knock and walks to open it. He takes off his jacket, puts it on a hanger and opens the front door to reveal Chris.

<DIRECTION>
INT. REZ'S HOUSE / SHIFTY'S BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris walks into Shifty's bedroom. He puts down his bag and pulls on a fresh tee shirt. He looks around at the room. New DVD player, LCD on the wall, a new game console, DVD's, CD's, lots of pristine trainers placed perfectly side by side, books about business, books about film, a perfectly stacked pile of mobile phone bills with the word "PAID" scribed across them. A picture of Mohammed Ali next to a picture of Allah. He approaches the window and looks out at the morning sun resting over a dull, featureless Dudlowe New-Town. He stands, staring.

We follow Shifty through a corridor deprived of light and colour. Valerie, who leads the way, is considerably smaller. We open into the front room and Valerie's revealed for the first time. At 5'5" with long arms book-ended by bony hands and a sculptured face, she smacks of an ageing Goth and is clearly an old hippie, her brain starched by LSD. Sleeping cats inhabit the surroundings like stationed guards.

Chris looks about at the bits and bobs that litter her front room. Sleeping felines. Chintzy ornaments of cats. He picks up a framed photo of her daughter, Loretta, in better days, fresh faced, before the scars, ready to take on the world. He looks slightly shocked to see this.
</DIRECTION>

CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
Chris sits in a sunken armchair, and looks around the room. He looks closely at a sleeping cat near his chair. He moves his foot and touches it but it slides along the floor, not moving just solid, as if frozen. It dawns on Chris that all the cats in the room are stuffed.
</DIRECTION>

Chris sits back in the chair, suddenly from next door, the deep hum of a drum and bass track starts thumping through the wall. It's so heavy it makes the shelves of chintzy cat ornaments rattle.

INT. VALERIE'S FRONT ROOM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The drum and bass track continues to thud through the wall. A fresh pot of tea stands next to an empty can of soft drink. Shifty pulls out two rocks of crack and places them before Val. Chris watches with intent. He almost can't believe what he's seeing. She opens the cellophane and places down a small yellowy lump. Then carefully she fashions the can into a smoking utensil. At that moment, one of her cat ornaments falls from the shelf because of the vibrating bass. Valerie walks over, picks up the china tabby, and places it carefully back on the side. She sits back down, clearly distressed by the music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're tight on the can as Valerie lifts the paraphernalia to her mouth and takes a hit, a small grimace etched across her lips. She gestures with her hand offering Chris some.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shifty enters. The CAMERA follows. We're introduced to a dark hallway, clothes, magazines and CD's litter the floor. Shifty peers into one of the bedrooms leading off from the hallway - a mattress with no sheets. Shifty carries on down the hallway. Reaching a door, he slowly pushes it open, to reveal a grotty front room. On the TV a violent movie scene plays out, the sound turned down. A wiry looking 18 year old, Otis, sits on the sofa rolling a spliff, absorbed by the films images. A chavvy-looking bird sits to his left. Shifty, cool as a cucumber, rolls into the front room, straight up to the stereo, and turns it off. The young kid sits there, just staring, a spliff held in his two hands, totally flummoxed. Shifty stares him out.
