We hear a strange, single, BENT NOTE. We follow a small boy's FINGERS on a strange contraption-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCRATCH, 10 years old, has a `DIDDLEY BOW', a piece of baling wire nailed to the side of the unpainted shack so it is stretched taut. He moves an old corn cob under it as a fret and makes TWANGY, pitch-shifting NOTES as he plucks the wire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His friend LONNIE stands moving his fingers over a BOARD he has laid on the side of the porch floor. A few scrawny CHICKENS run around in the yard behind them-
</DIRECTION>
<LONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave off with that, Scratch.

EXT. 1ST COTTON FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON SLIDE GUITAR plays. A tuft of RAW COTTON bobs on the stem and we begin to scroll OPENING CREDITS-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We TILT and RACK to look over a FIELD OF COTTON, the bolls plumped out and ready for picking, blowing in the breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HARVEST HAND steps into the shot, looks toward the setting sun, wipes his face with a bandanna then stoops to pick the row in front of him. We PULL BACK to see other PICKERS, men and women in denim coveralls, old gingham dresses and hard work shoes, wearing straw hats against the sun and trailing LONG WHITE SACKS between their legs and behind them.
</DIRECTION>

The boys walk down between them in the opposite direction-

EXT. HONEYDRIPPER LOUNGE - NIGHT We hear PIANO MUSIC as we CRANE DOWN toward the HONEYDRIPPER LOUNGE, a ramshackle wooden roadhouse at a rural crossroads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLUE-colored light bulbs (a few broken) FLICK ON and OFF erratically around the HONEYDRIPPER SIGN as we TRACK toward and then THROUGH it on the way to the entrance, catching up with Lonnie and Scratch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys step under the door-light, frantic with insects, and go up on their toes to peek in through a window-

SINGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A woman in her late 50's, early 60's, BERTHA MAE SPIVEY, leans into a MICROPHONE from where she sits on a stool on a little makeshift stage, a glass of whiskey in hand, and SINGS-
</DIRECTION>
<BERTHA_MAE>

	You women don't worry About your life She made Jack the Ripper Throw away his knife-
	</DIALOGUE>

Lonnie and Scratch step in, cautiously looking around, hoping that nobody will notice and tell them to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They plant themselves next to the piano, Lonnie intently watching the long fingers work the keys- we TILT to see TYRONE `Pinetop' Purvis, proprietor and piano player, in his 50's. He acts as if the boys aren't there, concentrating on the music. We SHIFT to include Bertha Mae as she wraps up the song-
</DIRECTION>
<BERTHA_MAE>

SLICK, a pretty, sharply-dressed man in his late 40's at the bar, and MACEO, who sits at a table near the bandstand smiling throughout, APPLAUD. The sound makes the room seem more empty.

</DIRECTION>
<TY>

Ty runs up to his microphone, shoots a look to the bar-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maceo is pouring a scotch with one hand, the other wrapped around the wires coming out of the wall. He nods to Ty-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny starts to hook his guitar up with a thick COIL OF WIRE, then into the dented AMP sitting on a wooden chair beside him and pointed out at the crowd. Metalmouth Sims looks on uncomfortably. Ty puts on his biggest grin, easing behind the keyboard-

ENTRANCE - TIME AND YOUNG HENRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Time Trenier strolls in with his sax still in its case, hat on his head, exuding his no-sweat attitude. Beside him is YOUNG HENRY, a kid who can't be more than 14, wearing a fedora-
</DIRECTION>
<TY>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<TY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-Guitar Sam!!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TY>
<DIRECTION>
A TERRIBLE SQUAWK emits from the amp as Sonny makes the connection-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheriff Pugh cover his ears-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girls from the store cover their ears, making pained faces-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny pulls his guitar away from the amp and the SQUAWK settles to a FUZZY BUZZ. Sonny frowns at the amp-
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, folks- must of got kicked on the train.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
The audience is stone-faced. Could this really be the man?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young Henry steps up and sits behind the DRUM KIT, pulling sticks from inside his shirt-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ty closes his eyes, begins to shake his head in defeat-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
China Doll looks worried, collecting another cover charge at the door-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delilah steps out from the kitchen and looks to the stage, worried-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny holds his arms out wide, shifting his body to get the BUZZ under control-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dex leans to talk in Junebug's ear-
</DIRECTION>
<DEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this fool playin at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEX>
<DIRECTION>
Maceo isn't going to wait to find out. He grabs the wires with both hands, yanks- they hold firm! He looks to the stage, panicked-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-as Sonny brings his fingers to the strings and the amp BLASTS the room with a long, trip-hammering, spine-shivering, ELECTRIC GUITAR INTRO!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ty stands at the piano with his mouth hanging open-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny WHOOPS and leans into his microphone-
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gonna hold may baby as tight as I can Tonight she'll know I'm a mighty man! Have you heard the news? There's good rockin tonight!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny looks over to Ty, who catches himself and begins to play along. Young Henry is impassive as he plays a fast shuffle on the skins-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ty looks over to Maceo, half-climbing the wall as he tries to pull the wires out. Maceo sees Ty, who waves him off-
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you heard the news? There's good rockin tonight!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Delilah smiles and presses her hands together, shooting a look upward-
</DIRECTION>
<DELILAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Jesus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELILAH>
<DIRECTION>
Time Trenier has his case open now, the gleaming instrument in one hand, squinting at the mouthpiece as he holds it up to the light with the other-
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Meet me at midnight behind the barn Don't you worry I'll do you no harm
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd is already CLAPPING and STOMPING in time with the song. Henry starts to hit the two and the four beat hard to keep time-
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make sure to bring my rockin shoes Tonight I'm gonna rock away all of my blues!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Time Trenier screws the mouthpiece on, puts his horn to his lips and BLOWS right on the beat to take the sax break, walking through the parting crowd to the bandstand!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Junebug grabs Opal's hand and they begin to DANCE a modified jitterbug, people spreading to give them room-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheriff Pugh, hands still over his ears, sits in a corner paying special attention to Opal's hip action-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Time continues to blow, stepping up onto the stage, Sonny keeps urging Metalmouth Sims to come closer to his microphone with the harmonica. Sims is hesitant but Sonny keeps waving- closer, closer-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Metalmouth shoots a nervous look to Ty, who nods from the piano, so he butts his harp smack against the microphone, takes a deep breath and HONKS his soul out, grabbing the break from Time!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The audience goes wild, a half-dozen couples dancing now, others clapping and finger-popping and jumping to the beat where they stand. Sonny shakes out the long CORD attached to his guitar-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
China Doll is trying to keep collecting from the new CUSTOMERS pressing in the door and dance at the same time, thrilled by the music. Lonnie and Scratch sneak in behind her as she turns toward the bandstand-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Metalmouth wraps up his break and Sonny takes over with the guitar again, making it WAIL as he hops off the stage, steps up on a chair, then onto the bar counter!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks the length of the bar, playing his ass off, hops down at the far end, grins at China Doll and heads out through the door, dragging extension cord behind! Lonnie and Scratch hurry to pull slack for him as he steps out into the NIGHT-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ACE OF SPADES - NIGHT Ham and a few other pickers stand outside Toussaint's, beers in hand, staring across toward the Honeydripper as Sonny steps out PLAYING with a CROWD behind him-
</DIRECTION>
<HAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAM>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny steps out into the middle of the crossroads and plays, a CAR stopping short of running him over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hops up on the hood and keeps playing, a TRUCK from the other direction stopping to blast him with its HEADLIGHTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny indicates with his guitar neck to the CROWD emptying out of Toussaint's that he wants them to follow, then hops down onto a big picker's back and is carried back in to the Honeydripper, still playing-
</DIRECTION>
<HAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got to check that out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAM>
<DIRECTION>
A couple dozen patrons move away with him. We HOLD on the doorway as OLD MAN TOUSSAINT comes out to look, puzzled and angry-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HONEYDRIPPER - NIGHT Time and Metalmouth SING into the same microphone as Sonny plays his way back up to the stage-

<DIRECTION>
We FOLLOW as Maceo hustles back and forth, trying to keep up with orders for ribs, bring cold beers out from the icebox, etc. He suddenly stops in his tracks-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nadine stands before him, looking fatally sexy in a SATIN DRESS she no doubt made herself.
</DIRECTION>

He hurries past with his arms full of beer, pivoting to check her out from another angle-
</DIRECTION>

Dex sees across the room, frowns-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ham is talking to Lucille at the bar, leaning in close to be heard over the music-
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard the news- There's good rockin tonight!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny finishes with a squawking chord and the joint goes wild- CHEERING, WHISTLING, STOMPING!
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alla you men grab hold of a woman! You can't find a woman, just grab hold of yourselves- we gonna play this one slow and tight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny goes into the intro for Louis Jordan's Blue Light Boogie. Time lays down a steady rock beat with his sax and Ty joins in at the piano-
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They did the boogie real slow With the blue lights way down low They did the boogie real slow With the blue lights way down low

	<DIALOGUE>
	I went to a party With a bobby sox I started swingin All she would do was rock
	</DIALOGUE>
</TY>
<DIRECTION>
As they join in the chorus, Ty sees-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cool Breeze, strolling in, checking out the action with a proprietary air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ty looks to Maceo, getting back behind the bar. Maceo sees as well, tightening up-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cool Breeze nods to Ty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A slow, sexy SAX BREAK comes up and Ty leaves the piano to cross to the bar. When he gets there Maceo is already counting out a huge pile of BILLS-
</DIRECTION>
<MACEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hundred forty-two, forty-three, forty-four, five, six, seven, eight, nine- hundred fifty. And they's another fifty in here-
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACEO>

Maceo thunks a heavy CLOTH SACK full of change onto the countertop-
</DIRECTION>
<MACEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucky Hardaway don't mind some change, does he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACEO>
<DIRECTION>
Cool Breeze doesn't even glance at the money, hard-eying Ty instead-
</DIRECTION>
<COOL_BREEZE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if Mr. Hardaway was to say let the chumps keep their change, he wants the club back one way or the other?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOL_BREEZE>
<DIRECTION>
Maceo looks to Ty, who remains impassive, mind working-
</DIRECTION>
<COOL_BREEZE>

	How'd that be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOL_BREEZE>
<TY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well- he'd have to take it up with my bidness partner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TY>
<DIRECTION>
Ty shifts and we RACK FOCUS to see across the room to Sheriff Pugh, receiving his sack of chicken and white bread from Delilah. Ty smiles and waves-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cool Breeze reconsiders his terms-
</DIRECTION>
<COOL_BREEZE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sheriff your partner?

<TY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, and he's twice as mean as he is ugly.

</TY>
<DIRECTION>
Cool Breeze grins, scoops up the bills on the counter-
</DIRECTION>
<COOL_BREEZE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must want this club awful bad, brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOL_BREEZE>
<DIRECTION>
Cool Breeze hefts the sack of change, shoots a look to the stage and leans over to speak into Ty's ear-
</DIRECTION>
<COOL_BREEZE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You maybe know this already, but that aint no Guitar Sam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOL_BREEZE>
<DIRECTION>
He steps away just as the song ends to APPLAUSE, Ty taking a deep sigh of relief. Sonny steps up to the microphone to introduce the next song-
</DIRECTION>
<TOUSSAINT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You is a lie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOUSSAINT>
<DIRECTION>
A shocked silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The audience makes way for Old Man Toussaint to come tottering up to the foot of the stage. He points a bony finger at Sonny-
</DIRECTION>
<TOUSSAINT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You is a lie, boy! I known Sammy since he's drinkin mama's milk, hell, I known his Mama herself when she live up to Plaquemine- and you aint him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOUSSAINT>
<DIRECTION>
The audience looks to Sonny for his defense-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ty holds his breath. Maceo brings the baseball bat up from behind the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny just smiles-
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Creole Guitar Sam you talkin bout, Pops. I'm Delta Guitar Sam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>

Toussaint ponders this a moment, then huffs-

</TOUSSAINT>
<JUNEBUG>
	<DIALOGUE>

A CHORUS of CRIES to the same effect, and Sonny crosses back to his microphone-
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Imonna play you one I come up with today while I was havin my hair cut-
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
He starts into a bouncy INTRO that Metalmouth joins in with, then starts to SING as the crowd starts to dance and clap-
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh China Doll Can't get you offa my mind! Oh China Doll I can't get you offa my mind! If you be my baby Gonna leave all them others behind!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
The front row is all girls goggling at Sonny, instant groupies- but we RACK to China Doll, transfixed, as she is drawn toward the stage-
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh China Doll Think about you day and night! Oh China Doll I think about you day and night! Can't forget you baby Oh when you gonna treat me right?

Time Trenier steps in for a growling SAX BREAK-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ty looks around the crowded, rocking room-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV - SHERIFF PUGH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff makes his way through the crowd and out the door. The last person he passes turns toward Ty-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Possum?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then DANCERS cross in front and he is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ty frowns, troubled. Under the sax now we hear a dissonant SLIDE GUITAR, the haunting notes Possum was playing at the train station. Ty searches the crowd-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SLIDE GUITAR continues underneath as we PAN across the crowd dancing-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's Possum again, at the bar, face turned toward Ty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We TIGHTEN on TY. Why is he here?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV - POSSUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Possum turns his head slowly, fixes on something, and we PAN to see Dex and Ham standing toe-to-toe, snarling into each other's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PUNCH IN tighter and tighter on the young men, body language telling us a fight is about to break out-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ECU TY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ty desperately pushes his way across the crowded floor to reach them and the FLASHBACKS come again, the SAX MUSIC growing echoey and menacing-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BAR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shaky perspective and over-saturated colors again, tight on the men struggling, the Girl cowering, then Young Tyrone twisting the Guitar Man's wrist and thrusting, again and again, hugging close to him, then pulled away and the-

-KNIFE falls to the floor, BLOODY, and the-

-and Ham reaches for his knife, but-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-a huge, strong hand clamps down on Dex's wrist-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-and another huge hand grabs Ham's wrist!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ty is there, clamping onto them with a grip of iron.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lighter, bouncier ELECTRIC GUITAR RIFF has replaced the sax now. Ty looks deep into the eyes of the two surprised pickers-
</DIRECTION>
<TY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yall in my house, here, gentlemen. Don't have no fightin, don't have no killin, don't have none of that dismal nonsense in my house. Understand? What's your name son?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TY>
<DIRECTION>
Dex is shaken by the strength of the grip on his arm-
</DIRECTION>
<DEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dex- Dexter Moncrief.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEX>
<TY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TY>
<HAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hamilton Drinkwater.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAM>
<TY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, gentlemen, this is the night there won't be no pitiful song written bout you two killin each other. Don't nothin rhyme with `Moncrief' anyhow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TY>
<DIRECTION>
Maceo is there now, holding a cardboard BOX in one hand and the BASEBALL BAT in the other-
</DIRECTION>
<MACEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got a problem here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACEO>
<TY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These young men seem to brought something in for our collection.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TY>
<MACEO>
<DIRECTION>
(to Dex)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yours first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACEO>
<DIRECTION>
Ty gently takes the pistol from Dex, regards it grimly before laying it in the box. He turns his attention to Ham-
</DIRECTION>
<TY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TY>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the knife from Ham, tosses it in the box-
</DIRECTION>
<TY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yall still need to mess with each other, you go outside and do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TY>
<DIRECTION>
Ty lets go of their wrists-
</DIRECTION>
<TY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This world is full of people got no use for us, like to see us in the grave. We don't need to give em any help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TY>
<DIRECTION>
The two give each other a final dirty look and move away into opposite corners-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny keeps playing-
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh China Doll Got to let you into my heart! Oh China Doll Got to let you into my heart! I surrender darlin I loved you from the very start!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Ty rushes to the piano, joins in jamming with the other players-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT Slick sits on a tomb, drinking wine, MOONLIGHT spilling over Bertha Mae's fresh-dug GRAVE. He listens to the MUSIC in the far distance-
</DIRECTION>
<SLICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sound like the music movin on again, darlin. The way it always do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLICK>
<DIRECTION>
He listens for another moment, sighs-
</DIRECTION>
<SLICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time to make room for whoever comin next.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLICK>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HONEYDRIPPER - MORNING The SUN RISES next to the Honeydripper sign. We hear the CROW of a distant ROOSTER. The parking lot is empty but for Ty's old Ford-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ty, exhausted but happy, steps out front. He pastes a SNIPE that says HELD OVER! across the Guitar Sam poster-
</DIRECTION>
<POSSUM>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That boy can play some.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POSSUM>
<DIRECTION>
Ty turns. Possum is on the road, guitar strung over his shoulder, feeling his way with a red-tipped CANE.
</DIRECTION>
<TY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You leavin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TY>
<POSSUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aint needed round here no more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POSSUM>
<TY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where you headed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TY>
<POSSUM>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh-- down the road.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POSSUM>
<DIRECTION>
Ty watches the blind man move away for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<MACEO>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tyrone-
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACEO>
<DIRECTION>
Ty turns as Maceo steps out, equally tired and unshaven-
</DIRECTION>
<MACEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who you talkin to out here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACEO>
<DIRECTION>
Maceo looks down the road, but Possum is nowhere to be seen. Ty shrugs-
</DIRECTION>
<TY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHARECROPPER SHACK - EARLY MORNING Scratch and Lonnie are set to pretend to play music again. Lonnie spreads his fingers over the keys he's drawn on the board-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-and begins to PLAY! Fast, rhythmic boogie piano-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instead of a Diddley bow, Scratch is pretending to tune the two strings on a `guitar' made of a plank of wood and baling wire. He carefully takes a length of clothesline rope leading from the guitar, tacks the end of it to the wall of the shack, plugging himself in. He looks to Lonnie, who nods, and then-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-he begins to PLAY in time with Lonnie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We CRANE UP and away from them, the MUSIC spilling out over the field-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It sounds a whole lot like rock and roll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
