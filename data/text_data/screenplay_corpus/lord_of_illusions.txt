A SLOW DRIFT through a collection of crudely constructed, surreal, six-foot tall "IDOLS." Like modern demons. Grotesque. Disturbing. WE LAP DISSOLVE between details of their twisted anatomies: headlamp eyes, bright metal claws, broken glass teeth.

A violent WIND HOWLS around, but through the sand we-can just make out a large, ominous building: the HOUSE of William Nix. Its walls are white-washed and scrawled with GRAFFITI. The "family" of IDOLS surrounds the doorway, guarding it. ON SCREEN, the words: '"Nevada - Thirteen Years Ago"

EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're at the front door now, which stands open. Leaning against the door-frame is a scrawny, wild-eyed YOUTH, about sixteen. His name is BUTTERFIELD. He's got a brooding, almost sultry look on his face. One of his eyes is black, the other milky blue. He's whittling something with a scalpel. Distantly, the sound of CAR ENGINES. Butterfield narrows his eyes.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - ROOMS AND CORRIDORS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house no longer serves any domestic function. It has become the temple and dormitory of Nix's small apocalyptic cult. As we go through the house with Butterfield we glimpse a little of what life here is like.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rooms are murky, and chaotic. The walls, PAINTED with scenes of cities and landscapes BURNING, and creatures from some unspeakable nightmare ATTACKING, RAPING, and DEVOURING helpless humanity. The atmosphere is joyless, and oppressive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his way to the heart of the house. Only OIL LAMPS, set on the floor, light these claustrophobic corridors.

A dozen CULTISTS sit cross-legged on the floor in front of their leader, WILLIAM NIX. His black hair grows to his shoulders. His eyes are deep and glittering, his voice seductive. A terrifying yet charismatic presence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the Cultists - who are a cross-section of obsessives - wear the same simple T-shirts, painted with the cult's SIGIL. They watch Nix in adoration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Nix speaks, he juggles a FLAME, passing it from hand to hand with casual ease...

A place of nightmares. Hanging from the middle of the ceiling is another grotesque SCULPTURE, three times the bulk of a large man, and made of metal, fly-blown animal parts and knotted rope. It is vaguely cruciform, but its swaying, creaking bulk is not even faintly Christian. It is a perverse, sickening image, evoking insanity and agony.

From the shadows in the corner, we hear a young girl's soft SOBBING.
</DIRECTION>
<NIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hush...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIX>
<DIRECTION>
Nix goes to the GIRL. She is twelve; beautiful, blonde, and presently in a state of mortal fear. She sits, bound, in a fetal position, her face soaked with SWEAT and TEARS, her mouth BLOODIED, her cheek BRUISED.

Nix catches hold of its chain. Holds it back. The Baboon starts screeching again, scrabbling at the Girl, its NAILS catching her arms and legs, drawing BLOOD.

She smiles a crazy smile. Reaches out for Quaid. A SNAKE appears from around the back of her neck. Quaid recoils.

And now we see that there are snakes everywhere. In the Cultists' clothes and hair. Even on the baby. Quaid turns away. And - shock! - there's a SNAKE on the door frame, winding around his hand. He strikes it to the ground, and drives his heel down on its head.

Swann starts towards her, his footsteps barely audible. As he approaches the chair - the Baboon leaps at him screeching!

The facade of this small HOTEL off Hollywood Boulevard needs a lick of paint, and the neon sign is blinking fitfully, but it has a certain charm.

INT. STARDUST HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large deteriorating mural of Hollywoodland, depicting a host of 50's movie stars, dominates the lobby. At the front desk - with his back to us at present - stands HARRY D'AMOUR. He is having difficulty getting the pretty but vacant BLONDE at the reception desk to comprehend his name.

INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>

On the suit-case, which is now on the bed. Harry flings it open. Inside, mingled with the clothes, a bizarre collection of items, which he tosses out onto the coverlet. A GUN. A CRUCIFIX. A STATUE of Shiva, the Hindu Lord of creation and destruction.

EXT. MELROSE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry stands, in a shabby doorway across the street from a classy restaurant. It's RAINING. ON TAPERT, a middle-aged, balding man with a very pretty WOMAN opposite him, sitting at a table close to the window. Tapert makes a joke (unheard). The woman laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HARRY, chewing on a hamburger, as he speaks into his tape recorder.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nine-eighteen p.m. Tapert's either got a great sense of humour or he's paying her to laugh.

In neon blue and purple, a sign blazes in a store window. It reads: TAROT CARD AND CRYSTAL READINGS - $15 SPECIAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TAPERT, as he hurries across the street, and through the door beside the store window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE PAN OFF the door as Harry's car comes to a halt on the far side of the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry gets out of the car. Stares at the sign in the window, puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Superstitious?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He starts across the street. Suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<TAPERT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAPERT>
<DIRECTION>
Tapert emerges, his face white with terror. He stumbles to his car, and he's away. Harry freezes, caught between the need to follow Tapert and sheer curiosity. He gives in to the latter, and steps inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An illuminated ARROW points up the stairs. Harry ascends, past faded PHOTOGRAPHS of Caspar Quaid with famous faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the landing, the passageway turns ninety degrees. Harry halts, and takes out his GUN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a strange RUMBLING SOUND approaching from round the corner. Harry chances a look. There's a short length of passageway, leading to an open door. From the threshold a CRYSTAL BALL rolls towards Harry, BLOOD- SMEARED. This is the source of the rumbling. Harry stops the ball before it falls down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dead silence. After a beat, Harry creeps towards the open door. He pushes it open. Inside, chaos. The fake antique FURNITURE is splintered, the ASTRAL CHARTS slashed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are two offices. In the front, a Waiting Room, into which Harry now steps. Beyond it, through a door that stands narrowly ajar, the Fortune Telling Room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From out of the Fortune Telling Room, a MOAN.
</DIRECTION>
<QUAID>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahh. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUAID>
<DIRECTION>
Harry crosses the Waiting Room, reaching into his jacket for his gun. Suddenly, a nightmarish FIGURE leaps from the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His name is RAY MILLER. He's as crazy as a rabid dog, teeth sharpened, eyes wild. Nix's SIGIL is tattooed on the middle of his forehead. He STRIKES the GUN from Harry's hand and goes for his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry reaches out behind him, picks up a phrenologist's BUST and SMASHES it on Miller's skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miller reels back. Harry makes a dash for the door to the Fortune Telling Room.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuckhead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - FORTUNE-TELLING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mysterious, candle-lit space. In the middle of the room, a table. At it sits Quaid. thirteen years older. He has been tortured close to death. Several small SCALPELS protrude from his chest and neck. His life is ebbing away. On the table in front of him, a fan of TAROT CARDS, BLOOD-SPATTERED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry races in through the open door from the Waiting Room.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry picks up the PHONE. It's dead. Miller charges at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry SLAMS the door in Miller's face, and locks it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he does so, the candles FLICKER. Harry looks up. A FIGURE looms from the darkness behind Quaid. He's in his late twenties: an androgynous, disturbing sight. His long hair is drawn back into a pony-tail. His mismatched eyes - one black, one milky blue, tell us that he is Butterfield. His hands are BLOODY, and he carries one last SCALPEL.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Butterfield)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't touch him."
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Butterfield strokes the wounds on Quaid's cheek. Quaid sobs in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTTERFIELD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTTERFIELD>
<DIRECTION>
Miller's hand tears at the wood around the lock from the other side. His fingers appear, scrabbling to tear the lock out. Harry doesn't move, or Miller will be through.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTTERFIELD>
<DIRECTION>
(to Harry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever watched a man die? If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTTERFIELD>
<QUAID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there. Ask Pimm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUAID>
<BUTTERFIELD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pimm's dead. Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared. They knew the Puritan was coming home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTTERFIELD>
<DIRECTION>
As this exchange goes on, Miller pulls the lock out of the door and starts to THROW HIMSELF against it from the other side. It's all Harry can do to keep himself from being pitched across the room. He looks around for some means of defense. There's a crack in the drapes to the left of the table. Behind it a WINDOW.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTTERFIELD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So do you. You've seen the future. Haven't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTTERFIELD>
<QUAID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUAID>
<BUTTERFIELD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And are you afraid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTTERFIELD>
<QUAID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUAID>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Harry steps aside. The door's flung open. Miller CHARGES in. Harry catches hold of his arm, and THROWS him against the drape. The window CRACKS; the drape comes down around Miller. Amber STREETLIGHT floods in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butterfield is momentarily distracted. Harry STRIKES the scalpel from his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miller, meanwhile, is struggling to free himself from the folds of the drapes. Harry lands a solid KICK to the man's belly. Miller is THROWN back against the cracked window, which SHATTERS. Still wrapped in the drape, he FALLS OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry turns back to arrest Butterfield, but he's already making his escape. Harry starts after him.
</DIRECTION>
<QUAID>
<DIRECTION>
(to Harry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't leave me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUAID>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back. TEARS are pouring down the man's face. Harry goes back to comfort Quaid, as Butterfield escapes down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need an ambulance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<QUAID>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too late. Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?

<DIRECTION>
Quaid takes hold of Harry's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO ... I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid stares at Harry's HAND. Fascinated, he momentarily forgets his pain. He traces the lines with bloody fingers.

He looks away, down at the CARDS. All have been turned over but ONE. He turns it. The card is the Ten of Swords which pictures a prostrate man against a thunderous sky, pierced by all ten swords. An image of death and desolation.

EXT. QUAID'S OFFICES - ALLEY BEHIND BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flashing LIGHTS of two patrol cars illuminate the scene. DETECTIVE EDDISON, a surfer-turned-policeman with buzz-cut blond hair, heads along the alley with Harry. He's midway through taking Harry's statement. There are already two OFFICERS examining the drapes. We can't yet see the body.

The rooms are spartan. Nothing on the walls. Nothing on the floors. Very little furniture.

Butterfield sits beside the window, obsessively combing his long hair. There is something feminine about him now: his voice a whisper, his stare distracted. If we didn't guess it already, we're in the presence of a madman.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swann raises his hands above his head and a SPEAR miraculously appears in his grasp. He descends on the dragon. It's a classic image: St. Michael smiting the Devil. Swann drives the spear down the throat of the dragon. The theatre SHAKES at its dying ROARS. Then the head cracks open, and out of the dragon's mouth emerge a dozen scantily dressed DANCERS, male and female. Swann throws down the spear, and where it strikes the stage his PANTHER appears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ROAR of APPLAUSE from the audience. Swann's plain white tunic falls away from him as he descends. By the time his feet touch the stage he is dressed in a star- shot TUXEDO. The PANTHER licks his hand in welcome. The MUSIC comes to a crescendo. The DANCERS freeze in their erotic dance. In the sudden hush, Swann speaks in a whisper.

As he FALLS, the sword runs through the middle of his back, carrying him down to the still-spinning wheel, and pinning him there. Some of the DANCERS continue to cavort. Some stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More GASPS from the audience.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HARRY, having a --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK: Harry's hand turns over the final tar of card. The scene on the stage is that image coming to life.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's something wrong...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
ON Swann, as a second sword FALLS, skewering his thigh, and a third, running through his buttock, and a fourth and fifth, until TEN SWORDS have entered his body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE AUDIENCE, not certain whether this is a trick or not.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC has stopped. In the silence, somebody GIGGLES nervously. A couple of PEOPLE break into APPLAUSE, but it dies away in a matter of moments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON DOROTHEA AND HARRY
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE STAGE, Swann raises his head and looks out at his wife, his eyes already glassy with imminent death. He reaches out towards her, and then sags on the wheel, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are GASPS now from the audience. Murmurs of disgust; sobs of horror.
</DIRECTION>
<1ST_AUDIENCE_MEMBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?

The curtains start to close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON Dorothea, tears of shock filling her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Harry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got to get to him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
The AUDIENCE is rising now, as the horror of what they've seen sinks in. There is panic. A few people have fainted. One or two are even praying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry carves out a path down to the stage for Dorothea against the flood of the exiting crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out of the way! Out of the way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He helps Dorothea onto the stage, and lifts the curtain so she can duck beneath it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chaos. PEOPLE running, sobbing, puking; some simply standing watching. Valentin is already at the body, with the STAGE MANAGER at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Stage Manager)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get then out of here, for God's sake --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<STAGE_MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You heard him! It's not a fucking show!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAGE_MANAGER>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to physically push the crowd back. Harry grabs his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<STAGE_MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAGE_MANAGER>
<DIRECTION>
Harry uses his grip to gently but efficiently move the STAGE MANAGER out of Dorothea's way. She goes to Swann's body, which has been removed from the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The audience is clearing now. But Butterfield is coming towards the stage, with an ambiguous look on his face. Is he enraged? Or puzzled? Or both?
</DIRECTION>
<MILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Psst!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLER>
<DIRECTION>
Miller stands at an open door, leading below the stage.
</DIRECTION>

Butterfield enters.

<DIRECTION>
INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dorothea kneels at Swann's side. A few yards from her, Harry examines the mechanism of the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swann...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
A DOCTOR appears.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a doctor. Let me through.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Doctor checks Swann's body.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(to Dorothea)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Harry has discovered a CABLE snaking down beside the device. He's suspicious. He slips round to the back of the mechanism, and climbs down beneath the stage, tracing the cable as he goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILTERN THEATRE - BELOW STAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's an eerie, shadowy space, filled with the PROPS that are used in the show, including the DRAGON we saw at the beginning. From above we hear FOOTSTEPS and VOICES, muted and echoing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cable ends in bare wires. Whatever was here has been taken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A NOISE, behind Harry. He swings round. Sees a shadowy FIGURE ducking away.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He gives chase. Loses the man in the shadows. Stops and listens for movement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Miller steps out of the shadows with a plank of wood and smashes it into Harry's face!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry reels back. Falls to his knees, BLOOD running from his nose. Miller pulls Harry's GUN out of his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got you, fucker!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLER>
<DIRECTION>
Harry is facing the dragon's head, dazed. And now, out of the dragon's mouth, comes Butterfield.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTTERFIELD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who did this, D'Amour? Who killed Swann?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTTERFIELD>
<DIRECTION>
Harry is barely holding on to consciousness.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<BUTTERFIELD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would I do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTTERFIELD>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beats me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Butterfield is a foot from Harry now.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTTERFIELD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTTERFIELD>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Deep shit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Butterfield hits him.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTTERFIELD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who did this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTTERFIELD>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Butterfield hits him again.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTTERFIELD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who did this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTTERFIELD>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(raises his hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. It was...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Butterfield comes a little closer.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(feigning a near collapse)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... it was...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Butterfield leans in. And Harry grabs him by the balls -- literally -- rising as he does so.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTTERFIELD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTTERFIELD>
<DIRECTION>
Harry THROWS Butterfield aside. Butterfield hits the ground in agony, and Harry swings round to protect himself from Miller, who's leveling Harry's gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He FIRES once, missing Harry by inches. Harry catches hold of a ROPE underfoot and pulls it, tripping Miller, who TOPPLES backwards into the mouth of the dragon. The GUN GOES OFF again, the bullet BLOWING APART the dragon's JAW MECHANISM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miller starts to sit up, his body splayed between the dragon's steel teeth. He has Harry in his sights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- something CREAKS. He looks up. The dragon's jaw is closing, FAST. He starts to scramble to his feet. Too late! The teeth SLAM CLOSED on his body. Sudden death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry looks round to see Butterfield retreating into the shadows. Then he's gone. Harry looks down at Miller's BLOOD, which is pooling around his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>

Harry sits at Eddison's desk, looking exhausted and bruised. Eddison has just finished taking his statement.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDISON>

	And this Butterfield guy--

</EDDISON>

<EDDISON>

(frustrated sigh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another fucking magician. Jesus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDISON>
<DIRECTION>
Harry looks past Eddison and sees an ashen, tearful Dorothea being taken into another office.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you finished with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<EDDISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For now. Are you planning to go back to New York?

Dorothea sits alone, staring at the wall. Harry enters.

<HARRY>

	Are they treating you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DOROTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard what happened. It looks like somebody murdered him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DOROTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know where you'd start.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DOROTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They won't tell you anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can be very persuasive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DOROTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I think you probably can.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(another beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'd need to talk about your fee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget the fee. If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money. If I don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...my gamble. Either way... I get to spend some time... here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
The way he says this, it's plain "here" doesn't mean L.A., it means near -Dorothea. And by the tiny smile on her face, it's also plain she knows it.

CUT TO:

EXT. MAGIC SHOP - HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Noon. Bright sun. Busy street. Harry, now wearing a bandage on his cut face, enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAGIC SHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wonderland for illusionists. Books, props, masks, tricks, etc. Two or three CUSTOMERS browse. Harry glances at them all, then targets a MAN in late middle age, who is browsing through books, one-handed. His other hand constantly manipulates a card, concealing and revealing it in a dozen ways. He doesn't even look at his hand. His name is WALTER WILDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry stands beside him. Scans the shelf.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd you learn that?
	</DIALOGUE>

	I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.

</WILDER>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm in from New York. I came to see Swann.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<WILDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a tragedy. It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILDER>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was he taking a lot of risks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<WILDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILDER>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not the Walter Wilder?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Walter beams.
</DIRECTION>
<WILDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The one and only.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILDER>
<DIRECTION>
He hands Harry a card.
</DIRECTION>
<WILDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want to try?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILDER>
<DIRECTION>
Harry tries to emulate Wilder's card manipulation through the rest of this conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<WILDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know Vinovich?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILDER>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(not a clue)

	Sure. Vivovich.

	I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.

	People are pretty cagey. Who do you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILDER>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<WILDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For an introduction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILDER>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... nobody.

Wilder takes a moment to assess Harry, who is attempting to manipulate the card he's been given with charming ineptitude.

EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - DUSK

The castle is faux, of course, but it has a Gothic charm.

Harry and Walter wander towards the front door. Harry is knotting a newly-bought tie.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I only wear ties for funerals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<WILDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists. Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILDER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - CORRIDORS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The interior is murky and atmospheric, the walls covered with illusionists' posters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter leads the way through the long corridors, past rooms where illusionists are performing close-up magic for audiences of well-heeled patrons. Walter nods and waves to half a dozen people on their way through the house, up the stairs and towards the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are they all in the business?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<WILDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILDER>
<DIRECTION>
Wilder points to a locked door.
</DIRECTION>
<WILDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what they call the Repository. Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILDER>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you been in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<WILDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MAGIC CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later. A drunken VINOVICH is holding court. He's in his 40's: a flamboyant and loquacious man with a heavy (and fake) middle-European accent. At the table - besides Harry and Walter - are: Vinovich's starlet/nymphet girlfriend LAURA; an Asian-American illusionist called BILLY WHO; and two of Vinovich's adoring courtiers, an overblown, overdressed female illusionist - DEBRA DEVINE - and a thin, waspish fellow in a spangly suit: the AMAZING QUENTIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the conversation that follows we go back to Harry repeatedly as he studies this extraordinary group.
</DIRECTION>
<VINOVICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's more than entertainment. We're opening people's heads up. Putting miracles back into their boring little lives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINOVICH>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But they're fake miracles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<VINOVICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Houdini believed he had spirit guides.

</VINOVICH>
<HARRY>

</HARRY>
<VINOVICH>
	<DIALOGUE>

</VINOVICH>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heaven and Hell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Vinovich stares hard at Harry, trying to figure out whether he's being sarcastic or not.
</DIRECTION>
<VINOVICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trickery and divinity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINOVICH>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<VINOVICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'm saying they were always fake. The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINOVICH>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So could you walk on water?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<VINOVICH>
<DIRECTION>
(deadly serious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINOVICH>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Swann's miracles?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
The smug smile on Vinovich's face dies. Furtive glances are exchanged around the table. Only Billy Who makes a tiny smile.
</DIRECTION>
<VINOVICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They weren't worth a damn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINOVICH>

INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

<DIRECTION>
There should be a subtle eroticism pervading this exchange. Both of them on beds, in different bedrooms. Each aroused by the other's voice, and frustrated not to be able to see and touch them.

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's okay.

On the pad beside the bed, Jennifer's name, surrounded by Harry's doodles. The phone RINGS.

EXT./INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Tarot Card and Crystal Readings sign is dark now. Harry heads up the stairs, past the PHOTOGRAPHS, to the door of Quaid's Waiting Room. It has been locked and taped by the police. Harry has come prepared. He takes out a small crowbar and levers off the locks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING/FORTUNE TELLING ROOMS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry enters, FLASHLIGHT on. He crosses the Waiting Room and enters the Fortune-Telling Room where Quaid died. On the TRACK -- a remote, eerie presence -- we hear Quaid's SOBS, Miller's SHOUTS, and, as Harry's flashlight illuminates the blood-spattered table:

(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTTERFIELD>
<DIRECTION>
Harry is spooked. He starts to search the room, opening cabinets and drawers. Quaid's hordes of mystical bric-a-brac are stashed everywhere. Boxes of crystals, religious statues, elaborate cards, incense, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls open a drawer, and notices that a rosary is wedged in a niche at the base of the drawer. He pulls the drawer out, empties its contents on the table, and examines it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using the crowbar, he forces the drawer apart. It has a false bottom.

	You didn't hire me. She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain. Enough churning over the past. She wants it all left alone.

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Left alone? Somebody's been murdered.

Harry looks up - with some surprise - not at a house but at a building, the sign on which reads, "St. Luke's Sanitorium".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - DAY

The place is bland and functional throughout, the walls decorated with sun-faded reproductions of great paintings. Nothing disturbing. Harry is talking to D.A. TOFFLER - black, fortyish, softly spoken - and a Nurse.

<TOFFLER>

	Right. And he's dead, isn't he? I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know. And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.

</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - CORRIDORS AND WARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Toffler excorts Harry through -the place. There are distressing scenes on every side. Nothing melodramatic no screaming, no fits. Just a subtle, pervasive air of despair. Blank, empty FACES in blank, empty rooms.
</DIRECTION>
<TOFFLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.

</TOFFLER>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's her problem?

	Oh yes. We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOFFLER>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what does Jennifer think's real?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>

They've come to french windows, which are wide open. Sitting outside in the sun is Jennifer, with her back to us.

Ahead now, the site where the workmen are digging a hole, laying pipes. The CAMERA doesn't focus on this action, but we're aware of it.

	I told you. I don't --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>

She stops. Looks ahead of her. Her face is suddenly ashen and clammy. Harry follows her gaze to:

The hole. Somebody is in it, digging. Earth emerges in shovelfuls, piling up beside the hole.

She delivers the Nurse a backhand SWIPE. The Nurse is flung back.

</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jennifer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She scrambles up over a wall, and flings herself from the top. There's a SCREECH of brakes, then the smashing of metalwork and glass. Harry gets to the wall before the Nurse. Hoists himself up onto it. Looks down.

HARRY'S P.O.V. OF STREET

Jennifer is dead in the middle of the street, beneath the wheels of a car. The DRIVER is out, and yelling incoherently.

	Jesus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He slips back down the wall, and leans against it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks towards the hole. The Workman has stopped digging. His mud-encrusted hands emerge, and for a moment, before his head appears, the image is eerily like somebody climbing from a grave. Harry closes his eyes.

	You go through these. Go on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Reluctantly, Billy does so. Harry picks up a faded PHOTOGRAPH of the doorway to Nix's HOUSE (with the sigil painted on it) and BUTTERFIELD the child standing in the sun. There are other CULTISTS standing around. And in the DOORWAY -- a barely visible figure (and all the more intimidating for that) - is NIX.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at the boy's face. The eyes are clearly different colours.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Butterfield...

</HARRY>
<BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(points to nan in) doorway)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And who's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
ON HARRY, staring at the ambiguous presence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE PHOTOGRAPH of the shadowy figure.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At a guess? The Puritan. Nix.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Billy picks up an ETCHING, water-stained and dirty. It shows a horror we recognize: a man's HAND pressed into the FLESH of another man's HEAD.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a look at this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A Nix specialty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Billy is getting subtly spooked now. He puts the etching down and starts to go through others in the series. We glimpse them as he does so. In one, a MAN regurgitates a serpentine form made of FLAME. In another, a MAN stares at his own HAND which is STRIPPED OF FLESH. There is no bone beneath. Only a form of solid blackness. In a third, we see a HEAD with a slit in the middle of the brow, emanating DARKNESS.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know any of these tricks...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry studies the etchings.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(a slow burn)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe they're not tricks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(mystified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, there's no instructions--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(realizes what Harry said)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, they're not tricks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trickery and divinity. Yeah, he says that all the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's because he knew. He'd seen these files and knew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knew what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Out of the corner of his eye. Harry sees a motion between the book-stacks. Billy frowns. Harry puts his fingers to his lips. Gestures for Billy to take cover. Billy backs away. Harry slowly turns in the direction of the motion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something eerily sepulchral is gliding between the stacks. A figure in a straight-jacket with his head bowed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry takes out his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Billy disappears around the back of one of the stacks. Harry goes after the apparition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TRACK is completely silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the creature appears behind Billy! It looks up, its face that of a psychotic: burning eyes, manic smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It tears open its straight-jacket and reaches for Billy, who backs away.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Books tumble on top of Billy as he stumbles against the shelves.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where the fuck are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry appears, and puts his gun to the PSYCHO'S head.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Hold it right there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
The gun goes through the Psycho's skull, as though it's made of smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry waves his hands through it. It's completely ethereal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But it's still terrorizing Billy.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(in mortal terror)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get it off me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry glances around. Sees a LIGHT flickering between some books. FIRES at it. The light goes out. The "Psycho" vanishes. Billy is left hyper-ventilating on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hokey enough for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm out of here, man! Are you coming?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry picks up a handful of papers from the Nix file.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Billy is already out of the room. For a moment. Harry pauses to look back at the other files, sealed behind the spiked gates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he does so --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the proiector sparks into life one last time, and the "Psycho" appears --ROARING - at Harry's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, shaddup!

He FIRES at the projector a second time.

INT. SWANN'S MANSION - CASKET ROOM - NIGHT

The room is a museum of Swarm's career. Posters, and memorabilia everywhere. And in the middle of the room, Swann's sealed CASKET, surrounded by flowers and candles. Dorothea is standing beside it, head bowed.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the way he wanted it... no autopsy, no embalming. Nobody meddling with his body...
	</DIALOGUE>

Harry approaches, slowly.

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stuff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DOROTHEA>

	He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Dorothea is pouring herself another drink. The glass slips from her hand. It SHATTERS. Harry goes to help her. They stoop together, very close. The sexual attraction is almost palpable. Dorothea cuts herself on a shard of glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!

They are very close to each other.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A room of illusions. Walls lined with mirrors, and warm, flattering lighting, bathing the naked forms of Dorothea and Harry as they make love, sitting on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a deeply passionate, but slow, sensual coupling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - NIGHT

Valentin opens the front door. There's a wind blowing. The palms churn against the night sky...

Roiling, wind-filled pains with the glistening, urgent bodies of Harry and Dorothea.

INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STAIRS - LOBBY - NIGHT

Harry descends the stairs, buttoning up his trousers (which is all he wears). He has his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Valentin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Dorothea appears behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry? Wait!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
Harry's at the bottom of the stairs now. Across the hall, in a passageway, an eerie SILHOUETTE. We can make out no detail of clothing or face.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell-?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the shadowy FIGURE comes at Harry. A BLAST of ENERGY bursts against Harry's face. As it breaks against his skin, we see (for three frames or so) a glimpse of Harry's skull.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(in pain)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry FIRES at the figure. The shadows fold up around the Stranger like an origami puzzle. He's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's him! It's Nix!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
Harry goes out into the passageway.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Valentin! Get some lights on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
As if in reply to the command, a burst of vivid white FIRE erupts behind Harry. He swings round to see the Stranger "unfolding" out of the shadows again, defying physics and physiology to do so. The FIRE is at his feet, like a serpent writhing on the ground. It comes at Harry. Harry FIRES at it, but it comes at him faster still, rising to burn Harry's leg. He retreats, the FIRE racing after him. He makes for a door, and flings it open. He's in --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SWANN'S MANSION - CASKET ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FIRE follows him across the ground and STRIKES his hand. Harry drops the GUN. Looks up to see the Stranger in the doorway, arm raised to will the fire-serpent on. But then, he hesitates. Harry glances round, and sees that the Stranger - whose face is still a dark smear - is staring at the CASKET.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>

Dorothea appears behind the Stranger. Sees Harry, burned and sweating, cornered against the casket.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
The Stranger looks round. Harry snatches up the GUN, supporting his burned hand with -his good hand. Levels the gun at the Stranger. The FIRE raises its head, like a cobra.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which goes first? My face or your heart?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
The Stranger draws a deep breath. The Fire-Serpent withers and dies.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who in God's name are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches for the Stranger, who simply folds up again; gone into darkness. The WIND blows through the house, masking his exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Find Valentin! Find him! Get him in here!

Dorothea disappears. Harry takes one of the candle-holders and jams it under the casket lid. Wood splinters. He starts to force off the lid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valentin and Dorothea enter.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing? This is sacrilege.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
He starts towards Harry. Dorothea goes after him and catches hold of his arm. Her expression is a mingling of fascination and dread, as Harry gets his fingers under the casket lid and pulls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, Swann's corpse.

<VALENTIN>

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right. It's not hurting...

</HARRY>

He now has four fingers in Swann's mouth and seizes hold of his lower jaw. It cracks --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and comes away in a little rain of plaster and latex.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...plaster doesn't bleed.

He tosses the jaw to Valentin.

WE CRANE DOWN from a high angle on a GRAVE, surrounded by MOURNERS. The graveside service has just ended, and the Mourners are beginning to disperse. Dorothea is there amongst them, of course. So are several faces we recognize: Vinovich, Wilder, Billy Who, Swann's Stage Manager, his Dancers, his Technicians. There are also several members of the PRESS, and thirty or fourty other Mourners, some of whom, to judge by their dress and manner, are also illusionists.

The stage is starkly lit with working lights, the auditorium in darkness. Swann's equipment - including the partially dismantled Dragon's head - is heaped on the stage.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY

Valentin hears something in the auditorium. Looks up.

	Who's there?

</VALENTIN>

He reaches into his jacket to draw a GUN. There's a NOISE. He swings round. Too late.

Butterfield has a scalpel at his throat. He kicks Valentin to the ground.

On Valentin, staring up in terror.

Valentin's P.O.V.- of Butterfield, upside down, above him, the scalpel glittering.

<BUTTERFIELD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To be able to heal with one little cut.

EXT. L.A. STREET - SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bad neighborhood, to judge by the state of the streets. Harry gets out of his car and crosses to a gate, topped with barbed wire. He peers through the bars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry's P.O.V. of the STRANGER from the funeral disappearing into the building. He glances back towards the street. We get a glimpse of a bearded face beneath the brim of his hat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry slides out of sight. Waits until the Stranger has gone inside. Then he's up, over the gate, braving the barbed wire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. -SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's been a hospital. Now the echoing corridors and wards are deserted, littered with reminders of old suffering. Rotting mattresses; spilled boxes of surgical supplies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry explores this tiled labyrinth, looking for some sign of the Stranger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He enters a shadowy room. Birds fly UP into his face!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he retreats, another SOUND, a little distance from him. GUN in hand, he heads towards it, and steps into

Narrow shafts of light through the circular viewing window fall on an operating table, and looming pieces of discarded equipment. Eerie. Disturbing.

Silence.

Harry looks up.

Svanrt is hovering in the air above him. The veins in his temples bulge and throb. This trick requires a lot of concentration.

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Ma, no wires.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<SWANN>
	<DIALOGUE>

Swann swoops down towards Harry, who levels his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be careful. Funerals make me trigger-happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Swann stops, inches from the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, it's such a fucking waste. You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.

<SWANN>

	Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour. Magicians get burned.

<SWANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He deserved it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now. That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?

<SWANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did it for Dorothea.

	Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.

Harry grabs Swann, literally pulling him down to earth. Now they're face to face. Eye to eye. Swann, for all his posturing, is afraid.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Nix won't come looking for her?

</HARRY>
<SWANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's me betrayed him.

	Help me.

</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
On Swann, his face a churning mass of rage and fear.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen. If he's back from the dead, then he is some kind of god. And he'll find you, wherever the fuck you are. And if he's just another phony Messiah, then you can stage the greatest come-back in history.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We MOVE THROUGH the shadowy interior, catching sight of several CULTISTS as we go. They all have looks of barely suppressed ecstasy on their faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are moving towards the Sanctum, and it's getting darker. A MATCH is struck, and an OIL-FLAME sputters into life. We see NORMAN'S gleaming face. On the wall is a PICTURE of Nix, floating over a scene of apocalyptic destruction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Norman brushes away thirteen years' accrual of DIRT. Beneath, Nix's expression is as rabid and terrifying as ever. Norman grins.

A BABOON SHRIEKS, its mouth filling the frame.

CUT WIDE, to reveal the Baboon, racing around Nix's Sanctum, crazed.

Hanging on the sculpture that swings from the roof is a shadowy figure. Is it Nix? We can't quite see. Black BLOOD runs from the figure and splashes on the ground.

NOW WE SEE DOROTHEA, being pulled by the Cultists towards the falling gouts of dark fluid --

Looks down the stairs.

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that all?

</HARRY>
<SWANN>

</HARRY>

Silence for a moment.

</SWANN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he didn't have them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<SWANN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	And you believed him?

<DIRECTION>
The house is silent now.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We TRACK through the house. The CULTISTS, all Seventeen of them, stand in the passageways, looking toward Nix's sanctum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE SANCTUM DOOR. Butterfield emerges. He is wearing WHITE now.

<DIRECTION>
Now we see that the Cultists have BOTTLES in their hands. With looks of ecstatic fervour on their faces, they SMASH the bottles to the ground at their bare feet. Then they pick up MORE BOTTLES, and SMASH them, littering the ground with razor sharp pieces of GLASS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON Butterfield, smiling. He steps back into the Sanctum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH, WIDE SHOT of the room, as Butterfield approaches the BODY of Nix. It lies on a table, surrounded by bowls of OIL. Bandages, soaked in oil, are laid over its limbs. Beside its head, Butterfield's INSTRUMENTS are laid out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON Dorothea, crouched in the corner of the room, terrified as she watches Butterfield remove the multi- part MASK screwed into Nix's face. He works with surgical precision.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen. You've got everything you want. You don't need me. ..
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
A piece of the mask comes away from the cheek. A subtle POWER plucks at dust around the room, disturbing it minutely. We CUT CLOSE to Dorothea's face throughout this sequence (on occasion her eyeball fills the screen) as she sees these signs of disturbance in the ether, growing in magnitude.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTTERFIELD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, but he will. After what you did to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTTERFIELD>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls a piece of the mask from Nix's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTTERFIELD>

The bottle-breaking has ceased. The Cultists stand, breathless with anticipation.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On Nix's emaciated mouth. The lips TWITCH.
</DIRECTION>

On Dorothea. The DUST moves around her.

<DIRECTION>
And Nix DRAWS BREATH.

On Butterfield, TEARS in his eyes.

<DOROTHEA>

	Christ in Heaven.

</DOROTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
ON Nix, as his body starts to thirstily soak up the oils. His withered flesh starts to REHYDRATE; his veins start to THROB.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butterfield is watching the process in amazement. Nix's HANDS move up to his face, where the last portion of the mask is still screwed over his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTTERFIELD>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unnoticed by Butterfield, who has his eyes on Nix, Dorothea gets to her feet and creeps away to the door. Very quiet TRACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the snake-handling Cultist steps into view, snakes coiled around his face and fingers!
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
Butterfield looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTTERFIELD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTTERFIELD>
<DIRECTION>
On Nix, as he starts to pull at the mask on his face. It comes away with a moist, WRENCHING SOUND. At last, we see his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NIX'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The candle-lights blaze, BLINDING his sensitive eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<NIX>
<DIRECTION>
(fury to agony)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaarrrgh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIX>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and flings himself around the room, knocking over all the lights but two. Then he strikes Butterfield to the ground, and slams his foot on Butterfield's neck, knocking him unconscious. It's a terrifying, almost demoniacal display of instant physical superiority. Throughout, he literally ROARS in rage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cultists SCREAM in sympathy, letting out years of repressed frustration. Many of them are dancing on the shards of glass now, crazed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT NEAR NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry's car is parked a quarter mile from Nix's house. He is getting out. Swann stays put.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUND of SCREAMING is carried towards them on the wind.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On Butterfield, as Nix removes his foot. Butterfield is out for the count.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On Nix, as he stops screaming. His face is grotesquely disfigured by the mask, the flesh stained and corrupted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SCREAMING of the Cultists is dying away.

<NIX>

	Will you suffer to come unto me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIX>
<DIRECTION>
One by one, the Cultists fall to their knees. We never see flesh pierced by broken glass. But we HEAR IT, and see the agony on the Cultist's faces. They start to sob.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, Nix appears in the doorway, mostly hidden by shadow.
</DIRECTION>
<NIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've come back to share the wisdom of the grave. Will you hear it?

He steps out of the doorway. The Cultists let out sobs of adoration. Nix locks at Dorothea.
</DIRECTION>
<NIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I know you, child?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIX>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches for her. Pulls her close to his body. Dorothea keeps her self-possession; but only just.

Then he carries her down the passageway to the Meditation Room, walking on the glass, apparently indifferent to the wounds he's receiving.

The Cultists follow.

ON SWANN, as the TRACK fills with eerie ECHOES of that terrible event. Nix's SCREAMS. The GUN-SHOTS. The sound of the SCREWS GRINDING into Nix's flesh.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly. Butterfield reaches out of the darkness, and catches hold of Harry's leg. throwing him to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has one of the INSTRUMENTS in his hand. He STABS at Harry, striking the ground between Harry's legs.

With a ROAR, a PIT four or five feet across opens up beneath Nix and Dorothea. Nix HOVERS over it. It's utterly dark; perhaps bottomless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dorothea SCREAMS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT

Hearing Dorothea's CRY, Harry looks back towards the passageway. Butterfield pulls the instrument out of the ground and stabs at Harry a second time. But Swann catches hold of his arm.

On Nix, Dorothea clasped close to him. He REVOLVES as he floats over the chasm below then.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, I escaped the grave. So I have to give something to the grave in return.

</NIX>
<DIRECTION>
On the Cultists, listening to their lord with love in their eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SLIT OPENS in the middle of Nix's forehead, above the bridge of his nose (this is an image we saw in the prints in the library), and from it comes a WAVE OF DARKNESS. As Nix REVOLVES, the darkness STRIKES the GROUND around the Cultists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At first they don't realize what's going on. They think this is some kind of bizarre blessing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the ground starts to LIQUIFY beneath them.

<NIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I'm not your shepherd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIX>
<DIRECTION>
Harry surveys the horrific scene in front of him. The ground is now re-solidifying around the Cultists, some of whom have disappeared from view completely, some of whom still reach up out of the dirt. The scene has a surreal beauty to it despite its horror. SCREAMING FACES locked in the solid ground. TWITCHING HANDS the same. Harry starts towards Nix and Dorothea, GUN levelled. So far, he has avoided Nix's gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butterfield and Swann are locked in a life-or-death struggle. They tumble back against the table upon which Nix was resurrected. It collapses under them, and for a moment Swann is stunned. Butterfield snatches up one of the instruments and STABS at Swann, who rolls out of the way in the nick of time.

Suddenly, Nix isn't interested in Harry and Dorothea. He steps onto solid ground, and walks towards Swann, his tone suddenly conversational.

With each word, Nix almost casually throws a gesture in Swann's direction, and though there is six feet between them, they have the force of terrible blows. One to the ribs. They CRACK. One to the face. It BLEEDS. One to the legs, one to the arms. They all BREAK. Then Nix turns towards Dorothea.
</DIRECTION>
<NIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's just flesh, Swannnie-boy. I'll show you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIX>
<DIRECTION>
He moves towards Dorothea. Swann falls to the ground, broken.

The fight between Butterfield and Harry continues.
</DIRECTION>
<SWANN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry! Stop him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANN>
<DIRECTION>
Harry looks up. Sees Dorothea retreating from the door, and running off into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butterfield comes at Harry again. Harry's got no more time for this creep. He delivers Butterfield a backhand swipe, and Butterfield lands face down in the glass. We don't see the impact. HEARING it's enough.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry looks down at the body. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<NIX>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIX>
<DIRECTION>
Harry turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nix is on him like a luoaernaut. treading on Butterfield's body as he comes at Harry!
</DIRECTION>
<NIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did she go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIX>
<DIRECTION>
Nix GRABS hold of Harry's head with one hand and PRESSES the fingers of -the other hand against Harry's TEMPLES. He struggles to get free, but Nix is simply too powerful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nix's fingers slowly SLIDE BENEATH the skin of Harry's temples. As before, there's no blood.
</DIRECTION>
<NIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got Swann's disease. You think a little courage, a little love, and it'll all be all right. Wrong!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIX>
<DIRECTION>
His fingers slide all the way in!
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry wrests himself free of Nix, and stumbles away. His eyes are BLOOD-RED. Nix is a few yards behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<NIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me where she is... and I'll make it go away...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIX>
<DIRECTION>
Harry is reeling around in the grip of a nightmare.

HARRY'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The apocalyptic images on the walls seem to move! A face SCREAMS! FIRE blossoms!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HARRY, verging on insanity.

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God... oh God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry sees a WOMAN, wrapped in the sickly-sensual embrace of some glistening, barely visible OBSCENITY. We can't see her face. Only her mouth is visible in the coils of her devourer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HARRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he approaches the wall, on which this woman is painted. Reaching out for the image.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Woman reaches for Harry.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he touches the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dorothea!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to SCRATCH out the plaster on which the image is painted.

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dorothea! Dorothea!

Darkness swallows the image of the woman. She is still screaming when she disappears.

literally beating his head against the wall!

Harry stops. Dare he believe this is truly her voice?
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not real, Harry-
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
Harry turns around. Dorothea is there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, he sees Dorothea as she is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HARRY, relief flooding his face. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the image MORPHS. Dorothea's beauty is replaced by primeval muck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HARRY, appalled. Dorothea grabs hold of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry. Listen to me. Whatever's good between us, believe it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
Harry's face is deathly white, and pouring SWEAT. He's fighting the delirium. Or doing his best.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... oh... God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DOROTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here, Harry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DOROTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
Nix steps from the shadows of the doorway behind Harry.
</DIRECTION>
<NIX>
<DIRECTION>
(to Dorothea)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you are, child.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIX>
<DIRECTION>
Harry starts to look round.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... have... to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<NIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, child. I want Swann to see you die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIX>
<DIRECTION>
Harry turns and looks at Nix.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nix's face darkens as it MORPHS. And the flesh in the middle of his brow UNFOLDS, revealing a dark, pulsating THIRD EYE.
</DIRECTION>
<NIX>
<DIRECTION>
(to Harry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you looking at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIX>
<DIRECTION>
ON DOROTHEA, who has gone to the door of the Meditation Room and now slips inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HARRY, staring up at Nix.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON DOROTHEA, re-emerging from the Meditation Room. In her hand, Harry's GUN. Harry looks round at her.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(points to his brow)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There... there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
ON NIX, as he looks up at Dorothea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON DOROTHEA, as she raises the GUN. She FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bullet STRIKES Nix's FOREHEAD. He sinks to his knees, BLOOD pouring down his face from the hole where his third EYE used to be.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HARRY, as Nix's mind-hold falters. He leans against the wall, shaking.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm okay. I'm okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry opens his eyes. Looks up at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last of the MORPHING fades. He sees Dorothea as she actually is. Dorothea goes down to comfort him, and they embrace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a ROAR from Nix. They look towards him --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- it isn't over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One last, terrifying transformation is overtaking Nix as he kneels in the GLASS. His sallow flesh is running in STREAMS up his body towards the DARK HOLE in the middle of his forehead --
</DIRECTION>
<NIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One... last... illusion...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIX>
<DIRECTION>
-- his humanity is disappearing, vanishing into the vortex of the bullet wound.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
Harry and Dorothea start to get up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nix is no longer human. He is a shape of gleaming DARKNESS, stripped of features. He opens his mouth, the only visible element on his body is his toothed maw, which looses an utterly inhuman SHRIEK!
</DIRECTION>
<SWANN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... D'Amour...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANN>
<DIRECTION>
Harry glances through the door into the Meditation Room. Swann is on the threshold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nix RISES now. He is a terrifying spectacle, his bulk somehow more intimidating than ever in this simplified form.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes at Dorothea, who has no choice but to back away into the Meditation Room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pit still yawns in the middle of the floor. Dorothea is backed towards it by Nix.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Nix SPEAKS, his voice is not remotely human. It is DEMONIACAL.
</DIRECTION>
<NIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am the purest of the pure. I am the darkest of the dark...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIX>
<DIRECTION>
Harry is at the door now, starting towards Nix.
</DIRECTION>
<SWANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry. You can't kill him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANN>
<DIRECTION>
Harry crouches beside Swann.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He did something with the ground.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<SWANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<SWANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
ON DOROTHEA. She's a couple of yards from the pit now.
</DIRECTION>
<NIX>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm beyond Heaven. I'm beyond Hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIX>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Harry lunges at Nix, grabbing hold of his legs. Nix topples.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SWANN, who puts his hands on the ground. Closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wave of LIQUIFICATION runs through the ground from Swann's broken fingers --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the Cultists' bodies MOVE in the softening ground, like corpses in surf, and ROLL towards the pit, their dead faces resurfacing --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara's body floats past Nix, and disappears over the edge of the pit.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Dorothea)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
The ground is very liquid now, and the corpses are lodging around Nix as they're all carried towards the pit. So's Harry, of course.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nix tries to get up, but he's too late. The corpses weigh him down, the ground is too fluid for him to get a proper hold, and Harry still clings to his legs.
</DIRECTION>
<NIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! No! No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIX>
<DIRECTION>
He's at the edge of the pit.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
Harry looks round. Dorothea's behind him, risking the flowing ground to offer him a hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nix starts to fall into the pit. At the last minute, he reaches for Harry, as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Harry is pulled out of reach bv Dorothea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Together they stumble to THE DOOR, where Swann still lies. They look back to see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NIX, as he goes over the edge of the pit and FALLS SCREAMING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the door, Dorothea lifts up Swann's head. He's dead. She closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

INT. THE PIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What we are about to witness is the longest fall-to-his- death by any villain in the history of cinema...

Nix is falling through rock. Still SCREAMING. He CRASHES against a layer of stone, which his body smashes to smithereens. And as he falls --

</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
No it's not. Nix keeps falling, breaking through another layer of rock as he descends deeper and deeper into the earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now... there's a hint of FIERY LIGHT below. He's approaching MAGMA.

She puts her arms around him. Kisses him, sobbing with relief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nix hits a layer of molten rock, and, SCREAMING, he disappears. A BURST of dark, roiling ENERGY erupts from the spot where he sank, and starts up the pit --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

The room TREMBLES. There's a ROAR in the earth.

The ENERGY howls from room to room, ERODING the images off the walls, BLOWING out the doors, DESTROYING all the resurrection equipment in the Sanctum --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry and Dorothea stumble to the car. They look back at the house, as the cacophony of destruction dies down.

ON THE RIM OF THE SUN, as it peeps over the desert horizon.

The SUNLIGHT creeps through the rooms as the DUST settles.

The hole in the floor CLOSES UP, and is SEALED... SILENCE reigns.
