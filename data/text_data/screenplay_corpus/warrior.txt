<DIRECTION>
EXT. ST. MARY'S CHURCH - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PADDY CONLON (60) exits the doors of a run-down church holding a 12-STEP BOOK. He is followed by a cluster of other PEOPLE in the program and says his goodbyes.

<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD/`75 OLDS - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paddy grips the steering wheel with labor-calloused hands and drives over the P.J. McArdle Bridge and up a winding hill. He listens to "MOBY DICK" on tape as the last piece of daylight bleeds away. With rosary beads swaying from his rear view, Paddy turns and eases the Olds past row houses in a blue- collar neighborhood high above the city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOMMY CONLON (28), hard miles on a handsome face, sits on the stoop of an old row house in a wool watch cap and winter coat. A duffel bag is at his feet, a bottle of whiskey in a brown bag in his hands. He reaches into his coat pocket, pops a handful of prescription PILLS, and stares off into the approaching night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PADDY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paddy pulls up to the curb in front of the house, clicks off the tape, kills the engine, and climbs out of the car. As he approaches the stairs, Paddy sees Tommy. Can't believe his eyes.

Paddy grins uncomfortably. Lets the remark go and climbs the stairs as Tommy reaches into his duffel bag and produces a fresh BOTTLE of Jameson. He offers it to Paddy.

INT. PADDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paddy and Tommy walk through the front door. The house is clean, yet all the furnishings are from the late 1970s. Tommy stands in the den and looks around, breathing the old place in, as Paddy makes his way into the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>

The sound of glasses CLINKING in the kitchen as Tommy takes off his watch cap and begins to look around his old home. He glances down at a BIBLE on a table beside a weathered Barca lounge chair.

Tommy takes another swig from his bottle and looks at a series of old PHOTOGRAPHS lining the walls as Paddy walks into the room carrying a coffee pot and saucers on an old wicker tray. Tommy looks at him, incredulous.

Tommy's eyes are drawn to another picture, likely taken at a mall photography studio, of a MAN AND WOMAN (late 20s) POSING WITH A YOUNG GIRL (2). The man looks like the second boy in the other photos. His brother BRENDAN.

Tommy turns back to the photos and looks at another one of the woman. Obviously his MOTHER. He puts it down, glances at the bible, then stares hard at Paddy.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you found God, huh? That's awesome. Mom kept calling for him, but he wasn't around. I guess Jesus was down at the mill forgiving all the drunks. Who knew?

Paddy sips his coffee. Says nothing. Tommy keeps pressing.

<TOMMY>

<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's too bad. You could've gotten some good details.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy plops himself into a recliner. Glances at the coffee table, where a stack of classic books on tape sits. CRIME AND PUNISHMENT. THE SUN ALSO RISES. THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO. MOBY DICK.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could've heard about her coughing up blood in a shit box with no heat. Having me rub her down with holy water, because she didn't have no insurance. All the while waiting for your pal Jesus to save her. Did your man tell you that?

An overwhelmed Paddy sips his coffee and looks at Tommy, who is fading. The pills are kicking in. He tries to open his eyes, but it's no use, and after a few moments he's out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paddy glances down, where some pills have fallen out of Tommy's pocket and scattered on the rug. He watches his son. Relieved and heartbroken at the same time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME, PHILADELPHIA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A chaotic birthday party in the back yard of a middle-class home in the suburbs of Philly. A CLUSTER OF 5-YEAR OLDS run about, some whacking at a pinata hanging from a tree, some whizzing down a large blow-up slide, some getting their faces painted by a make-up artist dressed like a GYPSY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TESS CONLON (29) bounces around the yard, multi-tasking like a champion and filming the proceedings with a VIDEO CAMERA. She trains the camera on BRENDAN CONLON (30), who sits in a lawn chair in a scarf, hat, and women's make-up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH VIDEO CAMERA LENS: TWO GIRLS, EMILY (5), WHO WEARS A BIRTHDAY GIRL CROWN, AND ROSIE (3), MIMIC THE MAKE-UP WOMAN AND APPLY MASCARA AND BLUSH TO BRENDAN.

Tess laughs. Brendan looks at her with a "Help me out here" expression.
</DIRECTION>
<TESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Em, you want to open your presents?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TESS>
<DIRECTION>
The make-over ends abruptly at the mention of "presents." Emily, little sister in tow, runs over to a table filled with gifts as PARENTS and CHILDREN gather around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan gets out of the lawn chair and follows Tess over to the gift table. Amidst all the presents is one BOX, covered in pink wrapping paper, that is far larger than the rest.
</DIRECTION>
<TESS>

Tess turns the video camera toward Brendan again. He couldn't look more ridiculous. And he obviously didn't clear the gift with his wife. He grins at her as she lowers the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<TESS>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, but that's why you call it a budget. You set it, and you don't budge.

Brendan smiles in his make-up. Kisses his wife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The remnants of the birthday party lay strewn across the lawn. Tess, in a cocktail waitress outfit, says goodbye to her MOM and the kids, who play on the swing set.

<DIRECTION>
She walks toward the garage and enters to find Brendan pressing free weights on an old bench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>

Brendan continues to lift as Tess rushes in and tosses a bag of garbage in the bin. A deep CUT, hidden earlier by the make- up, is visible on his cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<TESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey babe, I'm late. Mom's saying goodbye to the girls. She's gotta get on the road. They've been fed. They just need a bath.

Tommy, wearing a wife beater and old gray sweats, works a bag and eyeballs an ENTOURAGE that surrounds a ring. Inside, a heavily-muscled FIGHTER with a mohawk, MAD DOG GRIMES (30s), is putting a beating on his SPARRING PARTNER. The obsequious nature of the entourage makes it clear that Mad Dog is somebody important.

Colt Boyd waves Tommy into the ring. Mad Dog's entourage starts whispering amongst themselves. Snickering at what lays in wait for Tommy as the fallen sparring partner is helped out of the ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TRAINER tapes Tommy's hands and gives him some MMA gloves. He slips them on, then at the sound of a BUZZER he starts moving toward Mad Dog, who smirks at Tommy's aggression and then starts circling him. Tommy nails him with a front kick to the chest. Grimes staggers back and shakes it off.
</DIRECTION>

</MAD_DOG>
<DIRECTION>
He crouches down, gets serious. He throws a right. Blocked. A leg kick. Blocked. Tommy snaps his head with a jab. Then he does it again. And again. Then he DECKS HIM with a hard right, sending Mad Dog to the canvas to the shock of his entourage and Colt Boyd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fenroy looks up from his post and walks over to the ring. Within moments everyone in the gym stops what they're doing and watches as Tommy grabs the back of Mad Dog's head, hauls it down, and launches knee after knee into his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy starts throwing Mad Dog around like a rag doll, striking him with vicious punches and kicks, as Fenroy pulls out his CELL PHONE and starts filming the action. As Colt Boyd screams at Mad Dog to cover up, Tommy shoves him against the ropes and blasts away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy continues to pound. It's a full-fledged beating going on in there. Finally, he crushes Mad Dog with a vicious left hook and sends him sprawling through the ropes, UNCONSCIOUS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SILENCE in the gym. What the hell just happened here? The entourage rushes to Mad Dog's aid, but he's out cold. Colt Boyd looks on in disbelief as Tommy walks across the ring and approaches him.

	This is the new appraisal figure, and this is how it effects the monthly. As you can see, that puts you upside down on your mortgage. That's the problem. It's the country that did the assessment, not the bank. So, the numbers are what they are, Mr. Conlon.

Brendan absorbs the blows, ducks down, grabs Moore by the legs, lifts him, and dumps him on the mat with a resounding THUD. Obviously bull strong and with tremendous punching skills, Brendan sits on his opponent's chest and starts raining down shots, banging and banging, pulverizing his face and body.

It's a full on ass-whooping going on in there until finally, mercifully, the referee stops the butchery amidst a mixture of CHEERS from the crowd and BOOS from the bikers.

BILLBOARDS heralding the arrival of the SPARTA tournament are everywhere. Ceremonial Fourth of July banners hang, cars jam Ocean Avenue, early FIREWORKS pop. The buzz is electric. The greatest show on earth has hit the shore.

EXT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIMOUSINES pull up in front of the Boardwalk Hall rotunda as "Mad Dog" Grimes, Orlando "Midnight" Le, Karl "The Dane" Kruller, and other fighters make their way down a long red carpet swarming with FANS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the middle of it all is J.J. Riley, greeting press and guests and running the show as the Tapout crew, Colt Boyd, and others mill about and talk shop. Announcers BRYAN CALLEN (40s) and SAM SHERIDAN (30s) corral J.J. for an interview.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Growing up, we all wanted to know who the toughest kid in the neighborhood was, right? I wanna know who the toughest man on the planet is. That's why I put this together, that's what all these people are here to see, and come Saturday night, that's what we're gonna find out.

	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIDAN>
<DIRECTION>
The great and mighty KOBA emerges from a white stretch limo, trailed by his ENTOURAGE of tough-looking RUSSIANS. FLASHBULBS pop. REPORTERS swarm. It looks like a movie premiere out there and Koba's the star.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL LOBBY - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As WORKERS set up for the press conference and camera crews stake out their territory, Tommy and Paddy hug the corner of the room and wait. Not in their element at all. Moments later, Brendan comes walking through the doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he moves through the crowded room, Brendan and Tommy make eye contact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They haven't seen each other in 14 years, and judging by the looks on their faces they certainly didn't expect to see each other today. Paddy is just as shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan begins to inch toward Tommy, but is intercepted by Frank, who was caught up in the media storm outside.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>

	Hey. Where'd you go? You can't leave me like that. They wanna talk to you, not me.

	Recent revelations that Riordan was not only a United States Marine but a hero in the Iraq War, has cast an even brighter spotlight on a fighter who seems to have come out of nowhere.

Brendan walks on the beach as the waves of the Atlantic Ocean lap at the shoreline. Boats bob on the water. Stray bottle rockets trace through the night sky.

In the distance, the NEON LIGHTS of an amusement park flash and zip. Behind Brendan, the big casinos loom, advertisements for Sparta filling their BILLBOARDS.

Brendan continues walking, then spots Tommy coming toward him. The brothers make eye contact. Stop. Then approach each other warily.

<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. He's just some old vet I train with. He means nothing to me. From what I hear he means nothing to you, either, so you got balls talking about forgiveness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's got nothing to do with forgiveness. I've got a family to protect. Everything I do is for them.

Tommy smirks. Walks away again.

</TOMMY>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not the only one who suffered, Tommy. I didn't even know she was sick. I never even got the chance to say goodbye to my own mother. You had no right to keep that from me! That was not your decision to make!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what? You walk around with your pictures in your wallet and you're all, I forgive you, I forgive Pop. I forgive everyone. But you know what? You're full of shit.

<DIRECTION>
Tommy and Brendan are right in each other's faces. Standing on the knife's edge of violence. They hold the stare down for a few long seconds, like two fighters about to go to war.

	Are we done, Brendan? Are we finished?
