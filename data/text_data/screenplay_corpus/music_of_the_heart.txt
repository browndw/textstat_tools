</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Roberta and her dashing Italian father, hand-carving a wooden music stand... a b&w snapshot of Roberta in a communion dress... Roberta at 15, playing violin in front of the same refrigerator, eyes on the music stand...

We hear the sound of KNOCKING as the CAMERA PANS a small, darkened guest room. A few streaks of daylight filter through Venetian blinds.

INT. GUASPARI BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WOMAN -- ROBERTA GUASPARI-DEMETRAS (38) -- retrieves the photo album from the floor, looks at a photo and removes it. She's a beautiful woman with large, expressive eyes, but right now she looks like hell. She stares at the photo -- it's the two couples dancing. A quick glimpse of hurt on her face, then her jaw tightens and she rips the picture in half. There's muffled talking outside the door, and then two young boys' voices.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
O.S. arguing "I DID NOT!" "YES YOU DID!" "LIAR!" etc. As if that one action siphoned all her energy, Roberta returns to bed, gets into fetal position, and stares at a point beyond the wall, ignoring the O.S. voices.

EXT. GUASPARI HOUSE - DOORWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ASSUNTA GUASPARI (58), Roberta's slender, tired Italian- American mother, stands in the doorway of a well-tended working-class home, addressing a young NAVAL OFFICER who holds a lengthy delivery inventory. It's a gray day with ominous storm clouds. Late 70's CARS are parked on the street.
</DIRECTION>
<ASSUNTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I have no room for this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSUNTA>
<OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, M'am. We have orders to deliver these.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
Assunta looks beyond the man, dismayed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Large wooden CRATES cover her front lawn, and TWO MOVERS plant down another. They hurry back to the TRUCK, grabbing the next crate too quickly this time. It slips from their hands, CRASHES to the ground and splinters open. Several VIOLIN CASES spill out. The crate looks like it holds a whole lot more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly a second-story window is flung open, and Roberta sticks her head out, a hundred times more energized than we've seen her so far.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch it, you idiots! Be careful with those!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
The men scramble to pick them up. Assunta looks at all the violins, then up at Roberta.
</DIRECTION>
<ASSUNTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why so many?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSUNTA>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta disappears inside and slams the window shut.

INT. GUASPARI LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The living room is filled with boxes shipped from Greece, labelled by the U.S. NAVY. And on the floor, in the middle of the boxes, are FIFTY VIOLIN CASES of various sizes, also with Greek and U.S. NAVY labels. NICK (7) and LEXI (5) climb over the boxes as if they were giant blocks.

ROBERTA'S on the phone, yelling at someone. She's still in the same ratty nightgown.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I know he's there, so quit lying to me!... Then check under Lana Holden -- Mrs. Lana Holden... Fine. Just tell Lieutenant Demetras that his wife called and --

ASSUNTA grabs the phone from her hand and hangs it up.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ma!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<ASSUNTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I want you to listen to me. You can't keep doing this to yourself -- or to the boys. They need their mother now. You're a beautiful, talented woman and you have your whole life ahead of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSUNTA>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I'm so beautiful and talented, why did Charles leave me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<ASSUNTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because Charles is a big jerk.

INT. GUASPARI KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coffee is brewing and homemade cinnamon rolls are cooling on a rack. We recognize the kitchen from the home movie footage. As Assunta clears the boys' breakfast dishes from the table, Roberta enters. She's dressed, but hasn't put on makeup or done much with her hair. It's a start.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really think Charles is a jerk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<ASSUNTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From the day you married him.

</ASSUNTA>
<ROBERTA>

<ASSUNTA>

Roberta half-smiles, pours herself some coffee, then sits down at the table.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I gonna do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<ASSUNTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First, you eat breakfast. Second, you go out and get a job -- any job. Your boys, god-bless-em, are good eaters -- but I can't afford it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSUNTA>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mama, he's gonna get tired of her -- you'll see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>

Assunta's face shows she's doubtful about this.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well in the meantime, get a job.

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - GIFT WRAP COUNTER - ROME, N.Y. - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta is behind the counter, meticulously wrapping a present with ribbons, bows and stickers. At one point she even unties a ribbon and redoes it because it's not perfect. She looks pretty, but she's dressed conservatively, like a navy housewife. There's only one other clerk wrapping gifts and a long line of impatient customers. A male SUPERVISOR appears behind Roberta.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERVISOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just wrap. You're not Picasso.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERVISOR>
<DIRECTION>
He exits, and Roberta quickly tries to finish her task.
</DIRECTION>
<MALE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Picasso would probably put the bows on the back of the box.
	</DIALOGUE>

Roberta looks up to find BRIAN TURNER (40), a handsome, sexy guy with longish hair and a beat-up leather jacket.

<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Roberta.

</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you moved away.

</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did. I'm in town for my Mom's birthday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
He holds out his hand. Roberta misunderstands the gesture and tries to shake his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- that's her gift.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
(embarrassed)

	Oh! Sorry.

Roberta hands him the gift she's been wrapping.

	I heard you had a book published. I didn't read it but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's O.K. My parents didn't read it either. It looks good on their coffee table, though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what are you doing here? I thought you'd be in Carnegie Hall by now.

HOLD ON ROBERTA as she takes this in.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - ROME, N.Y. - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta sits opposite Brian. Her lunch is untouched.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My college professors said it was too late -- I hadn't had enough training to be a concert violinist. So I got a teaching degree instead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll bet you're a great teacher.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I am. It's just that...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, every time I'd get started somewhere, Charles would be transferred... then I had my kids and took time off to raise them... and then when I decided to teach again, no one would hire me 'cause you can't count on a navy wife to stick around. I finally decided I'd start my own program -- Charles gave me the money and I bought fifty violins from this little Greek shop -- got started at a private school and then...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your husband ran off with your best friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>

A beat.

	She wasn't my "best" friend. She was a friend.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Charles is the last person you'd think would cheat on me -- he never broke a rule...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a few beats)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wake up one night -- it's like one in the morning -- and he's not in bed. I go outside and our neighbor -- this old Greek guy -- is sitting out there, smoking a cigar, so I ask if he's seen my husband. "He's taking a walk with the other officer's wife," he says. "He takes a walk every night with the other officer's wife."
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
A beat as she gets lost in the memory. She takes a bite of a french fry.

<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, these are cold.

<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're just gonna wrap presents and wait for him to come back?

<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sound like my mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not very sexy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you trying to be sexy or be my friend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little of both.

Roberta smiles, blushing a bit. Brian looks at her, getting an idea.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I know this really cool lady who runs this elementary school -- I wrote a piece on her. It's a public school, but it's alternative -- she might be able to create some kind of gig for you. Let me give her a call.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Great!

A SALSA SONG PLAYS OVER as we see stores with Spanish names and signs; Black and Latino elementary school children walking home from school; some burned-out buildings; Black and Latino teens playing basketball on a cement court; Spanish graffiti on walls; elderly women buying fruit at a produce stand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK TO REVEAL this is the POV of Roberta from the back seat of a cab. The SALSA SONG plays on the cab's radio. Roberta looks scared shitless.

Suddenly, two YOUNG MEN flash down the middle of the street, dart IN FRONT of the cab and the driver SLAMS on the brakes, jerking Roberta forward.

INT. JANET WILLIAMS' OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANET WILLIAMS, a Black woman (40's) with a kind face, sits behind her desk and looks at Roberta's resume. A sign on her desk indicates that she's the DIRECTOR. Also on the desk is a FRAMED PICTURE of Janet, her husband, daughter (14), and son (12). Roberta sits nervously in the chair opposite her.
</DIRECTION>
<JANET>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at resume)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aside from half a term in a private school -- in Greece -- and a year teaching chorus in Hawaii -- ten years ago -- it doesn't look like you've had any other teaching experience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANET>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, not traditional teaching experience. I've been doing private lessons...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
Janet looks for this on the resume.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not on there... I taught my sons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
Janet smiles politely.
</DIRECTION>
<JANET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to help you, Mrs. Demetras. Brian spoke highly of you and I told him I'd consider starting a violin class... But without the proper qualifications, and without any experience in an inner city school...

Roberta nods, defeated.

As Roberta opens the door, we see that Nick and Lexi are with her. All three have violins. INSIDE, Janet's in conversation with DENNIS RAUSCH (38), an uptight man with a tie that doesn't match his suit jacket. He's showing Janet a large scheduling chart.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>

Before Janet can answer, Roberta and the kids quickly take out their violins and get into position. Janet and Dennis exchange a look.

<DENNIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are we having a talent show? I should have brought my tap shoes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENNIS>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta ignores the jab, then nods to the boys. The three of them begin an incredibly impressive violin trio, playing an ETUDE in three-part harmony. For the first measures, Janet's still annoyed by the intrusion, but she's quickly won over. Dennis watches impassively.

Roberta and the boys finish their piece; Janet applauds and Dennis joins in to be polite. The three take bows. A beat.

Roberta wheels around to find a girl plucking her violin like a banjo, and doing a little dance. This is LUCY, a skinny Puerto Rican girl in perpetual motion.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have I been saying? Put that away! Back in the case!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta takes a breath. The kids settle down a bit.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O.K. Thank you. That's much better.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(takes another breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be dividing you into five classes, but for today --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - A boy plays "bongos" on his violin case.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O.K. -- that's it! You! Stand up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
The bongo player stands.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will be the first student who will NOT be in my violin class. Out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
The child looks stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said OUT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
With a sheepish expression, he exits. The room is finally quiet -- and Roberta's amazed that something worked. She puffs up a little bit, enjoying the feeling of control.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who else would like to be kicked out of my class?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
The students stare at her, afraid of her now. DE SEAN, a small but tough Black boy, raises his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you raising your hand because you want to be kicked out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DE_SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DE_SEAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DE_SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't wanna learn no stupid violin. It's for wimps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DE_SEAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who told you that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DE_SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DE_SEAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	De Sean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, De Sean -- you haven't given me a good enough reason, so you're staying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUSIC ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front of the class, Roberta helps NAEEM, a graceful Black boy, hold the violin. He has a serious expression and a scar on his left cheek. Roberta controls the bow and fingerboard, but it appears that the boy is playing music. He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<NAEEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I play pretty good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAEEM>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Naeem)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See how easy it is?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the class)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe in the spring, we could have a big concert for your families and for the whole school.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the boy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<NAEEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naeem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAEEM>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta writes in a notebook and we see that she's measuring for violin sizes.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
(to class)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you listen to me and do exactly what I say, you're gonna sound beautiful at the concert and you're gonna be so proud of yourselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Naeem)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, Naeem. Your hand's staying soft.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the class)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if you don't listen to me, you'll sound so bad that your own parents will feel sick when they hear you. They might even throw up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE KIDS, not used to a teacher speaking like that.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A funky apartment on the Upper West Side. Nick and Lexi are both asleep in sleeping bags on top of a futon on the floor, their suitcases nearby. Brian tiptoes past them, carrying two glasses of champagne. He knocks on his office door.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta's in a bathrobe and nightgown, some rollers in her hair. She's tidying up her suitcase, etc., next to an old couch that's been made up as a bed. Leftist political books line a shelf above Brian's desk, including copies of his own, TO HELL AND BACK: INTERVIEWS WITH VIETNAM VETS by BRIAN TURNER. His desk is covered with files and books pertaining to MIGRANT WORKERS. Brian enters.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to champagne)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a toast.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(giving her a glass, holding his up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To Roberta, who's made it through her first week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
They clink glasses and drink.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, Brian. I'm hanging on by a thread there. Out of fifty kids, maybe six are listening to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at the progress. Didn't you say no one was listening to you on Monday?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really appreciate all you've done for us. And I promise -- this weekend I'll start looking for a place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no rush.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we've put you out enough. You're supposed to be writing, not babysitting for us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(crosses to his desk,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	flips through his
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vietnam book)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've started your book. It's very powerful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Brian comes up behind her and starts to kiss her neck. Roberta's scared -- so she keeps talking, as if it's not really happening.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what made you choose migrant workers for your next book? I mean, how do you know what to write about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(kissing her neck)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I follow my gut, pay attention to what I'm being drawn to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta's aroused, in spite of herself. She turns around and faces him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been waiting to do that since Mr. Baines' orchestra class.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't even notice me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure I did. You used to ignore me and it drove me wild.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had at least five different girlfriends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It didn't mean I had the one I wanted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
He gives her a flirtatious smile, then takes out one of her rollers.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not a navy wife anymore...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
He moves to takes out another roller and Roberta stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I am... legally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And is it a navy requirement that you dress like it's the 1950's?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(goading her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who did you vote for in the last election?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does that have to do with anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
(hesitates, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Charles filled out my absentee ballot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God -- it's even worse than I thought!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(touching her hair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this the same Roberta who got the orchestra to strike until they gave us new uniforms?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She laughs wistfully, then looks a little sad.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That Roberta's not around anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls her towards him by the belt to her robe.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss and it heats up quickly. Roberta pulls back.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shouldn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The boys --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're sleeping.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, but... I'm still married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what's your husband doing right now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
A few beats, and she moves towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sun streams into the room as Roberta awakens in Brian's bed, a look of afterglow on her face. She suddenly remembers where she is, and quickly looks at the clock.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit -- the boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're still sleeping.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns, relieved, until she sees that Brian's packing a suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Texas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
He dashes out. Roberta sits up, rattled by this news.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIAN'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian excitedly gathers papers and files scattered around his electric typewriter.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's in Texas?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to see Roberta in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Farm workers. I just got the call -- it came through -- my research grant! It came through! Isn't that great?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
He places items into a carry-on bag, packing at a rapid clip. In contrast, Roberta seems to be moving in slow motion.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got a few families lined up there, some in California --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long will you be gone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two, three months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIAN'S BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian throws toiletries into a plastic bag. Roberta enters.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought... I just thought you were gonna be around. And then last night --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
He stops what he's doing and looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa. Roberta -- last night was great but did you think I was gonna marry you in the morning?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Of course not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
We see in her face that part of her did think that.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just that... we just got here and we're barely... I don't even know where to buy groceries.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
Brian softens as he sees how vulnerable she is. He takes her in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gonna be fine. You have a job, a place to stay, your kids have a school to go to -- and there's a D'Agostino's around the corner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She attempts a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her forehead, then exits. HOLD ON ROBERTA, looking hurt and frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta rosins her bow, standing in front of ten kids -- third through fifth-grade -- who sit on the floor next to their violin cases. The kids are Black and Latino, with a couple of white faces. They're all talking and ignoring Roberta except for NAEEM and GUADALUPE, a petite Mexican girl with a long dark braid. [NOTE: We'll see other violin students from time to time, but this is the class we'll follow for Roberta's first year]
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what am I doing now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<NAEEM_GUADALUPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rosining the bow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAEEM_GUADALUPE>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. And what am I doing when I turn this little screw?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(raising her voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone stop talking. Right now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
The kids quiet down. Only Naeem raises his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naeem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<NAEEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tightening the horse hair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAEEM>
<ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
(touches the heel of the bow)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what do we call this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
Again, only Naeem raises his hand. Roberta sees him but turns to DE SEAN, who's talking to his neighbor.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	De Sean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DE_SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DE_SEAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do we call this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DE_SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DE_SEAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DE_SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DE_SEAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes you were but you weren't paying attention! Do you want people to think you're stupid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
This makes De Sean blush -- and it pisses him off.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Naeem -- tell them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<NAEEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's called the frog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAEEM>
<DIRECTION>
Some kids giggle and joke about this. Roberta points to the scroll of the violin.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone remember what this is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
LUCY, the fidgety girl, snaps her fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucy! Do you like people snapping their fingers when you're talking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
The kids laugh. Roberta doesn't. She points to the scroll.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this called?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The jeri curl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta laughs, even though she's trying to be tough.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DENNIS' MUSIC CLASSROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dennis's twenty students play recorder in rows of attached theatre-style seats. Dennis sits at his desk, a METRONOME ticking, and apathetically leads them in scales, using a red pen as a baton. He keeps one eye on a stack of quizzes that he's marking, stopping to circle mistakes with the pen.
</DIRECTION>
<DENNIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C-C-C-C, D-D-D-D, E-E-E-E...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENNIS>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - Roberta stands in the hallway at the open door, dismayed by Dennis' uninspired teaching. She enters and crosses to Dennis, speaking quietly to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me -- sorry to interrupt --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
The students immediately start to chatter.
</DIRECTION>
<DENNIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No talking!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENNIS>
<DIRECTION>
He looks back at Roberta, annoyed by her intrusion.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm supposed to take kids out of Miss Cooper's classroom for my ten o'clock class -- there's nobody there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DENNIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Cooper's students have phys ed on Tuesdays.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENNIS>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you scheduled them for violin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DENNIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must have read the schedule wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENNIS>
<ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to remain polite)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DENNIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I can't solve this problem for you right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(nods to his class)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm trying to teach.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENNIS>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So am I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
She exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lexi and Nick are in Brian's bed. Roberta's tucking in Lexi; he holds a toy truck with Greek writing on it.
</DIRECTION>
<LEXI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I bring a puppy for show and tell tomorrow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEXI>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, we don't have a puppy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy said we could get one when we moved back to America.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta looks at Nick, then turns back to Lexi.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about your truck? I'll bet you're the only one in school with a truck from Greece.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When's Daddy coming back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta turns to Nick and tucks him in.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, he's still on his tour, so we'll just have to see but... It shouldn't be too much longer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<LEXI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he gonna live with us and Brian?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEXI>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, honey. We're just staying at Brian's house for a little while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
She turns back to Nick who looks worried. She kisses him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night, sweetie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses Lexi, then reaches to turn off the lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Leave it on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta nods, smiles at her sons, and exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nine children stand, violins under their right arms, bows hanging down from their right hands, and try to position their feet as Roberta addresses them.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now take the right foot and put it on a tile. Good. Now with the other foot take a tiny step forward and put it on a line. Try to make a box with your feet --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
She walks over to BENJAMIN, a white boy with glasses, and corrects his feet. She sees Lucy dancing in place.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucy! Would you like to leave the class right now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
Lucy nods, giggling. Roberta walks down the row of students.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should feel very strong -- so strong and balanced that if I wanted to knock you over I couldn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
She crosses to TANISHA, a sweet-natured Black girl with her hair in tiny braids, and gently pushes her belly.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see? If you're standing strong, I can't even push you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta turns to De Sean, who's talking to JAMES, a pudgy Black/Puerto Rican boy.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	De Sean! James! Quiet!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as she crosses to another student)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does anyone know where Naeem is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<TANISHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw him this morning but he's not here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TANISHA>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I know he's not here -- that's why I'm asking.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
She gently pushes Guadalupe's belly. The girl stumbles back.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See how I pushed you? It means your feet aren't centered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
Guadalupe tries to correct her feet. Roberta bends down to help and sees that the little girl wears LEG BRACES under her pants. Roberta stands and gestures to one of the boys.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you bring over a chair?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Guadalupe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's probably better for you to sit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
The boy brings the chair. Guadalupe sits, embarrassed.

EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta walks through a school yard filled with kids and parents picking them up. She sees Naeem and crosses to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where were you today, Naeem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<NAEEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't be in violin class anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAEEM>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<NAEEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother won't let me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAEEM>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
NAEEM'S MOTHER, MRS. ADISA, steps INTO FRAME. She's an attractive Black woman in a dress and head scarf made of African fabric.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_ADISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My son's got more important things to do than learn dead white men's music.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ADISA>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're gonna learn "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<MRS_ADISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many Black classical composers can you name? How many Black classical violinists do you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ADISA>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That doesn't mean it's the way it should be. Naeem's learning to play music -- and that makes him feel good about himself. Why should it matter who wrote it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<NAEEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Mom? Can't I be in the class?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAEEM>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Adisa puts a protective arm around her son, then addresses Roberta.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_ADISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. I've seen this before. You white women come up here and think you can rescue our poor inner city children who never asked to be rescued in the first place. No thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ADISA>
<DIRECTION>
She walks off with Naeem. He glances back at Roberta, then turns away quickly. Roberta watches after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta attempts to read Brian's book, To Hell and Back: Interviews with Vietnam Vets, but she's distracted. She glances at her purse, then back to the book. She puts the book down and dials the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brian Turner's room, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
While she waits, she looks at Brian's picture on the book jacket. There's no answer and she hangs up. She starts to straighten the already clean room, then gets her purse, takes out her wallet, and opens it to the plastic covered pictures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - PICTURES

<DIRECTION>
Charles in uniform; a studio shot of the boys when they were 3 and 1; the whole family posed on the terrace of their home in Greece, a view of the ocean behind them.

BACK TO ROBERTA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's really depressed herself now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE CROWLEY (50's), a no-nonsense Black teacher, shows her fifth-graders a globe. She doesn't turn as Roberta enters and crosses to her. In the b.g. we see ROBERTA'S STUDENTS waiting in THE HALL.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And which ocean is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Kids simultaneously yell out "ATLANTIC" and "PACIFIC."
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me... I'm here for the violin students.

</ROBERTA>
<ALICE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You're late.

</ALICE>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a couple of minutes -- I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're having a lesson now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this is when they have violin class!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not my problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta's reluctant to argue in front of the kids; she exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lots of noise and chaos as kids run wild during lunch recess. Janet rushes through the throngs while Roberta tries to keep up.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought all the teachers agreed to this.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Adam! I want you in my office right after lunch, you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANET>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<JANET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think about it!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Roberta)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whenever you pull kids out, it's a disruption, plus it's extra work for the teacher 'cause they have to fill the kids in on what they missed. Some teachers resent it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANET>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, can't you talk to them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
Janet stops walking and pulls a box cutter out of her pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<JANET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I took this off a second-grader this morning. I'll help you Roberta -- but I can't hold your hand here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANET>
<DIRECTION>
Janet starts to walk away, then turns.
</DIRECTION>
<JANET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A word of advice? When you're picking up your students, go to Alice's classroom first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANET>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta stands there as Janet walks on ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nine children hold their violins in position as Roberta addresses them.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So pretend you're driving a car and I'm the policeman and I say STOP! Thumb up, fingers straight up, flat palm. Now you be policemen, but turn your hand and make it say stop to yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DE_SEAN>

Some kids crack up and start joking and chatting.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knock it off, De Sean!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to all)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you kids can't take this seriously, I don't want you here. I'm teaching you a difficult instrument because I respect you and have faith that you can learn it. But none of that matters if you don't have respect for yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
Some of the children think about what she's saying. A couple, uncomfortable with the intensity, hold back giggles.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now turn your wrist so it's flat against the fingerboard, and that's how you'll set up your hand...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta sees Guadalupe struggling.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guadalupe! You've got the violin in the wrong hand! How did that happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
Embarrassed, Guadalupe corrects her position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIAN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the small kitchen table, Nick does homework and Lexi puts stickers in a sticker book. Roberta's cooking dinner; she grabs a potholder and checks on a bubbling lasagna in the oven. The PHONE RINGS and she answers it.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ROBERTA>
<CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>

</ROBERTA>
<CHARLES>

Roberta closes the oven and gathers her courage.

A beat.

We watch Roberta's body collapse into a sense of overwhelming relief. FOLLOW HER as she steps into THE HALLWAY, then stretches the phone into:

INT. BRIAN'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

She half-closes the door, leans against the sink and starts to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
(through tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've missed you so much, Charles. The boys... they can't wait for you to come home... I know we'll have a lot to work out and it won't be easy right away, but we're gonna get through this, you know? We're a family and we belong together and --

(O.S.) (more emotive than before)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Roberta in Brian's living room. She's extremely agitated and her eyes are puffy from crying.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe you were still holding out hope. The guy hasn't called you or the kids in three months -- I thought you'd moved on.

<ROBERTA>

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

Roberta walks through crowds of kids towards Janet who's in the middle of confronting a boy student. Janet holds a FIFTY- DOLLAR BILL. Roberta hangs back and waits for a chance to speak.

Janet gives him a stern look.

</BOY>
<JANET>

<GUADALUPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't come anymore. It's too hard.

</GUADALUPE>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The violin is hard for everyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<GUADALUPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But everyone else is better than me. I'll always be slow.

</ROBERTA>
<GUADALUPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUADALUPE>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's one of the greatest violinists in the world, and he has problems with his legs too. He walks with two canes -- but he still makes the most beautiful music.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<GUADALUPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he sits down when he plays?
	</DIALOGUE>

Guadalupe takes this in.

</GUADALUPE>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. But if he was, I'd tell him the same thing I'm telling you. You shouldn't quit something just because it's hard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<GUADALUPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I can't stand strong.
	</DIALOGUE>

Guadalupe nods. Roberta holds out the violin case. Guadalupe lunges forward and hugs her around the waist. Roberta awkwardly accepts the hug, startled and touched by it, and strokes the girl's hair. Guadalupe lets go, takes the violin and exits. HOLD ON ROBERTA as she absorbs what just happened. JANET pokes her head into the room.

ROBERTA'S POV OUT THE WINDOW
</DIRECTION>

</ROBERTA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to hear the birthday story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
A beat as she contemplates whether to push or not, then:
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was the day of Grandpa's birthday, and I was sad because he had died a few months back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you knew I'd be born that day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I packed a bag and got all ready --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Daddy laughed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said, "It's my father's birthday, and the baby's gonna be born today."
	</DIALOGUE>

<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't believe you. But I was born. The same day as Grandpa.

</NICK>
<ROBERTA>

	It was a happy day.

</ROBERTA>
<NICK>

</NICK>

She looks at him, taken aback by the question.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course he was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why is he leaving me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta, overcome with emotion, can barely answer.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not leaving you, Nick. He loves you and Lexi very much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why can't he live here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ROBERTA>

(struggling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's very hard to explain... Sometimes things happen between grown-ups... and they just can't be together.

The CAMERA moves behind them as they continue to look out the window, and we see Nick move away from his mother.

EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of kids stand together with their violins and chat. Roberta exits the building and they greet her. She waves back, but she's clearly still upset by her interaction with Lucy. She sees Naeem and his mother and approaches them.
</DIRECTION>
<NAEEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Roberta.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAEEM>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Naeem. Can I talk to your mom for a minute?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
Naeem nods and moves off.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I didn't come up here to rescue anybody. I'm a single mother and I needed a job. And I know you think you're protecting your son, but you're not. I mean, what if Arthur Ashe's mother had stopped him from playing tennis because it's a "white man's game"?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The important thing is that when Naeem plays music, his whole face lights up. You should see him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Adisa takes this in. Roberta exits. Mrs. Adisa looks for Naeem and sees him watching the violin students, longing to be among them. She watches her son with compassion.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. OUTDOOR MARKET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta and the boys shop in a colorful outdoor produce market in their neighborhood.

A brown puppy is jumping all over Nick and Lexi who laugh delightedly. Roberta is putting down newspapers.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
They stop playing. Tanisha raises her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this an important question, Tanisha?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
Tanisha nods.
</DIRECTION>
<TANISHA>

	Do you have two of those skirts?

</TANISHA>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

</ROBERTA>
<TANISHA>

The door opens and Naeem enters with Mrs. Adisa. Roberta crosses to them.

</ROBERTA>
<NAEEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAEEM>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we can also arrange some private lessons at my house.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's try it again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>

They begin again, and we see Naeem take out a violin and join in. As they play, Roberta's ears perk up at something she's hearing. She crosses to Lucy.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>

Lucy hesitates, thinking she's in trouble. She plays a jazz variation of the song. Roberta smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did someone teach you that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<LUCY>

	No. I made it up.

INT. JANET WILLIAMS' OFFICE - DAY

Roberta sits opposite Janet and MRS. LAMB, a white woman in her 30's.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_LAMB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're shouting at them. All the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_LAMB>

	Not all the time. But if they don't listen --

</ROBERTA>
<MRS_LAMB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you tell them that they were making their parents sick?

Janet raises her eyebrows at this.

	That wasn't exactly what I said --

	I'm raising Becky in a supportive atmosphere. I don't send her to school to be abused.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_LAMB>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just trying to discipline them. If they're gonna learn an instrument, they need to take it seriously --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<JANET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think what Mrs. Lamb is trying to say, Roberta, is that you're a little too harsh. I'm sure you might be able to soften some of your comments to the children?

She gives Roberta a long hard look. Roberta nods.

Roberta listens to the students play "Go Tell Aunt Rhody" -- badly. They finish and stare at her, afraid of her response.

	Well, that was... that was pretty good... that wasn't too bad...

The boy nervously shakes his head no.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you please try a little harder for next week?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>

James nods. The kids are baffled by her politeness.

	Good. Just do the best you can.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take good care of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLIGHT_ATTENDANT>
<DIRECTION>
The FLIGHT ATTENDANT escorts them into the jet way. Roberta holds back tears as they get further away from her. At the last moment, Lexi turns and waves; Nick does not. Roberta waves, tears starting to fall, and the boys disappear from sight. She observes all the families travelling together, and feels like the loneliest person in the airport.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta enters her apartment, back from the airport, and double-locks the door behind her. You can see on her face that she's dreading the emptiness. She crosses to a small Christmas tree, obviously decorated by her and the boys, and plugs in the tiny blinking lights. It's not exactly Rockefeller Center. She turns on the T.V., playing IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She crosses to the kitchen, then returns with a carton of eggnog, a glass, and a bottle of rum. She sits down on the couch, pours herself some eggnog, adds rum, adds more rum, goes back into the kitchen, returns with nutmeg, sprinkles some on top, then drinks. She sighs, glancing miserably at the tree and the T.V. Pathetic. She couldn't look any less festive if she tried. There's a KNOCK on the DOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta gets up and warily approaches the door.

	Santa Claus.

</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She looks through the peephole, then quickly unlocks the door and opens it, revealing BRIAN, giving her a big smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks sexy as hell (even with a silly lit-up Santa Claus pin on his leather jacket), and he holds a long-stemmed red rose in one hand, and a Christmas present in the other.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta's thrilled and relieved to see him. She embraces him, and they kiss passionately.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BROWNSTONE - EAST HARLEM - THE SAME DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mild winter day. Roberta, covered with plaster dust and overheated from working, leans against a car and drinks a beer. The three-story brick building has some graffiti on it and is badly in need of a paint job; there are a few broken windows, and the front stairs need repairing. WORKMEN file in and out. We can see from the STREET SIGNS that we're on 118th STREET, a few houses off FIRST AVENUE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian (also dust-covered), Nick and Lexi toss around a football. LAWRENCE (6), a Black boy who lives next door, joins them. Brian crosses to Roberta, sweaty and out of breath. He takes a swig of her beer.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O.K., enough goofing off -- back to work.

Brian and Roberta finish making love on the futon. They lie in each other's arms, still breathing heavily.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
Brian makes a sound that's either panting or laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you just laugh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. It's just...

Roberta looks at him, offended.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do people feel like the minute something's going great, they gotta name it?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Once you name something, you snuff the life out of it.

</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She disentangles from him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, Brian. Do you still get away with that crap? It's not the Sixties anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, maybe if you'd actually gone through the Sixties, you'd know what I'm talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine! We won't name it, we won't talk about it, we'll act like we have no feelings for each other whatsoever!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
She angrily turns on her side with her back to him. Brian regrets hurting her and moves to her, kissing her shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I'm being an asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sweetly teasing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can say you love me if you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it. I changed my mind.

He laughs and coaxes her to kiss him -- a temporary truce.

INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
ERNIE (70's), a rickety Black man in work boots, looks baffled by a tangled mess of wires protruding from a wall. Roberta approaches.

<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's it coming, Ernie?
	</DIALOGUE>

Brian overhears, rolls his eyes and pulls her aside.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're crazy. Why did you hire him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He needed a job. Besides, he's wired all of East Harlem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When? Fifty years ago?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Brian sighs and walks off into another room. Two MEN carry in large panels of sheetrock with old WALLPAPER on it.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why is there wallpaper on it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<MAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's how it comes.

They lean the panels against a wall. Roberta turns to Ernie.
</DIRECTION>
<ERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep, that's how it comes now.

The guys quickly exit. Brian re-enters and sees the panels.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>

</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheetrock.

</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've gotta be kidding. Those ex- cons you hired ripped this off -- and you too!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta feels stupid but doesn't want to show it.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>

He stomps off. ANOTHER ANGLE - Nick watches them fight and looks distressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lots of screaming and commotion as the kids crowd around a fight in progress. As we move through the crowd we see that NICK's in a fight with another boy; Nick's nose is bleeding and he has the boy in a headlock. TWO TEACHERS run over to break it up.
</DIRECTION>

Roberta plays "Go Tell Aunt Rhody" with Guadalupe, De Sean, Naeem, Benjamin, and two kids from the other classes. Lexi plays along with them. Nick enters from the kitchen, eating a cookie, ignoring the students. He turns on the T.V.

</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good catch Nick!

</BRIAN>

Nick throws it back to Brian and it lands in the WATER.

<BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(mock sternly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-oh. You know what that means?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
He stalks towards Nick menacingly, picks him up and pretends he's going to throw him into the water. Nick laughs hysterically.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(through laughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't! Don't throw me in!
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - A LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian and Roberta speak as they stroll; the boys run ahead of them, dragging sticks along the pavement. In the b.g. we see HARLEM STREETS bordering the park.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You seem to be the only one who can get Nick to laugh these days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He misses his dad. I'm just a surrogate.

	No -- I think Nick really likes you.

	You know... we're all hoping you'll move into the new house with us.

</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa. Can we just slow down here a minute? It's too much like getting married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's so bad about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That kind of commitment just isn't realistic. I mean, how can we know that you and I will even be able to stand each other in five years?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we don't. But if two people care about each other, they take a chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And look what happened to you and Charles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not talking about Charles. I'm talking about us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Roberta. Marriage is based on a belief that one person can completely meet another person's needs. I just don't buy that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
This is making her nervous. She looks at him, afraid of what he might be saying.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
(carefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you saying? If there's some need you have that I don't meet, you'd go and get it "met" by someone else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
He heaves a sigh of frustration, not wanting to answer the question.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm saying that it's the 80's and it's a fantasy to think of marriage lasting these days. One out of two marriages ends in divorce!

</BRIAN>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't answer my question.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>

	If I don't meet all your needs, and we're in a committed relationship -- forget marriage for a minute; I'm just talking about a relationship -- would you go to someone else?

A beat.

Roberta looks distressed by her talk with Brian as she and the boys enter, back from the park.

	Well then I wanna go to his house.

Nick stomps off to get his violin. Lexi follows. Roberta puts down her bag and takes off her coat. While Lexi sets up his violin, Nick opens his violin case, takes out the violin and angrily starts playing, loudly and roughly.

<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<NICK>

Nick picks up the violin and THROWS the violin down even harder, then YELLS at Roberta before she can even respond.

	It's all your fault! You made Daddy leave and you're gonna make Brian leave too! You're gonna be all alone and I'll have to take care of you!

Roberta is stunned. The anger drains out of her as she suddenly sees what this is all about.

This hits her in the solar plexus. Her hurt and vulnerability start to pour out.

The fifty fifth-grade students play the "Twinkle" variations. Their playing is impeccable and they look terrific.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the CAMERA PANS the audience, we recognize: MRS. ADISA, tears in her eyes as she watches Naeem; MRS. LAMB and her husband, watching Becky in amazement; ISABEL and her daughter sitting with ASSUNTA, NICK and LEXI; JANET, impressed as hell; and DENNIS, seething with jealousy.

<DIRECTION>
The students are now playing "Allegro," and they reach the fermata. They hold their positions in silence and the audience watches in anticipation. Roberta cues them and they play the next note in perfect unison. An involuntary smile lights on DE SEAN's face. They finish the song, the audience applauds, and Roberta turns to face them.

She lights up when she sees how thrilled Janet looks, and Janet in turn raises her hands higher as she applauds Roberta.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta stands in front of a classroom of twenty cute first- graders -- mostly Black and Latino, a few white -- sitting on the floor, chatting excitedly. Even though Roberta's ten years older, she seems more youthful; her wavy hair is loose over her shoulders, her clothing's casual and artistic. Beside her is Janet, her hair flecked with gray, and Dennis, who looks pretty much the same. The classroom teacher is ISABEL, a little older, a little tougher.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>

	C'mon everybody, settle down -- Janet wants to talk to you.

<JANET>

	It's not me, Roberta. The Board of Ed. cut the budget, the District had to comply, and as of the end of this term, the violin program has been... excessed.

Roberta takes this in, momentarily speechless. In the b.g., the beginners slip into the hall to watch.

	I've been on this phone for the past three days trying to "do something" -- the District office can't even stand the sound of my voice. Believe me, there are some people around here I'd much rather get rid of. But as far as the Board's concerned, violin classes are not a priority.

INT. CPE 1 AUDITORIUM - THE CONCERT - STAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEVENTY-FIVE KIDS play "We Shall Overcome" and it's incredibly moving. Nick's on cello, Lexi plays piano. ROBERTA proudly leads the children. At the side of the stage, we see DOROTHEA photographing the concert. THE CAMERA PANS THE AUDIENCE of teary-eyed parents, many of them with CAM CORDERS. We FIND Ramon's family. Manuelo is riverted by his son's playing, and he starts to cry. Concepcion knows this without looking. She takes his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - JANET stands along the side and her eyes start to fill with tears. She tries to stay composed, then discreetly exits the auditorium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The song ends and the audience APPLAUDS, rising from their seats, including ASSUNTA (now 65), next to ISABEL and DAN. Someone remains seated: a REPORTER (40's), sitting beside Dan and taking notes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STUDENTS bow, then point to Roberta who bows and takes the stage. She gestures for people to sit. A beginner student brings her flowers. Roberta kisses her, then approaches the mike.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
(to the audience)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The beautiful concert that you just heard could be the last concert of the East Harlem Violin Program. The Board of Education and the District Superintendent don't think that music is important for our children. But they're wrong -- and they're in for a fight.

The parents stand and applaud. We see the REPORTER writing quickly. Dorothea snaps more pictures. Roberta extends an arm towards the kids, directing the applause at them. Ramon gives her a thumbs up.

ROBERTA is vacuuming the living room while Assunta dusts. Extra chairs are set up in the living room in preparation for a meeting. The doorbell RINGS.

</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
FOLLOW ASSUNTA to the DOOR. She opens it, revealing JANET, who's carrying two bags of groceries. Assunta's demeanor instantly cools when she sees her. In the b.g. Roberta sees Janet and turns off the vacuum cleaner.
</DIRECTION>
<JANET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Assunta. How are you?

Assunta hesitates for a beat, then gets the dog and exits. Janet continues unpacking the bags as if there's nothing unusual about her being there. Cheeses, crackers, bread, salads, fruit, paper plates, napkins, etc. She sees Roberta's confused expression.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Plus night time rehearsals during the week. There's only six weeks till the concert, so classes in school won't be enough.

</ROBERTA>

The kids look sobered by this.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come to think of it, we'll probably also need to meet before school.

ANOTHER ANGLE - Two young men and two young women walk in, carrying violins. We realize from the scar that one is NAEEM (20), now a strikingly handsome man, over six feet tall. With him is DE SEAN (19), a short guy with dreadlocks, looking more like a rapper than a violinist. GUADALUPE (19), walking with a cane, is now a beautiful young woman, her long braid pinned up. The fourth is a reserved Puerto Rican woman (20).

INT. RAMON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ramon's father carefully reads the violin contract while Ramon and Concepcion anxiously watch. He stops to look up a word in the English-Spanish dictionary beside him. Ramon and his mom are squirming. Manuelo nods as he finishes reading, then SIGNS the contract. Ramon breaks into a smile, throws his little arms around his Papa and kisses him.

EXT. RIVER EAST - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
School's letting out; Carlos' sister exits, carrying Carlos' violin. A few beats later, Carlos quickly exits, checking his watch. He sees his LOS LEONES teammates standing in a group, and tries to bypass them without being noticed, but they spot him.
</DIRECTION>
<TEAMMATE_1>

	Hey Carlos! Where ya goin'? We got a game, remember?

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Fiddlefest kids, including Carlos, Vanessa, Shandra, Ramon, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, Simon, Thomas, De Sean and Guadalupe practice Bach's "Minuet One," Roberta leading them and giving direction. They're playing badly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel plays as well, but walks around the room making corrections. It's early morning, and the kids look half- asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frog! Frog! I need more accents on the down beat! More bow! More!
	</DIALOGUE>

They play a few more bars and still sound pretty bad.

INT. ARNOLD AND DOROTHEA'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dorothea opens the door for Roberta who just charges in, agitated, without even saying hello. We sense that Dorothea too, is troubled by something.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must have been crazy to agree to this. They're never gonna be ready. And you should hear the Bach Double! A disaster. So the good news is tickets are selling like hot cakes, but the bad news is that the kids sound like shit.

<DOROTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's more bad news... We've lost the Y.

INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Fiddlefest kids are crammed into Roberta's house, (including De Sean, Guadalupe, Ramon, Vanessa, Shandra, Carlos, Thomas, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, and Simon), rehearsing "Orange Blossom Special." They play badly. Rachel helps Roberta correct students.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop! Someone's playing the wrong notes! And you shouldn't need your music anymore! Except for the Bach Double, everything has to be memorized by next rehearsal!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
The kids look at each other, daunted.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>

	And you sound like you're sleepwalking. Your heart's not even in it.

</ROBERTA>
<VANESSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe 'cause we don't have a place for the concert.

Roberta looks at her, and then notices the despondent looks on many of the kids' faces.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you're right. This might all be for nothing. So we can either keep on rehearsing in case we find a place -- or we can just... give up.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I hearing right? Did you use the words "give up"?

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Dorothea.

Nick opens the door and Dorothea rushes in, out of breath, talking a mile a minute.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have good news -- really good news. Arnold got a call from his friend Wally Scheur who heard about us losing the Y and wanted to see how he could help -- and then Wally had this brilliant idea and called his friend Isaac Stern and it's all arranged! We have a new place for Fiddlefest!

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE CEILING OF CARNEGIE HALL, revolving slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK TO REVEAL THIS IS ROBERTA'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stands on the empty stage, gazing at the ceiling as she slowly turns around. She's holding her violin case. She looks at the UPPER BALCONIES -- THE LOWER BALCONIES -- THE ORCHESTRA SEATS. Her footsteps echo as she walks towards the front of the stage, then stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON ROBERTA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can see her imagining the audience on the night of the concert. She can't believe her eyes. A beat, and she looks around to make sure she's alone. She takes out her violin, takes a deep breath as she looks out towards her "audience," then starts to play the second violin part of the Bach Double Concerto. Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a stage door opening. Roberta stops.
</DIRECTION>
<MALE_VOICE>

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Incredible sound in this room, no?

Roberta pours nervous energy into her cappuccino, adding cinnamon, chocolate, and sugar, stirring loudly. Dan sits across from her, observing.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just don't see how I'm gonna do this. It's huge. It's gigantic! It's Carnegie Hall! And listen to this: now Isaac Stern wants to play with us -- Diane Monroe, Michael Tree -- there's other people calling --

	That's fantastic!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAN>
<ROBERTA>

	Fantastic? I'll never get the kids up to speed in time, I'll never get myself up to speed. I'm gonna be playing side by side with the world's greatest violinists.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And "the world's greatest violinists" are playing side by side with you because they want to help you win this fight.

</DAN>
<DIRECTION>
He offers her a forkful of some decadent-looking chocolate cake, but she shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but... you don't understand. Maybe there's a good reason why I never made it as a violinist -- maybe I just can't cut it. I keep blaming it on not having enough early training, but if I were talented, if I had a gift --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you do have a gift. You're gonna put thirty East Harlem kids on stage at Carnegie Hall not because they're prodigies, but because you got them to stick with something that's hard as hell and to strive for excellence -- which, by the way, I certainly wasn't striving for when I was their age. Not to mention the other ten years' worth of students whose lives were changed because of you. That's your talent, Roberta.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAN>
<DIRECTION>
She takes this in, looks at him gratefully and puts her hand over his. He strokes her hand.

	And by the way, I happen to think you're a pretty good violinist too.

<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've barely heard me play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've heard enough to know you're gonna do just fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAN>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta looks at him with trepidation. Dan takes another forkful of his cake.
</DIRECTION>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides, no one's gonna be paying attention to your playing anyway.

The Fiddlefest kids (including Ramon, Shandra, Vanessa, De Sean, Naeem, Guadalupe, Lucy, Simon, Stephanie, Amanda and Kenny -- but RACHEL is absent) stand outside the locked school gate, waiting for Roberta. Some of the kids have their violins out of the cases, tuning them.

Kids laugh.

<RAMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I don't think we should let her play in Fiddlefest!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAMON>

A few kids start playing "CAN-CAN." It catches on, and more of them join in. PASSERSBY stop to listen, and some drop change into the open cases. RAMON and a couple of other kids grin at this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARLOS steps in front of the kids as he plays, and begins an uncanny imitation of Roberta:
</DIRECTION>
<CARLOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More bow! To the frog! You sound terrible! I can't believe how terrible you sound!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLOS>
<DIRECTION>
The kids crack up, but a few spot ROBERTA heading quickly up the street. Carlos is oblivious to this -- and no one signals him that Roberta's watching.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gonna make everyone in Carnegie Hall sick to their stomachs! That's right, they're gonna pay a thousand dollars a ticket and you're gonna make them throw up on their gowns and tuxedos!

Carlos senses a presence and turns to see Roberta. A tense beat as he awaits her reaction.

	If you're gonna imitate me, do it right.

Roberta nods, and addresses the kids as she unlocks the gate.

Roberta leads De Sean, Naeem, Guadalupe, Lucy, Stephanie, Thomas, Carlos, Erica and Nicholas in the Bach Double Concerto. The other kids watch. Roberta's on the edge of hysteria. She signals the players to stop.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, no! Accent the up bow after the slurred notes and then it'll get you off of those slurred notes! You Double Concerto kids need to be working harder! This is the grand finale of the concert! You're each gonna be sharing a music stand with one of the world's greatest violinists!
	</DIALOGUE>

The kids say "the world's greatest violinists" along with her -- they've obviously been hearing this a lot. Roberta glares at them.

	<DIALOGUE>
	When I became the principal of Central Park East Elementary, I envisioned a school where children could fulfill their highest potential, despite the challenges of poverty and racism. Ten years ago, Roberta Guaspari walked into my office because she needed a job, and because she had a vision that any child could learn the violin. We put our dreams together and created the East Harlem Violin Program which has helped more than a thousand students expand their vision of what's possible in their lives. When a program like this is cut, our children's future is compromised. I want to thank you for your support. Enjoy the concert.

Roberta Guaspari lives in East Harlem with her daughter Sofia, whom she adopted from El Salvador. Nick is a professional cellist in a graduate music program, and Alexi has been accepted to medical school.
