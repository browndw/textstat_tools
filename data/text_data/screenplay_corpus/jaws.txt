It is a pleasant, moonlit, windless night in mid-June. We see a long straight stretch of white beach. Behind the low dunes are the dark shapes of large expensive houses.

The fire, now one hundred yards in the b.g., silhouettes Chrissie running up a steep dune. Once there, she pauses to look at the ocean that we can only hear. Cassidy plods up the dune behind her, grossly out of shape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chrissie runs down a few steps, leaving Tom Cassidy reeling on the summit. Chrissie's dress, bra and panties fly toward Tom, who can't make a fist to catch them. The dress drapes over one half of his head. Soggily aroused, Cassidy struggles to get his shoe off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Chrissie is already in full flight toward the shore. In she goes, a delicate splash, surfacing in a cold ocean that is unusually placid. Chrissie pulls with her arms, drawing herself into deeper water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That's when we see it. A gentle bulge in the water, a ripple that passes her a dozen feet away. A wave of pressure lifts her up and eases her down again. Her face shows the beginning of fear. Maybe it's Tom. She smiles and looks around for him, then her eyes go to the beach where Tom -- too drunk to stand -- one pantleg off, is struggling with his other shoe. Chrissie turns and starts for shore.

Her expression freezes. The water-lump is racing for her. It bolts her upright, out of the water to her hips, then slams her hard, whipping her in an upward arc of eight feet before she is jerked down to her open mouth. Another jolt to her floating hair. One hand claws the air, fingers trying to breathe, then it, too, is sucked below in a final and terrible jerking motion. HOLD on the churning froth of a baby whirl- pool until we are sure it is over.

Whatever he sees has a marked effect on his entire physique. Kicking out with his foot, Brody sends dozens of angry horseshoe crabs in an escape frenzy and they boil over the top of the dune and down its slopes.

Cassidy takes a few uneasy steps backwards when Brody waves him over. He shakes his head. An awkward moment. Then Cassidy shuffles forward and up the few remaining feet, his eyes looking everywhere but down. Brody says something else and Cassidy shakes his head again, eyes out at sea. Brody puts his hand gently around the quaking man's shoulder. Nodding, he starts to look down, an inch at a time. He looks.
</DIRECTION>

The jolt that assaults Cassidy is not unexpected. He falls backward in a sitting position as though shot. Nods yes -- it's her. Brody turns and slides off the dune, stumbling close. Hear his BREATHING. He looks around, envisioning the week ahead of him....

Ellen's eyes drift down to the open book. One large text is open to a page of illustrations.

Startled, Ellen closes the book, opens the window and sticks her head out.

A jelly-bowl woman visitor to Amity's beaches plunges head- long into the white foam. There's enough of her stuffed into a one-piece bathing suit to sate the appetite of any shark for weeks.

Vaughn gestures up at the billboard. The beautiful model splashing in the golden surf with flailing arms has been significantly reinterpreted. Some pranksters have painted a huge dorsal fin cutting through the waves next to her, and she now looks like an hysterical beach-goer stampeding out of the water. The deputies begin covering it over with paint. People have been gathering throughout the scene on bicycles and a few station wagons.

Brody and Deputy Hendricks are supervising another loading activity. Six local fishermen are converting their 16-foot fiberglass double outboard into a gunboat.

Ellen is somehow mired behind Brody's desk, two travel folders in her absent-minded grasp. She talks into one phone, at the same time she is talking on another to a breathy, ticky landlady. All of this overlapping. Brody's secretary Polly is in the outer office doing three things at once.

Ellen removes the receiver from her ear, from which angry geese-like sounds filter through.

:SC: INT. QUINT'S RESIDENCE - NIGHT

Entering Quint's abode is not unlike a spooky ride at Disneyland...the placement of objects, the dungeon lighting, the tendrils of smoke and dust in the air makes a visitor wish he were carrying a 100-watt bulb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is gear everywhere. The walls are adorned with jerky shark hides, coiled ropes dangle like serpents above a galley stove that leaks smoke and holds two weeks worth of filthy dishes. Tubes, barrels, rods, reels, harpoons, an antique gun collection and a dizzy array of shark hooks line the walls, with one entire wall dedicated to a collection of laminated jaws from the blue shark to the Great White. Con- spicuously in the center of the room is a swivel fighting chair and it looks like the perfect place to have all your teeth pulled. Into this orifice of decay, Brody enters, and from his point of view, we see Quint hunched over a tub of steaming Borax.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>

The fin, huge, black and real, crosses behind them. They are not yet aware. The fin seems to circle and return. It heads toward Michael's boat when another small dinghy gets in its way -- a weekend novice just finishing a thermos of coffee when he is "bumped." The entire boat is overturned. Michael sees the fin now as it collides with him, the entire bow lifting out of the water and rolling over on the port side. Michael and Kit are thrown head first.

Three heads in the water come up sputtering, the fin between them crossing back. Michael freezes. The fin comes directly at him, growing into the sky, passing him so close he could touch it, but ignoring him as it follows the flailing and panicked weekend novice. Catches him. Michael watches. That all too familiar explosion of water -- a choked off scream -- the head and upper torso of the novice passing Michael swiftly as though being carried off -- a current of blood trailing around.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A seizure of violent shaking. A horrible splintering and popping noise. Quint half falls, half springs, out of the chair. Hooper is on his feet, but loses his footing. The Orca is again bumped from underneath. Brody holds on, his gun in hand. Quint pulls out his M-1.

<DIRECTION>
Brody leans against the windshield on the flybridge. His arms hoist binoculars to his eyes. Visible without binoculars is the signal-light and barrel, not moving, two hundred yards astern. An angry racket filters up from below deck -- Quint is effecting engine repairs the only way he knows how. Brody has learned a neat sailor's trick and nimbly slides down the hand piping, his feet avoiding the steps. He sidles next to Hooper, who is struggling into his full wet suit.

Quint cuts the engine once alongside the barrel. Hooper barely controls himself. Climbs down.

Quint follows after him, putting a cautioning hand on Hooper's shoulder to walk softly, then motions Brody to stay on the flybridge and keep his eyes peeled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: QUINT - HOOPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tiptoe to the stern, Quint intercepting a harpoon along the way. Hooper leans way out over the transom and poles the barrel closer. It bobs around easily, arousing Quint's sus- picions.

Hooper starts hand-reeling in. Surprisingly, there is no resistance. Both men share perplexed looks. Then Quint reaches over, his whole body leaning over the side, putting down his harpoon.

	Here -- gimme. I don't get what he's....
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINT>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: WATER - ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both men are draped over the side, their chins almost touching the water on the aft side. From the opposite starboard direction, fully unfastened from the barrel, comes the Great White. First the fin, then the conical nose and the upper border of wide, grinning teeth. It knifes through the water in absolute silence, propelling itself with tremendous speed toward the unsuspecting men.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They turn just in time, and a long spine-stretch saves them from instant decapitation. The Great White passes the transom, the harpoon still in its side and trailing five feet of chewed off cable. The monster rolls on its side and looks at them as it passes. Then, with a great sweep of its tail, it lashes the side of the boat, ripping the rope from Quint's hand and shearing off five square yards of paint like a lathe. It makes a wide arc out to sea, only the fin showing now, and begins to circle around the boat. Quint notices his hand, palm cut and bleeding, realizes he came that close to losing his whole hand. He has never been more dangerous.

Brody heads off for the cabin.

A perfectly terrible look comes over him. He raises up and starts after Brody. Brody disappears into the cabin. Quint pauses outside and sees:

Sparks fly, lights blink and go out, plastic and sections of metal ricochet all over the cabin as Quint demolishes the ship- to-shore radio.

Quint takes a happy breath, winks at Brody and hands him the bat.

Hooper skillfully avoids the speeding rope.

Quint leans to one side, harpoon over his head. The Great White breaks water and....

<QUINT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take two, they're small!

</QUINT>
<DIRECTION>
He sinks it deep. We hear shots. As the new rope whips out, Brody can be seen standing on the gunwale, clutching the steel cage with one hand, firing his pistol at the shark with the other.

Quint shakes his head in amused disbelief at this, as the barrel goes over.

The shark leaps partially out of the water, and the sight is both horrifying and awesome. Its jaws break water, snapping at the ropes that have him snarled and frustrated.

Quint throws the Orca into neutral and shouts down:
</DIRECTION>
<QUINT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haul in -- watch the prop!
	</DIALOGUE>

At that, Quint slides down to the prow, grabs up an iron. It is too light. He grabs another, finding satisfaction in its heft and balance. The shark can be seen directly ahead, threshing closer.

They are trying to untie from the cleats, but both ropes are stretched too taut. They jump out of the way as the ropes stretch down the side and behind the boat, knocking over objects as it skeeters across the deck. A tight jerking motion, and the Orca is dragged through the water -- backwards. And much too fast. Water is splashing up over the transom in its backward wake.

He gooses the throttle but the engine only screeches and pounds erratically. The three barrels pass beyond the boat, negotiating a tight circle and plowing mercilessly toward the Orca. The tip of the fin aims for the stern. Quint is ready with his rifle.

The shark breaks water and rises like a rocket, snout, jaw and pectoral fins shooting straight up. We see the smoke- white belly, the pelvic fin, as it clears the surface and falls sideways drenching Quint, who fires six times.

The Orca shudders from side to side. From Hooper's point of view we can just discern what is happening. The shark has the lower transom in its jaws and is shaking the boat with each jolt of its head.

He pops his mouthpiece between teeth and lowers the face mask. Unsure, Brody manages to undo the knot that starts the cage into the ocean. He and Hooper stare at one another as their faces pass, Hooper's moving down, down into the slate- grey sea. Brody curls the rope around his forearm for a stronger hold.

:SC: HOOPER'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water is clear and shafts of sunlight streak downward in the blue. From the deep gloom -- diving slowly, smoothly -- comes the shark. It move with no apparent effort, sinuous beyond comparison. As it nears the cage, it turns, and its ghastly length passes right in front of him: first the snout, then the jaw, slack and smiling, then the black eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hooper tentatively reaches out. It is too far for the strychnine pole. The vinyl flesh is pocked with bullet holes, iron scars, gaffing hooks and strange open wounds that tinge the passing currents with pink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: SURFACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trailing barrels GONG and SCRATCH the keel of the Orca above. Brody and Quint leap back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: HOOPER - CLOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shark has vanished into a cloud of rising silt. Hooper, expecting the shark to attack out of that same general direction, braces himself, pole extended through the bars, breathing faster, straining his eyes into the gloom and...we see that the shark attacking from behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cage is sent careening. Hooper grabs the bars for dear life. The shark has grabbed the steel struts in its brutal jaws, shaking the cage relentlessly from side to side, bending the bars like clothes hangers. Hooper can't turn the point- end of the pole around, his body jammed as far away from the non-rational attacker as possible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hooper is trapped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shark withdraws to get some running room then charges again. The bleeding snout thrust deeper into the yawing bars, the jaws snapping and twisting, two feet from Hooper's torso, the tail thrusting it forward. Hooper drops the strychnine pole between the bars and it tumbles slowly toward rapture depth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the shark needs is one more good thrust before separating Hooper at the waistline. Through frantic bubbles Hooper fumbles with the overhead hatch cover, kicking up and out of the cage. The shark backpedals with its tail, but the broad head won't shake loose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hooper rushes downwards, after the strychnine pole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: ANGLE - SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As spirals of harmless bullets bead the water, the shark twists free of the cage and arrows downward after Hooper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hooper nearly recovers the pole. Again it slips from his frightened grasp and this time disappears into a narrow abyss. Hooper turns and looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Great White is lunging at him, twenty feet above.

The Orca is listing dangerously aft, the ginpole bent almost to the breaking point. Brody is in a frenzy trying to haul up the cage. Quint attaches the end of Brody's rope to a hand-winch. The GINPOLE IS SPLITTING!

The pole gives way, the rope whipping down on the gunwale.... the pulling of the tonnage below is tipping the Orca, dragging it, but Quint won't give up the winch. Brody hauls on the rope barehanded.

The shark breaks water right beside the Orca, rising with a great whooshing noise. It rises vertically, towering over- head, blocking out the sun. The pectoral fins seem to reach forward. The shark, in all of its monstrous glory, falls onto the stern of the boat with a shattering crash, narrowly missing Quint and Brody. It drives the stern underwater, the ocean pours in over the transom. The jaws snap from side to side. Brody flounders backwards away from it. Quint gropes for his rifle and fires. The shark heaves its terrible girth and Quint flies backwards onto his harpoon display.

Skewered by a Number Twelve iron, Quint gulps blood and pitches into the onrushing sea.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Orca is tipping backwards, sinking stern first, tipping Brody toward the gaping thrusting jaws. Deck chairs, irons, spent cartridges, thermos, beer cans all pour into the vacuum of the open gagging jaws. It wants Brody now, its tail keeping him into position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brody is sliding toward it with the rest of the debris as the bow raises thirty degrees. He intercepts one of Hooper's compressed air tanks and just as he and everything else pours toward the whirlpool and into the jaws, Brody braces himself and shoves the tanks at the bottomless pit. They jam between the upper and lower jaws and stick fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shark twists backward in the water and turns away. Hooper, rising, is peering around for Brody and Quint. The shark is spinning in crazed circles, the head-thrusts indicating that it can neither dislodge nor swallow the silver tanks. It bites down at fifteen tons pressure per square inch. The TANKS EXPLODE!
