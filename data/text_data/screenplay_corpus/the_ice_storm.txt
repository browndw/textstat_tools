EXT. TRAIN - DARKNESS BEFORE DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suburban Connecticut, outside of New York City, 1973. The still after a terrible storm. Trees dripping, their branches torn, the air warming just before the break of a new day. The train lies dark and motionless, a few flashing yellow emergency lights up front, as a work crew removes debris from the track.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN. PRE-DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Various passengers, huddled uncomfortably, cold, asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On Paul Hood, 15-and-a-half, stoner-preppie look, hunched up in his seat under the faint emergency exit light. He reads his Fantastic Four comic book by the pale light of the emergency exit sign.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the lights begin to flicker on and the hum of the train's engines returns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The conductor enters the car, blasting forth in his classic nasal voice.
</DIRECTION>
<CONDUCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning ladies and gentlemen --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONDUCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He sounds like a baseball announcer.
</DIRECTION>
<PASSENGERS>
<DIRECTION>
(mumbling, ad lib)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What ladies?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PASSENGERS>
<CONDUCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- this train originating at New York's Grand Central Station is back in service - next stop will be New Canaan, Connecticut. New Canaan, Connecticut, next stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONDUCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He moves on to the next car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train begins to move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul rubs his elbow against the window and looks out into the still-dark early morning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks back down at his comic book.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the comic book: Reed Richards (also known as Stretch) has zapped his young son with a cosmic ray gun to neutralize the destructive energy that Annihilus has implanted in him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Thing, Medusa, Flame, and Richards' wife Sue Storm look on, stunned.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"THEN YOU'VE TURNED HIM INTO A VEGETABLE. YOUR OWN SON." "DON'T YOU SEE, SUE? HE WAS TOO POWERFUL... IF HIS ENERGY HAD CONTINUED TO BUILD, HE WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WQRLD!"
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul looks up again, thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In issue number 141 of The Fantastic Four, published in November 1973, Reed Richards has to use his anti-matter weapon on his own son, who Annihilus has turned into a human atom bomb. His son is the result of Richards' coupling with the earthling Sue Storm, and the problem is that the cosmic rays that infused Richards and the rest of the Fantastic Four on their aborted moon mission have made young Franklin a volatile mixture of matter and anti-matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRAIN BRIDGE. PRE-DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train moves slowly through a suburban, semi-forested landscape.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's what it is to come from a family, if you analyze it closely. Each of them is negative matter for the other ones. And that's what dying is -- dying is when your family, which is in fact your personal negative matter from which you emerge -- it's when the family takes you back, thus hurling you back into negative space...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN. CONT'D.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On Paul, as the sun breaks over the horizon. His face glows warmly in the yellow light. He looks down idly at the comic book.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it's a paradox -- the closer you're drawn back in, the further into the void you're thrown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONRAIL STATION. EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train slowly pulls in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train doors open, and Paul, weary from the long night, emerges. He sees his family gathered at the other end of the platform -- Ben, 40, a bit worse for wear but still retaining traces of his boyish looks; Elena, 37, distant and elegant even in her oversized sweater; and Wendy, 14, a sullen suburban Lolita.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses, regarding them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stand, silent, even dignified, awaiting him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ST. PETER'S SCHOOL. MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To establish. A typical New England prep school.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PAUL AND FRANCIS'S DORM ROOM. MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cramped, a mess, but quaint. Paul shares the room with Francis Davenport IV, a dissolute, smart-ass son of money.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul's alarm clock rings. He slams his hand down on it and jumps out of bed, fully clothed in his rumpled preppie uniform of frayed khakis, loose tie, shirt with one tail untucked in, etc. Across the room, Francis beckons from his desk, as he finishes loading up a four-foot-high bong.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arise and shine, young Hood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCIS>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<FRANCIS>
<DIRECTION>
(finishing a hit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and Ben&Ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCIS>
<DIRECTION>
Paul reluctantly walks over and takes a hit. He coughs, spewing uninhaled smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCIS>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.

</FRANCIS>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(gathering books, papers,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	almost talking to
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCIS>
<PAUL>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta get to English class.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ST PETERS' CLASSROOM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An English class in progress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul Hood sits blankly, hardly listening, until he hears the teacher call out.
</DIRECTION>
<TEACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Libbets?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEACHER>
<LIBBETS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What Dostoyevsky is saying here is that to be a Christian is to choose, because you have to choose of your own choice, but since you can't choose to be good because that would be too rational you have to choose to be bad -- it's existential.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIBBETS>
<TEACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you Libbets, that's a very compelling summary, but --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEACHER>
<DIRECTION>
Paul looks at her, smitten. Marge, Paul's friend, notices his look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ST. PETER'S HALLWAY. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As class lets out, Paul accosts Libbets.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<LIBBETS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Idiot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIBBETS>
<PAUL>

	If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.

</PAUL>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's beyond mere physical attraction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Truly? Do speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know this shit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.

	Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?

(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?

<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good thinking Marge.

</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHOOL PARTY. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul, Francis and friends enter the dark, crowded room. Various kids are awkwardly dancing to some progressive fm style undanceable rock (Jethro Tull, etc.) Francis hands Paul the tail end of a joint, but Paul waves it away.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See ya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCIS>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCIS>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flame on, asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCIS>
<DIRECTION>
He waves his fingers toward Paul's eyes, in the classic "stoned" gesture, then wanders off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul looks on at the gathering. Marge waves to him from the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHOOL PARTY. CONT'D
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul wanders, stoned, through the party. He sees Libbets from across the room. She seems to be surrounded by friends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARTY. CONT'D
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul has cornered Libbets and is talking over the music. There are just a few people left, most of them making out with each other.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(stoned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- because I've been reading Kerouac and Ginsberg and those guys were creating beat culture and traveling and sleeping wherever, and, of course, with all kinds of people, but when you read carefully the various contemporary accounts of their lives, and, uh, these guys didn't bathe much, I mean they were really filthy, with like genital crabs, lice, exceptionally strong body odor...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Libbets smiles through her yawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCHOOL BENCH. NIGHT

Paul sits alone on the bench, freezing cold, eating a donut. Some kids from across the lawn yell good-night to him.

The kitchen door swings open into the dining room, and Mikey and Sandy Williams emerge, each holding platters of food. Mikey, 15-and-a-half, lost in space, and Sandy, 14, a sullen and barely pubescent boy, each have towels draped over their forearms -- they are the evening's "waiters".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They move unsteadily to the table, at which sit their parents Janey (38, a hard-edged, sharp-witted beauty) and Jim (43, large and a bit goofy, a genius inventor), together with their guests, Ben and Elena Hood, and neighbors Dorothy and Ted Franklin.

The dinner party has moved to the living room for after dinner drinks. Elena remains behind to help Janey pick up the table. She stacks a plate on top of another.
</DIRECTION>
<JANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't.

</JANEY>
<ELENA>

INT. WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The party progresses. Mikey and Sandy are lying on their stomachs at the top of the stairs, out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<ELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A key party?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELENA>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic.
	</DIALOGUE>

<JANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ironic?

INT. WILLIAMS FRONT HALLWAY. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guests are leaving. The men shake hands, the women kiss, and the men and women awkwardly peck each others' cheeks.

<ELENA>

	Thank you Janey.

INT. STAIRWAY. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the top of the stairs, a rather dejected Sandy and Mikey finish spying on the leave-takings below. Mikey nudges Sandy, and they silently head back the upstairs hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MIKE'S ROOM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They enter Mike's room -- the door has a "nuclear waste positively no admittance" sign on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Mikey reaches his bed, he doubles over, groaning, and starts to make retching noises. He then throws himself onto the bed, his head leaning over the far side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sandy walks over and sees a pile of vomit next to the bed. Taken aback for a moment, he then reaches forward and picks it up -- it's fake plastic vomit. He throws it on top of Mike's back, but Mikey doesn't take notice.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stupid!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause, looking sullenly at Mike's back)
</DIRECTION>

</MIKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mikey returns to his reading -- a copy of The Sensuous Woman, obviously well pawed over. He absentmindedly picks his nose. As he flips the pages, a beautiful, almost electrical HUMMING SOUND begins to fill his ears. He frowns and pauses to listen to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sandy, who has picked up a balsa wood miniature plane, obviously doesn't hear it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mikey focuses on the plane as Sandy waves it through the air. Perhaps the hum is the sound of its engines as it soars through the sky...

INT. WENDY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

There is a large poster of a cartoon version of Richard Nixon "Tricky Dick" -- on her wall. Wendy is on the phone to her friend Beth.

<BEN>

He pauses before a hall table, and, with his eyes, traces the telephone cord under Wendy's room.

	Hmm. I knew she'd still be up. Watch this --

He starts to pull gently on the cord. And continues pulling. No response for a few seconds. Then:

Wendy jumps into bed and under the covers, pulling them up over her head. He stands over her, looking down at the crumpled pile of sheet and blanket.

(CONT'D) (softening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, kiddo. Sleep well, huh.

INT. HOOD BEDROOM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elena is sitting cross-legged, eyes closed, on her side of the bed. We hear the toilet flush from the master bath, and see Ben emerge in his boxers. He pauses in front of the bed, looking at Elena.
</DIRECTION>
<ELENA>

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?

</ELENA>
<BEN>

Elena just gives him a look, more sad than angry.

	So maybe you'll come too?

</ELENA>
<BEN>

	Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELENA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --

INT. SHACKLEY AND SCHWIMMER CONFERENCE ROOM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben, seated, is finishing a brief presentation to a small group of men, which includes George Clair, mid-thirties, unctuously handsome.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what, exactly, is stagflation, this mixture of inflation and stagnation, and how should we in the securities industry understand and accommodate it? Well -- and I hope I'm not out of bounds here - think of the money supply as a large male organ, continuously inflating, and yet, the societal vaginal cavity simply wants more. As the vicious circle of higher returns without real satisfaction continues, the money-organ may seem to be in demand, but in fact even the most inflated capital is unwanted. This is why I suggest that while we engage this mawing abyss for the highest returns, we at the same time fantasize, so to speak, of the safe harbor of capital appreciation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
The aging boss nods agreement.

Ben is gathering papers, readying to leave. He looks up to see George Clair in his doorway.

<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT HALL IN FRONT OF BEN HOOD'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we see that Clair is deftly fondling Hood's attractive secretary as she is seated in the cubicle beside the door to his office. She looks up coyly at Clair, hidden for the moment from Ben's view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben comes out of his office, pulling his coat on. Clair and the secretary pull back, but it's clear that Ben has some sense of what's transpiring between them.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	George, I'm just trying to get a global view of things -- can't just look at the small picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
There's an obvious rivalry between the two of them.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?

</BEN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.

(back to Ben)

	You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- What advice? You never --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --

</HAROLD>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- 73

</BEN>
<HAROLD>

EXT. NEW CANAAN HIGH SCHOOL FIELD. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cool gray afternoon. A group of boys are playing flag football on the field, while two groups of girls are gathered underneath the bleachers at either end, warily smoking c1garettes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wendy, Beth, and a couple of other girls are gathered in one group.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to one of the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	girls gathered in the
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
other group)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She said you licked Dave Brewster's weenie in the third floor bathroom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a liar. I wouldn't touch Dave Brewster's dick if you paid me. It's probably crawling with v.d. after he put it in her, which he did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
The conversation peters out at this point, as the two groups of girls give each other the hairy eyeball from afar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wendy looks through from beneath the bleacher seats onto the field where the boys are playing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of boys break from a huddle, Mikey among them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The quarterback takes the hike and Mikey runs out for a pass. As he runs, his breathing increases in volume, filling his ears, and transforming into the humming sound he'd heard before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The quarterback spots him and throws a long one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs in an oblivion of beautiful white sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ball drops next to him as he continues, in a world of his own, to run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the humming ends and he stops and turns around, to see all the other kids just standing there looking at him. One of them makes a pot-smoking gesture, as if that's the explanation.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(as he returns to the group, ball in hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did anybody hear that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKEY>
<DIRECTION>
The other kids snicker. Wendy looks on, and catches Mikey's eye for a fleeting moment.

<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta go.

She takes hold of her bicycle and pushes off.

Elena and Philip are seated at a booth.

	It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHILIP>
<ELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELENA>
<PHILIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples --

Wendy pulls her bike up to the back, locks it, and walks in.

<DIRECTION>
INT. FIVE AND DIME STORE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wendy moves with a certain amount of stealth through the aisles, arriving at the candy selection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a package of twinkies and slips them into the oversized pockets of her painter's pants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns around, and her breath goes out of her -- an OLD WOMAN has been watching her shoplift. The woman looks sadly at her, but says nothing. Wendy slowly walks past her and out the back door of the store. The woman looks on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIVE AND DIME STORE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she walks her bike onto the sidewalk, Wendy comes across Sandy.

<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? See ya.

She pushes off on her bike.

Sandy gazes after her. He takes his G.I. Joe out of his coat pocket, and points it at her.

	Bam.

Wendy flies along on her bike. It's a desolately beautiful fall day.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. SILVER MEADOWS PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wendy rides by the front gates of the posh grounds of the private psychiatric clinic. A security guard leans against a booth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once a bit past the gate, she gets off her bike and walks it into a grove of trees near the front drive.
</DIRECTION>

Mikey is waiting amid the trees next to his bike as Wendy arrives.

EXT. SILVER MEADOWS SWIMMING POOL. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind is picking up and the light is fading. Mikey and Wendy climb the fence around the pool, which is empty and half-covered in dead leaves and twigs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They climb down into the concrete recess and walk into the deep end, leaning against the far wall of the pool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They each matter-of-factly take their gum out and put it behind their ears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They begin not so much to kiss as to place their tongues in each others' mouths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see them from high above the pool, as the dead leaves swirl lightly around them, Mikey groping under Wendy's poncho.
</DIRECTION>

INT. WILLIAMS GUEST ROOM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A couple are in the final throes of lovemaking. We see Janey Williams's face, more or less enjoying the proceedings. The man gives a final heave and groan, and rolls off to reveal himself to be -- Ben Hood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUMP CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Janey smokes a cigarette. Ben is babbling.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were golfing, and you know, golfing to me is something I'm supposed to enjoy, and I was on the goddam golf team in college, so it's something one would assume I do well -- I used to do well -- but basically these days golfing for me is like hoeing, or plowing.

</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Janey smiles briefly at this.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --

</JANEY>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<JANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.

She wraps a blanket around herself and gets up.

	I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELENA>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.

<DIRECTION>
Ben and Elena take their seats on the sofa. Wendy stands before them holding an enormous trombone, with a music stand and sheet music in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She puffs a series of seemingly disconnected notes in waltz time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she's done, she looks up from the sheet music to her parents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They applaud.

<BEN>

	Why are you so good at math but not in English?

<MIKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not good at math. Just geometry.

He looks at the book.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (drawing out his examples on a piece of paper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's like, you know when they say "two squared"? And you think it means 2 times 2, equals 4? But really they really mean a square. A square with a side of two. And the area of the square is four. Like every time you use the word, like squared, or cubed, it's really space, it's not numbers, it's space. And it's perfect space, but only in your head, because you can't draw a perfect square, like in the material world, but in your mind, you can have perfect space.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know?

As Mikey goes on, we see his geometric doodles, and hear faintly the HUMMING SOUND under his voice.

<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. But I just need some help with my homework.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>

A knock at the door. Jim stands in the doorway with a suitcase in his hand.

<DIRECTION>
Elena and Philip Edwards are having coffee again.
</DIRECTION>
<PHILIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology.

<ELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're saying that Christ is the child, and --

</ELENA>
<PHILIP>

	All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?

	That's right.

</ELENA>
<PHILIP>

	I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELENA>
<PHILIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.

	<DIALOGUE>
	But not too ashamed.

<DIRECTION>
Mikey is reading his English paper before the class.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because of molecules we are connected to the outside world from our bodies. Like when you smell things, because when you smell a smell it's not really a smell, it's a part of the object that has come off of it -- molecules. So when you smell something bad, it's like in a way you're eating it. This is why you should not really smell things, in the same way that you don't eat everything in the world around you - because as a smell, it gets inside of you. So the next time you go into the bathroom after someone else has been there, remember what kinds of molecules you are in fact eating.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKEY>

An embarrassed silence.

INT. SCHOOL MUSIC ROOM. DAY

Band practice. The New Canaan High School band is doing a wind version of a popular rock tune.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front, there's Wendy, in halter top and hip-hugging bell bottoms, incongruously blowing away on her trombone -- this being her one stab at extracurricular activities.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the flute section directly behind her is Sandy, piping away on a tiny piccolo. He sits on a riser slightly elevated above her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He directs downward at Wendy a protracted regard, a look of intense concentration on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SANDY'S POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wendy's backside, her pants pushed outward in the back, affording Sandy a libido-charged view of the top of her bum crack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Push in on a close-up of this cherished abstract landscape, then back to Sandy's furrowed face.

Ben and Harold are at their table again. Lunch is being cleared.

She picks up a lipstick, looks at it, then quietly places it in her pocket.

The middle-aged lady behind the counter watches her leave.

In a wide shot, from across the street, we see Elena leave the store, followed by the shopkeeper who runs behind her and taps her on the shoulder. They converse for a minute, and Elena is accompanied back into the store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the store windows we see her take the lipstick out of her purse. She's obviously distraught -- offering to pay, talking quickly, etc. The shopkeeper is holding a telephone, not yet decided on whether to call her in.

Suddenly Sandy turns beet red, and bursts into tears.

One by one, each member of the Hood carried in a final item to place on the overstuffed Thanksgiving table. Then, one by one, they each silently take their seats.

They look over the table. No one moves.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's great we can all be together. And this Thanksgiving, no hysteria, no yelling, especially with grandpa not here, although we miss him. So let's do it right and actually, Wendy, why don't you say grace. You used to love to say grace, remember.

Janey gives him a rather contemptuous look.

<BEN>

	Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<JANEY>
<DIRECTION>
(almost ironic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANEY>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but, I -- I've been working a lot lately, and -- No, that's not it. I guess we've just been on the verge of saying something, whatever it is, just saying something to each other. On the verge.

Janey gets up.

<JANEY>

She leaves the room.

<DIRECTION>
He leans back onto the bed. Sits back up. Takes a sip of vodka. Puts the glass down. Takes his socks off. He's now in just his jockey shorts and shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faintly, he hears a door close. The front door?
</DIRECTION>

He takes another sip.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MIKEY'S ROOM. CONT'D
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benjamin walks in, an obvious look of distaste.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sorts through a few of Mike's things -- monster eyes that glow in the dark, The Sensuous Woman, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He twirls the garter belt absentmindedly, then tosses it into the back of Mike's closet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GUEST ROOM. CONT'D
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finishes putting his clothes back on. As he reaches for the door, he hears voices and quickly steps back in again.

<DIRECTION>
Teenage voices. Mikey and Wendy.

<MIKEY>

Wendy and Mikey stand in the middle of the semi-lit basement.

But Wendy doesn't seem to hear -- she's drawn to an object lying next to a bean bag chair off to one side.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, what's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
With a look of utter fascination, she picks up a Nixon mask, looking at it as though it were an archeological find.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDY>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow!

She puts the mask on.

<WENDY>

(from behind the mask)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't take my pants off. But I'll touch it. That's as far as it goes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
Mikey looks totally confused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Remaining fully clothed, Wendy loosens Mike's belt, showing no excitement from behind her mask, and lets him climb on top of her for a dry hump.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, a shaft of light hits them from the top of the stairs -- Ben towers above them, looking down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mikey flips over immediately and pulls his clothes together, grabbing a TV Guide as Wendy stands up, the mask still on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Ben descends Mikey, still stuffing his shirt-tail into his pants, pretends to flip through the TV Guide.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think we're doing, dad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I think? I think you're probably touching each other. I think you're touching that reckless jerk-off, for god's sake, and I think he's trying to get into your slacks. I think, at fourteen years of age, that you're getting ready to give up your girlhood --

<MIKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, hang on there, Mr. Hood --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKEY>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you direct a single word at me, Mikey. I don't want to hear it. I'll be speaking with your parents about this situation very soon. Bet your ass on that, son. Young lady?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talking to me, dad?

	I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.

Hood and Wendy walk through a cold drizzling rain.

He looks at her from time to time, then takes her arm.

	Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, he's not serious, he'll end up living off Janey and Jim, you watch. It's just that you develop a sense when you get older, if things are going to work out or if they won't, and sometimes it's not worth the mess...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>

She looks at him. They keep walking. She walks through a puddle.

He stops and lifts her in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll carry you up the drive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
She puts her arms around his neck and he lifts her up.

<DIRECTION>
On her face, as he carries her -- a look of blank but real intimacy.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Libbets, you really shouldn't mix and match, you know with the beer. I'll put 'em back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Libbets reaches into his pocket and pulls out the bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<LIBBETS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh far out, Paulie. Hey look, these expired like five months ago. You think they're better aged?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIBBETS>
<DIRECTION>
She opens up the bottle and takes one out.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you should have just a half.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<LIBBETS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for the advice dad.

She takes the pill.

Paul looks on, thwarted.

INT. HALFORD'S. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben is back at the bar, pouring another tall one. Mark Boland sidles up next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<BOLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Benjie, feeling no pain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOLAND>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As the Indian saying goes, pain is merely an opinion.

</BEN>
<BOLAND>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey -- check it out. Maria Conrad's brought her son.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(walking off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish some of the gang had brought their daughters!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOLAND>
<DIRECTION>
Ben feels a wave of distaste at the joke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks across the room as Maria and her son Neil (stringy hair, acne, tie-dyed turtleneck, patched jeans) are engaging Janey and Philip Edwards in conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIBBETS' APARTMENT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul, Francis, and Libbets sit on the floor, listening to the music blasting at full strength.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Libbets and Francis are obviously on the verge of unconsciousness. Paul regards them with a look of apprehension on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALFORD'S. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neil has now cornered Janey.
</DIRECTION>
<NEIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As Werner says, there is nothing to get. That's It. When you get that there's nothing to get. That's the training, when you ask yourself, the question, "What is is?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIL>
<JANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, this is the training, where they don't let you go to the bathroom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANEY>
<NEIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was the hardest part. But I did it. And you get into some far out shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIBBETS' APARTMENT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Libbets puts a blanket over a sleeping Francis, who's crashed out on the floor in a corner. Francis alternates between snores and various mumbled delirious ravings.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The foot... the foot... toeclipper man...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCIS>
<DIRECTION>
Paul is sitting on the couch, and Libbets comes back and sits at his feet, facing up to him.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess he's just real exhausted from, you know, tests and stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Libbets is herself somewhat in dreamland.
</DIRECTION>
<LIBBETS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIBBETS>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<LIBBETS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah but you don't even know me really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIBBETS>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.

</PAUL>
<LIBBETS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIBBETS>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<LIBBETS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIBBETS>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --

</PAUL>
<LIBBETS>

	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<LIBBETS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIBBETS>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<LIBBETS>
<DIRECTION>
(consciousness fading fast)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm so wasted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIBBETS>
<DIRECTION>
Her head bobs and weaves, her eyes close, and suddenly her head falls forward with a whoosh toward the couch -- smack dab between Paul's legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She begins to snore instantly, her open mouth nuzzling into his crotch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul doesn't move, doesn't even breathe. Then, slowly, he leans his back into the couch, without shifting the rest of his body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks as though he has simultaneously won the lottery and received a lobotomy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALFORD'S. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd's a bit thinner than before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Dot Halford begins calling out for everyone's attention, a few couples make their last-minute way to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK everyone. We have a little business to attend to now. So everyone who'd like to stay, please gather in the living room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOT>
<DIRECTION>
She scoops up the bowl and places it on a high end table which has been put in the middle of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready to go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not going anywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELENA>

Elena waves at Janey Williams, who is standing across the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Janey looks back without expression.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIBBETS' APARTMENT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Libbets and Paul in the same position whence last we saw them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul delicately leans to one side of the couch and picks up a phone. He dials a number.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT:

<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.

</PAUL>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.

<PAUL>

</PAUL>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have plans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
Paul hangs up the phone and looks down at Libbets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Libbets' Allman Brothers tape has run out. The machine makes a repeated clicking sound as the take up real continues to circle. The only other sound is the noise of the wind and rain lashing against the apartment's windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOOD HOUSE. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wendy emerges from the house and gets on her bike, but the ice makes it too slippery. The storm is now in full swing. She gets off and walks.

Wendy walks, barely keeping her balance in the wind.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HALFORD'S NIGHT

All the couples are now gathered for the key selection process, men on one side of the room, women on the other. The storm can be heard outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DOT>

	Well, what shall the order be, alphabetical? In order of appearance?

</DOT>

	Golf handicap! Lowest handicap does the honors.

	Oh I'll go first, damn it. Let's just line up and get it over with.

Maria chooses Stephen Earle. Hands the keys to him. A smattering of applause as she takes his arm and they leave.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIE_EARLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good luck!
	</DIALOGUE>

A few more couplings.

JUMP CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
Helen Worthington approaches the bowl. Helen Worthington has the size and shape of a sumo wrestler.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a nervous shifting of weight on the male side of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen delicately reaches into the bowl. Her hands emerge with a key chain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George Clair steps forward, obviously depressed, as a collective sigh of relief goes up from behind him. Ben looks on, momentarily triumphant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elena smiles to herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUMP CUT TO:

The Gadds choose each other.

	Oh, I think not.

Mr. Gadd smiles as they leave, obviously happy to go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, only Mark Boland, Neil Conrad, Janey and Jim Williams, Rob and Dot Halford, Sari Steele, Benjamin and Elena.
</DIRECTION>
<DOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Getting down to the wire!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOT>
<DIRECTION>
Elena steps forward. Benjamin is obviously agitated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on Janey's hands selecting -- away from Ben's equine key ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lifts up another key ring -- Neil Conrad, the teenager.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hands the self-important-looking Neil his keys and they turn to go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim Williams smiles mysteriously to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben suddenly lurches forward, semi-drunkenly, trying to separate Neil from Janey.

He backs off, ashamed, and, taking a step backwards, trips over the coffee table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark Boland helps lift him up.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry... maybe I should... the bathroom?

Dot follows Mark Boland down the hall behind Ben.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, it's just Elena and Jim Williams, and Sari Steele and Rob Halford.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB_HALFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(taking Sari's arm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, we didn't put our keys in at all. But you won't spread it around? It's my party, and Dot isn't... hey, we're just going to slip upstairs for a while. You folks like a cup of coffee or something before we go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB_HALFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Elena and Jim look at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<ELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rob, we'll fix it for ourselves. You two go and get acquainted. We'll let ourselves out the front door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELENA>
<DIRECTION>
Jim and Elena stand there alone.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<ELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELENA>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the bowl and dips her hand in. Two sets are left. One, her own, she avoids. She takes out Jim's keys and walks across the room, handing them to him.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<ELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELENA>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somehow it was different in my imagination when I thought about it. Actually, I didn't think about it at all, really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
They sit down on the sofa.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want coffee or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<ELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELENA>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<ELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELENA>
<DIRECTION>
They both look at their hands.
</DIRECTION>
<ELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELENA>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<ELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELENA>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
But they still walk around turning off lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the hallway, Elena looks a bit mournfully at the light seeping from underneath the bathroom door. She hears the sound of running water from inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she goes into a sideroom and joins Jim. They pick up their coats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HALFORD HOUSE. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Elena and Jim walk outside into the freezing, pelting rain.

Covering their faces, they jog to his car, an oversized Cadillac. A thick glaze of ice forms on his windshield.

INT. JIM'S CADILLAC. NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
They climb in.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to have to defrost this thing for a while.

</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
He turns on the ignition, and the vents start to blow cold air at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leans over and kisses her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do these seats go back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELENA>
<DIRECTION>
That starts it. He jumps at her, unbuckling her and unzipping himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They tangle uncomfortably for a few seconds. And then, comically, he's in her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a groan, it's over in a flash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim pulls himself off, readjusting his pants.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was awful, really awful. I'm so sorry, Elena.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Elena has somehow worked herself into the cavity of the glove compartment, and is trying to figure out how to extricate herself.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<ELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.

</ELENA>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --

<ELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we can talk about it.

She sits on the toilet next to him, stroking his hair.

He sits, accepting and quiet.

Wendy wanders into the living room, then climbs the steps. The sound of the wind and the darkness begin to scare her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes into Mikey's room -- it's even more of a disaster zone than usual.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees on the wall his dark-light poster of the 12 (sexual) positions of the zodiac.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She notices the black garter belt on the floor, and picks it up, absentmindedly swinging it in her hand as she walks out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks back down the stairs and into the kitchen, leaving the garter belt on the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the refrigerator, grabs a jar of peanut butter, and scoops some up in her finger. As she puts her finger in her mouth --

Paul and Libbets, still frozen in the same position. Finally, Paul gently pushes Libbets' head back.

It slides off his leg and, as Paul lurches forward in a failed attempt to grab it, Libbets flops backwards, her head hitting the carpet with a dull but decidedly loud thump.

He runs over to a side table and sees the clock: 11:10.

<PAUL>

</PAUL>

He grabs his comic books and runs for the door.

<DIRECTION>
INT. TAXI. NIGHT

The driver impassively inches down Park Avenue.

<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit oh shit. C'mon!

<DIRECTION>
INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul sprints down the platform just as the doors are closing. He barely makes it into the train.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul walks through the nearly empty train car and finds a seat. He pulls his Fantastic Four comic book out of his coat pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALFORD KITCHEN. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben makes his way to the kitchen, pours himself a cup of coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees himself reflected in the black glass of the cabinets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SANDY'S ROOM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sandy and Wendy are sitting on the floor. He grabs his G.I. Joe.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check this out. He's supposed to talk all kinds of stuff, but he's like malfunctioned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls the dog tag on the doll, and G.I. Joe emits a plastic macho voice.
</DIRECTION>
<G_I_JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mayday! Mayday! Get this message back to base!
	</DIALOGUE>
</G_I_JOE>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Same thing. Again and again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Wendy takes the doll and yanks the cord.
</DIRECTION>
<G_I_JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mayday! Mayday! Get this message back to base!
	</DIALOGUE>
</G_I_JOE>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gonna get a lot colder tonight, I predict. Probably a blackout. Do you have candles in your house? I know where the candles are, and I have my own flashlight. Over there. Also, I know where every emergency exit is on this floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>
<DIRECTION>
During the course of his monologue, as Wendy looks on, Sandy calmly ties a noose for his doll.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This knot's called a bowline.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the noose over the doll's head, as Wendy holds him.
</DIRECTION>
<G_I_JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mayday! Mayday!
	</DIALOGUE>
</G_I_JOE>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's hang him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Sandy drapes the noose over the edge of a dresser drawer. G.I. Joe dangles. They both look at him in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The silence continues.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
She takes him down and lays him flat on the bed. And then begins to remove his clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sandy looks on, desirous.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(noticing his lack of anatomy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It looks like someone got to his private parts before us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Communist Viet Cong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They left it in the jungle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
They speak with high seriousness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wendy slides up on the bed where Sandy sits, a pillow on his lap, and one by one, with exaggerated slowness, she removes her snowboots, as if they were stiletto heels.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I get into your bed?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
Sandy begins to shake.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
Sandy begins to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just -- it's just --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>
<DIRECTION>
She takes his hand, and they walk out of the room and down the hall, into the guest room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GUEST ROOM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wendy and Sandy enter. She sees the vodka bottle on the dresser.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want a drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vodka?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never tasted the stuff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
She fills the glass to the brim and hands the bottle to Sandy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They clink and each toss back a sip -- Wendy almost the entire glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sandy coughs and gags, but swallows.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
He does.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It feels warm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One more shot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>
<DIRECTION>
They drink.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Under the covers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
Under they go, and soon every layer of clothing emerges.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
(feeling her way)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get 'em off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
Sandy begins to laugh, and soon Wendy joins him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They roll around on top of each other for a while.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
Sandy shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They didn't tell you this stuff yet? What planet do you live on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
Sandy doesn't answer, but climbs back on top of her and kisses her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's nice. Are you drunk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. How do I know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
Sandy rolls off her and lies on his back.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think I'm spinning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>
<DIRECTION>
They cuddle up together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He yawns. She yawns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SILVER MEADOW. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mikey walks along the edge of the empty pool in the rain. He climbs up on the diving board and bounces lightly on it, but then gets off and stands, looking down at the pool again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SILVER MEADOW. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mikey walks across the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The storm has let up. Mikey walks along. With a running start, he slides on the ice down a hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks back up and slides again, hollering with joy. He is an image of a tiny yet absolute and positive freedom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The streetlights sputter on, then off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILLIAMS GUEST ROOM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sandy and Wendy lie asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A power line is down. It hisses and HUMS -- a humming very much like the humming Mikey has been hearing earlier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The humming takes on the same transcendent tonality to which Mikey has become so accustomed at such moments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mikey sits down on a metal street guardrail, to ponder the sound and the snaking coil of electricity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A strange look of almost religious wonder overcomes his face, as the power line connects to the guardrail.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Glued by an electrical pulse to the rail, he shakes as the current flows through him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a minute, his body slumps and slides down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Paul sits reading on he moving train, the lights inside begin to sputter, and the train begins to slow. After a few moments, the train grinds to a halt, and Paul and his few fellow late night passengers are left in near total dark, with only the light of an emergency exit sign above Paul's head to light the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train is eerily silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOOD CAR. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben drives home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An emergency vehicle, lights flashing, crawls by Ben's car. He drives on slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF WILLIAMS HOUSE. PRE-DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim and Elena arrive on foot.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<ELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Maybe coffee.

INT. WILLIAMS KITCHEN. PRE-DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
He walks into the kitchen. The pipes have begun to burst. There's a water leak running down the walls, forming a puddle on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elena has walked into the kitchen behind him. She leans against the counter, picking up the garter belt without thinking for a second, then putting it back down.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh well. Why don't you put on some dry socks -- and we've got some rain boots in the guest closet back there. Last room upstairs -- back of the hall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Elena climbs the stairs in her bare feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILLIAMS GUEST ROOM. CONT'D
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elena opens the door, and discovers Wendy and Sandy asleep. She stands before the bed, and gazes down on them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look almost angelic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wendy, sensing her presence in the room, opens her eyes, slowly coming out of sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<ELENA>
<DIRECTION>
(heartbroken, softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get dressed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELENA>
<DIRECTION>
Elena walks out of the room, back to the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wendy gets out of bed quietly, leaving Sandy sleeping peacefully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him lovingly, and tucks the blanket back up around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILLIAMS KITCHEN. DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elena and Jim are drinking coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<ELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should let him sleep.

Wendy enters. She looks inquisitively at the two adults.

<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's dad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOOD CAR. DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben continues to drive slowly. He looks out his side window, and sees something. He puts on his brakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET. DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben gets out of the car, and stands on the top of an icy embankment. In a clump of bushes is the orange glow of a parka.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks hesitantly toward it. Mike's body lies face down in the wet ice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben leans down and turns the body over, then stands back in amazement and saddened shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands there for a moment, then picks Mike's body up, carrying him over the hill and onto the street. We see now that he is parked just a short block from the Williams's house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He bypasses his car and walks directly down the street toward the house. The effort is obviously enormous. He falls from time to time, then gets back up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN. PRE-DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Various passengers asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul, hunched up in his seat under the faint emergency exit light, cold. He reads his comic book by the light of the emergency exit.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"DON'T YOU SEE, SUE? HE WAS TOO POWERFUL... IF HIS ENERGY HAD CONTINUED TO BUILD, HE WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WORLD!"
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the lights begin to flicker on and the hum of the train's engines returns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The conductor enters the car, blasting forth in his classic nasal train conductor voice.
</DIRECTION>
<CONDUCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning ladies and gentlemen --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONDUCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
On Paul, squinting in the harsh light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRAIN BRIDGE. PRE-DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train moves slowly through a suburban, semi-forested landscape. On the street below the bridge, an emergency highway crew is removing a fallen tree, their trucks aglow in flashing yellow lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILLIAMS KITCHEN. DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elena pours Wendy a cup of coffee. They're both in their coats.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like coffee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<ELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll warm you up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELENA>
<DIRECTION>
Elena sits next to her. They both raise their cups and sip the coffee, not noticing the simultaneity of their movements.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GUEST ROOM. DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim watches the sleeping Sandy, picks up the half-empty bottle of vodka, pours himself a drink. The noise wakes Sandy up. Jim sits down on the bed at his feet and takes a sip.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Jim looks at him.

Elena and Wendy hear a hollering from outside, get up to see what it is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elena and Wendy come out the front door, as Ben lays Mikey's body onto the ground before the front steps.
</DIRECTION>
<ELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ben?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELENA>
<DIRECTION>
He's too breathless to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stand there, looking down at Mikey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind Elena and Wendy, Jim appears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes softly by them toward the body of his son.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jim -- he was just up -- in Silver Lane -- I think maybe -- a power line --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Jim picks up his son.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He carries him silently into the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sandy, now standing inside the foyer, pushes himself back against the wall as they pass, without expression.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, from outside, the Hoods can hear Jim's wailing.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --

She turns back up the front steps and gently goes in --

<DIRECTION>
INT. WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM. CONT'D
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
on the living room floor, Jim is hugging Mike's body, his shoulders shaking uncontrollably, sobbing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wendy walks and stands next to Sandy, who is filled momentarily with a brief inexplicable rush of anger toward her -- but she takes him and gives him an awkward, childlike hug, then turns and runs out the door, joining Ben and Elena on the driveway. Sandy watches her go, his face wet with tears.

Elena, Wendy, and Ben reach the car and get in. The car starts and drives off.

There are more crews out cleaning up the storm's debris and fixing the power lines as they drive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONRAIL STATION. EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train slowly pulls in. The Hood family walks down to the end of the platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train doors open, and Paul, tired and a bit cramped, emerges. He sees his family gathered at the other end of the platform, and walks to them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stand, silent, even dignified, awaiting him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he joins them they all walk silently to the car and get in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOOD CAR. EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sunlight floods in and temporarily blinds Ben as he starts the engine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He squints, his eyes tearing a bit from the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around, first at his wife, then at his two children sitting in the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns off the engine. Quietly, he begins to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to the back seat.

<BEN>
