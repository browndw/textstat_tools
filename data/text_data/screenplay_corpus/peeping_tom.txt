:SC: PEEPING TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screen remains dark for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the darkness WE HEAR the film's THEME MUSIC - a gentle whirring purring noise. Nothing to be alarmed about. It might be a small contented motor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A DESERTED STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT of the solitary figure of a WOMAN standing professionally alone at the end of the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a bright, still night. We can HEAR the Woman whistling 'Stardust' merrily to herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA TRACKS around her. A Man's footsteps are overlaid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR the Man start to whistle 'Stardust' under his breath - haltingly at first, then in time with the Woman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we approach, she glances at us over her shoulder - then turns round for a better look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her whistling stops - so, at the same moment, does the man's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of DORA - a plump, attractive brunette - still young enough to need two glances at the customers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles at us - and is pleased with the reception. She hesitates for a long moment, weighing us up carefully... and then - half defiantly, half expecting to be laughed at.
</DIRECTION>
<DORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll be two quid...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORA>
<DIRECTION>
Evidently we have two quid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She beams with relief - throws her fur over her shoulders, jerks her head towards the right - and sets off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA TRACKS after her. Overlaid is the sound of the man's footsteps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dora resumes her whistling. So, under his breath, does the man who is following her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A DESERTED STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wider street than the last - but just as empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dora sways her way towards a small house. CAMERA FOLLOWS at a respectful distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS from Dora's hips to an overflowing dustbin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of a man's hand throwing something into the dustbin. It is an empty packet marked Kodak Film. CAMERA PANS to Dora's house. It stands next to a chemist shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dora climbs the few steps which lead to her front door - glances round at us encouragingly - then unlocks the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY OF DORA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She switches on a light - and hurries up a flight of stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA TRACKS after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She changes her tune to 'Goodnight Sweetheart'... and so - under his breath - does the Man who is following her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A woman with hair like a two-toned car comes down the stairs, winks at Dora - looks at us for a moment with great curiosity... winks... then passes out of camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dora reaches the landing - we are close behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LANDING OF DORA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dora unlocks the door of her room - and goes inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DORA'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She switches on the light, throws her fur onto a chair, lights the gas fire then turns round.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Dora. She holds out her hand-smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly. There is a gentle whirring purring sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA HOLDS ON Dora - she is staring at something with great curiosity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It turns quickly to bewilderment - and the bewilderment to fear. She steps back from CAMERA - but CAMERA won't have it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dora is now staring at something in horror - she opens her mouth to scream - a shadow falls across her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound purrs on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

BLACK AND WHITE FILM SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The solitary figure of Dora standing professionally alone at the end of a street. WE SEE her turn towards CAMERA - and smile at us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are watching her on a 16mm screen - projected in BLACK AND WHITE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK to show the surround in natural colour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARK'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A darkened room in natural COLOUR. The movie screen images are in BLACK AND WHITE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can SEE the back of a Man's head as he bends intently over a projector. He is watching Dora on the screen. He is breathing quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Dora's hips waggling their way home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Man raises his head, so that we cannot see the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he lowers it again, we see the Woman with the two- toned hair winking at Dora... then we see Dora throwing her fur onto a chair - and turning towards us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE her staring at something in bewilderment... then backing away from CAMERA in fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE HEAR the Man breathing as if at the end of a very long race.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Dora opens her mouth to scream, and a shadow falls across her face - the title:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PEEPING TOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blots out what is happening to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OTHER CREDITS FOLLOW... behind them we can see Dora's hands pushing something away.

EXT. A PARK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is very dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of a stack of deck chairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two forms behind it - a MAN'S and a WOMAN'S.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are intertwined and motionless... suddenly a brilliant shaft of light is trained onto them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Overlaid is a gentle, whirring sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS quickly to a nearby tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of the lens of a cine-camera - the motor purring... a blinding spotlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS to the couple - the whirring of the camera is overlaid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Man leaps up - shielding his eyes against the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He advances towards the tree.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you peeping...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The spotlight goes out. There is the sound of footsteps running away — and the night is at peace again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now WE SEE who DIRECTED the picture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:

It is standing in the roadway outside Dora's house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE it through the finder of a small cine-camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREETS BY DORA'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A crowd has gathered outside the house - and we are watching them from a corner of the street (ALWAYS THROUGH THE FINDER- MATTE).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE several Policemen holding back the crowd as two Ambulance Men hurry into the house, carrying an empty stretcher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gentle, whirring sound is overlaid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE children staring curiously into the empty ambulance - and a group of Women talking excitedly to a Reporter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of a SMALL MAN looking at us curiously as he approaches (FILLING THE SCREEN WITHIN THE MATTE).

<DIRECTION>
The finder is lowered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of a Young Man (MARK) sighting a cine-camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lowers the camera - and turns politely to his interrogator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He seems to have slight difficulty informing his words.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beg your pardon?

</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
The Ambulance Men come out of the house carrying the stretcher... there is a body on it covered by a sheet. Mark raises his cine-camera and photographs them. He photographs the ambulance as it drives off. He photographs the Policemen dispersing the crowd. He photographs his Interrogator, who gladly poses for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he slings his camera over his shoulder, and strolls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Dora, smiling happily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her photograph is on the front page of a newspaper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above it is a caption: BRUTALLY MURDERED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK - to show sexy magazines alongside the newspaper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A NEWSAGENT'S SHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark is staring at a newspaper in the window of a small newsagent's shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances distastefully at an array of film magazines - showing actresses showing everything - then hurries into the shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEWSAGENT'S SHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A plump, bald-headed Man stares at Mark.

Mr. Peters hesitates, drumming his fingers on the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He starts to drum his fingers on a shelf.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_PETERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark... I've a question for you.

He stops drumming his fingers. So, at that moment, does Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_PETERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which magazines sell the most copies?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PETERS>
<MARK>

<MR_PETERS>
	<DIALOGUE>

Overlaid is the sound of the door opening.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_PETERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look busy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PETERS>
<DIRECTION>
Mark busies himself sorting some newspapers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A whole row of Doras smile up at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS to doorway of the shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ELDERLY GENTLEMAN is standing there.

<MR_PETERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly, sir - anything else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PETERS>
<DIRECTION>
The Elderly Gentleman hesitates - glancing at Mark's back. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<ELDERLY_GENTLEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... er... have been told by a friend that you... er... have some views for sale?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELDERLY_GENTLEMAN>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PETERS>
<DIRECTION>
From under the counter he produces a thick book. Mark turns round.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From his POV WE SEE the Elderly Gentleman open the book. He - er- seems - er - more than a little interested.
</DIRECTION>
<ELDERLY_GENTLEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I, er... how much each?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELDERLY_GENTLEMAN>
<MR_PETERS>

</ELDERLY_GENTLEMAN>
<MR_PETERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To you - five pounds, sir...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PETERS>
<DIRECTION>
The Elderly Gentleman hesitates. Mr. Peters turns over a page... and the Elderly Gentleman almost turns over with it.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_PETERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell you what, sir. Four pounds ten - and I'll throw in The Times and Telegraph... how's that?
	</DIALOGUE>

<ELDERLY_GENTLEMAN>

He holds open the door for the Elderly Gentleman, and watches him leave.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_PETERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He won't be doing the crossword tonight!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PETERS>
<DIRECTION>
He turns triumphantly to Mark.

<MR_PETERS>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those pictures he chose... were all yours!

<DIRECTION>
(in a very different tone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this is yours too...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PETERS>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up a postcard - holds it towards Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_PETERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's what I want to talk to you about. It's a clever picture - because you're a clever lad... but, Mark...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pathetically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PETERS>

Mark looks at the postcard in silence.

He opens a door at the far end of the room. We catch a glimpse of a winding staircase. He starts to climb it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REAR OF NEWSAGENT'S SHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the top of the staircase is a door. Mark and his camera trudge towards it. The door opens suddenly. A vivacious young redhead - Milly - pokes her head round. She has a towel round her shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well look who's here! Cecil Beaton!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLY>
<DIRECTION>
From REVERSE ANGLE WE SEE Mark venture a shy smile at Milly. Milly opens the door impatiently.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, sonny... make us famous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Through the half-open door we catch a glimpse of a second Girl (LORRAINE). She is staring out of a window, her back to camera. She is naked except for a shawl draped round her shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark enters the room... the door begins to close. CAMERA TRACKS towards the door. On the threshold of the room, a hood is thrown over our faces. THE SCREEN BLACKS OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the darkness WE HEAR Milly's voice.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you read about that girl who was murdered last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STUDIO ABOVE NEWSAGENT'S - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are with Mark under the hood of an antiquated camera. Through the ground-glass of the camera WE SEE a SMALL INVERTED IMAGE of Milly.

<MILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The same thing nearly happened to me!
	</DIALOGUE>

We hear Lorraine's voice - muffled, and very far away.

The SMALL INVERTED IMAGE of Milly peers anxiously into the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	can you fix it so the bruises don't show?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLY>
<DIRECTION>
The ground-glass camera begins travelling slowly down Milly's back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Milly. She is on a couch, lying on her stomach at a slightly oblique angle. All that WE CAN SEE are her face and naked shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From Milly's POV WE SEE Mark under the hood of an antiquated camera.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, can you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Mark's voice is MUFFLED under the hood.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark's toes - in sandals, next to the tripod of the camera. They start to wriggle.

CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine. We watch her in profile as she stares out of the window - clutching her shawl. She has outstandingly beautiful features.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He is standing by the side of the camera, studying us thoughtfully. He is holding a remote- control switch panel in his hand. He clicks off several lights and then switches several others on... then he ducks back under the hood.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There he goes again! What have you got under there? A girlfriend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLY>
<DIRECTION>
We join Mark under the hood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE a small INVERTED IMAGE of Milly on the ground-glass. Her shoulders are now white and glistening, her spine caressed by shadows. She is staring into the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose you have a girlfriend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLY>
<DIRECTION>
He adjusts the focus. We can see more clearly the contempt on Milly's face.

<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Milly.

</MARK>
<MILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Lorraine clutches her shawl tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, love. Don't be shy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Lorraine turns round.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The left side of her face is classical in its beauty. She has a hare lip, which twists and distorts the whole of the right side. Her eyes are large - and beautiful - and defiant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark looking at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine.
</DIRECTION>
<LORRAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>

CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine. Beautiful in profile.
</DIRECTION>
<LORRAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose you'll fix my bruises too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORRAINE>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MARK>
<MILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You needn't be shy... of me... it's my first time too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine's eyes - puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<LORRAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORRAINE>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In front of eyes... like...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to go on - but words are a foreign language to him.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...eyes... as full of...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
In a sudden rush:
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lorraine - let my camera tell you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine standing very still — looking at him in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milly shrugs and reaches for the coffee pot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Overlaid is the gentle purring of a cine-camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA LINGERS on the dark liquid being poured into a cup.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:

<DIRECTION>
Whisky being poured into a glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING - TOWARDS SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hand filling the glass is a woman's (MRS. STEPHENS). She is sitting in a high-backed chair, and we cannot see her face. Over her shoulder we watch a party in progress. A group of Young people have surrounded someone to whom they are singing:
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_PEOPLE>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you,
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_PEOPLE>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA TRACKS towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of TONY HUNTER, a well-built youngster in his middle twenties.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy birthday... dear Helen
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
He obviously means it.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	happy birthday to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of 'dear HELEN'. A sensitive, intelligent, and extremely attractive girl, who — as the encircling youngsters now inform us in song - is:
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_PEOPLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty-one today, She's twenty-one today, She's got the key of the door, She's never been twenty-one before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_PEOPLE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of the glass by Mrs. Stephens' side. It is half empty. An elderly lady leans across to her. She is Mrs. Partridge, slightly high on a glass of sherry.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_PARTRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must be very proud of your daughter, Mrs. Stephens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_PARTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Stephens grunts. Someone switches on a gramophone and the young couples start dancing at once. Tony hurries up to Helen.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
Helen goes towards him. A YOUNG MAN calls out sharply:
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
He is pointing at something out of camera. All heads - except Mrs. Stephens' - follow the direction of his gaze. Mrs. Stephens continues to sit motionless in the high-backed chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS to the window. Mark is standing there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking at Mark. We watch him over her shoulder - Tony's arm encircling it.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's that chap from upstairs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - EVENING - LOW SUN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chap from upstairs presses his face to the window. From his POV WE SEE Helen's eyes looking at him - the key of the door in them - looking at him, not staring. Suddenly the rest comes into focus - Tony's arm around Helen's shoulder... the high-backed chair in the foreground with the back of that motionless head... a young couple giggling as they stare at him. Mark steps away, and the CAMERA PULLS BACK with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We catch a glimpse of the house - large, sprawling, but with a touch of quality about it, in a quiet, unpretentious street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark hurries towards a side entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING

<DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Tony - frowning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS to Mrs. Stephens' glass... the hand which refills it has begun to tremble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REAR OF HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights are on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE FOLLOW Mark (and his camera) along a small passage which leads to the hall. The sound of a dance record can be heard. Mark starts to whistle it under his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over his shoulder we see a staircase, and beyond it the door of Helen's sitting room. The sound of Helen's party fills the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark reaches the staircase. There is the sound of a door opening. Helen's voice is overlaid:
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Mark hesitates, then turns round.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen - smiling at him.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how many times we've passed each other on the stairs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Mark looks at her as if he does.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... but tonight I'm determined at least to say hello to you! So hello!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Her directness is natural, consistent and very hard to resist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark - smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Helen Stephens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She glances with unconcealed interest at the camera over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm having a party - and the other tenants are there... And a few friends. We'd like you to join us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Mark...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hallo, Mark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She holds out her hand... he takes it gently.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please come in... you'll meet the others who live here, and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, but... work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She glances again at his camera.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I hope to keep it going for hours yet... so when you've finished why not look in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She realizes that this is not the happiest of phrases.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Mark?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
He hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS to Helen's door. Tony stands there.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darling, your cake - everyone's waiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark - looking at her.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy Birthday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He hurries up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen. She stares after him for a moment. Then returns thoughtfully to her party.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screen remains dark for a moment. We are with Mark in a darkened room. He is giving a film show - and we are the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARK'S DARK-ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His cine-projector points straight at us. A flickering light shines in our eyes. We can see him crouching behind the projector.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark leans forward, watching the screen intently... Perspiration trickles down his forehead. He is breathing very quickly. The sounds of the party seep up from downstairs - music, laughter, and a Girl's yelp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a knock on the door. Mark does not hear it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS to the door of the room. It is blacked-out like a photographic dark-room. The knock is repeated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He switches off the projector instantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS to an open cupboard in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of the shelves. They are stacked with spools of film.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA travels slowly over these spools. WE SEE Mark's hand add two more to the collection; his Voice is overlaid.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...minute...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He closes the cupboard door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark comes out of the dark-room behind him - the light is kept out by a baffle and a curtain. He has a pleasant, normally untidy bedsitting room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wipes his handkerchief across his forehead - then hurries to the door. He opens it - Helen is standing there.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope I'm not disturbing you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark - shaking his head, smiling shyly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew you wouldn't come down... so I've brought you this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She holds out a plate on which is a piece of birthday cake.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the plate.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... very much...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mustn't keep you from your work
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to go.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to offer you a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
She turns round.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Mark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd adore some water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	a hostess can't drink water at her own party, it looks like a hint to the guests.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you... would you... like to come in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Mark...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She steps over the threshold. The door closes behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking round the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark's voice is overlaid.

	There's milk... if you'd like some?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very much... if you can spare it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Helen glances towards the inner room. He holds out a glass of milk to her.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Mark...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She drinks it with relish. He watches her in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a pleasant room... and you've another inside?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long have you lived here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All my life.

</MARK>

She looks at him in surprise.

</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my father's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mean I've at last found out who our landlord is? Your father?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well - no... he's dead!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the landlord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him in astonishment.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you walk about as if you haven't paid the rent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.

</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's his house - and I'll never sell it... but I can't afford the upkeep, so I let rooms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her anxiously.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... if I charge too much, tell me and I'll tell the agents.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The rent's very reasonable, but don't say anything to the others or you'll have no peace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peace...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark, what do you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(slowly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most of the time, I work in a film studio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On the photographic side, I'll bet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope to be a film director... very soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How exciting.

</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>

<HELEN>

<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I came in were you looking at some films?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Yes.

</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to see them...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know I'm being rude... but I really would like to see them...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she smiles.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...it would be a birthday present... from you to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Mark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I suppose you're too busy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She puts down the glass, turns to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you... would you... like to see them now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
She turns round. He is standing by the entrance to the inner room.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll... go first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He leads the way - she follows. For a moment the screen is in darkness. A dark-room darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE INNER ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can HEAR - faintly — the dance music from downstairs. There is a click - and the walls are suddenly bathed in diffused light, throwing the room into delicate shadow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking round in amazement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As certain events of possible interest are to take place in this room, here, in detail, is what amazes Helen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is the product of three rooms which have been knocked into one. It is very large and extremely well constructed (as we are soon to learn, it was originally a laboratory). One half of the room is used for processing, and the other half for filming - and for trade shows. The two halves are lined by long shelves upon which are perched all shapes and sizes of cameras, their spectacles glinting in the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the processing half two benches (a 'dry' bench and a 'wet' bench) face each other against opposite walls. There are three sinks above the 'wet' bench and an outburst of equipment above the 'dry'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This part of the room is lit by two dark-room lamps frowning in the ceiling above the benches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other part of the room has a window at the far end of it. Heavy drapes are putted across it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark's projector rests on a small table in front of the 16mm screen. Two banks of floods and a variety of spots light this part of the room. There is a small control panel on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some of the equipment is ancient - but none of it is old. All of it glistens with the affection of its owner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is absolutely nothing in the room to alarm anyone except an adult... the kind who starts to wonder who paid for it all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He stands by the lighting panel, watching Helen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From his POV WE SEE her brushing the hair out of her eyes as she looks slowly round. He brushes the hair out of his. For a moment she turns her back to him. He presses a switch on the wall. A gentle light ripples through the back of Helen's hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT of Helen. She turns to him. She is very nearly at a loss for words.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is so... well - so many things... but above all - it's so...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a final look round.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...completely unexpected!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him searchingly.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is all of it yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean... is it designed by you? Furnished by you? Tell me about this room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It belonged to my father
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scientist...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then this equipment was his?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sold his to buy it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it seems to be so... technical.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him with renewed interest.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If this is where you work, I can't wait to see what you work at.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark - in difficulties.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't know what to show you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... what were you looking at when I interrupted you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her thoughtfully.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses to the corner cupboard - opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of the cupboard. WE SEE Mark's hand reach for a spool of film... then hesitate, poised above another spool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen - watching with interest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mark. He closes the cupboard, and turns round... there is a spool of film in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks slowly towards his projector... he seems — for the moment — to have forgotten she is there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen - watching him thread the film into the projector.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>

	This is the first... twenty-first birthday present... I'll ever have given.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the first I've ever asked for...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
He places a chair a few feet away from the screen - and, with an oddly courteous bow, beckons her into it. She sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He looks at her intently for a moment - then turns off the lights. Over Helen's shoulder We can just make out the empty screen. Mark switches on the projector.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen - the light flickering on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark staring at Helen's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen. WE SEE her expression of surprise. Over Mark's shoulder WE SEE the surprise growing. Over Helen's shoulder we see the screen. We are looking at a small boy. He is lying in his bed asleep. Although the print is old, we can see that he is a remarkably handsome boy.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark, what a beautiful child.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
The boy turns restlessly in his sleep... one of his pillows falls to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course it is! Then who took this film?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My Father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
A light - as if from a small torch — starts to shine on the child's eyes. He moves restlessly.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a wonderful idea...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
The light plays on the child's left eye, then on his right. It is growing brighter.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll be able to show it to your own chi...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
The child wakes up suddenly. He stares at something... then starts to scream.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must have had a bad dream...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark watching her in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...but what was that light? ...The camera, I suppose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Mark does not answer. The small screen is filled with the face of the screaming, terrified child.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(Mark's father now tries a not altogether successful dissolve:)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE NOW SEE the little boy standing in front of a garden wall. He tries hard to climb to the top of the wall, but falls over. Helen laughs. Mark watches her in silence. Small Mark tries again - and again - to scale the wall... At last he succeeds.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever are you after?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE the little boy lying flat on the wall staring at something... rapt, motionless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cine-camera which is taking this picture now tracks rather clumsily towards the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH ANGLE SHOT over the wall of what is fascinating young Mark - A man and woman are lying on the ground, kissing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CINE-CAMERA PANS - again rather clumsily - to young Mark... staring intently.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naughty boy I hope you were spanked!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen. It suddenly occurs to her.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... but, Mark... what a strange thing for your father to photograph.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Switch off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She stares again at that lonely figure perched on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
The small screen begins to dissolve ...so does the large one.

INT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over Mrs. Stephens' shoulder WE SEE the party in progress. The glass by her side is full again. Tony is dancing with an attractive blonde.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tony!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
He turns round.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me, Mrs. Stephens?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
The head nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tony advances reluctantly towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over Tony's shoulder WE SEE a powerfully built and once lovely woman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is so perpetually drunk as almost to be sober. The few movements she makes are slow - deliberate - and give nothing away. The voice articulates so carefully that the slur scarcely shows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fact that she is blind almost helps to conceal the fact that she is drunk. Her sightless eyes stare out the camera as Tony reaches her.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want a word with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen's eyes. The light from the projector flickering into them.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate people who chatter in films - but there's so much I want to ask.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE INNER ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is leaning forward, her face cupped in her hand, watching the small screen intently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark. His face is cupped in his hand as he watches her intently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over Helen's shoulder WE SEE Mark in the making.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The child is again asleep... this time he is being photographed from the head of the bed - the CAMERA POINTING STRAIGHT DOWN AT HIS FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beam of light starts to shine onto his eyes, first onto the left, then onto the right.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(in a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Mark looks at her in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy moves restlessly, then turns over onto his face, pulling the bedclothes round him. His right hand is limp on the pillow. The light shines for a moment on this hand, then goes out. Helen half turns towards Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark, this isn't some kind of jo...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Her attention is suddenly riveted on the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(in a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Helen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Over Helen's shoulder WE SEE something drop onto the child's bed... something which stays quite still for a moment, then starts crawling towards the counterpane. It is a small lizard.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark, whatever is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Her voice trails away. She stares - repelled and fascinated - at the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE Mark reach for his cine-camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over Helen's shoulder WE SEE the lizard reach the counterpane. It stretches itself out on the floral design - its body is pointed towards the child's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE HEAR a click - and suddenly a spotlight falls onto Helen's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVERLAID is the GENTLE PURRING of Mark's cine-camera. She wheels towards him - blotting out the small screen.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	wanted to photograph you... watching...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Mark!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
The camera purrs on.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
He switches off the spot... the purring of the camera dies away. She turns towards the small screen.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	help me to understand this... this nightmare...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
The small boy is sitting upright... screaming with terror... there is no sign of the lizard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A handkerchief is thrown onto the boy's bed. He continues crying - looking up into someone's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark watching the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a man's deep voice overlaid.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_DEEP_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That'll do Mark... dry your eyes and stop being silly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_DEEP_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Small Mark reaches for the handkerchief and wipes his eyes... his hands are trembling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The small screen trembles with them into a clumsy dissolve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen turns to Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right... now look... Mark - what was all that about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her helplessly.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... that was a lizard, wasn't it? Or a...

</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Liz...

</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well how did it get there?... How did it get there Mark?... Was it a pet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not mine...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Won't you try to explain?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark staring at the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd better go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like to understand what I'm shown!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was your father trying to do?... Photographing you at nigh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Her voice trails away.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	better go...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
From Helen's POV WE SEE the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Small Mark is wearing a dark suit and a black tie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is standing at the foot of a four-poster bed, staring at something in horror and disbelief... his hands clasp the bedrail tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly - very slowly - he walks towards the head of the bed, staring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His lips begin to quiver. He bends forward over the bed. WE CAN SEE the back of his bowed head.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark... what is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am saying... goodbye... my mother...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
We catch a glimpse of a woman's hands folded in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(in a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He... photographed... that...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly - and healthily - his temper snaps.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes a lever on his projector as far forward as it will go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The film is now shown at tremendous speed - We catch a glimpse of a long line of cars.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...her funeral!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
It speeds by.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
A confused picture of earth and flowers.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...her burial!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
The briefest glimpse of a little boy with a spade.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE a girl in a bikini by sand-dunes. Mark offers no comment.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark, who is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her successor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suc-?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He married her... six weeks after... the previous sequence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls back the lever of his projector... the film returns to its normal speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE the same attractive young woman standing in a garden. She is holding a bewildered and defiant Mark by the hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the girl runs towards camera - leaving Mark standing alone.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She filmed... what comes now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen watching intently. It's out of focus!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From Helen's POV WE SEE a tall man in a black coat walking away from camera. He hurries towards small Mark - who watches him anxiously.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that your father?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The morning that he left for his honeymoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
The back of Mark's father suddenly obscures our view of small Mark... all we can see is that tall figure looking downwards standing very still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera wobbles - as if the person holding it is laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is he doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Giving me a present...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Mark stares at the blurred screen, perspiration trickling down his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't you guess?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
The small screen comes back into focus - and suddenly our camera rushes towards it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE a CLOSE SHOT of a CLOSE SHOT - and at the moment we see it, Mark's Voice is overlaid... A whisper which echoes round the room.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A camera...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
We are looking at a close shot of a camera in a small boy's hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a single shrill chord of music on the sound track.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of the shelf which encircles Mark's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are looking at the very same camera which the small boy is holding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of the camera in small Mark's hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His father's finger points lo the view-finder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Small Mark stares into it. Small Mark begins to smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark watching himself being born.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen watching Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Switch it off!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
He continues to stare at the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Switch it off, Mark!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to the projector - touches the wrong switch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Small Mark and his father go rapidly backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark turns off the projector abruptly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is in darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE CAN HEAR both of them breathing quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light goes on. Mark is standing by the exit - he keeps his face averted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen walks slowly towards the exit. She glances round once, over her shoulder, then goes into the other room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark stares after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks towards the door... turns round suddenly - almost in anger.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So he was a scientist?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
He keeps his face averted.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of scientist, Mark?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Biologist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was he trying to do to you?

</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark!...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
He turns round slowly. From his POV WE SEE the willingness to understand on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was he trying to do to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch me... grow up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
She walks towards him... takes his handkerchief from his jacket pocket and wipes his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wanted a record of a growing child... complete in every detail - if such a thing were possible - and he tried to make it possible by training a camera on me... at all times...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never knew... the whole of my childhood... one moment's privacy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And those lights in your eyes?... and that - thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was interested ... in the reactions of the nervous system... to fear... Fear?

</MARK>
<HELEN>

We are looking at the spine of a book on Mark's shelf. The full title reads: The Physiology of Fear by Professor A. N. Lewis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARK'S VOICE IS OVERLAID:

CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think he learned a lot... from me... I'd wake up... screaming... sometimes... and he'd be there... taking notes... and pictures... and I'm sure good came of it... for some people... He was brilliant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A scientist drops a lizard onto a child's bed - and good comes of it?

<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know... if he did... but if he did... he'll have learned something of value...

He looks at her in silence.

<HELEN>

There is a knock on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One day...

</MARK>

He hurries to the door, and opens it.

Tony is standing there.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>

</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
From Tony's POV WE SEE Helen looking at the door of the dark room.

	Oh, there you are, Helen.

<DIRECTION>
She turns towards him.

She smiles at him.

INT. FILM STUDIO - DAY

HIGH ANGLE SHOT of a set showing part of a large West End store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A blonde is lying unconscious in front of a lift - and a crowd of extras surround her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the word 'cut' dies away, the extras relax - and the blonde (DIANE ASHLEY) props herself onto her elbow, looking towards the Director.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of the Director (ARTHUR BADEN) standing beside the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<BADEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK. Print that one!

</BADEN>

He glances at the CHIEF CAMERAMAN (PHILIP TALE), who nods his head in agreement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark standing at the back of the camera crew. He shakes his head in disagreement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chief Cameraman spots Mark's small mutiny and wags his finger at him. As the Chief Cameraman turns away, Mark's finger automatically wags back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Baden looking at his watch. He sighs, then nods to the Assistant Director who stands beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<ASSISTANT_DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, everyone! Back at two!

Baden walks out without a word to anyone. A hubbub of chatter breaks out. The unit downs tools and begins to disperse.

No reply. Vivian hesitates... then edges slowly forward.

Ahead of her are shadowy counters full of merchandise. Beyond them is the door of the lift.

<DIRECTION>
Very faintly overlaid is the sound of Mark whistling under his.

She listens intently for a moment - then peers at her watch.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of the watch on Mark's wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Vivian. She shivers suddenly... then looks at her watch again. She hesitates... then turns towards the exit, and starts to edge back. She trips over a cable and almost falls.

Suddenly she is bathed in light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She wheels round. One of the big spots is beating down on her.

No sign of him. Overlaid is a gentle purring sound. Where are another light comes on, shining through her hair.

<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's time to find out, Viv...

</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He walks slowly towards the studio camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She prepares for the test by switching on music and warming up with dance movements.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on! Get hot!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she accents the rhythm)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark puts the cine-camera and the black cloth bag on the dolly, slowly mounts the platform, closes the blimp - and swings the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We watch him from the top of the studio, from the door of the studio, from the Director's chair. And finally WE WATCH HIM from Vivian's POV. She stops dancing but the music continues.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You belong there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He stares ahead of him, his mind far, far away... then bends and looks into the finder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a single harsh chord of music - and the screen goes dark. It remains dark for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the darkness parts like curtains - and in the centre WE SEE Vivian's face in the finder of the studio camera. (Unlike the ground-glass of the newsagent's camera, we see everything the right way up and in perfect perspective.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark hooks a filler-light below the camera and switches it on. He adjusts the finder until he has made of Vivian's delicate features a radiant miniature.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The miniature smiles shyly at him. She has stopped dancing and is looking directly at the camera. Music continues.

<VIVIAN>

	I do feel alone in front of it...

<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes - and I'll have a go!

</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
We hear his quick breathing.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He looks down - a little sadly - and peers into the finder. (The camera dolly is on tracks - he tracks forward.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Music continues - piano.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the finder WE SEE a large trunk - 'at greatly reduced prices' — on the shelf behind Vivian.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From Vivian's POV WE SEE Mark leave the studio camera — and hurry towards the trunks. She watches him wide-eyed.

</VIVIAN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly.

He carries the trunk towards the studio camera, and lays it carefully on the floor.

Music continues.

Vivian peers into the front-glass of the studio camera — as if it were a mirror. The rhythm of the music changes.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>

	If only Don Jarvis could see me now!

</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She jumps onto the trunk and taps.

She giggles again.

</JARVIS>
<DIRECTION>
The Fireman follows him meekly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So near - yet a lifetime away - a red light is burning above a closed door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Vivian - puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That..?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STUDIO E. - EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is holding his cine-camera; fixed to it is a collapsible tripod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he pulls one leg of the tripod out. WE SEE that a very sharp spike protrudes from the end of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From Mark's POV WE SEE Vivian looking at the spike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He raises it towards her - until the spike is only inches from her throat.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... that would be frightening!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But... there's something else...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
We can hear his heart pounding as if it will burst - and gradually Vivian, too, becomes aware of it.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well? What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Just for a moment Mark's arm moves. His back hides what he is doing. Suddenly WE SEE Vivian turn her head sharply - she is looking at something out of camera.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(in a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
The spike is very close to her throat - but Vivian ignores it, staring out of camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over Mark's shoulder we concentrate on Vivian's face.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(in a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark... take it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
The fear on her face is rapidly growing...
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to move back - but the trunk prevents her.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MARK - YOU!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
It is almost a scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can hear Mark breathing quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian raises her hands to push something away from her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the screen is filled with her eyes. WE SEE them dilating with terror. There is a sudden crash as the big power switches go out in the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights go out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a scream in the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The darkness acquires a grey, opaque quality as if one is seeing the world through a curtain - it is the world of Mrs. Stephens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bright light is felt, rather than seen, beating against our eyelids. It looms closer and stronger.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that, darling, is the end of the news! Unless you want the football results?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens, a large glass of whisky - and the bottle - beside her. It is night.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen. 'She's Got the Key of the Door' is overlaid.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What else can I read you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The label on this whisky bottle! Are you sure it says seventy per cent proof?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're bigger liars than the press!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
From Helen's POV WE SEE her reach for her glass with a steady hand.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that your last tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I doubt it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your last but one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't haggle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(producing a coin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Toss me double or nothing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Done!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
Helen spins the coin on the table Mrs. Stephens listens intently... the coin stops spinning.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heads.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
Her fingers shoot out and feel the surface of the coin.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bad luck, darling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
She turns the coin over and carefully feels the other side. Helen watches her with a smile - then looks thoughtfully at the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you looking at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The ceiling!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wondering if that young man is home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well he is... I heard him come in... four paragraphs ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
From Helen's POV WE SEE the sightless eyes staring at her.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you like him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, darling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has a quality...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
(sipping her glass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wish this had.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and I think he could help me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With your photographs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Helen...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Stephens hesitates - which is rare.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
(abruptly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mummy, what's worrying you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The price of whisky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What else matters?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you like Mark?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haven't met him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't like him! Now why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens. Again she hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I distrust a man who walks quietly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's shy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His footsteps aren't! They're stealthy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now darling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you going up to him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We both have the key of the door... Mine needs oiling - and yours needs exercise... Off you go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses her - and glances at the whisky glass.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	remember that you lost the toss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She walks to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Helen...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, darling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're back in five minutes... I won't even finish this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Done!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She hurries out. Mrs. Stephens instantly refills her glass. CLOSE SHOT of her hand. It has begun to tremble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARK'S DARK-ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark's hands, in the green light of the dark- room. He is busy unloading and winding film onto a developing rack.

He puts the rack of exposed film into the tank and starts the time clock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of the time clock ticking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A knock is heard off.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PASSAGE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>

Helen opens the door of Mark's sitting room. We hear Mark call out from the inner room:
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you... please... wait in there?... Developing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Helen goes in, closing the door behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen enters. She speaks loudly to be heard in the dark- room.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother heard you come in - so I guessed you wouldn't be in bed ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
No reply from the inner room.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure this is conven...

<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Vivian's recorder, placed on a chair.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>

	Hallo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Helen turns round. Mark is standing on the threshold of the dark-room.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hallo, Mark...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
He walks towards her... he stops suddenly. He is staring at the recorder in her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you don't mind - is it a tape-recorder?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Gently he takes it from her - as if it is a cup with which she has finished - and replaces it on the shelf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure I'm being a nuisance... but, Mark, I very much want to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Her voice trails away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He is holding out a small package.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy birthday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark! That's very sweet of you - but really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It isn't much... I don't know anything about... presents for twenty-one... but I saw it this morning... so... please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>

She takes the package, and unwraps it. Inside is a slender brooch
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's beautiful...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like the design... More milk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More?... No, thank you, Mark... and I really appreciate this... I'm going to put it on now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
He watches her hold it against her dress.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There?... Or there?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>

<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>

<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark, I'm here for some advice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From me? Please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He looks as if he has just been voted the best cameraman of the year (unanimously) - and the two films he directed have both won Oscars (though Don Jarvis understood them).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His delighted astonishment is such that she has to smile.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I work in a public library - in the children's section... I'm telling you that to postpone admitting what always embarrasses me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a deep breath.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my spare time... I write.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's embar...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I write stories for children... but so did Grimm... Hans Andersen... Lewis Carroll...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had any published?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some short stories.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to read...

</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I learned today... that my first book... has been accepted! ... For publication in the spring...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that's wonderful... what's it about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A magic camera - and what it photographs...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever made you... think of that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you one day - I promise...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well what does it photograph?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you that too - but, Mark... this is the problem... The children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes - but the publishers say they're impossible to photograph, and suggest drawings... but I don't agree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No - nothing's impossible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	was hoping you'd say that! There must be photographs - however difficult to take - and I was wondering, Mark - if you'd...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	discuss it with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	take them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark - I can't ask you to do that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
They have cancelled his Oscar.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean... the publisher's mightn't agree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd take them... for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes but... the money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are some things... which I photograph... for nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking at him...
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does your camera photograph?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>

	Mark - I must go... I just wanted to know... if you'd talk it over with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's up to you.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of a Tall Man with a severe face. He is standing in front of a familiar pile of trunks marked at 'Specially Reduced Prices'.

CAMERA PULLS FURTHER BACK and WE SEE that we are in a small theatre watching rushes...

INT. THEATRE IN STUDIO - DAY

From Diane's POV WE WATCH the screen. We see the Tall Man (SHOP ASSISTANT) reaching for a trunk and laying it on the counter. He opens it with a flourish. Vivian passes across the screen - glances casually at the trunk - and wanders off.

CAMERA PULLS BACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The unit is busy preparing for a retake. The studio camera (and its crew) are off camera, and we concentrate on Baden briefing his artistes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is clutching a script as if afraid that opening it might be indecent exposure.
</DIRECTION>
<BADEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Instead of taking the first trunk you see, I want you, darling... to ask for a blue trunk - and when he brings it to you, to ask for a red one - and when he brings that, to ask for a white one...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns to the Assistant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you, Michael... get the trunks one by one - growing more and more fed up - and we'll end on a gag which I'll think of in a minute - all right?

<ASSISTANT_DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's beautifully fitted -

<DIRECTION>
She takes a perfunctory glance -

	</DIALOGUE>
</DIANE>
<ASSISTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly, madam.

She pockets another item. He turns and wrestles with another trunk... brings it forward and opens it

</DIANE>
<ASSISTANT>

Mark turns towards the rehearsal and raises his cine-camera. WE SEE the Assistant try to lift a blue trunk - and half collapse with the weight of it.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Baden - beaming.

<DIRECTION>
The Assistant manages to drag the trunk forward. He leans over it - exhausted - then starts to open it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark moves round until Diane's face is in the finder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the lid of the trunk is opened we can see only her eyes above the rim of the lid... WE HEAR her scream.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Baden - freezing.

There is the sound of a body falling to the ground.

Over his shoulder WE SEE what he is looking at - it is a photograph of Dora in her furs and finery.

	What about that man the landlady passed?

From Mark's POV WE SEE that the unit (with the exception of Diane and Baden) is crowded into the canteen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They have formed themselves into small groups and are talking in whispers. The Assistant Director is standing with his back to the door. A GIRL calls out:

From his POV WE SEE a police car driving across the courtyard. Mark watches with great interest - then reaches for his cine-camera.

Don Jarvis points towards the trunks department. The Chief Inspector nods, then he and the Sergeant approach the counter.

CLOSE SHOT of the Inspector - over the top of the lid. His expression is mainly one of surprise.

The Inspector nods.

<SERGEANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGEANT>
<DIRECTION>
He puts a tick on the list. There is the sound of a door opening. The Inspector looks up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From his POV WE SEE a young man with a camera over his shoulder advancing shyly towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Lewis?

<MARK>

<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've brought the camera in case you want to take the film away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He holds out his camera. The Sergeant glances enquiringly at the Inspector.
</DIRECTION>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all right, Mr. Lewis - as long as we don't appear at the Odeon next week in place of the cartoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INSPECTOR>

Mark smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, sir.

</MARK>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well now; have you anything to tell us?

</INSPECTOR>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't think so, sir.

</MARK>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you know the girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INSPECTOR>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How well?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INSPECTOR>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mainly by sight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did you see her last?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INSPECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up a pencil — taps it idly on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yesterday afternoon - when we broke...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Speak to her?

</INSPECTOR>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Called out good night - don't know if she heard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark's fingers... tapping on his knee in time to the pencil.
</DIRECTION>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you do then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INSPECTOR>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Took sqme shots, sir - for a film I'm making.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INSPECTOR>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All over the place, sir... it's a documentary.

</MARK>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>

<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What time did you arrive home, Mr. Lewis?

</INSPECTOR>
<MARK>

</MARK>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone see you?

</INSPECTOR>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MARK>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INSPECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The telephone rings. The Sergeant promptly answers it.
</DIRECTION>
<SERGEANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sergeant Miller - Right, I'll tell him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGEANT>
<DIRECTION>
He replaces the receiver, turns to the Inspector.
</DIRECTION>
<SERGEANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The doctor's finished his examin...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGEANT>
<DIRECTION>
The Inspector rises at once.
</DIRECTION>
<SERGEANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...wants to see you -
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGEANT>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.

Mark stands very still.

<INSPECTOR>

<SERGEANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGEANT>
<DIRECTION>
From the Sergeant's POV WE SEE Mark turn to go into the passage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sergeant stares at the camera on his shoulder... then the door closes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sergeant makes a note on a piece of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PASSAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Inspector and Mark walk side by side along the passage. The Clapper Boy comes into view - still reading Sight and Sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Clapper Boy glances up - just in time to see the Inspector and Mark walk side by side to the end of the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAPPER_BOY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I warned him to be careful!

INT. ENTRANCE TO SET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Constable is standing outside the entrance to the set. From his POV WE SEE the Inspector and Mark approach. The Constable stiffens... From Mark's POV WE SEE the Constable barring the entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I can find my way now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INSPECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Mark smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...thanks for the escort
	</DIALOGUE>
</INSPECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Inspector hurries towards the door of the set.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Constable opens it - and the Inspector goes inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Constable closes the door - and stands in front of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark turns away quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COURTYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The carpark is jammed with cars - but there is hardly anyone in sight. Mark hurries towards the large sliding doors of Stage E - they are a few feet apart. He looks round carefully, then slips inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAGE E. - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Facing Mark is the darkened set of an hotel bedroom. Beyond this is another set - also in darkness - and beyond this yet another. Only in the far comer of the studio - in the furthermost set - is there a light burning. Voices can faintly be heard coming from this set.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark walks quietly towards a long ladder which leads up to the gantry. Carefully - rung by rung - he starts to climb the ladder. At the top of the ladder is a gallery. Mark moves along the maze of bridges until he is nearly above the Policemen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark raises his head cautiously - and looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Far below WE CAN SEE the Inspector standing next to the Doctor - a tall, silver haired man - who is peering into an open trunk. Detectives are photographing the set. Mark raises his cine-camera... its gentle purring seems to echo round the studio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark's jacket pocket. A row of pencils is sticking out. As he leans forward the pencils tilt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the finder-matte of Mark's camera WE SEE the Inspector - very far away - peering into the trunk and nodding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A faint echo of conversation is overlaid.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No doubt at all... wounds were caused by the same instrument...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Mark changes lens (and alters the finder to a 75mm lens). The Doctor's face - thin and impersonal - appears in the finder over the lid of the trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... both women... subjected to the most violent shock...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<INSPECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What sort of shock?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INSPECTOR>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...still cannot determine - but look!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He points to something in the trunk - out of the camera's eye-line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He balances carefully - then raises the camera above his head. As he leans forward, the pencils fall. WE SEE them shooting like small torpedoes into the darkness below. They make three separate landings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of the Inspector. Looking up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From his POV WE SEE tiers of scaffolding deep in shadow...
</DIRECTION>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quiet, everyone. Please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INSPECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Detectives make as much noise to become quiet as the normal occupants of the studio - and then there is complete silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Complete, except for the Doctor's asthmatic breathing... And then - so gently that it might almost be in our own minds - WE HEAR a purring sound from the shadows above. The Inspector listens intently.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I heard a putty cat!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
There is a burst of laughter - the Inspector frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but we do have a maniac on our hands, and if we don't get him quickly there'll be a third unsolved murder to report to the Commissioner. So let's hurry things up, shall we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INSPECTOR>
<DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, Chief!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
The 'putty cat' Detective raises his flashlamp towards the trunk counter. In the brilliant flash of light that ensues, we glimpse a shadowy figure moving towards a ladder high in the scaffolding... But then we are looking for it - no one else is. The flashlight dies away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scene fades with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of a knitting-needle held upwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another knitting-needle scales down it like a fireman descending a ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK

INT. HELEN S SITTING ROOM - DAY

Mrs. Stephens is doing her knitting. The inevitable glass stands on the table beside her. Helen is seated opposite, reading from a newspaper.

Mrs. Stephens sips from her glass. The Prime Minister to visit Athens.

<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If he's free.

Behind her back we see that her fingers are crossed.

<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll bring him in and introduce you if...

</HELEN>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel I know him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now how can you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>

Mrs. Stephens stiffens suddenly.

<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's here.

</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of the window.

Mark is standing outside - looking in.

<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't we make him a present of the window? He practically lives there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
Helen beckons to Mark to come in. We see him nod eagerly - and leave the window.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you know where he was standing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The back of my neck told me... the part that I talk out of!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>

Helen hurries to the door of the sitting room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark closes the front door behind him.

	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
She holds open the door. He goes inside. The screen suddenly greys out into the veiled images of Mrs. Stephens' world. We hear Helen's voice.

<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darling, this is Mark... Mark, my mother.

Mark holds the door open for Helen and she goes into the passage. Mark turns and takes a long look at Mrs. Stephens. She is in the middle of raising her glass. She stops suddenly, the glass poised mid-air. He goes out - closing the door. She finishes her drink as if it is her last.

Suddenly Mark stands motionless. He is staring at something off camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Especially when -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her voice trails away... she is staring at Mark staring at something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the shadows, at the mouth of an alley, a young couple are kissing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark stands motionless, staring at them. Automatically his hand reaches for his camera. Helen starts to speak - then looks at him in silence. The man glances round. Mark hurries away and Helen stares after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back - waiting for Helen.

From his POV WE SEE Helen come slowly towards him. She looks at him searchingly for a long moment.

He manages - but only just - to meet her eyes.

A small and very pleasant restaurant, almost full. Helen and Mark have a corner table. They are dining by candlelight, and there is a bottle of wine in the middle of the table.

As CAMERA TRACKS TOWARDS them, Helen is laughing.

He looks at her in silence.

CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... when you stared at that couple, you were like the little boy on that film you showed me... looking over the wall at something he shouldn't see. But Mark - you're strong enough now to lift that child off the wall... aren't you?

	Yes, Mark... in case, one day, a child comes in and asks for it!

</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not popular with my customers! They ask me for horror comics - and I take their sticky hands and drag them to where there are books!

</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and do you know, Mark, waiting for them to come in next time and ask for books... is as exciting... as a horror comic...

	What does your magic camera photograph?

</MARK>
<HELEN>

</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's owned by a little boy who is terrified of grown-ups... but when he looks in his magic camera he sees grown-ups as they were when they were children... and he isn't frightened any longer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark listening, engrossed.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and one day he gives his camera away to a little boy who is even more frightened of grown-ups than he was - and do you know what he finds?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
The little boy opposite her shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... that when he looks at grown- ups without his camera he can still see them as they were when they were children! And that means that he's grown up himself...

A moment's pause. She drinks her wine - shy, awaiting his reaction.

Helen smiles.

Mark glances at the blind - then looks away quickly.

	Good night, Mark...

</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
He watches her as she goes into the room, and doses the door. A light goes on beneath the door.

<DIRECTION>
He stands very still for a moment... then turns the camera round and points the lens towards his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he turns abruptly, and hurries up the stairs.

<DIRECTION>
The waterfall cascades on. The screen grows dark - and the dark-room grows out of it.

INT. DARK-ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The big drying drum is turning, feeding the dry print into a box. A small motor drives it. CLOSE SHOT of the box. Mark is spooling up the film as it comes off the drier. Once or twice he can't help glancing at an image.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP of Vivian's face, in the image.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark stops the motor and the drum, loosens the end of the film, spools up with a snap, slides the spool off and hurries out with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark hurries to his projector, threads the film and starts the projector. He flicks it on, as if it were a gramophone, then looks eagerly at the 16mm screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him something moves in the shadows
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE SHOT of Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over the shoulder of someone who is standing deep in the shadows WE SEE Mark. His head obscures what he is watching on the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE TURNS ROUND SUDDENLY -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From Mark's POV WE SEE the processing sinks deep in shadow. He starts to move towards them, then suddenly stares at the shadows at the back of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence - except for the whirring of the 16mm projector.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark's hand - switching on the light. Mark turns round... he is as astonished at what he sees as he can be.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS in its own good time to the back of the room.

Mrs. Stephens is standing in the shadows... a heavy hand rests on a heavy stick... the sightless eyes stare unerringly towards the light switch.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I've no one to talk to... in the rooms I live over...

Mrs. Stephens nods. Her hand touches the black cloth loading bag, lying on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm told that you stare too much... so do I.

</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of her hand - touching the black cloth bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark - walking slowly towards her.

At once she raises the heavy stick - pointing it towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of the stick. It is a shooting stick - with a sharp spike on the end of it, similar to the tripod on Mark's camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark stares at the stick, fascinated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens - exploring the inside of the black cloth bag with her free hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cloth... with something hard inside it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a changing bag... we put films in it - so that the light won't spoil them...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How odd - that the light can spoil anything...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
The screen greys out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In Mrs. Stephens' own dark-room we hear the hum of Mark's projector - and the pounding of Mark's heart - and, very faintly, the sounds of Tony bathing himself.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every night you switch on that film machine.

</MRS_STEPHENS>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>

FADE IN:

The singing dies away, and the sound returns to normal.

Over Mark's shoulder WE SEE Mrs. Stephens holding her stick in front of her.

<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you lie to me? I'd never know...

</MRS_STEPHENS>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd know at once -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Stephens smiles - then turns her head towards the 16mm screen.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take me to your cinema.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He takes her arm gently and guides her towards us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both of them stare at the 16mm screen... She leans forward - her face only inches from the screen - the light from the projector flickering on to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens. Slowly she stretches out her hands and touches the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I seeing, Mark?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
Her head and shoulders blot out most of the screen - but between her outspread fingers WE CATCH A GLIMPSE of a girl's terrified eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you answer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark and Mrs. Stephens.

<MARK>

</MARK>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

</MRS_STEPHENS>
<MARK>

<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have to try again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He hurries to his cine-camera.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've yet to meet an artist who could judge his own work...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
Mark slips a new spool of film into his cine-camera.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think you've spoiled?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An opportunity... now I must find another.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her thoughtfully, then presses a light switch. A spotlight falls blindingly on to her eyes. He presses another switch, and then another, until the whole of her face is shining with light.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you putting those lights on my face?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
He walks towards her. She starts to back away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shadow of Mark's head appears on the 16mm screen. WE SEE him raise his camera - then pull down the tripod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Black out into the grey darkness of Mrs. Stephens' world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE HEAR the purring of Mark's camera - more clearly than we have yet heard it. (There is the faint rasp of a cog which needs oiling.) The sound of footsteps approaching... the purring changes direction.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's almost over...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
The purring is on top of her. There is a sudden thud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Stephens is leaning against the wall... she has dropped her heavy stick. It lies on the floor a few feet away from her. Mark is kneeling in front of her - the tripod firmly on the floor. The cine-camera is pointing upwards into her face. He peers excitedly into the viewfinder.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please let me finish! It's for Helen!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
She edges towards her stick. He hurries forward and picks it up. He looks at the spike on the end of it - then carefully gives it to her by the handle. She grasps it tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean? It's for Helen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wants to see something I've photographed!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He returns excitedly to his camera.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My daughter sees enough of my face without photographs...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
On Mark's focusing screen WE SEE the fear on her face. Her hand trembles as she wipes away the perspiration.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please... don't be frightened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not frightened! Hot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
But it is fear that we are looking at.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So put that camera away...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
On the focusing screen we see her moisten her lips nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He switches off the camera abruptly, and folds up the tripod. He turns away without looking at her - and hurries to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens listening to his movements - puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In rather a hurry, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
He glances towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From his POV WE SEE the fear in her eyes. He looks away at once, staring into the darkened room.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
From her POV (shooting over her shoulder with a large CLOSE SHOT of her ear in the foreground) WE SEE Mark standing in the doorway - and hear, very clearly, his quick, uneasy breathing.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must be tired...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're anxious to get rid of me all of a sudden.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
We hear his quick intake of breath.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't be selfish... You can take some more pictures - if you want to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... thank you.

</MARK>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't you find some - to please Helen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
He glances towards her - then hurries into the next room.

INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The tapping of her stick is overlaid. Mark hurries to the door and opens it - staring into the dimly lit passage. Over his shoulder WE SEE her tapping her way towards him from the dark-room.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't it Mark? A pity it can't be photographed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
Over her shoulder we follow the stick towards him.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't have let a man operate I had no faith in... so I'm listening to it now...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It says all this filming isn't healthy - and that you need help...

<DIRECTION>
His face is averted... his eyes are closed.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... get it, Mark... get it quickly... and until you've got it... I don't want you and Helen to see each...

</MRS_STEPHENS>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll never photograph her... I promise you that.

</MARK>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd rather you don't have the chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<DIRECTION>
He turns towards her - a small boy who suddenly understands what contagious means...
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_STEPHENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean it, Mark. And if you don't listen to me... one of us will move from this house - which would be a pity, because we'd never find a cheaper...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_STEPHENS>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll never have to move... because of me... I promise you.

He stares at Helen's room - then looks quickly away. Suddenly she raises her hands - and runs them gently over his face...

The Publicity Man sighs with relief.

</BADEN>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir ... but a few things seem to point to it... No one outside your unit admits to knowing the girl... There was a trunk all ready for her... and with the risks he was running, I think he'd have to use surroundings he was familiar with... Where is your unit now?

We watch Helen's face as she looks at the screen. Nothing seems wrong for a few seconds - then something starts to happen to the comers of her mouth... and then her eyes become locked... and cannot stop watching. Some kind of sound comes from the back of her throat. Her hands dig into the table and she tries to stand up. She cannot manage it the first time - and keeps on watching, then, like a child waking from a nightmare, she jerks herself away from the table, and stumbles towards the door.

From her POV WE SEE him standing in front of the door, looking ahead of him. She backs slowly away into the shadows at the back of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's right... your mother... must tell someone everything... sorry... has to be you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen standing in the shadows where her mother stood.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was his laboratory... and you know some of what he did... but not all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
The room is suddenly filled with the terrified screaming of a small boy. Helen wheels round. The screaming seems to be coming from the walls. Mark's hand is on a switch - one of a number on a panel.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... aged five...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He presses another switch. There is a click, and the screaming stops, to be replaced by a low sobbing.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... aged seven...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He presses another switch. There is a moment's silence.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the rooms were wired for sound... and... still are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
WE SUDDENLY HEAR the ticking of a clock.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen - listening.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mother's .
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
The click of a switch - and we hear a loud snoring.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tony's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
The click of a switch - and we hear Tony's voice.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one will come in... honestly, darling...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<GIRL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL_S_VOICE>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But darling...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<GIRL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it, Tony!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Mark listens with interest.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn it off!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
He does so - at once. She walks towards him. He turns away from her.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at me, Mark!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not if you're frightened...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly he faces her.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you do... to those girls?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you do, Mark...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to turn away - but she follows him.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you want to torment me... for the rest of my life... then make me imagine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark - his eyes closed.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you do ... to those girls?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show me, Mark...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if you're frightened...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show me - or I'll remain frightened... for the rest of my life. Show me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to his cine-camera, and picks it up. He releases the tripod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA HOLDS on Helen. She stands very still against the wall. Mark's voice is overlaid.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know... what the most frightening thing in the world is?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
She is looking at something, puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's fear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of his footsteps approaching...
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I did something... very simple...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE a look of fear spring into her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very simple.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE the spike approaching her throat... but she is looking at something else.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When they felt the spike... touching their throats... and knew I was going to kill them...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
The spike is touching her throat.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I made them - watch their own deaths!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen's face several times its natural size. She is looking at herself in a large circular magnifying mirror which has been fitted over the camera's face. The mirror entirely obscures both Mark and the camera. There is a small hole in the mirror through which the lens of the camera winks. As Helen looks at her terrified distorted face this small hole gives her an extra eye in the middle of her forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Made them see their own terror as the spike went in... and if death has a face, they saw that too!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark - crouching behind the mirror, sweat pouring down his forehead... his finger on the trigger of the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not you! Not you! I'll never photograph you! I promised - I promised - Not you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Helen's eyes are closed. The spike is still touching her throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Mark — his face turned away from the viewfinder.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... frightened ... for you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
There's the sound of a car pulling up. He hurries to the other room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Police arrive: three cars. Mark appears at an upstairs window with his camera.
</DIRECTION>
<SERGEANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGEANT>
<DIRECTION>
He thinks Mark has a gun. They all duck. Mark raises his camera and photographs them. The Police recover and charge for the house. Mark disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DARK-ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark hurries back into the room carrying his camera. He knows exactly what he has to do.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark! Mark! Give yourself up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been ready for this... for such a long time...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Rapidly he fixes his camera on to a hook on the wall. Then he adjusts the tripod so that the spikes protrude towards him...
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll be all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He makes chalk marks on the floor in front of the camera, then switches on all the floodlights. WE CAN HEAR the Policemen pounding on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can beat that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses to a switch - presses it. The room is filled with a small boy's screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give yourself up... Mark!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
He stands next to her, and looks at his long array of cameras. WE SEE that each one of them has been fitted with a small metal disc (a delayed release), and that some of the older cameras have flashlights attached.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch them, Helen... Watch them say goodbye - one by one -
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he presses a master switch on the wait)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've timed this... so often...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly he walks past his cameras. As he does, the metallic disc on each one explodes with a little plop - and the eye of each camera winks once as if in salute. Some go off with flashlights on either side of the room. The sound of footsteps hurrying up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead of Mark - coming steadily closer — are the spikes of the tripod. The mirror on the cine-camera reflects the approach - and Helen's terrified face.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No - No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
The child's screaming reaches its peak as Mark approaches the spikes... Ahead of him, on the small table where his projector stands, is Helen's book The Magic Camera.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish... I could have found your faces for you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
The Policemen are now rattling on the dark-room door.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Helen - I'm afraid!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
We see his face, terrified, in the magnifying mirror. The spikes are against his throat. The eye of the camera is winking rapidly.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad I'm afraid!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Heavy shoulders are pressing against the dark-room door... as it breaks in, Mark lunges forward against the spikes. The cine-camera is wrenched away from the wall as he falls back. He crashes against the small table, which falls over. He is not parted from his camera - it is fixed to him by the tripod, and falls back with him, covering his face like a canopy. WE SEE his face in the lens of the cine- camera. and WE SEE his hand - lying limp on the cover of The Magic Camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Policemen hurry into the room. They stare motionless at what they see.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Helen - her face buried in her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The child's screaming stops suddenly... and in the absolute silence which follows WE HEAR the voice of Mark's father:
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be a silly boy... there's nothing to be afraid of...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
And a small voice answers.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILD_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night, Daddy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILD_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The spotlights begin to dim... The dazzling white of the 16mm screen fades slowly into greyness...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is filled with the gentle breathing of a small child.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
