Stacy barely slips in the door before the final attendance bell sounds. She finds a seat just as the teacher's cubicle door opens at the back of the classroom. A tall figure comes barreling down the aisle. He is Mr. Hand. The man makes a double-speed step to the door at the front of the class, kicks the door shut and locks it.

Hand finally turns, as if he has just noticed the sound at the door and opens the door an inch. Jeffrey Spicoli stands in the doorway, red eyes glistening. His long, blond hair is still wet and streaming down the back of his white peasant shirt. He grins, oblivious to such trivial matters as attendance bells. A Student sitting near Stacy turns to his friends.

INT. DAMONE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Damone expertly fills two glasses three-quarters full of Kahlua, then adds a few drops of milk. Music is playing on a nearby speaker. Damone hands The Rat a drink and checks himself out in his mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See that moustache coming in, Rat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<DIRECTION>
There is only a hint of peach fuzz, but he grooms it anyway.

Damone turns around. His friend is preoccupied.

<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am in love.

Damone takes a sip of his drink, looks at The Rat.

<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<THE_RAT>

	What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.

</DAMONE>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damone, you gotta listen to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
Damone quits puttering around his room with the Kahlua and milk. He grabs a chair and straddles it.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right... where did you see her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's in my biology class.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DAMONE>

</DAMONE>
<THE_RAT>

<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you get her name?

</DAMONE>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It's too soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DAMONE>
<DIRECTION>
(thoughtfully)

	<DIALOGUE>
	I would. Yeah.

</DAMONE>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<THE_RAT>

He saunters over to the chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMONE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.

INT. CARL'S JR. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Brad operating at full throttle in the kitchen, and taking a moment to sneak a kiss with his girlfriend Lisa as she goes to the front counter to open up a cash register. She allows him only one kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>

	Were those flowers really for me, Brad?

	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Brad shifts his weight, tries to find the right words.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.

<BRAD>

	Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Brad prepares to respond. He squints his eyes, prepares for a truly sizzling comeback, when Dennis Taylor, short and prematurely balding assistant manager of Carl's Jr., comes bustling out of his back office. He quickly surveys the situation in the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hamilton! You have fifteen double cheese to box!

</TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Lisa returns to her cashier post, leaving Brad's last words stalled in his mouth.

<DIRECTION>
INT. BRAD'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brad is alone in his room. He's prone on his neatly made bed, reading a paperback book entitled Power With Class. On the wall of Brad's room is a large framed photo of a Carl's Jr. hamburger.

Brad hears a muffled knock at his door.

<BRAD>

	Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?

</BRAD>
<STACY>

	It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
	</DIALOGUE>

He begins pacing.

<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is everything okay at work?

	You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<BRAD>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Because she won't sleep with you?

</STACY>
<BRAD>

	Where did you hear that?

</BRAD>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just guessing.

</STACY>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... it's true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Stacy pops the question.
</DIRECTION>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I was just curious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe yes. Maybe no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are a virgin!

</STACY>
<BRAD>

<STACY>

	Maybe yes. Maybe no.

</STACY>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<DIRECTION>
Stacy smiles and stands up. She playfully slaps her brother on the arm and walks down the hallway to her room. We can see there is less frill and lace in Stacy's room. The junior high paperbacks are gone. There are no dolls in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda and Stacy walk past rows of cars. Stacy stops at a brown MG.
</DIRECTION>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.

<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.

	If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.

	C... D... F... F... F... three weeks we've been talking about the Platt Amendment. What are you people? On dope? A piece of legislation was introduced into Congress by Senator John Platt. It was passed in 1906. This amendment to our Constitution has a profound impact upon all of our daily liv....

Mr. Hand appears mesmerized. He then turns and heads for the board. He writes in long, large letters as he slams the chalk into the green board. He writes: "I DON'T KNOW".

	I really like that too. 'I don't know'... that's nice. 'Mr. Hand, will I pass this class?' 'Gee, Mr. Spicoli, I don't know'. I like that. I think I'm going to leave your words on this board for all my classes to enjoy. Giving you full credit, of course, Mr. Spicoli.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_HAND>

We hear the blare of the dismissal bell. Stacy and the other students get up to leave. Spicoli stays in place. He has just figured out a truly bitchin' comeback... and his mouth is forming the first word, when Mr. Hand cuts him off.

We see a group of buzz-cut young toughs, walking in formation, hunched over, sneering and wearing sleeveless U.S. Army fatigue jackets. None of these damaged-looking kids is over the age of fourteen. They pass to reveal this legend on their backs: LINCOLN SURF NAZIS.
</DIRECTION>

Suddenly we see all ticket business stop. Damone and his customers see someone menacingly coming directly for them. The small crowd parts as Charles Jefferson, football duffel bag in hand, walks up.

They walk together towards Swenson's, as The Rat drapes his aqua-blue Cinema Four jacket around his shoulders, like a French film director. Damone walks a few steps, then stops Rat.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Rat pulls open the door to Swenson's. He walks toward the counter to Stacy Hamilton.
</DIRECTION>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. May I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<DIRECTION>
The Rat feels the beginnings of cold panic, but barges through nonetheless.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I have two questions. I was curious...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
His voice becomes a shade deeper. He begins to pull The Attitude together.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<STACY>

(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We keep them.

</STACY>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You keep them.

</THE_RAT>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We keep them, in case the people come back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches under the counter and pulls out a cardboard box with some rumbled jackets and other items.
</DIRECTION>
<STACY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here they are. You can look through it, if you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<DIRECTION>
The Rat chuckles to himself, struggling with The Attitude.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's cool. It would take too much time to go through all that stuff. I'll just pick up a new one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
Stacy smiles. He's obviously awkward, and she likes it.
</DIRECTION>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your other question?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
To The Rat's surprise, Stacy continues smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls one out of his jacket pocket, gives it to her. Stacy writes her name and phone number on a scrap of paper and gives it to him. The Rat looks at the paper.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stacy. Nice to meet you, Stacy. My name is Mark Ratner.

<DIRECTION>
He sticks out his hand, and they shake. We see The Rat turn around and walk out of Swenson's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SWENSON'S - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Rat exits with ultimate cool. He sees Damone waiting just off to the side, talking to some girls. The Rat nods, gives him the thumbs-up. Damone returns the gesture. All-Attitude.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CARL'S JR. - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl's is happening tonight. There are lots of kids inside. We hear charging rock music -- "Girls Got Rhythm" by AC/DC -- coming from a radio in the back kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARL'S JR. BATHROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the bathroom, Brad Hamilton applies the Carl's scrub brush to a felt tip graffiti message near the mirror: I EAT BIG HAIRY PUSSY. He pauses and catches himself in the mirror. He adjusts his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD>
<DIRECTION>
(talking to mirror)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lisa? I have something to tell you. Look, I'm a senior now. I'm a single, successful guy and I've got to be fair to myself. Lisa... I think I need my freedom.

Brad pauses, looks at the mirror soulfully.

<BRAD>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, don't do that... don't take it personally, okay? Please? I knew you'd understand, because...

</BRAD>
<DIRECTION>
The bathroom door opens -- it's Arnold, the boy who Brad got a job.
</DIRECTION>
<ARNOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brad! I know you're on your break, but would you cover me on register three?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARNOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Brad nods, exits:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARL'S JR. COUNTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brad stands at the register.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a prominent display over Brad's head: TRY OUR 100% GUARANTEED BREAKFAST. The last of many harried businessmen customers gets his breakfast order and takes his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brad is joined by Dennis Taylor, the Assistant Manager.
</DIRECTION>
<DENNIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENNIS>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Dennis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<DIRECTION>
Brad begins polishing the counter and Dennis Taylor returns to his office at the back of the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brad watches him disappear behind the door that says: ASSISTANT MANAGER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As soon as Dennis disappears behind the door, the one Businessman in the place rises and returns to the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (nervously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

The Businessman has short, curly brown hair. He speaks in a whine.
</DIRECTION>
<BUSINESSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. This is not the best breakfast I ever ate.

The Businessman points to the huge display over Brad's head: TRY OUR 100% GUARANTEED BREAKFAST.

Brad begins searching under the counter.

<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<BUSINESSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I want my money back right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUSINESSMAN>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<BUSINESSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUSINESSMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Brad begins looking to the restroom. "Where's Arnold?"
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<BUSINESSMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(as if talking to a kindergartner)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?

<DIRECTION>
(looks at name tag)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Brad?

<BUSINESSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUSINESSMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Brad looks up from under the counter. No amount of pay will make him take that kind of insult.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<BUSINESSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Manager!!

</BUSINESSMAN>
<DIRECTION>
"Bam!" The door to the Assistant Manager's office swings open, and Dennis comes hurtling out of the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DENNIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I help you, sir? Is there a problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENNIS>
<BUSINESSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bet there's a problem! Your employee used profanity and threatened me with violence! I'm shocked, frankly. I've eaten here many times and I've always enjoyed the service -- until today!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUSINESSMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Angle on bathroom door as it opens and Arnold starts towards the register. He quickly sees the incident with the irate Businessman and ducks back inside the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<BUSINESSMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I wanted was my money back for this breakfast. It was a little undercooked. And this young man threatened me. Now I plan to write a letter! I plan to...

Dennis wheels around to Brad.
</DIRECTION>
<DENNIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?

<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He insulted me first. He called me a moron.

<DENNIS>

Brad looks around, expecting his friends to defend him. Dave and Rich seem very occupied with their work. Brad is stunned.

Then Brad unhooks his fryer's apron and throws it on the counter. He grabs a backpack and walks out of the place. On the way, he bangs the bathroom door with his fist.

INT. BRAD'S ROOM - DAY

He arrives back in his room and locks the door. He yanks the burger picture off his wall, dumps it into the trash. Then he takes it back out of the trash and cracks the cardboard picture and plastic frame in half.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DARKNESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are in the middle of a deep, dark void. After a moment, a pinprick of light appears in the distance. We head towards the light. We are being led somewhere important.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we draw still closer, curtains suddenly part to reveal a wildly cheering studio audience. We hear the voice of Merv Griffin.
</DIRECTION>
<MERV_GRIFFIN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you please give a warm welcome to... Jeff Spicoli!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERV_GRIFFIN>
<DIRECTION>
The Merv Griffin Show band begins playing a Merv Griffin Show version of AC/DC's "Highway to Hell". Someone hands Jeff Spicoli a microphone. He works the studio audience into a frenzy as he sings the words to "Highway to Hell": Merv Griffin show style.
</DIRECTION>
<SPICOLI>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Layin' ladies! Drinkin' wine! You gotta dollar -- You're a friend of mine! Gettin' loose! Feelin' fine! You and me -- It's get down time! We're on the Highway to Hell! The Highway to Hell!'
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPICOLI>
<DIRECTION>
Spicoli finishes up with a spectular pump. The audience goes wild as Merv Griffin greets him warmly, and guides Spicoli to his seat. Spicoli motions for the cheers to die down. Griffin is obviously happy to see him. He touches Spicoli's arm lightly.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIFFIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How've you been?

</GRIFFIN>
<SPICOLI>

	School.

	<DIALOGUE>
	School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.

</GRIFFIN>
<SPICOLI>

The audience is howling again. He is Merv's favorite guest.

<GRIFFIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
	</DIALOGUE>

</GRIFFIN>
<SPICOLI>

</SPICOLI>
<DIRECTION>
We watch as Spicoli catches the perfect wave, and it hurtles him through a turquoise tube of water.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIFFIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIFFIN>
<SPICOLI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPICOLI>
<DIRECTION>
The audience is howling once again... when suddenly we hear the loud noise of a door opening, followed by a shrill voice. It is Spicoli's eight-year-old brother, Curtis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff Spicoli's dream of glory evaporates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SPICOLI'S TRAILER HOME - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a messy trailer, part of a trailer park by the sea. Spicoli's area is small, but he has made it his own. The walls are covered with posters, almost all of them naked centerfolds. It is obvious Spicoli's parents are not welcome in his room.
</DIRECTION>
<CURTIS>

Spicoli reaches over to the floor next to his bed. He pulls a snorkel from the mess, heaves it at the door and his little brother. It bounces off the wall and doesn't even hit Curtis, but the kid starts crying anyway.

<DIRECTION>

A GRAINY HIGH SCHOOL FILM 57
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are suddenly watching a movie shown on a class projection screen. We see footage of a serene, middle-class neighborhood -- as seen through the glass windshield of a car. Judging from the other vehicles parked on the street, the film is from the early Sixties. We hear the narrative voice of Desi Arnaz, speaking in his inimitable Latin accent.

	Be noble. Be aggressive. The thing about Missile Command is to decimate before you can be decimated. Just like in real life.

ANGLE ON A GANG OF SURF NAZIS

ANGLE ON MIKE DAMONE AND MARK RATNER

<DIRECTION>
walking the mall.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check it out, Rat. The Surf Nazis... out for a Sunday stroll.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<DIRECTION>
Damone and The Rat walk on. The Rat is barely interested. He appears deep in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I say after she gets in the car?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
Damone, obviously in his element here at the mall, stops to flash a winning smile at a well-built older housewife.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem, Rat. What you need is my special Five Point Plan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<DIRECTION>
As he talks, Damone passes a Country Farms shop. He plucks a free sample of cheese and sausage.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<DIRECTION>
The Rat and Damone continue on.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. Pay attention.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<DIRECTION>
The Rat nods, always the student, as they pass a Wherehouse Record store. Damone stops right in front of a seductively posed life-sized cardboard stand-up of Debbie Harry, the alluring rock singer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Damone begins his speech.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMONE>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First of all, Rat... never let on how much you like a girl.

Damone turns to the cardboard cutout of Debbie Harry to demonstrate.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't this great?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to The Rat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four. When ordering food, find out what she wants and then order for both of you... it's a classy move.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Debbie Harry; Cary Grant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the lady will have...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to The Rat)

	Five. And this is most important. When you get down to making out, whenever possible, put on the first side of Led Zeppelin IV.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Debbie Harry; seductive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you put this tape on? It sounds great in the back of my van... why don't we listen from there?

ANGLE ON DEBBIE HARRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
with the same inviting smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMONE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

	<DIALOGUE>
	And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts...
	</DIALOGUE>

Standing there in the front of the Wherehouse, The Rat nods his head and smiles. He's finally beginning to understand, and we...

We see The Rat behind the wheel of a green Volvo. Stacy sits beside him. They are driving the streets of Ridgemont.

This is it. The Big Date. "Led Zeppelin IV" is on the car stereo of his sister's van.

He rounds the corner of Luna Street, off the neon fast-food stand that is Ridgemont Drive.

INT. THE RAT'S CAR

<DIRECTION>
Yet another silence has fallen. Then, after a time...
</DIRECTION>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a nice car.

</STACY>
<THE_RAT>

EXT. ATLANTIS RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pull into the parking lot of a steak and lobster house called The Atlantis.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've heard that, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<DIRECTION>
The Rat finds a parking spot near the back of the lot, grateful that the long silence is over. He walks with Stacy to the front of The Atlantis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE ATLANTIS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Rat and Stacy are escorted by the host to a nearby table. They are given large wooden menus.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know what you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
The Rat leans back in the booth. He is starting to feel in control now. Then something hits him. The panic sweeps across his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, The Rat reaches back to check his wallet. It's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
(weakly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah.

Cool. Cool was the name of the game. Stay cool.

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?

</THE_RAT>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>

Just as The Rat is about to get up, the Waitress approaches the table.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you ready to order here?

</WAITRESS>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... sure.

(settles back down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.

<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything to drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two Cokes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
The Rat gets back up again, looking paler by the minute. He excuses himself and walks over to the pay phone by the Atlantis toilets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Rat dials a number. Damone answers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DAMONE'S ROOM - NIGHT

He is sitting in a chair, leaning onto the back two legs, watching television.

	Yo.

</DAMONE>
<THE_RAT>

(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>

	Damone. It's Mark.

</THE_RAT>
<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark. What happened to your date?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you go home and get it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
There is silence.

<THE_RAT>

INT. STACY AND THE RAT'S TABLE - AN HOUR LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Rat and Stacy have finished the meal, and desert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE CHECK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it sits in a little tray before The Rat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Waitress approaches the table. It is clear she wants to make room for other customers and bigger tips.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<STACY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. I'll... have another Coke.

	Two more Cokes.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Two... more... Cokes.

ANGLE ON FRONT DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Mike Damone finally walks in. Damone looks over the diners, then feigns great surprise when he sees The Rat.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Mark. Is that you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damone! You come here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
Stacy smiles politely, with the slightest sparkle in her eye, as the Waitress returns with the two Cokes.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I've gotta be running.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. See ya.

</THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON STACY

looking strangely at the proceedings.

<DAMONE>

	Nice to meet you, Stacy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice to meet you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<DIRECTION>
Damone leaves. The Rat takes a few quick gulps of Coke, and gets up to pay the bill. As he moves out of camera range, we see the strange look on the faces of waitresses and diners.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE RAT'S CAR - LATE EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Rat pulls up to Stacy's house in the cul-de sac. He stares straight ahead, like a zombie.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a really nice time tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<DIRECTION>
The Rat nods glumly.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want to come inside?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't your parents asleep?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Sure. I'll come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
We see a confused but interested look on The Rat's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE HAMILTON HOUSE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They walk in the front door. The Rat stands uncomfortably in the doorway to the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's your brother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. That's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naw. I don't mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>

Stacy turns her back and pulls up her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you unzip me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the wheels inside his mind start to spin. This can't be what it seems. He unzips Stacy, past her bra, down to the small of her back. It's the first time he's ever done anything like that.
</DIRECTION>
<STACY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<DIRECTION>
She walks down the hall to her room, easing out of her dress as she walks. She leaves the door to her room open.
</DIRECTION>
<STACY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can come in, if you want!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is completely unsure of himself, as he begins to walk down the hall. His heart pounds into his throat. He turns the corner and steps into Stacy's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STACY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stacy stands there, looking gorgeous in an almost seethrough white robe. The Rat pretends not to notice.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... pretty nice house you've got here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. So...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(puts hands on hips)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he struggles with the memory of Damone's words. "Always call the shots."
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
Stacy goes to her closet, reaches up to grab the books from the top shelf. The Rat watches her robe slip up her legs. Then she sits down next to him. Her knee grazes his. It is almost too much for The Rat. Go for it. We see The Rat struggle with the action of putting his arm around her. He almost does, but then reacts as she says suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
(looking pained)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
Her knee grazes him again. Does she expect something?
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Stacy, I want you to know that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
The Rat struggles. Try as he might, he can't seem to cross the line. He can't make his move. He is woeful as he completes the sentence.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I've got to go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you really have to go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... it's getting kind of late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, The Rat is seized with ambition. He reaches one hand around her right shoulder and plants the other hand directly on her left breast. It looks something like a wrestling hold. The Rat looks at Stacy. Stacy looks back at The Rat. The Rat is absolutely frozen.
</DIRECTION>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess it is getting late, Mark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<DIRECTION>
She shrugs him off, walks him to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE HAMILTON HOME - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see The Rat's forlorn face as he trudges towards his car. He stops. He takes a breath -- it wasn't that late, he really didn't want to leave. The Rat turns and begins walking back up the Hamilton steps. Just as he does so, Stacy's bedroom light clicks off. It was too late. He kicks at his car.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You blew it, asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him, recklessly speeding towards Ridgemont Drive, is Charles Jefferson's blue Mustang.

<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. THE BLUE MUSTANG - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff Spicoli is behind the wheel. Sitting next to him is Little Charles, "L.C.", Jefferson's younger brother. They're smoking grass and holding Lowenbrau beers in between their legs. The radio is blasting the music of Rick James.

<SPICOLI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold your beer down, L.C., I think it's a cop.

Spicoli slows down. The car behind him slows down.

Then mystery car pulls back, then up alongside Spicoli and L.C. on the left. We hear the music on the radio of George Thoroughgood's "Ride On, Josephine".

<SPICOLI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!

on the word "ease", Spicoli curls his finger into one of the Mustang steering wheel bubbles and whips it clockwise. The idea is to turn off onto a side street and head back to the party. But instead, at the moment of the hairpin turn, L.C. is attempting to switch the radio station. Spicoli crooks his finger farther into the bubble than he expected. The car swings in a complete circle, a circle that includes a bright yellow fire hydrant. The hydrant rips the side of the car open like a can of tuna. There is a silent moment of terror.

MONTAGE OF SHOTS

<DIRECTION>
as we see Ridgemont High gearing up for its big Homecoming Game against Lincoln. We see a series of shots of kids talking about it, wagering on the chances of a Ridgemont victory. We see the many signs and placards all over school, proclaiming Ridgemont revenge. We see students lining up to vote for Homecoming King and Queen in the gymnasium. It is the most spirit that Ridgemont has shown this year.

From the back of the parking lot, we see a crowd around the flagpole. A group of kids are staring at something. They sadly shake their heads at the sight, as if they are witnessing a funeral.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we draw closer, we see the center of commotion. It is an ugly sight. Someone had wrecked Charles Jefferson's Blue Scholarship Mustang and welded it to the flagpole. Spray-painted on the side was the message: LINCOLN SURF PUNKS RULE.

EXT. RIDGEMONT BLEACHERS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ridgemont football bleachers are full of cheering students. We see the same basic groups from lunch court, and many more.

The cheerleaders are on the field -- Cindy Carr, Dina Phillips and company -- and their cheerleader "husbands" sit directly in front of them in the stands. Linda and Stacy sit in the bleachers with some of the Swenson's girls. The Rat and Damone sit several rows above them, watching. The teachers sit together in another section.

Everyone is cheering the amazing game on the field. Charles Jefferson is poised on the offensive line. He mutters a string of obscenities at the opposing Lincoln player. The ball is snapped, and Charles Jefferson comes directly at the player with both elbows up and angled to hit inside his helmet. The Lincoln player is hit and keels over.
</DIRECTION>

Charles Jefferson sets up for another play. The ball is snapped. Ka-boom. Down falls another Lincoln player. Jefferson doesn't know who it was who wrecked his Mustang, but he wasn't about to spare any of them. There is pure madness in his eyes. It has taken him over.

Brad loosens his buccaneer scarf, and starts back towards the kitchen. He is stopped by the sudden appearance of Captain Kidd Assistant Manager, Harold.
</DIRECTION>
<HAROLD>

	Hamilton! I'll take over the fryer. Those boys at IBM need some Catch of-the-Day boxes, and I told them you would personally deliver them within the hour. I'll reimburse you for gas.

<DIRECTION>
While Harold leans down to tally up the fish order, Brad goes to a nearby employee's closet. He has completely perfected the art of changing back into his street clothes, and it takes less than a minute. He is just about to finish buttoning his street shirt when Harold sees him.

<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?

</BRAD>
<HAROLD>

	But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<DIRECTION>
Harold can barely fathom the idea.
</DIRECTION>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!

<BRAD>

	You really want me to put all this stuff back on?

INT. THE CRUISING VESSEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brad is driving down the freeway, listening to the music of Bruce Springsteen's "Out in the Streets." He pries open one of the fourteen Catch-of-the-Day boxes on the seat next to him and pulls out a small piece of fried fish. Brad takes a bite. The look on his face says it is the worst piece of shit he has ever tasted. He throws the piece out the window, and drives on.

Brad turns to see a girl smiling at him from another car. It makes his afternoon. He returns the smile with gusto.

Damone nods, and watches as Stacy unhooks her top and steps out of her bikini bottom. She stands naked in the shadows of the afternoon sun. She sits down naked on a red changing room couch, and gathers her legs up to her chest. She watches as Damone struggles with his clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON DAMONE
</DIRECTION>

hopping on one leg, pulling first out of his pants, then his jockey underwear. Bashfully, he goes to sit next to Stacy on the couch. They begin to kiss, and it quickly escalates into heavy petting. Stacy pulls away.

Stacy leans back and pulls him on top of her. He enters her and begins pumping so hard, so fast, that he doesn't notice he's banging the sofa into the wall of the changing room.

But just as quickly as Damone starts, he stops.

They lay there, Damone still on top of her on the red couch.

The Robber turns to look at Spicoli, and that is all that Brad Hamilton needs. Just like it is the most natural thing in the world, Brad reaches for the hot, steaming coffee pot he has just made and throws it into the gunman's face and hands.

The .45 falls out of his hand and rattles to the floor. The gunman is still grabbing his face, and looking at his skinless hands in horror when Brad snaps up the gun. In the parking lot, the gunman's accomplice, poised behind the wheel of the yellow Firebird, spots the foul-up and screeches out of the parking lot.

Two girls pass his way. One smiles briefly at him, and The Rat turns to watch her pass. He is about to say something to her, then no. He walks on, sees Swenson's Ice-Cream Parlor up ahead. The Rat decides to walk the other way.

Jeff Spicoli sits in his room, and it is his castle. Clothes lie in disarray on the floor. A huge half-waxed surfboard is propped against the window. We see Spicoli dressed in a too large white short-sleeved shirt, attempting to tie his father's fat paisley tie. He stops to take a hit from his bong, all the while talking on the phone. The music of Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird" plays on the radio.

We pull back to reveal a large, clumsy banner reading: LAST DANCE. Students are pouring into the gym for this event. Many have brought their annual yearbooks. On stage, the lead singer snaps his fingers and the band goes into Nick Lowe's 'Heart of the City'. Some students start to dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every one of our characters is either here, or about to arrive. From Charles Jefferson to Spicoli to Mr. Hand. For once, all classes are partying together. But, just as in the beginning of the year on lunch court, the kids are still cordoned off into their distinctive cliques.

<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Stacy. How are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>

The Rat maintains The Attitude.

<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<DIRECTION>
The Rat looks at her from the corner of his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<DIRECTION>
She withdraws a picture from her pocket, hands it to The Rat.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(breaks down, takes picture)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'll give you a call sometime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<STACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STACY>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him a kiss on the mouth, gets up and walks away. The Rat sits there, smiling at the way things sometimes turn out. He slips the picture into his pocket, a satisfied young man.

<DIRECTION>
The Rat is joined by Mike Damone, who has changed into his street clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wants it, Rat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<DIRECTION>
The Rat snickers, shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMONE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw you. You had pure Attitude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<DIRECTION>
The Rat turns to look at his friend.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever you say, Rat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<DIRECTION>
They take off together, blending into the crowd of kids walking the mall.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sensitive -- what is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what makes you so sensitive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DAMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you read? What's the last book you read?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DAMONE>
<DIRECTION>
(scoffs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMONE>
<THE_RAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I put it out, and I have personally found that girls do respond.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RAT>
<DIRECTION>
Damone laughs, shoves him hard. We lose sight of the two boys in the sea of kids.
