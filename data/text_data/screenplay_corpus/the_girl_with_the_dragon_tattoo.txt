<FRODE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's less in his asset column after his conviction today.

Frode looks at Armansky. What's that supposed to mean?
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure if that means yes or no.

	Not in this case. I have to know if there's anything about him I might find unsavory - even if she doesn't.

Armansky's look to her at once apologizes for Frode, and encourages her to speak. She finally relents but puts no more spin on it than any other piece of raw data -
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>

	He's had a long sexual relationship with his co-editor. It wrecked his marriage, but not hers. Her husband accepts it. Sometimes she sleeps at Blomkvist's, sometimes at home.

Frode thinks about that, perhaps imagining how much simpler his own life would be with such an arrangement.

So much so that he does nothing more than look at her. She reaches to take the money back, but he pockets it and moves across the dark room to a work table where high-end computers fight for space with debris. Finds and gives her a small homemade electronic box, which she turns over in her hands.

<DIRECTION>
Erika, first to arrive this morning, or so she thinks, comes through the empty offices with a Wayne's Coffee to- go cup - but Blomkvist is already there, packing supplies from his desk, books from his shelf. A second suitcase, presumably full of clothes, sits on the floor.

As a taxi passes a gas station by the bridge, Blomkvist regards the Middle Eastern driver's eyes which regard him in the rear view mirror.

EXT. COTTAGE - HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The taxi deposits Blomkvist outside a cottage. From here he can see Vanger's manor and couple other houses. The taxi drives off and disappears into the snow. INT. COTTAGE - DAY Two rooms. Fireplace. Pile of wood. A realtor would call it cozy. In truth it's just tiny and freezing cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist unpacks. Puts clothes in a wardrobe, sets out books, note pads, pens, CD's, a CD player, his laptop and a small printer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He flips open his cell phone to make a call. Gets no reception bars. Hears a faint, plaintive cry and traces it to a window, beyond which, on the sill outside, stands a cat peering in. He opens the door, and the cat heads straight for the kitchenette. Then looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What. Milk?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the old fridge. No milk. Nothing. EXT. COTTAGE - DAY

He comes out into falling snow holding his cell phone out in front of him like a dowser divining ground water. Moves around trying to get a signal. Can't. INT. MARKET - HEDESTAD - DUSK

<DIRECTION>
He purchases milk, butter, a loaf of sliced bread, some packaged lunch meats and a few cans of cat food. EXT. HEDESTAD - DUSK
</DIRECTION>

He walks along the street through wind-whipping snow, cradling the grocery bag, cell out in front of him again. Any of the locals could tell him he could do this forever - there are no cell towers anywhere around here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HEDESTAD - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grocery bag at his feet, he dials a call with fingers he can no longer feel on the gas station pay phone by the end of the bridge. It goes to Erika's voice mail.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's me. I'm here. It's fucking cold and I'm on a pay phone. If you tried to call, the reception sucks, and if you tried to email, there's none of that either, so - so - I'm here - and - I can't even speak it's so fucking cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>

He hangs up, open the same pack of cigarettes from before. Eighteen in there. Struggles to get one lit in the wind and snow, hurries off toward the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the cat laps at milk on a plate, Blomkvist tries to get a fire going using pages ripped from a book. It's a struggle he's going to lose; he's no Boy Scout.

INT. COTTAGE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But it's a knock that draws Blomkvist awake. Having forgotten where he is, he regards the cat sleeping with him, then the room, and groans. He pads to the door in the freezing cold. Opens it to find a rugged older man on his doorstep with a handcart loaded with file boxes.

	No jail time, though. That's good. Cost you a lot of money though, yeah?

EXT. VANGER ESTATE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vanger has ventured outside to show Blomkvist around the estate. Smoke from chimneys rise into bitter cold grey skies, weather for which Blomkvist, unlike the old man, is inadequately dressed.
</DIRECTION>
<VANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The island is owned by my family. Your closest neighbor is my brother Harald, another Nazi if you can believe. Two in the family. He's detestable to put it nicely, but you'll probably never see him. He's a recluse.

Vanger's look to Blomkvist adds, 'so consider him a suspect.' He indicates another house on the grounds -

	<DIALOGUE>
	I speak to him. He runs the company now, as I think I told you.

They hear a distant rifle crack and echo. It startles Blomkvist a bit, but not Vanger.

<VANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was 19 when Harriet disappeared.

Old enough, Blomkvist gathers, to be considered a suspect. Vanger points off -

<VANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He lives over there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Shivering in the cold, Blomkvist turns.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>

	Sorry?

<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your house.

For a moment, Vanger isn't sure what Blomkvist means. Then he is, and is pleased by it.

<VANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, you're right. The man who hires the detective should always be kept on the suspects list.

INT. PALMGREN'S APARTMENT - DAY

A nurse takes a tray away, leaving Salander alone with Palmgren, separated by the chess table they won't playing a game on. She wipes his mouth with her sleeve.

	I got a call from social welfare. I've been assigned a new guardian.

It's unlikely he understands what she has said. It's unlikely he even knows she's there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT Tacked to a wall, a map of the island on which Blomkvist has written the names of the living Vanger family members and staff in the approximate locations of their houses. Next to it - 3x5 cards and photos - a Vanger family tree - which doubles as a suspects list. On some of the cards is the word, 'deceased.' He makes a sandwich. Refills a coffee cup. Begins reading the police reports. The first is a photocopy of a note when the call from Vanger came in: "Officer Morell informed by telephone of situation, 10:19 p.m."

The same face - forty years older - the man who spoke to Vanger on the phone about the dried flowers - now speaks with Blomkvist as he scrapes out the bowl of his pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<MORELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I also couldn't find a motive. Was it spontaneous? Was it planned? Did she know something someone wished she didn't? Was it about business?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Business? She was sixteen.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MORELL>

	And very bright. Henrik told me he could easily imagine her running the business someday, which would mean someone else wouldn't.

</BLOMKVIST>
<MORELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She told them she wasn't feeling well. She left early. But they also said she kept secrets from them, too. The main thing I learned talking to them for hours is that teenage girls are complicated.

	I wanted to ask you about this.

He produces an old address book from his jacket pocket. Of course, Morell has seen it before, and handles it delicately. The decades have dried out its pages.

</DIRECTION>
<MORELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're local Hedestad phone numbers. The first belonged to a woman named Margot, whose mother was Magda, who claimed she didn't know Harriet. The fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosemarie Larsson, an elderly woman who died a few years before. The other three were unconnected in any way that I could find.

He hands the address book back. It, and everything else about the case, clearly trouble him still.

Blomkvist isn't sure what that means.
</DIRECTION>
<MORELL>

	Every policeman has at least one unsolved case. Back then it was old Torstensson. Year after year he kept returning to one - taking out the files - uselessly studying them. As young men, we had to laugh.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Was this also a missing girl case?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORELL>
<MORELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that's not why I mention it. The Rebecka Case is something that happened before Harriet was born. I'm talking about the soul of a policeman. Poor Torstensson could never solve it, and could never let it go.

As a man behind a desk reviews a thick file, Salander reviews him: About 50; spends money on suits, thinking that might disguise his public servant status; no wedding ring; typical creep, as far as she's concerned.

EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin's house didn't look so far away, but the road Blomkvist has to climb to reach it, and the fact he, like all writers, is out of shape, taxes him. A car driven by an attractive woman in her 30's pulls alongside him.

Martin, wearing an apron, opens the door to find both his dinner guests on the porch.

	I found him at death's door halfway up the hill.

	No, it's a climb for anyone. I should've warned you. Come on in.

</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist puts a bottle of aquavit in Martin's hand. INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is far cry from Vanger's manor. It's modern. Martin, Liv and Blomkvist work on the dinner Martin has prepared. Soft jazz music issues from somewhere.
</DIRECTION>
<LIV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to work in the company's petrochemical division in Goteborg. When it was sold, I went with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A dark day.

<LIV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I live in Hong Kong now, but come back to Stockholm for family events, and when I do, I drive up to spend a couple days with Martin.

	She comes for the moose steak.

</LIV>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what this is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<DIRECTION>
They all glance away to a sound: A soft, strange, wailing wind. Martin drains the last of a bottle of wine in Blomkvist's glass and gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something's open. You like this one, or would you like to try something else?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That one's good.

</BLOMKVIST>
<DIRECTION>
Martin heads off to the kitchen. Blomkvist and Liv, left with each other, seem unsure what to talk about.
</DIRECTION>
<LIV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw you on Sky News a while ago.

<LIV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry to remind you of it.

</LIV>
<LIV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're writing a book now, Martin said.

<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Henrik's biography.

<LIV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love Henrik. He's fascinating. Martin, too. Together they're the Old Sweden and the New.

<LIV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know about Harriet, right?

Blomkvist doesn't say. The sound of the wind stops.

	You don't?

Martin emerges from the cellar with a bottle of wine in hand and returns with it to the dining room.

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The family doesn't like to talk about it, but it can't just be swept under the rug.

Martin doesn't comment. Just nods. Silence. Then -

<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we could talk about that later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can talk about it now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Blomkvist glances to Liv)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Liv knows everything about my crazy family. Which is why she'll never marry me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<LIV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's one reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIV>
<DIRECTION>
She holds up her left hand. A wedding ring is on it. The couple seems very comfortable with each other, not unlike Blomkvist and Erika.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't put that in your book. Anything else is fine. Harriet certainly. Everything changed after that. Not just the family, but the company.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not Nordea or Ericsson, but we're still the largest family-owned company in the country. At the height, we had 40,000 employees. We have about half that now, and that downward slide - anyone can tell you - began after my sister's death. It broke Henrik's entrepreneurial spirit, and his heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
And Martin's, too, clearly. Blomkvist dares to ask, as innocently as possible -
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were here that day?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone was here, though I didn't get in until after the accident on the bridge. The 4:30 train.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know it well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a terrible day. And the days after - searching and not finding her - were even worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Liv sets her hand atop her boyfriend's.

	<DIALOGUE>
	This event, Mikael, has to be a big part of your book.

Blomkvist promises him with a nod that it will. INT. STOCKHOLM METRO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Salander moves with a crowd toward the doors of a subway car, someone behind her roughly yanks the strap of her messenger bag from her shoulder - She gives chase, pushes past people, catches up with the junkie, grapples with him. He slugs her. She goes down, but doesn't give up. Catches up with him on the escalator, throws him back down it. The bag slams onto the metal stairs, too, but at least she has it now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't run. She waits at the top and watches the junkie drag himself up and think about trying again. He wisely decides to let it go, hops to the down-escalator and disappears into the underground station. INT/EXT. COTTAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist sifts through a box containing some of Harriet's personal belongings: school papers, textbooks, a Bible, the address book, her wallet and ID ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A knock on the door. He puts the box in a closet on top of others, kicks it closed, opens the front door to find a not unattractive woman in her 50's on his porch.
</DIRECTION>
<CECILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. I thought I'd come over and say hello. I'm Cecilia.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTAGE - DAY Cecilia regards Blomkvist's Vanger family tree on the wall. Wherever he only has an old photo, there's a Post- It next to it that reads: Recent Photo? INSERT of Cecilia's photo, taken when she was a teenager, and a Post-It with her name on it.
</DIRECTION>
<CECILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're all uncomfortable with the idea of a chronicle of our family.

</BLOMKVIST>
<CECILIA>

	Unlike the one that landed you in court.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unlike that one. Correct.

<CECILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what you're saying is, you're not really here to look into what happened to Harriet.

</CECILIA>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Then -

<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't ignore such a dramatic event, but no, that's not by any means my focus.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CECILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So all those boxes Gunner carted down here - which are where? - in the closet now? - weren't Henrik's private investigation.

	Since we're talking about it, since you brought it up, what was Harriet like?

</BLOMKVIST>
<CECILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure Henrik has told you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was my age then, and so couldn't know what was really going on with a teenager any more than I can with my own daughter. You were her age.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CECILIA>
<CECILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, my sister Anita was closer to her in age.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CECILIA>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT of the photo on the wall of Anita, taken when she was about 17 years old.
</DIRECTION>
<CECILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She knew Harriet better than anyone - certainly better than I did. You should talk to her.

<CECILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't seen her in years. We never really got along.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm getting used to that comment.

</CECILIA>
<CECILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the way it is when you're always after the same boys.

</CECILIA>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People generally get over that sort of thing at a certain point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<CECILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm long over it, and won't ever have to worry about it again. She hates this place even more than I do. She left, moved to London and that was it. You couldn't pay her to send a Christmas card, much less visit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll try to track her down for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CECILIA>
<CECILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't bother.

He smiles. She studies him. Maybe he's not so bad.

INT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT As Bjurman reviews a McJesus invoice, Salander waits. The thick atmosphere reminds her of all the others she has sat in with school principals, shrinks and cops.

He grabs her hair and roughly pulls her head toward him. INT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE - LATER - NIGHT Salander eats some toothpaste in Bjurman's private bathroom. When she returns to the office, she finds him calmly writing a check.

</BLOMKVIST>
<ANITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was messed up. Like all us Vanger kids. Crazy mother. Drunken father. At least hers wasn't a Nazi like mine.

<ANITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never saw it myself, but you could tell something was going on. One day she'd be withdrawn. The next she'd be putting on makeup and wearing the tightest sweater she had to school. The next she'd be studying a Bible like a nun - no Vanger was ever religious - can you imagine? Obviously, she was very unhappy.

</ANITA>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She never confided in you what about, specifically?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ANITA>

<DIRECTION>
What caught his attention is a figure in one of the upstairs windows. He checks a scribbled floor plan of the manor and sees that it's Harriet's bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he's not sure if it's Harriet. The figure is too soft to identify - even with a magnifying glass - but is wearing a light-colored dress and has light hair. He glances to the family tree on the wall - the teenage Vanger girls' photos -

They all have light hair, and, frankly, all look alike.

He moves on to the parade pictures. To the one Vanger said before was the last picture taken of Harriet alive. It's not really of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a wide shot of the parade itself - but she can be seen in the background across the street with her friends, watching a float - atop which some women in harem outfits dance - pass by.

She pulls a Taser from her pocket and jams it under his chin, firing off 75,000 volts - EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Set down on the rugged landscape under an almost moonless night sky, the cottage looks vulnerable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT The cat, curled up on a chair, jerks its head up at a sound neither we nor Blomkvist can hear, and stays absolutely still, listening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist scrolls through the Courier negatives he has converted into positives and has loaded into Photoshop. He was right. Many more parade pictures were shot that day. Several at street level - a marching band, floats, children with balloons, some in better focus than others. He reaches the first of the higher-angle shots from the floor above the haberdashery, scans the crowd lining the street. Harriet isn't in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But in the next she appears at the edge of the frame with her school friends. In the next, she's further into frame. And the next, standing in the same spot he stood earlier today.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist selects all 18 of the high-angle parade photographs, transfers them to an iPhoto file, and reopens them as a 'slide show.' The first few, accompanied by the default music, Minuet in G, dissolve at two-second intervals. Too long. Too distracting with the music. And too wide. He adjusts the size function - closer on Harriet gets rid of the dissolve effect and music and reduces the time- interval to make the transitions as quick as possible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hits 'play' again and watches a short jerky 'silent film'- a kind of electronic flip-book:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harriet arrives with her friends. Moves along the street. Stops and faces the parade. Says something to her friends. Laughs. Watches the float with the harem girls on it. Smiles. Sees something to her left. Turns her head slightly toward it. Her eyes widen in fear. She looks down. She moves off. Her friends look after her confused. And then she's gone. Blomkvist backs up to the frame of Harriet looking off with fear in her eyes, and for the first time believes without a doubt what Vanger has believed for 40 years:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She was murdered. Whoever she saw across the street followed her and killed her. The cat watches him. INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bjurman slowly comes to.

<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. You're alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
It takes him a moment to realize it's true. Another to realize it might be better if he wasn't since he's naked on the floor, face-up, wrists and ankles bound. He tries to cry out and realizes he's also gagged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She emerges from the shadows, stands over him, and he sees that her eyes are ringed in black mascara like some kind of ghoulish raccoon. She looks insane. As she steps out of his field of view, and his hands struggle against the restraints.
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Recognize this?

<DIRECTION>
He cranes his neck to see she's by her backpack that's resting on a chair.

<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's what's going to happen. Pay attention.

<DIRECTION>
He can't. He can't even look at her. His life is over. He weeps into the gag.
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He won't. She strides to her backpack. Takes out a large dildo. Gets on her knees, and works it into his ass. She can only get it about halfway up. She has to stand up and kick it the rest of the way with her boot. He howls into the gag.
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I have your attention now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<DIRECTION>
She does indeed. He vigorously nods his head, now, and after everything she says -

<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you can walk again, which I admit could be a while, we're going to my bank. You'll tell them I alone have access to my account. After that, you'll never contact me again. Each month you'll write a report of a meeting we won't have. You'll describe how well I'm doing, how sociable I'm becoming. Then you'll negotiate with the court to have my declaration of incompetence lifted. If you fail, this video will spread across the Internet like a virus.

She kicks him. Then straddles his fat gut and looks him in the eye.

And he knows she means it.

	I know it'll be hard for you to abide by my rules. Especially no more sex. I'm going to make it easier for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She puts on a plastic surgical mask. He fears the next thing he'll see is a pair of scissors in her hand, but it isn't. It's something else he doesn't recognize. She straddles him again. He squirms under her weight.
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lie still. I've never done this before.
	</DIALOGUE>

He sees that the thing in her hand is some kind of surgical device, a shiny stripped-down gun with a sharp point and a plastic ink bottle where the bullets would go.

	There will be some blood.

He struggles to twist his body away, but it's useless. She digs the tattooing gun's needle into his chest and begins dragging it back and forth. He screams as dots of blood spatter her plastic mask ... EXT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - DAWN - ESTABLISHING

The job has taken her all night. The sky outside the living room window is beginning to lighten. She drinks a glass of water in the kitchen, wipes her prints from it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She crosses to the bedroom where Bjurman's toys have been wiped cleaned and put back in the dresser. Picks up her backpack. Looks at him. He's unconscious. She sets handcuff key next to a dark stain on his stomach.

We stay on the key as she leaves the room. Hearing the front door open and close, we rise up to see his entire naked body on the bed. Tattooed into his skin in big letters, from his nipples to his groin, is:

Returning from a walk and a smoke, Blomkvist sees - sitting outside the cottage, petting his cat - Harriet. Of course it can't be her, but it is a teenage girl who resembles the old pictures of her. Seeing him, she waves. It's his daughter.

Since all the number sequences begin with '3,' he goes to the third chapter - Leviticus - notices that its first facing page is faintly dog-eared - finds R.J's verse - 1:14 - on it:

Blomkvist, plunging a French press, watches as the girlfriend lets herself out. In the bedroom, Salander finishes getting dressed, sticks her Taser in the back pocket of her jeans and comes out to find a table setting that's more formal than she, or anyone who lives alone, is used to.

	Your boss Armansky tells me you only work on things that interest you. I guess I should be flattered. He also says you're the one he goes to for jobs that are, 'sensitive' is the word he used. I'll use 'illegal,' since that what it was when you hacked into my computer.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to do anything about that. I could but I won't. What I'm going to do is tell you a story. If it entertains you, maybe you'll decide to help me research it further. If it doesn't, I'll wash the dishes and leave ... Are you going to even touch your food?

<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not all right, she's unbearable. But it has nothing to do with you. It's between her and Henrik ... She lost it when my father died. The drinking - her state of mind - it all got so bad Henrik took me and my sister away from her, leaving her alone in our old house on the other side of the island like she was excommunicated. She's never forgiven him.

And he seems as lost now as he must have been then.

Before Blomkvist can find the verse, she's on to the next ones. More photos of murdered girls -
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eva Gustavsson, 1960. A runaway. Raped, strangled, a burnt pigeon tied around her neck. Lena Andersson, 1967, a student. Raped, stabbed, decapitated -

<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay -
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not done -

<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right, we're looking for a serial murderer ... But what does it have to do with a 16-year-old girl on an island?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Salander, as we know, is not paid to give her opinion. She's a hunter/gatherer, not an analyst. But Blomkvist asked, so she gives it -

<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was looking for him, too.

<DIRECTION>
The silence they just left has followed them out here. The island, more than ever, feels haunted as Blomkvist looks off, smoking.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rape. Torture. Fire. Animals. Religion. Anything I'm missing?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The names. They're all Biblical. The first woman, the whore, the Virgin Mary - Sara, Rakel - all from the Old Testament.

He pokes at embers in the fireplace to try coax some flames.

He takes a blanket from the back of a chair.

She takes the blanket from him and sits with it on the couch. He watches her a moment.

She switches off the lamp. Then, in a moment, in the dark -

<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harriet's name isn't.

INT. COTTAGE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Salander browses through an iPhoto album of old photographs of Blomkvist and the motorcycle he mentioned. In some of them, Erika is with him. In all of them, he's wearing a leather jacket not unlike Salander's.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<DIRECTION>
He's just woken up in a tangle of blankets on the couch to see her at his laptop. She closes the album, leaving on the screen what she was looking at before: his iMovie of the parade and some annotated police files.
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Going over your notes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're encrypted.

<DIRECTION>
She gives him a don't-be-a-child look.

<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have some coffee.

<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will. And then we'll have a talk about what's yours and what's mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist drags himself up, pours himself some coffee, adds some milk.
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's amazing what you figured out from the parade photos.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad you don't have hers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't say. He comes over. She plays the iMovie, stops on a frame before Harriet turns her head. Points to a young couple standing among the people behind her. The woman has an Instamatic camera in her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She advances to the next frame: The woman has raised the camera to her eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the next: Harriet turning her head in foreground while in the background the flash cube atop the woman's Instamatic flares slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist is stunned, by both the fact he didn't notice it before, and what it means: Though the woman is taking a snapshot of the parade, she could have inadvertently included in it whatever - whoever - Harriet saw at that moment across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes over his laptop from her, finds the later Courier photos he didn't include in his iMovie, after Harriet has left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In one, the couple is moving off the other way. In another, they're getting in a parked car to leave. He sharpens the Photoshop contrast. The rear license plate is partly visible, but too small for him to make out even by squinting.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you read that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A, C, Three - the rest is blocked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<DIRECTION>
He focuses on a decal on the car's back window. The letters are even small and blurrier, but she thinks she can make out -
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	N, something, R, S, J -

He gets up. Heads for the front door to smoke his cigarette outside -

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to have to go to Norsjo.

<DIRECTION>
He opens the door to leave and sees on the porch - The charred corpse of the cat. Its legs - sawn off and arranged in the shape of a swastika - lie in the middle of a dark circle of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He seems too startled to move, but when Salander sees it, she immediately gets her camera and begins framing close-ups of the cat parts, and its head resting atop the seat of her motorcycle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist stares off at Harald's house ...

Having returned and scanned Mildred's snapshot into Photoshop, Blomkvist better defines on his laptop its background and the people in frame across the street from where Harriet was standing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT: Couples, kids, a clown. INSERT: The watch repair shop clock that reads, 2:00.
</DIRECTION>

INSERT: A figure standing slightly apart from the other people. It's too blurry to make out his face or age, but he has light brown hair, dark slacks, and a dark blazer with some kind of patch on the pocket.

INT COTTAGE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist regards Isabella's two photos on the wall. In one she's a stunning young woman. In the other, the old wreck she's become. He glances to her husband Gottfried's photo. Where a second more current photo of him should go is a Courier article about his drowning in 1965. That's when Isabella changed - and this is where it happened - in this old house out on the point.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He untacks the article -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boathouse hasn't fared well. Neither has the dock Blomkvist has to walk on to reach it. He glances inside - no boat, just dark water slapping against the pilings - looks back to the shore at the long-uninhabited cabin. INT. CABIN - LATER - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No electricity but enough light spills through the open door for him to see the neglected, shadowy interior:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beds with bare, or no, mattresses. Sticks of furniture. Old water-stained books strewn around. Beer bottles and other debris left by intrepid Hedestad teenagers. It's creepy, even if you weren't alone in it, knowing what you know.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He kneels to look at some of the books. Mickey Spillane, a bird guidebook, something called The Evil Empire about the USSR, a children's book. He opens this last one and sees "Harriet" scrawled in a very young child's hand. EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Having climbed the cliff above the cabin, he finds himself at the highest point on the island. Stops to rest at the ruins of a fort.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A piece of the stone wall next to his head suddenly erupts. As fragments tear into his scalp, he hears the delayed crack and echo of the rifle shot -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He throws himself to the ground. Crawls desperately around and behind the ruins. Sees his shirt is bloody but can't feel a wound under it. Touches his face and finds the blood is coming from his forehead. He can see no one, and is almost relieved since if he could it would mean they were walking toward him, which would mean he would soon be shot dead, point blank. He has to get out of here before that happens. Behind him - the rocky cliff he just climbed. Ahead of him - a clearing leading to woods. Really only one choice -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs for the trees. Dives through a curtain of thicket and stinging nettles that tear at his arms and hands. Crawls the rest of the way to the woods on his elbows and toes like an infantryman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Safe for the moment, he figures, hidden in the woods, he looks at the sun low in the sky, and decides to wait.
</DIRECTION>

Salander, returned from Stockholm, moves around the cottage - inside and out - installing the equipment she brought from Milton Security: Motion detectors - security cameras - software that bisects a PC screen into quadrants showing night-vision views of each corner of the cottage.

He takes a swig from the vodka bottle. She reaches to his face with the needle and floss -

It takes all he's got not to move, and even that isn't enough as she first sticks the needle through the flesh. He pulls away with a groan.

She just looks at him. Waits for him to take another swig of vodka to steel himself. She pierces him a second time, draws the floss through the skin. And after that it doesn't seem to be so bad. As she works, his eyes glance to hers with a mixture of dread and gratitude, but hers are focused on the work. Hers then briefly glance to his, but now his are down.

He comes out of the bathroom in his soaking wet pants and collapses on the bed. She works to pull his pants off.

<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I doing here ... why did I ever come up here ...

</BLOMKVIST>
<DIRECTION>
He touches the wound and looks at his fingers -

	It's too dark to see ... did it stop bleeding ... I think maybe it has ... it still fucking hurts ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTAGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She regards the surveillance monitor, the night-vision views of the cottage. She can't believe it but she feels vigilant more for his sake than her own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to a window and looks out. Sees her own reflection in the glass and studies it. Then kicks her boots off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT She comes into the bedroom in her t-shirt and underwear. He's still muttering without looking at her.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't an accident ... Somebody was shooting at me ... It's insane ... these people are insane ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one's shooting at you now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls her t-shirt over his stitched-up head, cocooning it against her breasts. Silence. Then -
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm pretty sure this isn't a good idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He extracts his head from the cocoon and looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apart from the fact that I'm old, we work together.

<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You work with what's-her-name. That's worked out for you.

<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have some standards of behavior, believe it or not.

<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need to stop talking.

</SALANDER>
<DIRECTION>
She climbs on top of him. INT. COTTAGE - LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Afterwards. She opens his dwindling pack of cigarettes. Lights one. Glances over to him lying next to her. He's not looking at the smoke but rather the startling tattoos on her bare legs and arms. Eventually -
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to open a window?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head no. Reaches for the cigarette. Takes a drag. Hands it back. INT. COTTAGE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wakes. Comes out to find a proper place setting on the table. Sits with Salander. Listens to that awkward, but not altogether unpleasant silence you always hear in this situation the next morning. She breaks it -
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like working with you.

	People hunt on the island, Mikael. Gunner's out there shooting something almost every day for his dinner. It could have been a stray shot.

	If he needs this to do his job, he should have permission.

This goes against every privileged, confidential bone in the lawyer's body. He can only stare at Blomkvist and Salander across the room, wondering why he hired either one of them.

Vanger Industries' corporate archives are kept in the oldest building in the town's warehouse district. The rumble of Salander's motorcycle announces her arrival.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTAGE - SAME TIME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like someone visiting a relative they never liked, Blomkvist reviews yet again the photos from 'that day' - scrolling through the bridge accident shots - He stops. One of the figures has something in his hand he hadn't noticed before. It and the figure are somewhat blurred in movement - but it looks like a gun. He sharpens the contrast to reveal that the gun is in fact a Hasselblad-type camera. Looks at the man's face - then at his wall of Vanger family photos - unhappy to see it matches Harald ... INT. VANGER INDUSTRIES - LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carbon-copied or original documents from the 50's and 60's surround Salander like the water around the island:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Financial analyses, annual reports, internal memoranda, trade union agreements, brittle news clippings, corporate staff photographs, one of which she's regarding now: A much younger Frode, posing against a wall of law books. INT. COTTAGE - DAY

The photo of Harald in his Nazi uniform on the wall.

INT. HARALD'S DEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blinds, as usual, closed. Couple of lamps throw shadows on the walls which display hunting and military trophies - wild game heads, sabers and vintage firearms - some of Harald's dearer photographs - some photographs in dusty frames.

Blomkvist, alone in the room, looks at them: Swedish Nazi leader in the 1930's.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HARALD'S DEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bony Nazi pouring tea in a shadowy room with you is bad, but the rabbit-print tea cozy only makes it worse. Blomkvist tries to ignore him settling back in his worn leather chair with his chipped cup, and sifts through an old shoebox of unsorted photographs:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A holiday at Lake Como, early 1950's judging from the cars; a Vanger family gathering long ago; some men posing by a slain wild boar dangling from a rope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harald holds out a pack of cigarettes. Blomkvist comes over, pulls one out.
</DIRECTION>
<HARALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blom ... kvist ...

Harald doesn't say it, but his nod means, 'not Jewish then. Good' Blomkvist returns to the photos, glancing up occasionally to the smoke curling up past Harald's face as he examines the journalist at work.

	I'm not a recluse. I don't close my door to anyone. They just don't visit.

Blomkvist tries to nod appreciatively, but the bridge photos don't tell him anything he doesn't already know.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finds several more that appear to be a hunting expedition - men and blood hounds - but then sees Morell in one, more policemen, and a stricken Henrik in boots and raincoat, and realizes this is the search party. Off to the side, a young man, head turned half away, wearing a dark blazer with a gold patch, which that 2.8 Zeiss lens makes clear is a prep school insignia. A lion.

<HARALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Landscape? Some nice landscapes there.

	No, it's - I can't tell who it is from this angle.

<DIRECTION>
Having found nothing of interest in the 1954 files, Salander moves on to the 1957 killing of Rakel Lunde. The older woman comes back. Drops a set of keys on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDGREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay all night if you want. Leave the keys with the guard.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The woman leaves. Her footsteps echo and fade. Salander reads a yellowed clipping from a Landskrona newspaper:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's about Vanger Industries hiring a local contractor, Carlen Construction, to build a plant. Gottfried Vanger - here to sign the contract.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But all that really interests Salander is the date. The article was published one day after the paper printed the story of the discovery of Rakel's battered naked body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Salander flips through the handwritten notes she made during her talk with the retired detective in Landskrona - and finds that part-time palm reader Rakel's main job was as a cleaning woman for Carlen Construction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The detective interviewed her co-workers, but no one from Vanger Industries, including that firm's representative in town for a few days, Gottfried Vanger. Gottfried Vanger ... which one was he again? Salander brings up on her laptop photographs she took of the wall of the cottage: the Vanger family tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gottfried Vanger, Son of Margareta & Richard the Nazi Husband of crazy Isabella, Father of Martin and Harriet
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Of all the Vangers - at least back in 1950 when Harriet was born - Gottfried was the most handsome. Clark Gable good looks. She puts a check next to Rakel's name and returns to Mari Holmberg and the 1954 Vanger files.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTAGE - EVENING Blomkvist flips through one of Morell's reports stating everyone's whereabouts on the day Harriet's disappeared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT: Across from Martin Vanger's name it reads: "Arrived on 4:30 train."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He brings up the Photoshop-enhanced Brannlund parade photo on his laptop -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT: The figure with the blazer and pocket patch standing near the watch repair clock, which reads: 2:00.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the photo Harald let him take with him of 'Gottfried's useless boy' -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT: Young Martin with the search party, the emblem clearly visible on his blazer pccket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shuffles through copies of articles in Salander's victims' files. Looks at the last one, Lena Andersson, 1967. The photo is a school wallet photo -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT: She's wearing a sweater with the same Uppsala Prep School lion emblem as Martin. He looks at Mildred's parade photo of the figure standing near the watch repair clock. It reads, 2:00.

And the photo Harald let him take with him of 'Gottfried's useless boy' with the search party. In it and the parade photo, he's wearing the same blazer.

INT. VANGER ARCHIVES - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knowing what she's looking for now, Salander finds it fairly quickly: A clipping about a timber company Vanger Industries bought in Kalmar and an interview in its local paper with Gottfried, two days after Mari's murder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She jumps to 1960 - Magda Lovisa Sjoberg - Karlstad - and an article in its local paper - this time with a photo of Gottfried - about a union dispute at its factory there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COTTAGE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist comes out with his cell phone, tries to make a bar or two materialize on it. Dials but only gets a beep that asks him if he wants to 'retry.' He doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instead, under the darkening sky, he looks off to the point. Martin's house is small in the distance, but he can see there's no car in the driveway and no lights on. He stares at it for a long time ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VANGER ARCHIVES - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Salander pulls a 1962 Uddevalla paper from the files. Same day this time, the same page of the newspaper: Lea Persson's horrific murder and an story quoting Gottfried about an expansion project to the town's harbor. She regards Gottfried's newsprint photo: His face looks more than 8 years older than the one in Kalmar but that's what drinking to excess, and murder perhaps, does to you. INT. COTTAGE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist lays the Lena Andersson article - and the photograph of the figure at the parade - atop the rest of the junk on the desk - and quickly scrolls through photos on his laptop, leaving on the screen for Salander to see when she returns: Martin's recent Vanger Industries PR portrait ...

Salander has hit a snag. Gets up. We stay to have a look at the problem she leaves: the victims list - now with "Gottfried" jotted down next to all but one name: 1967 - Lena Andersson - Uppsala
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next to it, the newspaper article about the murdered girl, with a school photo. And, next to that, the reason there's no "Gottfried" notation: his obituary in a Hedestad Courier clipping: 1965. We listen to the fading echo of Salander's footsteps -

As annoying as the older woman was, it was less creepy with her around. Salander is alone in the old building now, wandering through it looking for vending machines.

Trying to look like he's just out for a stroll, Blomkvist walks past Martin's dark house, then turns around, walks up the front path to the porch and makes a show of knocking on the door, just in case anyone on the island can see him, which is doubtful in this darkness. He tries the door. Locked. Comes down off the porch as if leaving, but then veers off the path and walks around to the side of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He peers through a floor-to-ceiling window, but can't see much inside. Comes around to the back and looks in another window. Tries the back door. Unlocked.

INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can't see a lot in the dark, but doesn't dare switch on any lights. He crosses through the kitchen, but we stay behind to regard a closed basement door ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pick him up again as he comes into the living room, follow him to a wall of glass. It's pitch black outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow him down a hallway - but stop at a bedroom doorway as if this is as far as we care to go. We stay at the threshold and watch him go in and look around. As he begins rummaging around the recesses of a closet -

<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pair of headlights comes across the bridge. INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT Blomkvist comes back to the wall of glass. Still no lights out there. Heads off to the hall again. EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car parks fifty yards from Blomkvist's cottage. The headlights blink off. Someone climbs out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist comes into a study. Lots of books and framed photographs. He begins looking around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The headlights come up the road leading to the point. INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist approaches a gun case in the study. Hunting rifles. Three of them - and an empty space for a fourth one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trees outside the study window flare with light. A moment later, Blomkvist hears a sound of tires on gravel. Martin is back, and Blomkvist is in his house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We rush back down the hall with Blomkvist. Hopefully Martin will enter through the front door because we're going to try to get out the back one -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist trips over something in the dark and we go down with him. Then up again - through the kitchen - past the basement door - grabs a knife from a drawer - shoves it in a back pocket - hurries out the rear door -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Blomkvist tries to steady his breathing as he slinks around the side of the house. As he passes a window, it lights up - and we again hit the ground with him. He hurries across the yard, trips over something in the dark - a sprinkler? - and goes down again into wet muck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and starts down the road as if returning from a leisurely evening walk - which would be more convincing without the limp - not daring to look back as he goes.

Blomkvist stops. His heart pounds. Martin comes down his porch and walks toward his car.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Your evening stroll?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. How are you?

<DIRECTION>
Martin pulls a golf bag from his trunk and shoulders it.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on in, I'll make you a drink.

<DIRECTION>
Naturally, this is the last thing Blomkvist wants to do, but it would be more suspicious if he refuses. He heads back to Martin's house, trying not to limp. INT. ARCHIVES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finished with her candy bar and coffee, Salander opens the 1967 files, looks through the clippings for anything of note in Uppsala, where Lena was killed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She finds no news of factories opening there that year, but she does come across a PR newsletter about a winter retreat for fifty employees and their families.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a photo of Henrik presenting someone with a Best Worker of the Year plaque. And another taken at a dinner for twenty guests and Vanger family members: The camera has captured Henrik presiding at the head of the table, putting on a brave face, raising a champagne flute - as everyone else does the same - except for the young man at the far right foreground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks sullen. But what teenager wouldn't at an event as boring as this. Salander would look even more sullen. She checks the caption and reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... far right, Martin Vanger (19), currently studying in Uppsala.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Uppsala. Same place as Lena - though it's what young Martin is wearing that strikes her: an Uppsala private school blazer with a lion on its pocket - the same as on Lena Andersson's sweater in the photo of her in the article about her murder. INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

It's not as eerie with the lights on - except for the fact there's a killer in it. Martin sets the golf clubs down and begins emptying a grocery bag in the kitchen.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wasn't being careful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<DIRECTION>
Martin smiles, but Blomkvist isn't sure what he said warrants one. Martin begins rummaging through a drawer for a flashlight. The knife block - with one missing - is right there.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's the investigation?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing new to report.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>

Blomkvist notices a drop of blood from his pantleg on the stone floor and covers it up with his shoe. Martin, not seeming to notice, finds a mini-Maglite in the drawer.

	Dirch says Ms. Salander is clever. Maybe she'll turn something up.

Blomkvist's eyes only dart to a rifle bag leaning against the wall next to a box of shells, but Martin follows them.

Martin pulls open a bar drawer and takes from it a handgun.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A gun. Rather than a knife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
He gives a little gesture with it to the handle of the knife protruding from a back pocket of Blomkvist's jeans. There are fresh drops of blood on the floor next to his shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just couldn't stay away, could you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist doesn't know what to say. Martin's demeanor, even in this situation, remains cordial.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to show you something. Bring your drink. Leave the knife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist's hope of getting out of here unscathed is pretty much gone now. He pulls the knife from his back pocket and sets it on a side table. INT. VANGER ARCHIVES BUILDING - NIGHT

Salander strides past the napping night watchman without leaving the keys or bothering to tell him she's done. EXT. VANGER ARCHIVES BUILDING - NIGHT

Crossing the empty parking lot, she tries Blomkvist on her cell. Gets his voice mail. Kick-starts her bike. INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin "leads" Blomkvist from behind back to the kitchen, switching off lights as they go.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what's harder than shooting someone? Just missing them. That was a very good shot up at the cabin.

	It didn't work. I'm here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mikael, it did work. You're here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They come through a pantry, at the end of which is a door.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist does. Sees steps leading into darkness. As they descend Martin flicks a switch and bare fluorescent tubes flicker on to reveal: A furnace. Washer. Dryer. Old discarded furniture. And another door. A steel one. As they approach it, Martin presses a little remote and the lock on the steel door clicks.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Push it open.

INT. BASEMENT ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS

As Blomkvist steps across the threshold -
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Switch is on the left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist flips it and a row of overhead fluorescent tubes flickers on - one after the other - revealing a subterranean torture chamber:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Metal eyelets bolted to the concrete walls and ceiling and floor - table with leather straps - bed with leather straps - steel-mesh cage - work bench with handsaws and other tools -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist takes it in with one glance and immediately turns to try to smash the glass in his hand into Martin's face - which is covered now with a plastic oxygen mask he holds to it. Gas plumes down on Blomkvist from above; the glass comes out of his hand, shattering on the cement floor -

The Honda's single headlight shudders as Salander comes across the bridge onto the island.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTIN'S BASEMENT - CONTINUED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist comes to on the floor, handcuffed to a chain that runs through a metal eyelet. He sees Martin behind a video camera on a tripod, focusing it - a shelf full of Betamax tapes - and a TV monitor on which his own image then appears. Note: the steel door if we were close enough to it to notice - which we aren't - is not locked. It's not even completely shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Satisfied with the framing of the shot of his guest, Martin takes a seat on a comfortable armchair upholstered in clear plastic. It squeaks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He regards Blomkvist calmly. Sips his drink. Then almost sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you just go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I assume you mean the opportunity for that has passed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Martin smiles, appreciating, perhaps, Blomkvist's "easy" manner in this dire circumstance.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you do it? What did you find?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist doesn't say. Martin looks like he has all the time in the world to wait, and does. Then -
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can talk or we can just get on with it. It's really up to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing from Blomkvist. Martin shrugs 'okay,' gets up, goes to his workbench and takes a plastic shower curtain from it. As he's laying it on the floor around his victim, Blomkvist changes his mind -
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found a picture no one had seen before.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of.

</BLOMKVIST>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You. In your Uppsala prep school blazer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<DIRECTION>
Martin doesn't see the significance, but is pleased Blomkvist has decided to "participate." He rewards him by suspending his shower curtain work to return to the chair. It squeaks again.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does that say?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That you lied about where you were that day. Or rather when.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I? If I did, so what. People lie all the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<BLOMKVIST>

	It also said that Lena Andersson was a schoolmate.

	Where's this picture now? With all the other junk on your desk?

	A print is. Digital copies are on a secure photo site.

<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a lie ... How much does the girl know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist isn't sure how to play that question ...
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's hope it's as much as you. That'll make it more fun. Where is she?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stockholm. She went there this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's a lie. She's sitting in our offices looking at more old crap. Our archives manager called me - very perturbed with this girl. Lisbeth. I like that name. Lisbeth. When Lisbeth leaves I'll get a call from security, so I can be at your cottage to greet her when she arrives -

He holds up the keys he took from Blomkvist's pocket when he was out cold.

<DIRECTION>
He's clearly not here. She goes to the closet. Takes out the surveillance PC. Puts it on the desk - next to Blomkvist's laptop which is now displaying - not the photo of Martin he left for her - but the Apple default "light spider" screen saver.

<DIRECTION>
As Salander begins rewinding the captured surveillance images backwards at high speed to get to earlier in the day -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTIN'S BASEMENT - CONTINUED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin reframes the video camera to include part of himself in the shot, sits again and crosses his leg like this is a talk show.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what would you like to know?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
There are so many things, but also no point, so Blomkvist says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the journalist, ask me something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing from Blomkvist. Which is okay with Martin; he can do this alone -
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I do with my guests? Is that the question? Well, before - I do what we're doing. Relax, have a drink, converse. I like that part a lot - having a chat when you both know one of you is going to die. After - I simply get rid of them. Out to sea -
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(points off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- unlike my father leaving them scattered all over the place like trophies. That's not smart if you ask me. That's just garish and loud. But he was a garish and loud man. Frankly, he got what he deserved.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing from Blomkvist, but he is wondering now what happened to Gottfried if the drowning wasn't accidental.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't be a sloppy technician like that. You can't drink to excess like he did. This takes discipline. It's a science of a thousand details. The planning. The execution. The cleanup. I'm sure I don't have to tell you you're going to make quite a mess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing from Blomkvist, but Martin nods. ("How do you do this and still function in normal society?")
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the interesting thing. Because most of the time I am just like everyone else. I just have a bigger secret. It's wonderful really - standing there waiting for a train - or on a street corner as people brush past me. You know what I mean; you have secrets. You had one when you came up here. It made you feel - special. Didn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist doesn't say. Martin is a little thrown by Blomkvist's next unspoken comment -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
("Yes, but my secrets aren't rape and murder")
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'm not a rapist. Of course I do that too - and at one time it was enough - but -
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gathers his thoughts to explain it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A rapist, Mikael, gets off on domination. I need ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(discards a few other words before:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- destruction.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Martin gets up and sets about the business of immobilizing Blomkvist further with a block-and-tackle contraption of chains and straps.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I ask you something? Why don't people trust their instincts? They sense something's wrong - someone's walking too close behind them - yet they don't cross the street. You knew something was wrong - you even knew what it was - but you came back into the house. Did I force you? Did I grab you and drag you in? I just offered you a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd never think the fear of offending could be stronger than the fear of pain - but you know what? It is. They always come willingly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
It amazes him. It always amazes him. He keeps working.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then they're here. They know it's over like you do - and still somehow think they have a chance. "Maybe if I say the right thing - if I'm polite - or I cry and beg - maybe I'll survive."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(regards Blomkvist)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then the moment comes when they realize ... no, all hope is gone And when that happens - when I see the hope draining from their face like it is from yours right now -
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers like it's just between them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- well, I feel myself getting hard just watching it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>

</MARTIN>
<BLOMKVIST>

	You are a sick fuck.

<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Is this an interview or an editorial?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist, of course, doesn't answer, or comment, yet Martin considers what the journalist hasn't said ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
("Martin, civilized people don't do what you do.")
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right, this behavior is unacceptable. I know that. But we're not completely different. We both have desires. Satisfying mine just requires more towels.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Martin regards Blomkvist in a silence. Then -
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything else you want to know?

INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT Salander watches the surveillance images, forward -

Blomkvist leaving the cottage and property on foot. Blomkvist returning to the cottage, going back inside. Blomkvist coming out and attempting a call on his cell. Blomkvist going back inside the cottage. Blomkvist coming out again and leaving the property. Blomkvist not coming back. Nothing but the sky darkening to night. Then -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Headlights coming through frame. A figure appearing on foot at the front gate. The figure just standing there, looking at the cottage. The figure approaching it, and, as it's trying the locked front door, the motion detection light snapping on and illuminating Martin. Martin moving to the side, looking in a kitchen window, coming around front again, walking to the gate, turning around, looking back, then walking out of frame.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTIN'S BASEMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist hangs from the block-and-tackle rig, leather strap around his neck now, fed through a ceiling eyelet. With a big sewing scissors, Martin cuts through and removes Blomkvist's pants and underwear -
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It might amuse you to know that while you were over here having dinner with me and Liv - who, by the way, finds me very conventional - Irina was down here in the cage. Who's Irina, you ask? A girl I met in Belarus. Just another girl. Another immigrant whore. Who misses them?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He returns to his work bench to lay out various tools next to his gun and a desk phone.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your sister wasn't just another girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Martin comes back quickly and yanks a strap that cinches the noose tighter around Blomkvist's neck as it lifts him onto his tiptoes.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to her.

<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You useless fuckin detective.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
He lets go of the strap and Blomkvist's feet come back down to the floor. As Martin returns to his workbench, Blomkvist is not only scared to death, but confused now. Did Martin not kill her?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Martin is back in front of him with a roll of cellophane, pulls on the strap again until Blomkvist is balancing on his tiptoes, and ties it off.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too tight to talk?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
It is. Blomkvist can utter no sound but a gag.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. I'm tired of talking to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
He wraps Blomkvist's head in cellophane, completely cutting off his ability to breathe, and calmly watches him struggle. ...
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like me to do something about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist desperately nods as he's about to suffocate. Martin watches another several moments ... then pokes a finger through the cellophane into Blomkvist's gasping mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? I'm not a monster.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He frames a wide shot of his naked prey. Turns on some music. Takes a moment to collect himself from all this strenuous work. Brushes back his hair like he wants to look presentable in the shot. Then smiles pleasantly -
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I've never had a man in here. I've never touched a man as a matter of fact. Except my father, of course. But that was my duty. Harriet's, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The circulation to Blomkvist's head is being cut off by the strap. His fingers behind his naked back claw at the concrete wall to try to relieve some of the weight on the noose, but can't get a grip. Martin watches the struggle calmly, and just as calmly offers:
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's time. I don't want to be late for my date with our girlfriend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
He puts on a plastic rain poncho. A painter's mask. Plastic goggles. Surgeons gloves. Picks up a hunting knife. Steps up to Blomkvist. Looks at his eyes. Brings his own head close to his victim's -
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Mikael.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls the strap, lifting Blomkvist's toes off the floor, closing off his air again ... and is about to gut him like a wild boar ... when he hears a sound like some kind of animal behind him ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and sees her - coming at him from out of the shadows by the steel door - He darts for the gun he left on the workbench - Salander just as quickly swings a 5-iron - his 5-iron - like a baseball bat. Its metal-wedged end arcs through the gloom and slams into the side of his head, sending him tumbling to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He struggles up to his knees, and she swings the club again, splitting flesh and crushing bone as he crumples the floor. She takes the gun from the bench and shoves it in her other back pocket. Grabs the hunting knife and shackles key and hurries over to Blomkvist who only witnessed part of the spectacle before losing consciousness -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She saws through the leather strap around his neck. Unlocks the chain. As he sinks to his knees on the floor, blood rushes to his head, bringing him back to life just enough to see what she can't behind her -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin, blood streaming from the gash in his head, getting to his feet. But he's not coming at them; he's trying to get out -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist tries to say her name to get her to look. Lifts a hand to try to point. She turns and glimpses the monster as he disappears out the steel door. Looks back at Blomkvist, still handcuffed on the floor, and, like a child asking a parent for permission -
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I kill him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing in his life would allow him to agree to such a thing - until now. Now it's as if her years of violence and degradation have been passed to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She puts the hunting knife in his hand. Pulls the gun from her back pocket, checks the clip, flicks off the safety, and turns to leave -
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has more guns in the den -
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<DIRECTION>
She comes up the basement stairs, leading with her gun. Distant thunder rumbles. She crosses through the kitchen to the living room, and down the hall to the study. She eases around the doorway - the room is empty - looks to the gun case - sees there are only two rifles there now. She hears an engine start outside. Hurries back through the house. Sees out the picture window the taillights of Martin's car receding fast down the road as clouds burst.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She bangs out the front door. Runs halfway down the hill in the rain to where she left her motorcycle, jumps on and kick-starts it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She roars onto the bridge, chasing the taillights. Guns the bike to full throttle. Comes alongside him. He swerves to try to crush her against the railing - but she hits the brakes, avoiding the impact -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She accelerates again and comes up on the other side of the car. He swerves again at her, but this time the bike pulls ahead of him. Now he's chasing her -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gains on her as they near the end of the bridge. As they race off it, he goes in for the kill, but she veers hard to one side, leaving him headed straight for the gas station Blomkvist makes his pay phone calls from - and the tanker truck parked there -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin hits the brakes - hydroplanes into the truck - and its, or his own tank, or both, explode - Salander circles back. Regards the fire engulfing the car. The rain does nothing to dampen it. She could probably brave it to pull Martin out - but doesn't. As the flames burn his clothes, he manages to get his hands on the rifle he took from the den, turns its barrel to his bloody head - but before he can pull the trigger, she hurries over, yanks it from his grasp and stands back again. It's much more cathartic to watch him burn ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She finds Blomkvist in the living room. Sitting in a chair, his coat wrapped around him. The hunting knife in his hand. Distant sirens echo. He can still just barely manage to speak -
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HEDESTAD - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reminiscent of the last photographs taken on the Hedeby Island bridge forty years ago, police and firemen finish up at the crash site. A winch drags Martin's charred black wreck of a car onto a tow truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTAGE BEDROOM - MORNING Blomkvist is asleep in the bedroom with what looks like a neck tattoo - the black and blue mark left by Martin's noose that nearly strangled him to death. He doesn't hear the knock at the front door, nor -
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's open.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Frode comes into the cottage looking shaken. Salander is the picture of calm, drinking a cup of black coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<FRODE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Mikael?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Asleep. Coffee? There's no milk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Frode absently shakes his head no.
</DIRECTION>
<FRODE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have some very upsetting news. Martin was killed in a car accident last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Frode isn't sure he heard right. Regards Salander sipping her coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<FRODE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said it's sad.

<FRODE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you know about this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRODE>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't say any more. Frode gets up and starts toward the bedroom -
</DIRECTION>
<FRODE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to talk to
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Mikael)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRODE>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<DIRECTION>
It's not a request; it's a command. INT. COTTAGE - LATER - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frode is ashen as he leafs through a binder Salander brought from Martin's chamber of horrors late last night:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A scrapbook of murder. A death book. Photos of women cowering in his cage, tied to the bed, dead on the table - along with souvenirs of painted fingernails and locks of hair - all carefully taped into the 'album.' The older photographs are Polaroids; the newer ones digital prints. With little to no discernible emotion, Salander watches Frode wince as he turns the pages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frode can't take it anymore. Closes the book before reaching the end. Just sits there.
</DIRECTION>
<FRODE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are we going to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRODE>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going home, Mikael and me. I don't know what you're going to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<FRODE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to the police.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRODE>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show them the videos while you're at it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<FRODE>

Salander points to a stack of video tapes.
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like to see them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<FRODE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTAGE BEDROOM - LATER - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist half-wakes to find Salander lying next to him, fully-clothed, watching him. Is she actually there, or part of a dream? He looks at her a long moment, then tries out his voice -
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How is it someone who's 23 is a ward of the state?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm mentally incompetent and can't manage daily life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles, thinking it's joke. It isn't, he realizes.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since when have they said that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since I was twelve.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something happened when you were twelve?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't say. Just studies him ...
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right, you don't have to tell me anything -
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tried to kill my father. I burned him alive. Got about 80 percent of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<BLOMKVIST>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Then -
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need milk.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pours milk in her coffee from the carton she just bought. Pushes over two faded Polaroid photos. He picks them up: One shows a young girl about 14, naked from the waist up, head turned half-away from the camera. The second shows her on her stomach on a bed, completely naked, face turned to the photographer, frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harriet?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist can't look at the photos long. Sets them down. Something's troubling him -
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin didn't deny killing anyone. But when I mentioned Harriet, he was confused. He was angry - at me - for not being able to tell him what happened to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't kill her. And his father was dead the year before.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if she did somehow get away? Could she have done that? Could she have done it alone?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He goes up to his wall of suspects.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she's alive, there's only one person in this family who would know where she is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the photo of Anita down from the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - DAY Henrik sits in one of the chairs. Blomkvist in another. Salander prefers to stand. Eventually -
</DIRECTION>
<VANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor Martin.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Clearly, he hasn't been shown the death book, or been told the tale of Blomkvist's night in Martin's dungeon.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to go away for a couple days. When I come back, I hope to have an answer for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Such a possibility stuns the old man. He regards Blomkvist a moment. Then Salander ...
</DIRECTION>
<VANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would the young lady mind giving us a moment of privacy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's my partner, Henrik. She should stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A tiny, tiny, tiny smile finds its way to her face at the mention of the word 'partner.'
</DIRECTION>
<VANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have you found?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANGER>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<VANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't treat me like a child. Tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANGER>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't. I don't know. I need a week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<DIRECTION>
Vanger studies him. Then -
</DIRECTION>
<VANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've waited forty years. I can wait another week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANGER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRLINE - IN FLIGHT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist and Salander read magazines in a pair of coach seats. Across the aisle - occupying two seats - is one 300-lb. sleeping figure: Plague.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PUB - LONDON - DUSK They drink pints in an unpopular, almost-empty pub. A Cure song plays.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always liked this song.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(nothing from her or Plague)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like classical music.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A strange-looking young man comes in, regards the strange- looking trio at the table, comes over. To the fat man -
</DIRECTION>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Plague?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<PLAGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trinity.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wasp.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLAGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist starts to offer his hand before realizing no one else has or will.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Mikael.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<DIRECTION>
Trinity sits. None of these people have much experience with human interaction. They all look at Blomkvist, but he isn't sure why.
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist takes an envelope from his jacket, hands it to Trinity. He begins counting it - EXT. LONDON - NIGHT Alone in the back of a parked van amidst electronic components he doesn't understand, Blomkvist anxiously stares out a tinted window at a dark row house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Headlights flare down the street. An approaching car. He hopes it passes, but it instead pulls up to the garage - waits for the door to go up - pulls in.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He watches Anita Vanger get out of the car - the garage door come down - light go on inside the house - then dark figures hurrying along the side of the house: Trinity, Salander, and finally Plague. They climb into the van with their tools, firewires, a laptop. None speaks as they tether cables to computers in the van. Blomkvist just watches. Finally, to him -
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your turn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANITA'S HOUSE - LONDON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist knocks on the door. Anita pulls it open.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's me. Sorry to bother you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't invite him in, but doesn't shut the door in his face either.
</DIRECTION>
<ANITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one's called you?

<ANITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANITA>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your cousin.

<DIRECTION>
She has two, but doesn't ask which -
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<ANITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANITA>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He died last Thursday. A car accident. I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(nothing from her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's going to be a memorial in Hedestad. I know you haven't been back there in a long time, but -
	</DIALOGUE>
<ANITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not interested in any memorial.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<ANITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANITA>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That you don't really care for any of your relatives. Still, I thought you should know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<ANITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANITA>
<DIRECTION>
And now, she closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANITA'S HOUSE - LONDON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist returns to the van. Climbs in.
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd it go?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. I think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<DIRECTION>
He sits and watches them monitor the phone and computer taps they installed earlier. One of the laptops, without anyone touching it, blinks on to a Google screen.
</DIRECTION>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<DIRECTION>
A screen name and password characters on a Gmail page type themselves. They expect her to go to "Compose," but she opens one of the messages - spam - deletes it - marks a couple more and banishes them as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The only new thing left in the inbox is an eBay alert. Clicking it takes her to an auction for a triple-strand faux-pearl Jackie O necklace: 49 pounds. The cursor clicks the Buy-It-Now button.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the screen switches to Anita's Paypal account, Blomkvist and Salander exchange a confused glance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ROOM - LONDON - LATER - NIGHT Salander's laptop is monitoring Anita's computer, her hard-line phone and cell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist emerges from the bathroom, rests a hand on Salander's shoulder to peer over it at the screen: In one of the windows, cards are dealing themselves.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's playing solitaire?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Salander nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she still hasn't called anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do we have her cell, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Salander points to one of the windows on the screen. His hand comes off her shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was so she'd lead us to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put your hand back on my shoulder.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He does. They watch the solitaire game together ...
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's only one reason she wouldn't call Harriet. She can't because Harriet is indeed dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ROOM - LONDON - LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's strange perhaps, but he does some of his best thinking during sex -
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just thinking. What if -
	</DIALOGUE>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten more seconds.
	</DIALOGUE>

That's fair. She finishes. They lie there. Then -
</DIRECTION>

<ANITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He comes in and sits.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to show you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<DIRECTION>
He tugs his shirt collar low enough to reveal the black and blue "tattoo" around his neck. Anita is taken aback by the sight. It's hard to imagine how anyone would end up with a mark like that.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before he died, your brother hung me from a hook ... Harriet.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARK - LONDON - DAY They sit together on a park bench.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anita married in Stockholm in 1967. It's recorded in the Swedish General Register. But the family never knew, did they.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she confirms that with a shake of her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm guessing she then came here on a passport in her married name, and you followed on her maiden name passport.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, it was the other way around. She thought it safer for me to travel with Spencer myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did he think about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Only that he loved her. She said, If you love me, you'll do this and not ask why. He never did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They both died twenty years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A car accident. You found that, too.

Blomkvist nods, reaches for something in his jacket pocket - changes his mind - changes it again and pulls it out.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He hands her the less graphic of the two Polaroids Salander found in Martin's basement - the young girl, face turned half-away from the camera ...
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was 14 the first time he raped me.

	A year after the first time - after many times during that year - my father got drunker than usual one night and started bragging about women he'd killed. He quoted from the Bible as he tore off my clothes. He wrapped a belt around my neck. He wanted to kill me.

<DIRECTION>
As he comes onto the dock, she waits for the moment, and smashes him in the head with the flat side of an oar. It stuns and sends him toppling off the dock into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He surfaces, reaches for the dock planks. As he takes hold of them to claw himself from the water, she brings the sharp edge of the oar down, burying it in his head like an axe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares up her, uncomprehending. His fingers slide away from the dock. His body goes limp and sinks out of sight beneath the water.

The blanket covering Harriet on the backseat floorboard moves slightly, then is still. A policeman on the island side of the bridge waves the car across it. As it heads along the mainland service road toward the highway -

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blomkvist, Salander and Frode wait in Vanger's study. A tea service tray sits there untouched like the first time Blomkvist came here. Anna pushes a wheelchair into the room with Vanger in it. There's a file on his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you feeling?
	</DIALOGUE>
<VANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine. Thank you, Anna.

Anna leaves. Closes the doors. Before Blomkvist can say anything else -
</DIRECTION>
<VANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I made you a promise. Whether you found out anything or not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANGER>
<DIRECTION>
He holds out the file. Blomkvist takes it and sees: INSERT: Wennerstorm's name typed on it, and a fairly recent photo of him clipped to it.
</DIRECTION>
<VANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now. What do you have to tell me.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VANGER MANOR - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vanger propels his wheelchair down the main hall, but stops when he sees Harriet coming in the front door with Anna. He stares, trying to reconcile how she looks now compared to when he last saw her, or maybe to convince himself she's really alive. She sees him ...
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Henrik.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to weep. She walks to him and places a hand on his hunched shaking shoulders. Frode, Blomkvist and Salander watch. One of them isn't particularly moved.

As Frode leafs through the file that Blomkvist has already read -

	... I don't even remember Wennerstrom working here, much less being fired ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would you. It was a long time ago. Which is more to the point than the money he embezzled.

	</DIALOGUE>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, he knows you can't try somebody for this 35 years later. I like Henrik, but he knows that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Frode disagrees -
</DIRECTION>
<FRODE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A man's reputation used to mean something - he still believes that. I'm sure he thought you could destroy Wennerstrom with this in the court of public opinion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRODE>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The "court of public opinion," Dirch, makes celebrities out of girls who shop. Henrik promised me Wennerstrom's carcass on a plate. This isn't even the plate. I can't do anything with this.

	That's what you would've done. Not everyone's you.

</SALANDER>
<DIRECTION>
She's not sure she likes the comment. Decides she doesn't. Takes her arm away from his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was meant to be a compliment. Put your arm back on my shoulder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't. So he drapes his on hers. Then -
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened with Wennerstrom. How did he get you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALANDER>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was stupid. I got something from an anonymous source, who I'm sure now worked for him. It was fake. Which he easily proved in court.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Not a good day, that. Then -
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were emphatic that the way I looked into your life was illegal and immoral. Would you feel the same about Wennerstrom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOMKVIST>
<DIRECTION>
He regards her, uncertain what she means ...
</DIRECTION>
<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I started investigating him on my own. Then you showed up and hired me. I haven't had a chance to look at it all - you and Harriet-fucking- Vanger have kept me busy ... but I may have something.

INT. BLOMKVIST'S APARTMENT - MORNING

A new family tree on a wall here, more complicated than the Vanger's: The Wennerstrom Group, made up of dozens of companies in cities worldwide. As Erika looks at it -
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wennerstrom's Swedish assets are genuine, but they're the only things that are. The rest is funneled through companies in Gibraltar, Colombia, and Macao. These companies produce no products and provide no services. They're shells. They launder money from arms and drug sales, and crime syndicates in Russia. And that money - which accounts for all but 5-percent of his holdings - ends up in accounts in the Cayman Islands. It's a completely illegal, criminal empire.

What looks like 16-year-old tattooed runaway lets herself in with her own key. Crosses past Erika with a paper bag, takes out two bagel sandwiches, the same kind Blomkvist brought when he barged into her apartment. As she puts some water on for coffee, Erika looks at Blomkvist. He nods. Yeah. Her.

	In the current issue of Millennium magazine, he now charges the same company that successfully sued him - The Wennerstrom Group - of criminal activities on a global scale - backing it up with internal financial reports, bank records and emails - annotations almost as long as the article itself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
The cover of the magazine features a head shot of Wennerstrom, and, rare for the magazine, a tabloid-style title: GANGLAND. Salander leafs through the article as Blomkvist brushes his teeth in the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOMKVIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll call it a personal vendetta but it won't work. FI can't ignore banking and securities fraud like this. The police can't ignore the organized crime stuff. They'll both have to investigate.

Sitting with a different bank manager now as security cameras keep silent watch, she opens her portfolio and turns it so he can see its contents. He glances up with a polite smile that's supposed to mask his surprise.

<HASSELMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many of these would you like to convert for deposit?

<SALANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All fifty. Into five accounts.

He works out the conversion to CHF and hands her the calculator: A "2" followed by more digits than we can count.

The remnants of a McDonald's kids meal on the desk with the wig and white gloves. She bypasses the hotel's internet service, uplinks her MacBook through her cell. Five accounts - the ones she just established at Bank Dorfrmann - appear on the screen. She transfers all the funds into one account at Bank Kroenfeld, Cayman Islands, belonging to a Gibraltar company.

Irene/Salander puts her empty portfolio in an unlocked locker, wipes the prints from it, heads for the platform.

INT. TRAIN - MOVING - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She has a private sleeping berth, but isn't sleeping. She's smoking a cigarette next to a No-Smoking decal on the window that's cracked open, and tosses the Zimmerstal Hotel pen out to the darkening countryside rushing past.

INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Salander - looking like Salander - enters her apartment with only her laptop bag. Holds Irene's passport over a stove flame. Sets the burning document on a plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Takes a Coke from her fridge, sits with it. Puts the cold can to her forehead like a compress. Then opens it, drinks, and closes her eyes ...

A dark figure is looking up at her apartment, at television light playing on a window. As he walks off into the night, we see it's Bjurman.

The place is trimmed with Christmas decorations again. In a glassed-in conference room, Blomkvist, Erika, and a few others sit around the table, their production meeting interrupted by the news on the plasma TV here:

INT. TAILOR SHOP - STOCKHOLM - DAY A tailor brings out a garment bag bearing his exclusive insignia, drapes it across a table, returns to Salander the photograph she provided him with last week: It's of a much younger Blomkvist - at about Salander's age now - wearing the black leather jacket he loved and lost track of years ago.

INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - DUSK

<DIRECTION>
A perfect Christmas card vista that actually turns out to be a Christmas card: A snowy rural landscape scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's stupid, but she's writing under the pre-printed "Merry Christmas" inside, a personal note that's more sincere than she thought herself capable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She blows on the ink, puts the card in its envelope, neatly writes "Mikael" on it, gets up -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STOCKHOLM - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snow's falling, but unlike the brutal winter storms last year, it's just heavy enough to dust the city in white powder that reflects the Christmas lights in the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beauty of her city pleases Salander as she rides through it on her motorcycle. Or maybe it's something she's feeling as she turns onto Blomkvist's street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She parks. Gathers the garment bag and card, walks under construction scaffolding toward his apartment building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From around the corner ahead, Blomkvist and Erika appear. He says something and she laughs, puts her arm around his waist and lays her head against his neck scarf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Salander stops mid-stride, ducks into an alcove under the scaffolding, waits as long as it should take them to get inside the building, then peers out again - They're not inside. They've stopped just outside the building's entrance. They're embracing. And the longer they stand there together, the sharper the pain stabs at Salander.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally they separate, but only to allow Blomkvist to unlock the door. Erika takes his hand then, and they disappear inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Salander can't move. Waits for the pain to subside - which it eventually does - but only to be replaced with a sense of helplessness. Then that subsides, replaced with a facade of insouciance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The richest girl in Sweden emerges from the alcove and walks back the way she came - tossing the garment bag and card into a construction dumpster - climbs onto her Honda - starts it - and drives off -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Probably forever.
</DIRECTION>
