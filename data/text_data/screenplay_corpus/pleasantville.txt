(setting down the toolbox)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll get you fixed up in no time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He pops the top of the tool box while Jennifer and David just stare. It's a strange looking box with the same happy family painted on the side. TV Repairman pulls out another remote.
</DIRECTION>
<TV_REPAIRMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.

<DAVID>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, we didn't call any TV repair.

	Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?

Jennifer shuts the door and crosses down toward the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.

	The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment there is a huge FORK OF LIGHTNING and a booming
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAP OF THUNDER. It literally rattles the walls of the house as TV Repairman turns toward David.
</DIRECTION>
<TV_REPAIRMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pleasantville?

David recoils slightly. TV Repairman flashes him a smile.

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at David, speechless, for a moment, then smiles fondly and reaches beside him for his tool kit.
</DIRECTION>
<TV_REPAIRMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooomph?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<TV_REPAIRMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll take it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He flashes them a big smile and holds out a weird looking contraption that seems more primitive than space age. It's a strange combination of an early transistor radio and Flash Gordon ray gun. TV Repairman extends it with pride, while Jennifer and David stare at him warily...
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks...
	</DIALOGUE>
<TV_REPAIRMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I better get going. Your show's almost on, and...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling at Jennifer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's almost time for your date.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
There is a SECOND CLAP OF THUNDER even louder than the first. He smiles at them, then starts across the living room, pausing at the front door to look back. There is a weird smile on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<TV_REPAIRMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take care now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
David and Jennifer look at one another while the front door shuts with a THUD. It's quiet for a second or two before there is another CLAP OF THUNDER. David cocks his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DIFFERENT ANGLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances down at the strange contraption sitting on the coffee table. It looks a little scary. Slowly, very slowly, he reaches down and touches it. Nothing seems to happen so he picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER.

David points the remote toward the TV set with an apprehensive look on his face. He winces a little, then pushes one of the buttons.

It all seems normal as he pushes another button. This time the channel changes.

<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(relaxing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He continues to press the button, flipping through the channels. Jennifer sees that everything is fine and reaches for the remote.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lemme see that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way.

He continues to flip through the channels, coming to rest on the Pleasantville Marathon. BUD'S VOICE fills the room.

She tugs the remote while David yanks in the other direction.

<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.

They wrestle with the remote, inadvertently POINTING IT AT THE TV. At that moment, a weird thing happens:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge white light emanates from the set, like its own atomic blast wave. The entire room is filled with a BLINDING AURA for a second or two, before it actually gets sucked into the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE ANGLE. LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>

It is suddenly empty--illuminated only by the soft glow of the picture tube. David and Jennifer are nowhere in sight.

:SC: INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (PLEASANTVILLE) DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David and Jennifer are standing in the middle of the 1950's living room, dressed in Bud and Mary Sue's clothing. They still clutch the remote control in the exact same position that was occupied by their fictional counterparts. David and Jennifer glance at one another, then look horrified around the room. THE WORLD HAS TURNED TO BLACK AND WHITE...

George Parker (Bud and Mary Sue's father) enters from the landing whistling a happy tune. He's dressed in a gray suit with a gray shirt, and a dark gray tie with little gray dots.

(as if to his own children)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi Sport, hi Muffin...Better get a move on, you're gonna be late for school.

He continues to cross through the living room whistling into the kitchen...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uchh! Look at me! I'm like so...pasty!

He glances down at the remote control that sits lifeless in his hand. David frantically presses the buttons but nothing happens. All at once, there is a voice behind them.

All at once the scene on the TV changes and TV Repairman's picture gives way to a WIDE ANGLE SHOT OF THE WAGNER HOUSE. DUSK. Mark Davis is standing at the front door, BANGING on the brass knocker. He checks his watch, shifts restlessly for a moment or two, then turns and heads down the flagstone walk never looking back.

TV Repairman shakes his head and walks out of the shot. David grabs the remote and starts rapidly pushing buttons. Nothing happens. He crosses to the TV, spinning the dial, but comes up with nothing but local programming. He returns to the empty test pattern.

David and Jennifer walk two steps into the kitchen when they suddenly freeze--agape at the spectacle in front of them:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV -- PARKER KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every breakfast food imaginable has been laid upon the table. There are hotcakes and sausages and biscuits and eggs. Pitchers of orange juice are dwarfed by the mountains of ham. The table literally sags under the weight of the food. George Parker lowers his morning paper and smiles at his children.

	Morning kids. Better get a move on or you're going to be late for school.

Jen looks around this cheery little street, and the horror starts to dawn on her. At that moment, they hear a screaming SIREN and a bright GRAY FIRE ENGINE comes racing up the block.

<DIRECTION>
WIDER.

<DIRECTION>
Jennifer and David step back on the curb as the firemen come flying out of the truck, grabbing the ladder on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DIFFERENT ANGLE. (FOLLOWING THE FIREMEN)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They work in perfect precision. Two firemen grab the base of the ladder while a third takes the front. They go tearing across one of the lawns, in full "emergency response" anchoring the ladder into the ground and winging it up into a tree.
</DIRECTION>
<FIREMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mere, kitty...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He emerges a moment later with the cat who was stuck in the tree. Jennifer sinks to the curb as he carries the kitten by them, petting it gently as he goes.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God, we are. We're stuck in like 'Nerdville'.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes her head)
</DIRECTION>

	I always knew you'd pay a price for this. I knew you couldn't be hopelessly geekridden for this long without suffering some like, really tragic consequences.

<DIRECTION>
(voice wavering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...But it's just not fair. I mean--I'm starting to get really--popular. Debbi Russell transferred to another school and my skin's been great since March and Mark Davis is starting to come around and...

<DIRECTION>
Jennifer turns to see a strapping blonde seventeen year old driving by in his convertible. He is extremely handsome with Jack Armstrong features and a Letterman's sweater. Despite her crisis, Jennifer's jaw drops open as he slows to a crawl. Skip Martin flashes a huge Pepsodent smile. The guy is a "dreamboat".

Skip turns to see the fireman hand the kitten to its owner and climb into the truck.

He takes off down the street with the sun glinting on his really keen convertible. Jennifer gapes as he disappears around the corner.

:SC: INT. GEOGRAPHY CLASS. LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It looks like a propaganda film from the Eisenhower Administration. The boys all wear crew cuts and short sleeve button down shirts. The girls all have lacy dresses buttoned to the neck. Everyone stares straight ahead at a pulldown map where Miss Peters stands with a pointer in her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_PETERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last week Class, we discussed the geography of Main Street. This week, we're going to be talking about Elm street. Can anyone tell me one of the differences between Elm Street and Main Street?

Jennifer looks stunned as several students nod.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_PETERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, Tommy. It's not as long. Also, it only has houses. So the geography of Main Street is different from the geography of Elm Street.

ANGLE. JENNIFER

She glances around at several students who seem to be nodding in agreement. All at once, she thrusts her hand into the air.

	Mary Sue.

	Outside of Pleasantville... What's at the end of Main Street?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The class lets out a knowing groan--as if to say "Oh. We get it now. Boy what a stupid question." Miss Peters gives a kind but condescending look.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_PETERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Mary Sue. You should know the answer to that. The end of Main Street is just the beginning again.
	</DIALOGUE>

Miss Peters gives a big grin as a series of heads nod up and down. Jennifer stares straight ahead, dumbfounded....

There are fifteen to twenty boys scattered around the Gym. Each is dressed identically in white shorts and black socks with a "PLEASANTVILLE" Jersey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT. DAVID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands at the free throw line with a basketball in his hand. (Not exactly an athletic image.) David lets go of a jump shot that swishes effortlessly through the net. He looks a little surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at the backboard slightly intrigued. David retrieves the ball and fires again, this time chucking it up blind. The ball sails through the hoop again, HITTING NOTHING BUT NET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT. OTHER SIDE OF THE GYM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ten to twelve of his teammates fire simultaneously at the hoop. ALL OF THE SHOTS SAIL THROUGH THE HOOP, NONE EVEN NICKING THE RIM. The boys retrieve their shots as the coach claps his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<COACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it men. Keep it up. Big game tomorrow.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. DAVID

He gets the ball and turns his back on the basket completely. David flings the ball wildly over his shoulder. It bounces off all the walls of the gym, then glides through the net as smoothly as the others. He stares in amazement.

	I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me...

All at once, Skip takes the basketball he's been holding and hurls it toward the hoop. The ball does a couple of revolutions of the rim, and then amazingly pops out.

The screen door swings open and is held there by the end of a Letterman's sweater. A moment later, Jennifer sashays through, parading her new Jane Russell profile.

He enters the soda shop adjusting his paper hat. A young couple makes out passionately in the doorway--all tongues and hands. When they break David sees that the girl's cheeks are FLUSHED WITH RED. He stares at her for a beat as they return to normal. David shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLLOWING HIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses to the counter and grabs his pencil and little pad of paper. Various things have already GONE TO COLOR AROUND THE ROOM: The JUKE BOX.... The COKE SIGN..... THE NAUGAHIDE STOOLS.... David starts down the aisle when his sister's arm reaches out and stops him.

DAVE BRUBECK drifts out of the soda shop as David pauses for a moment, and looks at the door. The same couple that was making out before are at it again. This time, when they part, however, the color doesn't fade. They remain rich and saturated. David takes a bite of his cookie and goes inside.

He glances at the booth beside them. All the kids are staring up at him, with a weird expression of awe.

He crosses to the booth where Skip and two others look up at him. It's like Elvis has entered the building.

David hesitates, weighing his words.

<DAVID>

	Oh. Well--where I used to live...That's just what firemen did.

This sends a MURMUR through the shop. The boy leans forward.

<TOMMY>

<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(carefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um...Out-side of Pleasantville.

<DIRECTION>
This sends a much LOUDER MURMUR rifling through the kids. It's like electricity. They glance excited at one another. A hush descends.

Margaret Henderson (the girl with the cookies) stands in the doorway staring at David. She hangs on his words with the same excitement as the others.

She's ten feet away but might as well be touching him.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(slowly)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Um... Well...There are some places where the road doesn't go in a circle. There are some places where it keeps on going.

There's an excited giggle. They lean forward.

He moves forward extending a book. The boy is in full, rich color. The cover reads: "THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN." David opens the first page. There is printing inside, with COLOR illustrations...

	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The pages filled in?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther. David flips through the book and sure enough only the first chapter has print. The pages are blank after that.

She has moved closer and is gazing at him from a couple of feet away. It's silent in the soda shop.

<DAVID>

David looks immediately down to the blank pages of the book that aren't blank anymore. Rows and rows of FRESH NEW TYPE materialize in front of him. He turns to the back of the book, that is complete with a COLOR illustration.

At that moment, Lisa Anne, the girl with the red tongue, walks by them with an armful of books. She wears a plaid skirt, tight angora sweater and BRIGHT RED LIPS. Her EYES SPARKLE A BRILLIANT BLUE. She smiles at the men as she passes and their eyes nearly fall out of their head. They follow her progress down the block.

<DAVID>

	Are you alright?

Betty turns around to face him. HER FACE HAS TURNED COMPLETELY TO COLOR. THE EYES ARE GREEN. THE LIPS ARE RED. SHE HAS A NATURAL BLUSH IN HER CHEEKS. In fact the whole thing looks like a beautiful color portrait except for the tear stains on either side of her face.

<BETTY>

He crosses to the counter and grabs her purse. David sits Betty on a kitchen chair and fishes inside the handbag for her compact. He finds it along with a wadded up Kleenex.

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay--first we'll dry you out a little.

He dabs at the tears, while she smiles at him in gratitude. Then David opens the compact and takes out the large GRAY powder puff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a truly amazing sight. As David smears on the makeup, she returns gradually to BLACK AND WHITE. The skin tones disappear. The flush of her cheeks goes. David takes out a DARK GRAY lipstick, obliterating the bright red of her lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE. OVER BETTY'S SHOULDER.

He works on her for a second or two, then takes a step back. All at once, David seems to wince:

<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV. BETTY'S FACE.

<DIRECTION>
The life is gone from her face. In an instant Betty has gone from three dimensions to two. She stands in front of him, the fictional version of herself all over again.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
(off his reaction)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

David shakes his head and forces a smile. He hands her the compact so she can examine herself. Betty holds it up to her face, turning her head first right, then left.

Betty takes a deep breath and fluffs her hair. She grabs the plate of Pineapple kabobs and heads for the door. Just before she goes in, she pauses, then plasters on a big wide "stewardess" smile....

Massacio's "Expulsion of Adam and Eve" leaps off the pages in vibrant, tortured color. The beauty of the garden is offset by their agony and their shame. HE TURNS THE PAGE.... Titian's "Venus of Urbano". Soft, fleshy, in a rich golden light. She is utterly real and entirely nude. The folds of her flesh almost seem to glow....

Faintly, almost imperceptibly, the SOUND of a rich ARIA begins to UNDERSCORE THE IMAGES. It's so faint you can't be sure you even hear it at all.... like you're hearing it with your eyes. He TURNS THE PAGES faster: Breugal's "Harvesters"... Turner's "Steam Train"... Monet's "Cathedral"... Cezanne's "Oranges"... Mr. Johnson shuts the book.

Margaret stops in the street and turns to him: a moment of truth. All at once, he abandons the speech.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...You want to go out with me tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He wants to turn away but doesn't. David forces himself to look back at her. All of a sudden she beams. It's the whitest, pearliest smile in the world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ELM STREET. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David comes flying around the corner in complete jubilation. He vaults over a picket fence, swings around a lamppost and leaps off the bumper of a parked car. David hi-fives into the air at no one in particular and sails over Mr. Simpson's hedge almost decking him in the process.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He races across the street bobbing and weaving like an All American fullback. David bounds up his front steps two at a time flinging open the door.

He lets the door slam behind him as he takes off his apron and tosses it on the coat rack. David starts up the stairs, when he HEARS a MAN'S VOICE coming from the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>

He pauses a second and glances back.

<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David....

<DIRECTION>
He peers into the living room. David goes a little grayer.... HIS POV. TELEVISION TV Repairman is looking back at him from the middle of the TV screen. He seems to have a bit of a stubble.

He gives a gooney laugh. David just looks at him....

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't.

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to... um.... The look turns suddenly dark and ominous.

<TV_REPAIRMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to... to change the tape in the register...
	</DIALOGUE>
<TV_REPAIRMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(getting testy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Re-runs?
	</DIALOGUE>
<TV_REPAIRMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

She sits on the bed staring down at the front cover of a book. (It's an alien experience.) Jennifer is just about to open it when she senses something and glances toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE.

Bud is standing in the doorway just staring at her. He seems to be out of breath.

He keeps breathing hard in the doorway. David holds the remote in his hand.

<DAVID>

He takes a couple of steps into the room and then suddenly stops.

<DAVID>

(still stunned)

	<DIALOGUE>
	It is.

He just stares at her for a second as his mind seems to drift....

<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what is it?

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...

David stares at the wallpaper in her room like it's a window or a mirror or something. He seems a million miles away. Jennifer shifts closer to him.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I ask you a question?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.

<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(back to earth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I don't know. Maybe...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(thinks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...it's not just the sex...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
(looking up quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at him wide-eyed like someone who has just heard their name called. Jennifer's eyes dart around like she's calculating a math problem. After a moment or two, her expression changes: a vague look of recognition.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, maybe it's not.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She glances down at her book. It's a big book. Jennifer takes a deep breath and stares at the gray skin of her hand. After a second or two, she looks back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David looks at her for a beat...

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MARGARET HENDERSON'S HOUSE. (MAPLE STREET) DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David gets out of his "dad's" convertible, carrying a dozen "gray" roses. He takes a deep breath and heads up her front walk....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CAR. DAY. LATER...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David sits behind the wheel of the borrowed car with Margaret Henderson by his side. He concentrates hard on the road, holding the wheel at "10 and 2" as he steals a glance to his right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV. MARGARET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's not quite evening yet, and late afternoon light makes her glow. Margaret smiles as she turns her face into the warm wind that swirls inside the convertible....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT. DAVID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He studies her for a moment or two, then suddenly swerves to avoid a parked car on his right....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass a sign with a happy family on it that reads: "NOW LEAVING PLEASANTVILLE"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Main Street turns into a winding country road as they leave the town behind and head off into the woods. They wind through the dense woodland for a moment or two before a second sign appears, much like the first:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"NOW ENTERING PLEASANTVILLE"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DIFFERENT ANGLE. THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sure enough, the town emerges in front of them again, completing the 4 dimensional circle. David looks confused.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um...You gotta turn off Main Street.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over at her and smiles. Margaret turns on the radio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CAR. DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM COOKE sings for them as David turns from Main Street onto a smaller unmarked lane. The car starts to rise up a small hill, with Dogwood trees blooming on either side of the road. It continues to climb up the narrow gravel lane toward the crest in the hill. David looks over at Margaret who takes a deep breath shutting her eyes. He glances down at the seat between them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV. CAR SEAT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ROSES THAT WERE GRAY HAVE SUDDENLY TURNED TO COLOR. They sit next to him on the seat: a deep, rich RED...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David looks up and out the windshield. The same thing seems to be happening around them.... Many of the Dogwoods have started to turn PINK. Not all of them, but at least fifty percent of the petals have "bloomed" in some weird false spring. The road twists and turns on its way to the top, as they finally reach a crest in the hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV. LOVERS LANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There, sitting in front of them, is a whole world gone Technicolor: THE LAKE IS BLUER THAN BLUE. THE WEEPING WILLOW IS GREENER THAN GREEN. THE DOGWOOD PETALS (all "turned" now) SWIRL IN THE WIND LIKE SOME STRANGE PINK SNOWSTORM. A LONG LINE OF PASTEL CARS STRETCHES OUT ALONG THE SHORE.

Slowly, David rolls the convertible forward. Many of the kids have left their cars and sit down along the grassy bank by the edge of the water. A few of them have books open. It almost looks "Athenian."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David looks at the whole scene for a moment then suddenly cocks his head to the side.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that smell?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE ANGLE. LAKE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful wild rose in mid-bloom eats up half the frame, while David and Margaret stare at the view in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MAIN STREET. DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Betty is staring into the window of the FLOWER SHOP with a shopping bag on either hand. From a ways away, she looks like any other homemaker in Pleasantville. You don't even notice the gray make-up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER. FOLLOWING BETTY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She nods to Mrs. Filmore in the bakery and smiles at Don in the Post Office. Betty is just about to turn on Elm Street when she glances up, and suddenly stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV. ACROSS THE STREET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There, in the middle of the block, sits Mr. Johnson's soda shop. The whole scene is still black and white, except for the large CUBIST PAINTING THAT FILLS MR. JOHNSON'S WINDOW. It is rendered in bright PINKS, YELLOWS AND ORANGES, and looks like a Braque or a Picasso except for the unusual subject matter. Upon closer examination you see that all the spheres and cones add up to an avante garde snow scene, with a Cubist Santa hovering over the roof tops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT. BETTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at it, mesmerized for a moment, then starts to wander across the street. It's late afternoon and the business district is empty. Betty crosses in the middle of the block, staring straight ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SODA SHOP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and she sticks her head inside. Most of the place is dark except for one streak of sunlight shining through the window near the back of the store. Betty glances around. The little bell JINGLES as she enters.

He sits in front of a small easel near the back, staring at a board which doubles as a canvas. Mr. Johnson glances over his shoulder and recognizes Betty in the doorway.

	Oh, hi....

He gets up from his stool and crosses toward the door, still holding the palette in his hand. Betty stares at the "Cubist Christmas" in the window.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just thought..... It's beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MR_JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.

Their eyes lock for a second. Sort of a clutzy silence. Mr. Johnson motions toward his easel.

<MR_JOHNSON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just trying to do one of these "still lifes."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Having kind of a tough time. He sighs and looks beside him. Next to the easel is a bowl of GRAY FRUIT. Betty moves down the counter, glancing at the painting.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it looks nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MR_JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's what it's s'posed to look like.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches across the counter and grabs the art book. It's open to a Cezanne that nearly burns off the page.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are standing almost on top of each other gazing down at the book. Neither one of them moves. Betty almost disappears into the pictures--drawn by a strange new world.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. Look at this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to Kandinsky--a massive swirl of color. The image is nearly electric.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
(breathless)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd you get this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MR_JOHNSON>

He turns the page near the back to one of Picasso's "Weeping Women." The woman is rendered in pink and red and green. Her head is a large sphere, laying "peacefully" on her own shoulder.

<DIRECTION>
He looks up at her.....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A single tear is running down Betty's cheek. She senses it and reaches up to wipe it quickly away, but instead of just wiping the tear, she takes off a huge swath of GRAY MAKE-UP. A long strip of PINK FLESH is revealed underneath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. MR. JOHNSON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares up at her in amazement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE BETTY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She senses something and glances down at her hand. Her fingertips are covered in GRAY MAKE-UP. Betty turns and bolts for the door.

He stops her near the door and she turns her face toward the wall. Mr. Johnson touches her shoulder.

<DIRECTION>
He reaches up and gently touches her chin. Mr. Johnson moves around to glimpse the other side of her cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She freezes like that for a moment, then slowly, haltingly, turns toward him. THE COLOR of her real flesh is revealed underneath. Betty stands there exposed.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_JOHNSON>
<DIRECTION>
(a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	....It's beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She swallows, not sure what to do. Betty glances down.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shouldn't cover that up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Johnson reaches over to the little napkin dispenser on the counter and pulls one out. He leans forward and dabs at the tears beneath Betty's eyes. Then slowly, gently, he starts to wipe the makeup off her cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER STILL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She recoils a bit, tensing up, then just looks at him. Mr. Johnson is gazing at her "true color" with wonder and acceptance. She hesitates for an instant, then seems to make a decision. Betty slowly turns her face to the side, exposing her flesh all the way down to the neck. Mr. Johnson continues to wipe off the make up in larger and larger strokes as the beautiful pink flesh begins to emerge....

CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. JENNIFER'S (MARY SUE'S) ROOM. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lies on her bed, reading the same book she was browsing earlier. Jennifer seems strangely engrossed as she flips the pages, lying on her stomach, scouring every word. After a moment or two she gets restless and shifts position, lifting the book. The cover is plainly visible: "LADY CHATTERLY'S LOVER."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't have enough light so Jennifer rises from the bed and crosses to "her" desk. She sits in the chair and flattens the book in front of her. Jennifer is deep into the plot and doesn't even look up as she flicks on the desk lamp. She could almost be studying algebra as she sits upright at the little desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DIFFERENT ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She flips the page and peers more intently. Her hair is bothering her so she pulls it back and knots it in a pony tail. It's cold by the open window and she puts on a sweater. After a little while her eyes begin to get more tired and she looks up and blinks a couple of times. Jennifer notices something across the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pair of Mary Sue's glasses are neatly folded in front of her. Jennifer reaches out, puts them on her head, glances back down at the print.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
(impressed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hunh.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She can see much clearer now. Jennifer folds her hands in front of her and doesn't even realize that she has mimicked the PHOTOGRAPH OF MARY SUE THAT SITS BESIDE HER IN A SILVER FRAME. The face is the same, but that's to be expected. So is the pony tail, the glasses, the posture and the studious look on her face. Jennifer turns the page engrossed in her novel when there is a loud TAP on the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rises from the desk and pulls back the curtain. Jennifer slides open the window.

Margaret laughs like that isn't even possible. She shifts on the grass hiking her skirt up above the knee. It reveals a long tan leg beneath it. David watches as she kicks off her shoes, rubbing her feet through the long cool grass.

	Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Here. Look at this. She hops up and scampers across the grassy bank, kicking her heels behind her. Margaret reaches a tree in the distance and reaches toward an upper limb, stretching out her body like a piece of statuary. She picks a piece of fruit and scampers back toward him, hiking up her skirt as she goes....

It is cubist (like the rest of his recent work) but that isn't the shocking part. Even though she sits in front of him fully clothed, Mr. Johnson has painted a beautiful, sensual nude. Betty just stares at the canvas, stunned to see herself revealed like that. The COLORS are all hot pinks and oranges and yellows--like some Fauvist celebration of summertime. There is another even LOUDER

Margaret gives him a little giggle then opens the umbrella. She puts it back on her shoulder and turns a series of pirouettes-- like her own kind of rain dance. Margaret points her face up to the sky as if she is being showered by a summer storm. All at once a pair of HEADLIGHTS round the corner.

The crowd is moving toward him. A woman walks in front of a group of young men who circle around her, taunting and harassing her. A moment later David can make out the face: BETTY clutches her handbag to her chest while the crowd circles her like a pack of dogs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER. BETTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ROSY HUE of her face stands out in stark relief to the black and white faces around her. Betty holds her head high with dignity (and fear) while the ugly epithets overlap one another: "Oooh--let's see the rest of you... Let's see what's under that nice blue dress.... Bet she's even pinker than her picture..." One of the boys yanks at Betty's skirt and she quickens her pace. Just at that moment the boy is shoved to the ground....

	Wow.

<DIRECTION>
David lowers the paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DIFFERENT ANGLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is SILENT in the soda shop. Everyone sits motionless for a moment or two, letting the decree sink in. David just stares down at the piece of paper in his hand with a weird kind of sadness. Off in the corner, however, one of the boys has been fiddling with the jukebox and hasn't paid any attention to what was being read. All of a sudden, his voice rings from the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. This thing still works.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He hits a button and BUDDY HOLLY's voice fills the soda shop. RAVE ON blares at almost top volume recalling a more festive time.
</DIRECTION>
<BUDDY_HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well all the things that you say and do Make me want to be with you-oo-oo....
	</DIALOGUE>
<LISA_ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly/in a panic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn that off!

<DIRECTION>
The boy looks back at her.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA_ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(shrieking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not allowed to do that now!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He flinches and pulls the plug from the wall. The jukebox winds down with a groan as the electricity drains out of it. David looks at the kids then suddenly speaks in a calm clear tone.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He walks across the soda shop and plugs it back in. The kids watch spellbound at this personal display of defiance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER SHOT. SODA SHOP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buddy Holly's voice fills the Soda Shop but it has a suddenly different meaning. All the kids listen spellbound, as if to an anthem, while the Rock and Roll lives up to its rebellious reputation.
</DIRECTION>
<BUDDY_HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The little things that you say and do Make we want to be with you-oo-oo... RAVE ON! It's a crazy feeling... RAVE ON! It's got me reelin'...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer looks over at her brother with pride. Betty puts an arm around Mr. Johnson, feeling a little stronger-- a little safer... The kids seem to relax a bit, and even if they don't feel totally reassured, at least they don't feel ashamed. Twenty "colored" faces listen as Buddy Holly tells them RAVE ON. David stands beside the jukebox like a captain at the helm of his ship....

<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Johnson is standing in the middle of the shop, staring at the large piece of plywood where his window used to be. He just gazes at the thing as if he could look through it. There's a faraway look in his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT. DAVID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rises carefully from the booth, without waking Margaret. David crosses over to Mr. Johnson and speaks in a whisper.

CLOSE UP. DAVID

<DIRECTION>
He just nods. David glances down at the table next to him. He picks up one of the brightly painted shards of glass and just looks at it. It's orange and pink and yellow. David thinks for a second.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>

	Maybe I have an idea.

CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MAIN STREET. DAWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same paper boy who rode into the trash can, peddles down Main Street tossing his papers toward the curb. He throws right toward the post office, then left toward the hardware store, then right toward the bakery, then finally looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time the boy slams into a trash can. He tumbles off his bike and stares straight ahead in disbelief...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV. TOWN HALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two men sleep at the base of the wall next to a clutter of paint cans. Above them, however, is painted A VIVID ALMOST UTOPIAN MURAL OF THE TOWN OF PLEASANTVILLE in LIVING COLOR. Instead of being drab, the place literally gleams with life. The post office turns out to be a RICH RED BRICK. The sky shines in vibrant BLUE. It is a rendering of what the town could look like..... David and Mr. Johnson sleep soundly next to their own signatures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. PAPER BOY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns around and rides and away as fast as he can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP. DAVID AND MR. JOHNSON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David opens his eyes. Mr. Johnson stirs a moment later. They look straight in front of them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small crowd has gathered gawking at the brilliant colors revealed in front of them. There is a growing BUZZ in the air...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles slightly as the BUZZ gets louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV (TIME CUT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd has grown, as has the noise. A good portion of Pleasantville stares at the massive mural plastered across the police station... All at once, Big Bob fights his way through the front of the crowd...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT. DAVID AND MR. JOHNSON
</DIRECTION>

They sit upright in front of their creation proud, difficult. The NOISE of the crowd grows even LOUDER. The bright colors glisten in the sunshine...

A group of "colored" kids hangs out by the police station. They stare off in the distance, at the orange light glowing from David's jail cell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. JAIL CELL. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - NEWSPAPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large advertisement on the back page reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"TOMORROW! TOWN HALL 10 AM! PLEASANTVILLE'S VERY FIRST TRIAL EVER!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It depicts a cheery judge holding up his gavel with a smile. David lowers the paper and looks around his new surroundings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trial
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE. JAIL CELL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place has never been used so there is still plastic wrapping on all the sheets and pillow cases. He can't help smiling. David hears the jingling of keys...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT. POLICE CHIEF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches David's cell from the other direction and knocks gently on the bars. David turns around.
</DIRECTION>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's someone to see you Bud.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He sits upright on the bunk trying to think who it could be. After a moment, he hears the sound of the key turning in the lock.

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hi...

<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George enters the cell carrying his jacket and a small brown paper bag. He glances around the cell. It's a weird new experience.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this a bad time?

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I appreciate it.

George nods and takes a deep breath. He fidgets a little.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know your Mom went out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.

David just looks at him. George stares straight across the cell.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(big forced smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, there's so darned many gadgets in that kitchen. I didn't know it was so complicated. You got that timer on the oven and it won't turn on without that timer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glances at David)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you know it didn't work without a timer?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No I didn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't either. I always told her. I always said "Betty... My job is one thing, but your job, hey, that's something else."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
David nods. His "dad" stares right at him.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told her that Bud. I said it to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
David just stares.

<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well if I said it to her, then why would she "go out."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think it has anything to do with you.

<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well that's good.

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(sitting on the cot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm not sure either. Jeez. It's all so cockeyed right now. I didn't even know it was Tuesday. Tuesdays we play bridge with the Jenkins but there was no bridge so...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He heaves an exhausted sigh and just stares straight ahead on the cot. He glances at the jar of olives.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I have one of those?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. You hungry?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
George nods emphatically. He takes the olives pries off the lid.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(stuffing two in his mouth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Benson was making a meat loaf next door. I almost climbed in the kitchen window.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
David smiles. George wolves down three more olives, then suddenly pauses.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened Bud? One minute everything was fine and the next...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What went wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing went wrong... People change.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP GEORGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and looks right at David. There's a stunned expression on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(a brand new concept)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People change?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP. DAVID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It hits him as well -- as if he's heard the words for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(nods, a brand new concept)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... People change.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause...)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?

<DIRECTION>
MOVING CLOSER ON DAVID
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(slowly...)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... Sometimes they realize that what they thought they needed isn't what they need anymore...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(thinks...)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes they see that what they're scared of -- they don't need to be scared of anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(quieter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes they just... let go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George straight ahead, stunned. A couple of seconds go by.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can they change back?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
David looks down at his own skin. It's a bright rosy color. He smiles...
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I think that's harder.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They sit quietly in the cell for a moment. Finally, George jerks himself out of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, yeah... Just not fair, you know. You get used to one thing and then...

<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(re: himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It isn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Several seconds go by.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I better get going.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He rises from the bunk and puts on his jacket. All at once the stark image of the black and white armband fills the room. David stares at the "two shaking hands". George glances down at it as well.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got a meeting later...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you take these with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
David extends the jar of olives to his "father" who looks down at them.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks Bud.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the jar then turns and leaves the cell. David watches him head down the hall, before glancing back at his window. David rises and crosses to it peering out of the bars.

:SC: INT. TOWN HALL. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place has been transformed from meeting hall to courtroom. The huge Chamber Of Commerce symbol still adorns the back wall, but instead of the podium, there is now a judge's bench. Big Bob sits several feet above the proceedings finally living up to his name. He reads from the indictment.
</DIRECTION>
<BIG_BOB>

	You are charged with descration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of The Pleasantville Code of Conduct and "Laws of Common Decency."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE. ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David and Mrs. Johnson sit alone at a table in the middle of the room. The "Jury" lines either side of the chamber like some weird image from the Spanish Inquisition. There is a Black and White section on the ground floor and a "colored" section above. Franz Kafka meets "Inherit the Wind."

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary. There is a MURMUR and a great deal of nodding amongst the black and white faces. David turns and locks eyes with Betty who is seated in the front row of the balcony.

	Well--it was dark out....

<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was accessible to everyone.

	I didn't mean to hurt anybody. I just have to paint... I have to...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I could paint something different. Maybe I could use less colors or something... Or just -- you know -- certain colors. Maybe you could pick them before hand and then they wouldn't bother anybody...

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have a right to do this.

<DIRECTION>
There is a murmur in the courtroom. David continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" around here, but, there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly... or Sexy... or Dangerous... or Wild... or Brief... And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.

Slowly, almost imperceptibly he nods. A single tear rolls down his cheek. As it traces the side of his face it leaves a long trail of COLOR behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now don't you wish you could tell her that?

He nods again and it all comes out. Betty smiles at him through her tears. Even Mr. Johnson smiles as well.

	THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.

	What do you want to do to me right now?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Big Bob starts to tremble. He shakes with rage as David moves closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>

(CONT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making-out in the street. No one's getting their dinner--hell, you could have a flood any minute....Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked....
	</DIALOGUE>
<BIG_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not going to happen!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it could happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BIG_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No it couldn't!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Big Bob looks at David and starts to tremble. It starts around the base of his neck, spreads quickly up the rest of his head. After a moment or two, Big Bob has gone completely RED IN THE FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gasp goes through the courtroom. David looks at him and just smiles. The crowd reaction turns almost to a ROAR as Big Bob sits there confused.

Betty leans over the rail.

<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bud...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up as she tosses him a compact makeup mirror. David understands immediately and smiles at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. DAVID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses to the bench and opens the compact. David holds it right up to Big Bob, putting him face to face with him own, ruddy reflection. Bob stares in horror at the mirror then looks down at his bright pink hands. He freezes for an instant, then bolts from the bench fleeing the courtroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. DOORWAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Big Bob flees, he flings open the doors to the courtroom revealing an amazing sight: the TOWN SQUARE GLISTENS IN LIVING COLOR. The huge lawn is a rich deep green. The sky is a dense opaque blue. Dozens of spectators bolt from their seats and rush to the doorway as the crowd moves outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PLEASANTVILLE. (FULL COLOR!)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the birds are really chirping. Red Brick, Yellow cars, Green hats... The barber pole in front of Gus' has finally turned to red, white and blue--he can't help smiling. David walks out into the sunlight and stares in wonder at his creation. The whole town is washed in joy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margaret comes up and throws her arms around him. They meet in a rich passionate kiss (in direct defiance of the code of conduct). Several people around them actually clap, like spectators at a wedding. Jennifer moves up next to them and looks at her brother making out.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uch... I am like gonna hurl....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
David turns and looks at her. Both of them laugh. Then he glances across the street and pauses for a moment. David turns and starts down the steps of the town hall...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLLOWING DAVID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves across the street to the small row of shops on the other side. He stops and stares in the window of Philco TV store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Farewell
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV. NORM'S TV STORE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There, on the screens that once held TV Repairman is a late fifties travelogue showing a world of possibilities: The Eiffel Tower, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Hong Kong, Egypt, the blue shores of Hawaii. All of them are vividly real and all are in living color.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT. DAVID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's over now. He stands for a moment and just stares. A quiet smile spreads across his face...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. TOWN SQUARE. THE NEXT DAY...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a lush green park now -- the birds have something to sing about. Betty sits on a park bench next to her George. They look out across the square at Main Street in the distance. There's a breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(quieter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... Are you going to stay with him?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches over and takes his hand. George looks at his wife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS from HIS CLOSE UP TO HERS as she takes a deep breath.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not 'him' or 'you'. It isn't. I just need to think for a second. I never took a minute to stop and think... I just... I never...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MR_JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_JOHNSON>
<DIRECTION>
She looks back at him. The CAMERA PANS back but instead of George sitting on the bench beside her, it is MR. JOHNSON.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MR_JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

<DIRECTION>
Betty leans against him. Mr. Johnson puts an arm around her and kisses her gently on the forehead...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David and Jennifer stand together on the edge of town. She clutches a valise in her hand. He holds the remote control.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This thing works now. We could go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stand on the edge of town (which finally has an edge.) A large sign says: "Springfield 12 miles" and for the first time, the end of Main Street is no longer the beginning. Jennifer is dressed in Mary Sue's clothes with a little bit of style thrown in. Rich fields of wheat spread out in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JENNIFER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(thinks...)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honestly... no.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They both smile.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You got the admissions letter.

He pauses and looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles, nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll come back and check on you in a month. Jennifer nods and gives him a hug. She holds on tight for a couple of seconds.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're like the coolest brother in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
David smiles. Never been called cool before. They suddenly hear the SOUND of a motor and look to their left. A huge Greyhound bus lumbers up the highway, pulling to a halt at the sign. The doors open beckoning her in. Jennifer smiles at her brother, then turns toward the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PARKER HOUSE. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In glorious color now. The CAMERA begins to push up the walkway one last time.

<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got to see what it's like. I've got to try it.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be back and see you... I promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No you won't.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure I will.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just don't forget me. Even if you don't come back, I just don't want you to forget about me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She throws her arms and clings onto him, like a farewell at the train platform. Margaret clings onto him for several seconds, then finally lets go. She hands him a brown paper lunch bag.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- lots of stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to look in the bag...
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A meat loaf sandwich... And a hard boiled egg...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(softer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...And some marshmallow rice squares.

Betty is standing in the doorway with a letterman's sweater draped over her arm. She shares a glance with Margaret then crosses down to David.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's some fried chicken in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just cause you're not here anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I won't.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you weren't gonna...
	</DIALOGUE>
<BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
(painful, quieter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had to come say goodbye.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up at him and their eyes lock. Betty unfolds the sweater.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
(fighting it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a pretty short trip.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She drapes it around his shoulders and fusses with the collar. Betty arranges his clothes for a second or two, then finally throws her arms round his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Bud, I'm just so proud of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks...

<DIRECTION>
She hugs him tigher and whispers something in his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT) (nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I love you too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She clings on tight for a second or two then lets go. Betty flicks away a tear and draws a deep breath.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She steps back and looks at him. David glances down at the remote.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You better stand back a little.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Betty and Margaret cross toward the corner of the room. David points the remote at the TV...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MODERN HOUSING TRACT. DUSK.

<DIRECTION>
All the ersatz Spanish houses stretch out toward infinity. A WESTEC security patrol cruises by them at a crawl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. DAVID'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands in the middle of the living room looking at his new/old surroundings. Everything is the same as it was: The black onyx coffee table, the sleek white Berber rug -- black tile in the entry and the stark white walls. David glances around the room still clutching the remote control in his hand. The only sound comes from the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<TV_ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well that concludes the first hour of the Pleasantville Marathon; boy was that a weird episode. Don't forget folks, we go all night long till noon tomorrow...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
David smiles and reaches forward shutting off the TV. A sudden smile descends on him. He stands there, in the silence for a moment, when a strange SOUND comes from the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLLOWING DAVID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses toward the noise and after a moment it becomes clear: the unmistakable sound of a woman sniffling...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV. KITCHEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David stops in the doorway and stares. There are four Louis Vuitton bags next to the kitchen table. His mother (his real mother) faces away from him, still in spandex jogging clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns back to him. There's a tissue in her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_S_MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you went out of town.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID_S_MOM>
<DIRECTION>
(breaking again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She trembles slightly and stifles a cry. David crosses to the kitchen table.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to cry all over again. David's Mom shakes her head trying to draw a deep breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_S_MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I don't know. It's all so fucked up. I got halfway down there and then I thought, "what am I doing?" He's nine years younger than me and it doesn't make me feel younger it just makes me feel older...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_S_MOM>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I stopped in the market to call him and there was this young couple getting out of a station wagon with two kids and a big lab and I thought, "that was me. That used to be me."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to cry again.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_S_MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, when your father was here I thought well this is it. It's always gonna be like this. I have the right house and the right car and the right life...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no right house. There is no right car...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID_S_MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God. My face must be a mess.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She chokes back a sob and wipes away a tear. There is mascara all over her cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It looks beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID_S_MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, that's very sweet of you but it doesn't look beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure it does. C'mere.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a tissue from the box on the kitchen table and (aware of the parallel) begins to wipe the smeared makeup from her face. She glances at her reflection in the shiny black oven.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_S_MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God. It's not supposed to be like this. I'm forty- four years old...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not supposed to be anything. Hold still for a second.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He continues to clean his mother's face as she looks at him with a strange new expression.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_S_MOM>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you get so smart all of a sudden?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He stops for a second and smiles to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a good day.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXTREME WIDE ANGLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They sit alone in the half lit kitchen surrounded by her suitcases. David, carefully, gently continues to wipe the smeared makeup off her face as the MUSIC builds...

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

Across the universe
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF SHOTS. PLEASANTVILLE. FULL COLOR (END CREDITS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC CONTINUES (Frank Sinatra: Vo-La-Ray) as the town explodes to life in rich, drunk, saturated color. The most mundane pieces of daily living acquire a weird new meaning in their reds, and greens and yellows: A tire is changed... a grapefruit gets smelled... a lawn is watered... The CREDITS ROLL...
</DIRECTION>
