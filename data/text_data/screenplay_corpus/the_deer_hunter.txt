EXT. PENNSYLVANIA STEEL MILL - LIGHT SNOW - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The plant is massive, grime-streaked, squatting in the valley under five massive stacks, each one trailing a black ribbon across the winter sky. Fires can be seen flickering through the windows and long flames weave and dance from the tops of guyed metal flues. Steam rises in clouds from vents and chimneys and the sound of it all -- the hissing, the clanging, the rumbling, the shrieking -- comes faintly, muted by the falling snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the foreground is a street -- COLUMBINE STREET -- which inhabits the bottom of a narrow ravine and plunges directly down the hillside, straight at the mill. Columbine is a sad looking street, a grim-looking street, a street hanging on by the skin of its teeth. Dilapidated stores hug the narrow sidewalks. Battered signs squeak in the wind. Sandwiched between the stores and scattered on twisting roads along the hillside are narrow Victorian houses. These houses, which run to three stories or more in height, all seem on the verge of toppling over, and undoubtedly would, except that they are all connected one to another by a mad arrangement of utility lines which cross and re-cross between them with occasional aid from a leaning pole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC COMES UP -- dissonant, rather frightening music -- as we watch a car come charging up through the slush on Columbine Street. As it nears CAMERA the car falters on the slippery grade and slides out of sight. A figure appears, huddled against the driving snow. The figure disappears AS CAMERA HOLDS ON THE STEEL MILL AT THE END OF THE EMPTY STREET.

<DIRECTION>
MAIN TITLE COMES UP:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DEER HUNTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STEEL MILL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A white-hot ingot shoots out of an ejecting mechanism and comes ripping down a track. Another ingot follows it, and another and another and another. The ingots are huge, trembling with heat, and they come on with a terrifying rumble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREDITS ROLL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDER CREDITS we see STEELWORKERS catching the ingots with tongs and deftly swinging them into troughs. The STEELWORKERS wear leather aprons and are stripped to the waist. Warped in heat waves and glistening with sweat they seem like figures in some hellish ballet. Since they all wear goggles it is hard to distinguish between them, but there are three, who are young, who seem to work with particular grace. These are NICK, SAL and MERLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREDITS END. CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, SAL AND MERLE. The noise is deafening, the heat is unbelievable and the ingots come on with murderous speed. Taking advantage of a slight pause MERLE jabs NICK and they both make cuckold's horns at SAL. SAL blushes and waves them off with his hand. MERLE and NICK make the horns again and now SAL puts both hands on his hips, gives a thin smile and studies the corner of the shed. MERLE and NICK begin laughing. SAL can't hold out and he starts laughing too, but now the ingots begin roaring down the track again and they all grab their tongs.
</DIRECTION>

INT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - ALTAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A very old PRIEST is making preparations for a wedding ceremony. SAL'S MOTHER hovers around him as he unlocks a cabinet and takes out white tapers and a golden crown which will be used in the service. The PRIEST moves with agonizing slowness and SAL's MOTHER is in the midst of a bad case of nerves.

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another car lunges up the hill, gets about halfway and slides back. As the car disappears, the door to one of the houses bursts open and a group of giggling BRIDESMAIDS begin scampering across the street. They have all been working on their dresses, which are not completely finished, and they all carry ribbons and scissors and pieces of material. As they make their way to the other side of the street they all wave away the snowflakes and grab each other for support. One of the BRIDESMAIDS loses her dress entirely and with everyone laughing she rushes back to retrieve it in her slip. When the garment is repossessed a door comes open and the BRIDESMAIDS disappear inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA HOLDS ON COLUMBINE STREET. The snow slants across the little stores and piles on the gables of the tipsy little houses. Another car appears, lunges at the hill and slides back. Suddenly the door to the bakery comes open and a group of OLDER WOMEN emerge carrying a huge wedding cake with a miniature bride and groom standing on the top. The WOMEN are all in their fifties and bundled in boots and dark overcoats. They begin moving slowly up the street, in the driving snow, with the great white cake held firmly between them.

INT. V.F.W. POST - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is large and drafty and rundown. A huge American flag hangs from the middle of the ceiling. Under it WOMEN are laying white table cloths on trestle tables. Off to one side a half dozen OLD MEN wearing VFW hats are Scotch-taping paper ribbons to the brick wall. Two OLD MEN are on stepladders, two more are bracing the ladders and the operation is under the direction of a pair of World War I VETS standing side by side. Their hands tremble. Their four eyes loom huge behind corrective lenses.

Suddenly there is a commotion. The WOMEN who are setting up the tables all rush to the door as the OLDER WOMEN come in with the wedding cake. The OLDER WOMEN look half-frozen and as they move toward a table the cake receives a great chorus of Uhh's and Ahh's. Suddenly one of the OLDER WOMEN collapses. Friends rush to her aid, seat her in a chair and give her wine. The WOMAN takes the glass, tosses it off in one swallow and grins. EVERYONE laughs.

INT. JOHN'S BAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is packed with boisterous STEELWORKERS drinking boilermakers. Deerheads are mounted in a long row over the bar, and hand-painted murals decorate the walls. The murals depict hunting scenes and display an eerie tone -- at once comical and frightening -- as if the animals held some secret from the hunters, some power beyond their own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN bangs out from behind the bar with a tray of beer. At the same moment SAL comes in with NICK, MERLE, ALBERT and VINCE. JOHN, who is a great bear of a youth, puts down his tray, wraps his arms around SAL and begins jumping him around the floor, grinning ear to ear. The STEELWORKERS turn, desert their places and swarm around SAL, joking and shouting congratulations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LINDA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LINDA is thin -- a skinny slip of a thing with a hauntingly lovely face. Wearing her bridesmaid's dress she stands alone in the kitchen, staring at the ceiling. Thumping noises are coming from the room above. The thumping gets louder. There is a crash, then another crash, as if furniture were being thrown around. A MAN'S VOICE begins cursing and there is more thumping and crashing. Suddenly there is a thud... and then silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LINDA bites her lip. She crosses to the stove, ladles stew into a bowl, butters bread, pours a cup of tea and puts it all on a tray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LINDA'S HOUSE - FATHER'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is a wreck of broken furniture. Chairs are turned over, lamps are smashed and the pictures hang cockeyed on the wall. In the middle of the room, face down on the floor, is LINDA'S FATHER. His coat is torn, one shoe is missing and he holds a half-empty bottle in his hand. Behind him, through the open window, snow is blowing in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LINDA comes in with the tray. She stands for a moment expressionless, looking down at her father. Then she sets the tray on the bureau and kneels beside him.

LINDA reaches down, takes her FATHER by the shoulder and rolls him over. It takes some effort and the face that comes up is gray, unshaven and implacably bitter. Saliva dribbles from his mouth, there is a cut with the stitches still in it seaming his forehead and as LINDA looks at him he begins cursing again.

LINDA gets up and closes the window. She comes back, gets down on the floor beside her father and pushes him toward the bed. Then, hiking up her bridesmaid's dress, she takes him by the shoulders again and heaves him onto the coverlet. The effort is almost too much for her. Tears begin to burn in her eyes, but when he slips back she tries again. The father groans, begins to mumble, and then, when she almost has him on the bed, he suddenly lifts his hand, catches her full in the face and pushes her violently across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LINDA crashes backwards over a fallen chair and smashes into the wall. As she gets to her feet her father advances on her.

INT. JOHN'S BAR - DAY

NICK, SAL, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN are dancing. The MUSIC is at top volume and the smoke is thick enough to cut with a knife. Suddenly, from the back, comes a CHORUS OF SCREECHES AND FEMALE RECRIMINATIONS. The door to the alley bursts open and the HEFTY LADIES WITH TRUNCHEONS appear. The STEELWORKERS take one look, gulp their drinks, grab their heads in their hands and rush for the front door.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY

<DIRECTION>
The trailer is a dented two-tone pink and cream job which looks as if it had been purchased third-hand off a construction site. It stands on cinder blocks in a small lot which has been cut out of the side of the hill. A wrecked school bus decorates it to the right. On the left is a bare branched tree. NICK's black Cadillac is parked in front and a light shows from inside the trailer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PICKS UP MERLE who is strolling toward the trailer whistling through his teeth. He is wearing his tuxedo and carries a knapsack and a deer rifle. He mounts the cinder block steps and pounds on the trailer door. NICK opens the door and waves him in.

They are hard faces -- working class faces -- but we sense a fortitude among the congregation, a community of both heart and spirit.

NICK catches LINDA's eye and they hold each other across the intervening space like two children who are amazed.

The Band is going full blast and the whirling COUPLES, young and old, are laughing. We see SAL and ANGELA, NICK and LINDA, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN. The only one of the group not dancing is MERLE. MERLE is drinking, standing alone on the side of the floor chugging beer in tense, rapid-fire gulps. We sense immediately that he feels out of place, at a loss to join spontaneously in the spirit of the party. MERLE finishes the beer, crumples the can and starts on another. As he picks up the second can he notices that a SAD-LOOKING GIRL is sitting against the wall behind him, waiting for someone to ask her to dance. The SAD LOOKING GIRL gives MERLE a smile. MERLE pretends not to see and moves behind a post.

The wedding cake that was carried in earlier has now been attacked from all sides, but the miniature bride and groom are still standing in the middle. Unnoticed by each other SAL'S MOTHER and ANGELA'S MOTHER eye the little figures. Both women are in rather teary condition and begin moving toward the cake. Suddenly, as the CROWD shifts, they encounter each other face to face. Smiles are exchanged -- strained smiles, which get stretched and stretched and stretched. Then, in unison, they desert the smiling and remove their respective offspring from the cake. SAL'S MOTHER looks down at her sugar coated groom and ANGELA'S MOTHER looks down at her sugar coated bride. Then they eye each other, burst into tears and throw themselves in each other's arms, moaning and sobbing.

Suddenly he notices that NICK has crossed to the SAD-LOOKING GIRL by the wall. He has stopped in front of her and is asking her something. The SAD-LOOKING GIRL gives a blush, gets out of her chair and NICK takes her in his arms and begins to dance. The SAD-LOOKING GIRL looks transformed. She begins chattering and laughing.

The LIEUTENANT bayonets a few of the fallen U.S. SOLDIERS -- idly, without much interest -- and then cracks a joke as he rubs his finger in the Americans' blood. The V.C. SOLDIERS laugh, spear a few AMERICANS themselves and repeat the joke.

The V.C. roust the VILLAGERS from their huts, smashing them in the back with rifle butts. One of the SOLDIERS emerges from a hut carrying two small BABIES upside-down by their feet. One of the WOMEN cries out. The SOLDIER gives her a kick, swings one of her BABIES in the air and lets it go. The BABY turns over and over against the blue sky. As the BABY comes down ANOTHER SOLDIER catches it through the neck on the end of his bayonet.

The VILLAGERS -- about twenty of them -- have been formed in a line. As the SOLDIERS look on the V.C. LIEUTENANT walks up and down trying to extract information. The SPEARED BABY lies in the dust between the two groups. The SECOND BABY tries to play with it. The SOLDIER who threw the dead baby in the air squats nearby and yawns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRASS HUTS - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERLE approaches between the huts. He takes a quick look around the corner, finds the V.C. all bunched in a neat package and draws back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA CLOSES ON MERLE'S EYES. They are cold, dreaming things, glittering blankly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRASS HUTS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERLE spins out with the B.A.R. on full automatic. The V.C. SOLDIERS go down screaming, arms and necks thrown back, in a thin mist of spraying blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ABOVE THE CHATTER OF MERLE'S B.A.R. WE HEAR A GROWING ROAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. APPROACHING AMERICAN HELICOPTERS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are five of them, coming in low under the tops of nearby trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRASS HUTS - THE VILLAGERS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VILLAGERS stand motionless, staring at the helicopters and frozen with terror. They turn. They start to run. And then they disappear in a roaring wall of burning napalm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRASS HUTS AFTER NAPALM ATTACK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERLE stands alone with his B.A.R. surrounded by clouds of billowing black smoke. There is no sound but the rush of heated air and the faint crackle of flames. MERLE'S clothes are burning. Flames are licking up his trouser legs and a blob of napalm is burning fiercely on his helmet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front of MERLE the SOLDIERS and the VILLAGERS lie in two charred heaps. The BABIES lie between them. Both are motionless now, like two roasted stones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An AMERICAN LIEUTENANT steps out from behind one of the burning huts. MERLE and the LIEUTENANT spin on each other and then the LIEUTENANT lowers his carbine.
</DIRECTION>

MORE AMERICANS appear, some twenty of them, coming out of the trees in a long line. Among them are NICK and SAL.
</DIRECTION>
<LIEUTENANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Move it out, girls! Move it out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIEUTENANT>
<DIRECTION>
The LIEUTENANT heads down the line. NICK stares at MERLE.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merle?... Jesus, Merle!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
MERLE turns and looks at NICK. There is no recognition. He seems to be looking right through him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAL comes up behind NICK.
</DIRECTION>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey...! Hey, Merle!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<DIRECTION>
A shot rings out. The LIEUTENANT goes down and suddenly the whole line of AMERICANS is caught in a murderous cross-fire. Grenades rain out of the trees. MERLE, NICK and SAL dive for cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of the smoke V.C. SOLDIERS begin to appear, more and more of them, swarming out of the jungle in scores.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are looking at the ground where three pits have been dug and fitted with bamboo gratings which are held down by stones. The ground is ankle-deep in running mud and the pits are filled with water to within a foot of the bamboo gratings. In each of the pits are about a half-dozen men -- SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN. Their hands grip the gratings and their eyes are hollow. Other than an occasional groan there is only the sound of the falling rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A V.C. SOLDIER trudges out of the jungle. As he reaches the pits he notices the hands, curses and begins jumping up and down on the bamboo gratings. The hands disappear. As soon as one comes back, the SOLDIER stomps on it, shrieking with laughter. Then, almost as an afterthought, the SOLDIER pulls down his pants and squats above the center grating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA TILTS SLOWLY UPWARD. We see the clearing in its totality. It is a raw hole hacked out of the jungle and contains only two structures. One is a large bamboo "tiger cage" with a few leaves tied to its top. The other is a small hut with a thatched roof. The walls of the hut are open and we can see V.C. GUARDS moving about inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cry comes from the hut. There is the THUD of a rifle butt on flesh and the cry abruptly stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THATCHED HUT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the middle of the hut is an American kitchen table with a rose-patterned plastic top. At opposite ends of the table are two chairs. A SOUTH VIETNAMESE PRISONER sits in one of the chairs. In the other chair, facing him, is MERLE. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE has a welt on his head and one of the half-dozen V.C. GUARDS in the hut is screaming at him. In the middle of the table, between the SOUTH VIETNAMESE and MERLE, is a single-action .45 caliber revolver with an American eagle carved on its ivory grip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERLE sits quietly, waiting, but his eyes are working, taking in every detail of the scene. The V.C. GUARD gives the SOUTH VIETNAMESE a final cuff, takes up the revolver with a dramatic flourish and loads one cartridge into the chamber. Immediately the OTHER GUARDS begin placing bets. The GUARDS are a ragged bunch -- wet, half-drunk on captured Budweiser, and it takes some time to straighten things out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERLE looks off to his right:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THATCHED HUT - REVERSE ANGLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see more SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN prisoners standing against the wall. Most of them have been badly beaten and all have their elbows tied behind their backs. In among them, standing beside one another, are NICK and SAL. NICK looks grey, like a skinny ghost. SAL is out of control, sobbing quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THATCHED HUT - ORIGINAL ANGLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The betting is now completed. The V.C. in charge waves the .45 around and calls for silence. Then, closing the cylinder containing the single bullet, he points the revolver at the ceiling and clicks through the empty chambers until the revolver goes off with a ROAR. Bits of thatch flutter down from the ceiling. The V.C. GUARDS shout enthusiastically and grin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERLE sits motionless. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE across the table from him begins shaking uncontrollably.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The V.C. in charge now reloads the revolver with one cartridge, snaps the cylinder shut, puts the gun on the table between MERLE and the SOUTH VIETNAMESE and gives it a good spin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The revolver slows and finally comes to a stop pointing at MERLE. MERLE stares at it for a long beat. Then he picks it up, spins the cylinder, cocks it, puts it to his temple and pulls the trigger. The hammer falls on an empty chamber with a loud CLICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERLE places the revolver back on the table and pushes it toward the SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE begins to tremble again. Fumbling horribly he finally manages to get the gun in his hand. He spins the cylinder, cocks the hammer and puts the gun to his temple. The gun weaves around. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE closes his eyes and pulls the trigger. There is a loud CLICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERLE takes the revolver again. He spins it, cocks it -- all in one smooth motion -- puts it to his temple and pulls the trigger. There is another CLICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERLE pushes the gun back across the table. This time the SOUTH VIETNAMESE takes it up with sudden confidence. He spins the cylinder, cocks it, puts it to his temple and pulls on the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THERE IS A ROAR. THE PISTOL IS FLYING IN THE AIR AND THEN THE MAN'S HEAD, HALF-EXPLODED, CRASHES OVER ONTO THE KITCHEN TABLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERLE doesn't even blink. The GUARDS begin hooting and laughing, wiping pieces of brain from their clothes, and MERLE watches them, watches every gesture, every movement... like a cat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THATCHED HUT - LATER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pile of bodies lie by the steps in the pouring rain. The bodies are both SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN. Their heads are all variously blown to pieces and SEVERAL HUGE RATS are already feeding on them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THATCHED HUT - TABLE AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK is at the table now, opposite a SOUTH VIETNAMESE. He holds the pistol by his chin, spins the cylinder. His face is twitching, dripping sweat and both he and his opponent are holding onto each other's eyes as if they had been at it for a long time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK raises the pistol to his temple, CLICKS OUT. The GUARDS murmur. NICK pushes the pistol across the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THATCHED HUT - PRISONER END - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are no Americans left to play except SAL. The sobbing has stopped but SAL is shaking and trembling and his eyes wander around in their sockets as if they been cut loose. MERLE, who lies on the floor nearby, is trying to talk to SAL. As he does so we hear the CLICKS coming from across the room and the excited MURMURS of the GUARDS as their betting choice survives another round.
</DIRECTION>

<SAL>

(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merle, I wanna go home!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<DIRECTION>
There is an EXPLOSION from the other end of the room. SAL'S eyes go wide and he lets out a whimpering SCREAM. The GUARDS open a path and NICK appears. His knees won't support him and the GUARD who is holding him throws him on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<MERLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me, Sal. Do it! You have to do it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERLE>
<DIRECTION>
The GUARD who delivered NICK jerks SAL to his feet and drags him of f to the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THATCHED HUT - TABLE AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAL is thrown in the chair. A SOUTH VIETNAMESE is placed opposite him. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE is a kid, even younger than SAL, and he is trembling with terror.
</DIRECTION>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, listen, you can do it.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believe me, you can do it. We can both do it. Then we go home, see? Then we go home!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<DIRECTION>
SAL looks down. The pistol is ending its spin and the muzzle comes up pointing at the SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE stares at the gun and tears begin to fill his eyes. The GUARDS begin yelling at him, urging him on and then SAL gives him a SMILE OF SUCH UNWAVERING FAITH that the SOUTH VIETNAMESE picks up the gun, fumbles the cylinder around, cocks it and puts it to his temple. For a moment SAL and the SOUTH VIETNAMESE look at each other. THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE IS TAKING HIS FAITH STRAIGHT OUT OF SAL'S EYES AND NOW SAL GIVES HIM ANOTHER ENCOURAGING NOD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUTH VIETNAMESE BOY squeezes the trigger. THERE IS AN EXPLOSION AND HIS HEAD DISINTEGRATES WITH A ROAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAL sits motionless, his jaw hanging open and his face formed in an expression of terrible puzzlement. Then his face begins to move, begins to twitch, as if the muscles were trying to discover a frown. SAL looks around. He looks back again at the place where his friend was sitting and he begins to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TIGER CAGE - HEAVY RAIN - FOLLOWING DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A half-dozen SOUTH VIETNAMESE sit huddled together in the muck on the uphill side. A seventh lies sprawled on his back, DEAD. The rain pours through the few leaves placed on the roof and splashes in great cascades in the middle of the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the downhill side are SAL, NICK and MERLE. SAL is in a fetal position, gripping his knees and rocking himself back and forth. His eyes are vacant and his face is fixed in an expression of horror, as if he were still watching the boy at the table blow himself away. Beside SAL is NICK. NICK sits slumped against the bamboo. One knee is raised and he is picking at the threads of his trousers where they have torn at the knee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERLE IS STANDING, GRIPPING THE BAMBOO WALLS OF THE CAGE AND LOOKING OUT AT THE "PITS".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE PITS - MERLE'S POV - HEAVY RAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pits are about twenty feet away. Running mud and water gurgle into them, coming out through shallow trenches on the downhill side. There are fewer hands than the day before, far fewer. The nearest pit only has one pair and as MERLE watches he sees that these hands are struggling to keep their grip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY ONE OF THE HANDS SLIPS AWAY. THE HAND COMES BACK FOR A MOMENT, THEN BOTH HANDS DISAPPEAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TIGER CAGE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>

MERLE turns away from the "pits". He looks down at SAL, then he looks at NICK. His expression is one of exasperation, as if he had been having a long argument.

A shout comes from the thatched hut. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE whip around in fright. MERLE and NICK turn.

Through the bars of the "tiger cage" we see the V.C. GUARDS coming down from the thatched hut. The GUARDS are all drinking beer again and the GUARD IN CHARGE is waving the pearl-handled revolver.

The GUARDS begin screaming orders from outside the cage and ONE OF THEM lets off a blast of automatic rifle fire which shreds the bamboo roof just above the PRISONERS' heads. NICK and MERLE grab SAL and drag him to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the PRISONERS emerge from the "tiger cage" the GUARDS smash them with their rifle butts, screaming orders. In the melee SAL is separated from NICK and MERLE, both of whom are knocked to the ground by furious blows. When they get to their feet they see that SAL is wandering off alone in the direction of the "pits". One of the GUARDS spots SAL and clubs him down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAL gets up and begins wandering off again. The GUARD clubs him down again, turns to the GUARD IN CHARGE and begins complaining. The GUARD IN CHARGE dispatches a SECOND GUARD to help the FIRST and the TWO GUARDS open the bamboo grating on one of the "pits".

<DIRECTION>
SAL has absolutely no comprehension of what is about to happen to him. His eyes are dreamy, far away, as if he had mentally transported himself to some distant place. There are great gashes in his head from the blows he has received and as he stands waiting in the pouring rain he looks exactly like a very small child who has experienced some terrible confusion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the GUARD standing beside SAL wrenches him around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the pit now, CLOSE UP. There are four bloated CORPSES floating in the muck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SAL'S FACE, CLOSE UP. He gives a CRY and tries to turn away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the GUARDS pick SAL up, SCREAMING. We see the SPLASH as SAL hits the water and then we see him surface between the bloated CORPSES, STILL SCREAMING, paddling desperately and trying to find something solid to hod him up.

NICK stands motionless, stunned, listening to SAL'S SCREAMS. MERLE has his attention focused on the GUARD IN CHARGE and when he glances in their direction MERLE slugs NICK in the stomach and begins beating him furiously to the ground. NICK struggles to his feet. MERLE attacks him again and now, as the GUARD IN CHARGE comes over to see what's going on, MERLE begins hopping up and down, pointing at NICK, pointing at the revolver in the GUARD'S hand and screaming.

The muzzle stops pointing at MERLE. MERLE scowls, looks over at the GUARD IN CHARGE. The GUARD IN CHARGE has lifted the barrel of his AK 47 and is watching him with caution. The OTHER GUARDS, who are totally caught up in the game, are yelling and shouting.

NICK looks down at the revolver and picks it up. He stares at MERLE for a moment. Then he spins the cylinder, cocks the hammer, Puts it to his head... and CLICKS into an empty chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GUARDS let out expressions of disbelief. Those betting on NICK begin taunting those betting on MERLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERLE sits motionless, as if stunned, as if utterly defeated, his brow furrowed in a mighty frown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK pushes the revolver across the table. His face is twitching but he gives the gesture a certain flair, as if throwing back a challenge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERLE stares at the revolver -- stares at it with an expression of utter gloom. Then he reaches out, takes the revolver in his hand and pulls it toward him, as if he no longer possessed the strength to pick it up.

</MERLE>
<DIRECTION>
MERLE roams a glowering eve over the watching GUARDS, as if suddenly discovering himself among traitors. Slowly, he pushes himself to his feet. The gun is still on the table, still in his right hand, and as he gets up he lets his body sag over it.

MERLE snaps the revolver level in his hand and BLASTS the GUARD IN CHARGE, hitting him full in the face. At the same time NICK throws himself into the GUARD who is standing behind him, spins and slams the GUARD'S AK 47 into his chin. TWO MORE SHOTS BLAST OUT FROM MERLE'S .45 and we see TWO GUARDS crash over the kitchen table. NICK now opens up with AK 47, and as MERLE backs off beside him, also with an AK 47, they GUN the remaining GUARDS to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is over in an instant. The BODIES lie in a bloody, tangled mess under a pathetic paper lantern. The rain drones on -- uninterrupted, undiminished, eternal...

EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

Barely visible against the dripping foliage -- like a shadow is a startled V.C. SOLDIER. The man takes a half-step forward, unslings his rifle and OPENS FIRE.

<DIRECTION>
INT. THATCHED HUT - DAY

<DIRECTION>
The SOUTH VIETNAMESE PRISONERS are hit where they stand. NICK spins, BADLY WOUNDED. MERLE throws himself on the floor and lets go with the AK 47.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BAMBOO GROVE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERLE appears carrying NICK on his back. NICK is unconscious and the effort that MERLE has expended to get him this far can be measured in MERLE'S eves, which burn like dead coals. As MERLE approaches, traversing the bamboo grove along the side of a steep hill, we suddenly see SAL, stumbling along behind and attached to MERLE by a short rope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERLE comes to a stop, unshoulders NICK and lays him on the ground. As MERLE stands looking at NICK, gasping for breath, SAL hunches down and stares at the endless trunks of bamboo with an expression of pure terror.
</DIRECTION>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<DIRECTION>
There is a sound, so faint as to be almost imperceptible. MERLE throws himself on SAL, slamming one hand across his mouth and raising the other in case he has to silence NICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment there is nothing -- silence. The rain drones on and we can hear NICK'S breath, which comes in short, shallow rasps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound comes again and suddenly a PLATOON OF V.C. SOLDIERS appear, coming down through the trees. Their passage is almost completely silent and they go by on both sides, moving down the hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA CLOSES SLOWLY ON MERLE'S FACE. His gums are bleeding and his skin is drawn tight so that every bone stands out in his skull. His teeth are bared, his eyes are hollow and he looks within a hair's breadth of being completely mad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRATERED ROADSIDE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge battle is taking place nearby. The earth trembles and shakes and gigantic explosions intermittently light the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERLE staggers down a ravine with NICK, loses his footing and slides to the bottom where he lies in the mud, motionless, too tired to move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAL comes down behind. He is hunched over, like a gnome. The rope which MERLE has tied around his neck drags in the mud and his eyes are huge with terror.
</DIRECTION>

Another explosion lights the sky, this one much closer. In the flash we see that a red American car is stranded in the middle of the road. There is another explosion and another flash. The car is dusty, spattered with mud, but otherwise it appears miraculously unharmed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK'S breath rattles in his throat. MERLE, who lies beside NICK, holding him, has closed his eyes. SAL, who is the only one who has seen the car, stares at it hard, and for a long time, trying it out with one eye and then the other.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. CRATERED ROADSIDE - FOLLOWING DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REFUGEES are streaming down the road in a desperate, frightened human torrent. There is every imaginable means of conveyance -- from bullock carts to motorbikes -- but the vast majority, carrying their meager belongings, are fleeing on foot. The burned-out car is still in the middle of the road and the great human tide streams around it, as if it were an island. In the distance comes the sound of machine gun fire and mortars are coming in nearby. MEDVAC helicopters clatter overhead with wounded strapped to baskets on the skids. Now and then an ARMY CONVOY comes through, blasting the REFUGEES into the ditch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERLE sits alone on the embankment by the side of the road. NICK and SAL are gone and the area is littered with fresh bandage packages and throw-away medical supplies. Suddenly a jeep pulls up with a two-star GENERAL in it.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's your unit, soldier?

MERLE stares at the GENERAL -- blankly, without comprehension. Finally, after a long moment, he gives a slight shrug.

The room is tiny, a cubicle furnished with a chair. NICK is alone, standing at the window looking out. He wears ill fitting civilian clothes whose colors are too bright for-the pallor of his skin. Around his neck is a piece of plastic on which is stapled a colored paper marker. Departing aircraft thunder overhead and there is the sound of some nearby hydraulic mechanism.

The DOCTOR slams back out the door. Another jet thunders overhead. The hydraulic LIFTERS on the loading ramp shriek and whine...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK reaches for the new paper marker on his neck and peers down at it from the corner of his eye. It seems to remind him of something and he takes out his wallet. In his wallet is a PHOTOGRAPH of LINDA. NICK peers at the photograph intently, then closes his wallet and puts it away.

Banks of telephones line the wall. Stretching out from the telephones are long, ragged lines of SERVICEMEN waiting to call home. The room is huge, full of echoes. Re-enlistment posters are plastered everywhere and CANNED LATIN MUSIC is playing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK stands in one of the lines with only one person in front of him. He looks anxious. He takes out his wallet again, peers intently at LINDA'S PHOTOGRAPH, then puts it back. NICK takes a half-step forward -- staring at the telephone -- and then he stops, frozen with fear.

<DIRECTION>
NICK comes along the sidewalk in a CROWD OF PEDESTRIANS. He is drunk and he moves aimlessly, as if he had been drifting along for hours. As he comes to a stop, staring at a SOUTH VIETNAMESE who has lost both legs, he fumbles in his pocket for a pint of whiskey, empties the bottle and drops it in the gutter. Suddenly, across the street, something catches his eye.

NICK takes out his wallet, opens it hurriedly to the PHOTOGRAPH OF LINDA and peers at it with a kind of ferocious determination, as if this link were the last, as if by staring at it hard he could make it hold.

There is the sharp report of a pistol SHOT and then, as NICK spins, staring at a shuttered building, there is the unmistakable sound of APPLAUSE.

NICK stares at the building for a long moment, then he crosses toward it.

EXT. YARD BEHIND BUILDING - SAIGON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tiny light glows inside a paper lantern. Lying on the around are three CORPSES, all of them Asian, all of them expensively dressed and all of them with their heads blown off. As NICK stands looking at them a door comes open on the back of the building,and TWO BURLY MEN bring out another corpse. The body is that of a young American. Like the Asians he is expensively dressed and he is dead from a bullet in the right temple.

ARMAND moves around the side of the building and the sound of his FOOTSTEPS fades away. The TWO BURLY MEN come lurching with another CORPSE. Laughter comes from inside the building and there is a glimpse of AN ELEGANTLY DRESSED WOMAN seated at a cafe table. The BURLY MEN return to the door and shut it tight. In the distance the sky goes up in a huge flash of fire and then the sound of the EXPLOSION rolls across the city like a great dead wind.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - WINTER - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trailer is all decked out with bunting and stuck, like a plum cake, with tiny American flags. Stretching from the trailer to the side of a house across the street is a huge, hand-lettered banner which says "WELCOME HOME NICK!" and it whips and it snaps in the cold winter wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK's battered old shark-finned Cadillac is in the yard. Alongside it are a bunch of newer cars and PEOPLE are coming from all directions, spilling in and out of the trailer and congregating in excited, foot-stomping, half-frozen groups.

We see the OLD PRIEST on his way from the church. We see the OLDER WOMEN, wrapped in shawls and carrying cakes and cookies, trudging up the hill. We see ALBERT, JOHN and a bunch of STEELWORKERS, all of them half-bombed, dragging two cases of beer on a child's sled. We see LINDA peering out the trailer window, pale and anxious-looking. We see VINCE, who is unofficial lookout, jumping up and down at the approach of every car and screaming, "This is it! This is Nick!" and then, when it isn't, saying, "Not yet! Just hold your water, I'll tell you when!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we see an empty street into which SIX VETS from the VFW Post come tottering. The VETS are all in their old uniforms. While three of them attempt to make MUSIC on a BASS DRUM, a FIFE and an old Army BUGLE, the other three attempt to sing.

INT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK stands in the doorway where the driver has left him. His duffle bag and the cartons of electric appliances are piled along the wall by his feet. His head is thrown back and he is draining a bottle of whiskey, gulping it down in great raw swallows. .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK lowers the bottle, catches his breath and goes at it again. This time, as he lowers the bottle, the stark panic is gone, but there is still fear -- blind, nameless fear, like that of an animal run to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK crosses to the window, grips the frame with both hands and looks out.

NICK turns back to the room. He stares at it blankly -- stares at the bed, stares at the bureau, stares at the chair, then he picks up the bottle, closes his eyes and begins gulping down whiskey -- gulping it hard, fast, as hard and fast as he can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - NEW ANGLE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The banner stretching to the house across the street has been whipped to shreds by the wind. In the yard, parked beside NICK's black Cadillac, is another car of about the same vintage. There is a case of beer on its roof, the windows are entirely frosted over and the engine is running. After a moment TWO STEELWORKERS come down the street and knock on the trailer door. TWO OLDER WOMEN emerge, putting on their coats, and then LINDA comes to the door and tells the STEELWORKERS she has no news. The STEELWORKERS and the OLDER WOMEN start off, but now one of the WOMEN points to the frosted up car. The STEELWORKERS go back, pound on the roof of the frosted up car, pull open a few doors and go on their way. First thing out is a GIRL. Next thing out is a SECOND GIRL. Their dresses are rumpled and half-undone. Neither one has a coat and the SECOND GIRL is missing a shoe. The GIRLS both plunge back inside the car, where howling and cursing can now be heard. The GIRLS both retrieve their coats. The SECOND GIRL gets her missing shoe, plus a bra and a pair of panties. She returns the panties to the FIRST GIRL, puts on her shoe and they both take off at a fast trot. As the two GIRLS leave there is a cascade of empty beer cans and ALBERT, VINCE and JOHN all stagger out -- bleary-eyed, hung-over, half undressed and freezing. LINDA comes out of the trailer with coffee, but just as she emerges the whistle at the mill goes off. ALBERT and VINCE begin yelling at each other, yelling at JOHN and yelling at LINDA. Then they throw themselves back in the car and start off. The case of beer on the roof crashes to the street. They stop, pile out, pick up the cans, heave them in the back seat and take off again.

JOHN says something to LINDA and goes on his way.

NICK swallows and starts down the stairway toward the trailer. He hesitates, pulls the bottle from his pocket, drains the last of it and tucks it under the stairs. Straightening up, he claws at his hair, trying to comb it with his fingers. Then he starts down again.

Cakes, cookies, six-packs of beer and bottles of wine cover almost every inch of available space. LINDA sits on the little settee, wedged between two cases of Coca-Cola and hunched over a white sweater which she is attempting, with painful slowness, to knit. LINDA is trying not to cry. She is trying her God-damnedest.

<LINDA>

But NICK is out, gone. LINDA lets out a little moan and sits down on the chair beside the bed. Then, almost immediately, she stands and begins taking off his clothes. She takes off his shoes, then both socks. As she goes to undo his belt, his shirt, which is unbuttoned, falls slightly open, revealing a fresh scar. LINDA stares at the scar for a moment, then she slowly exposes the whole of NICK's chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK'S CHEST IS COVERED WITH A SERIES OF TERRIFYING FRESH SCARS. THE SCARS ARE RAISED; THEY ARE INTER-CONNECTED AND STUDDED WITH ANGRY SUTURE MARKS, LIKE A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP OF SOME UNKNOWN BATTLEGROUND.

NICK stands at the handle of a long metal rod. At the other end of the rod ALBERT and VINCE are attaching metallic strips. When ALBERT and VINCE have secured the strips they signal to NICK and all three of them lower their goggles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK. NICK is standing below a furnace which is seven stories high, towering above him into a maze of cat-walks and monstrous steel-hipped cranes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALBERT and VINCE give a signal and the CRANE OPERATOR raises the door at the bottom of the furnace. NICK is now alone, standing like Don Quixote with his lance. As NICK advances toward the base of the furnace with his rod the surface of his asbestos suit begins to smoke and bits of lint which have stuck to it burst into flame. Within reach of the furnace now, NICK pauses. Then, lifting the metal rod, he jams it through the open doorway at the base of the furnace. There is a white flash as the metallic strips explode and then a geyser of molten steel erupts in a huge jet through the doorway, passing NICK at the level of his shoulders and showering him in a great cascade of white sparks.
</DIRECTION>

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK sits on the bed in the back part of the trailer. His hunting gear is piled on the floor, the lights are out and he is staring at the telephone which is illuminated through the window by a street light on the corner. There is a sound outside, then the lights come on as LINDA enters with groceries.

NICK IS GONE. LINDA STANDS MOTIONLESS, CLUTCHING HER GROCERIES, STARING AT THE TRAILER DOOR. IT IS DARK OUTSIDE. SNOW IS BLOWING IN. THE DOOR CLOSES SLOWLY, WITH A FAINT HISS, AND THEN CLICKS SHUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOUNTAINS - MIXED HARDWOOD FOREST - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snow is blowing, swirling past the trunks of stark, ice covered trees. There is no horizon. Sky and earth are bound in a moan of wind, in the faint creak of frozen limbs and the whispering, fitful, spinning flakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK appears, suddenly, as a gust of wind shifts the slanting snow. NICK is moving easily, heading slightly uphill, following the contour of the slope. As he draws closer we see that he is following a SET OF FRESH TRACKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOUNTAINS - MIXED HARDWOODS - ROCK LEDGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A magnificent SEVEN POINT BUCK stands by a grove of hemlocks, looking down the slope.
</DIRECTION>

NICK appears below, barely visible in the swirling snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BUCK watches NICK for a moment, then turns unhurriedly and vanishes into the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIDGE NEAR CAMP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VINCE is out of breath, clawing his way up a steep slope on all fours. JOHN and ALBERT, who have reached a level area above VINCE, unsling their rifles. SHOTS are going off in every direction and the sound is so magnified by echoes that it sounds like a full scale war.

<DIRECTION>
JOHN nudges ALBERT. FOUR DEER are coming down the slope, single file. JOHN and ALBERT raise their rifles and FIRE. TWO OF THE DEER FALL AND THE REMAINING TAKE OFF. VINCE, who is just getting to his feet, unslings his rifle, trips and falls down. JOHN and ALBERT drag VINCE to his feet and then rush over to the TWO DEAD DEER.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN signals with his head. VINCE turns. ANOTHER DEER has come out of the woods. The DEER is rattled by the gunfire and peers at VINCE uncertainly. VINCE spins and grabs his gun, which immediately goes off. He slams another shell in the chamber and scrambles to his feet but the rifle sling is hooked on the antlers of the DEAD DEER and another shot ricochets off a nearby rock. JOHN and ALBERT dive for cover. As they look up, they see the DEER trot down the slope and then VINCE, firing wildly, running after it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOUNTAINS - RIDGE TOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind is much stronger, moaning in the trees. NICK appears, moving fast, at a near trot. Suddenly he stops, listening. At the same moment there is a snort. NICK wheels. The BUCK is behind him, bounding away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOUNTAINS - RIDGE TOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BUCK appears, trotting out of the swirling snow. Reaching a deadfall the BUCK pauses, looking back, and then turns sharp left and disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK comes out of the snow. He is winded but still going hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOUNTAINS - DEADFALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK reaches the deadfall, hesitates, then rapidly springs over. As he touches down on the other side there is a growling sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK grabs for the deadfall. The wind shifts and we see that he has stepped onto a boulder which is loosely planted at the top of a steep scree slope. As NICK watches, the boulder begins to roll, then to bound, dislodging other rocks and boulders, all of them bouncing and leaping and cracking... and then falling -- soundless -- over a sheer ledge to unknown depths below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALBERT and JOHN have dragged their TWO DEAD DEER to a log beside the shack. They sit side by side, drenched in sweat, guzzling beer out of both hands.

JOHN lowers his beer. ALBERT gives him a blank expression, then cracks up. SHOTS explode nearby. At first the shots are scattered but they quickly open into a FULL BARRAGE. ALBERT and JOHN stand up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY EMBANKMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DEER that VINCE was chasing earlier comes hobbling out of the woods pursued by a GROUP OF HALF-DRUNK HUNTERS. VINCE comes barreling through the HUNTERS, shouting and screaming. VINCE's clothes are in tatters, the sole is gone from one shoe and the barrel of his rifle is jammed up with mud and perceptibly bent.
</DIRECTION>

VINCE loses his footing and rolls down the embankment, head over heels.

EXT. DITCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VINCE comes up ten feet from the bewildered DEER. He raises his rifle, fires, and the BARREL SPLITS OPEN. SHOTS begin coming in, thudding in the mud and ricocheting off rocks. The DEER wheels out on the highway. VINCE heaves his rifle at the DEER, draws his pistol...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

A FLEEING HUNTER bowls him over. The DEER bolts for the woods, bullets smashing all around it. VINCE scrambles to his feet and plunges after it.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALBERT and JOHN stand with their beers, looking into the woods. A shot zings by, close, and they dive behind a log.
</DIRECTION>

The DEER comes out of the woods, barely able to keep moving. VINCE appears, reeling. He takes aim at the DEER and there is a DULL CLICK. VINCE jams his pistol back in his holster.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - FROZEN LAKE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind is blowing in gusts, slanting the snow first one way and then the other. NICK appears in the distance, a black speck in the endless expanse of shifting white.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As NICK draws closer we see that he is near exhaustion. His clothes are , caked with snow, his breath comes in a shallow gasp and his gait is uneven, favoring one leg. As NICK APPROACHES CAMERA HE FALTERS AND LIMPS TO A STOP. There are no tracks. There is nothing to go by and he hunkers down in the driving snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind bangs in from one way, then it shifts and bangs in again from another way. Suddenly it stops entirely. In the silence there is a sound -- the click of a hoof on rock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK turns. The BUCK is standing on the shoreline, not thirty feet away, looking down at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK pushes himself to his feet, raises his rifle and sights down the barrel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE THE BUCK THROUGH NICK'S SIGHTS. IT IS A CLEAR SHOT. NICK'S FINGER IS ON THE TRIGGER. HE HAS ONLY TO SQUEEZE IT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK LOWERS HIS RIFLE. THE BUCK SNORTS, TOSSES HIS HORNS AND DISAPPEARS IN THE SLANTING SNOW.

NICK goes around to the trunk, removes his gear, slams the lid and pounds on the car. VINCE takes off, thudding over the curb with his load of THREE DEAD DEER.

INT. NICK'S CAR - SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CLERK is still collecting abandoned shopping carts. The carts crash and clank as the CLERK rams them together.

NICK sits behind the wheel, watching the clerk. His hands begin shaking uncontrollably and he gets back out of the car.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LINDA is asleep - lying on her back, arms flung out across the pillows, like a dancer leaping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK stands beside the bed, wrapped in a blanket, looking down at her. After a moment he draws the covers over her, fusses with her slippers until they are straight and then goes to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF NICK'S TRAILER (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind is blowing. Bits of trash skitter and swirl in the frozen ruts and a cat comes by, MEOWING. Suddenly a MAN appears walking slowly down the street. The MAN is elegantly dressed in Western attire, wearing a tailored suit with vest, polished boots and a Stetson hat. As the MAN draws under the light of a street lamp he pauses, looking at NICK's trailer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MAN IS MERLE, OR IF NOT MERLE IT IS A FACE SO STRIKINGLY SIMILAR THAT NICK ALMOST LETS OUT A CRY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MAN UNDER THE STREET LAMP PAUSES, JUST FOR AN INSTANT, THEN HE TURNS AND MOVES ON DOWN THE STREET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK backs away from the window. For a moment he stands motionless, hardly able to believe his eyes. He looks over at LINDA, he looks down at a chair, then he pushes his face to the window again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The street is empty. The MAN is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK hesitates, then he sheds the blanket and pulls on pants, shirt, jacket and jams his sockless feet into a pair of slices.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK comes out into the street. There is no one in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK crosses to the intersection of Columbine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INTERSECTION OF COLUMBINE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one. Nothing. A beer can rolling in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK jams himself against a wall, zippers his jacket. He is irked with himself, a little frightened. Suddenly he hears a car door close and en engine start up. A black limousine pulls out of a nearby street and comes past him slowly. A CHAUFFEUR is at the wheel. The PASSENGER in back appears to be the MAN he saw, but the MAN is looking out the window on the other side and his face is not visible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As NICK watches, the limousine rapidly gathers speed. The tail lights grow small, then the car dips over a hill and disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - RECREATION ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sunlight streams through a window. The television is going. In a far corner SAL sits in his wheelchair, sleeping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA CLOSES SLOWLY ON SAL. His head has fallen to one side and his single arm sticks into the air -- as if he had failed in his grasp of something, as if he were drowning. On a tray in front of him is an untouched breakfast of orange juice, milk and a little box of Wheaties.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY STAIRWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone is descending the stairs. After a moment the feet appear, clad in expensive cowboy boots. We see expensive, tailor-made trousers, a belt buckle embossed with a six shooter... and then, suddenly, MERLE'S FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERLE slows in his descent, stops, looking at something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

NICK swings up on the wall and then he freezes. The lid of the suitcase has popped open and bundles of money are scattered all down the slope of a steep embankment.

<SAL>

	Maybe you could use socks, Nick. Jesus, I mean, come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now.

</SAL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not socks, Sal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
NICK bends over the suitcase and begins going through looking for identification. There is nothing. As he straightens up he notices a wadded-up piece of paper lying beside one of the bundles of bills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The paper is about an inch square. The corners are tattered and it looks as if it had been carried in someone's pocket for a long time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK picks the paper up, realizes it is a calling card and unfolds it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CARD READS "EXHIBITIONS". IT CONTAINS A TELEPHONE NUMBER ON THE LOWER LEFT CORNER AND IS IDENTICAL TO THE CARD ARMAND GAVE TO NICK WHEN HE CAME UPON HIM IN THE GARDEN BEHIND HIS ROULETTE GAME IN SAIGON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - VALLEY OVERLOOK - DAY

NICK leans on a railing watching the black, interchangeable cars of a coal train roll slowly by. SAL sits with the suitcase of money in his lap, utterly bewildered, crying.

NICK is standing slightly behind SAL, looking down at the money. The reality of what MERLE is doing, has nearly overwhelmed him and it is only with tremendous effort that he maintains a casual tone.

	Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.

NICK is back in uniform. He stands at a window watching a jet transport being prepared for loading. A CLERK comes by, arguing with a SERGEANT. The CLERK sets down his clipboard to consult the SERGEANT's papers. NICK picks up the clipboard and moves into the CROWD.

NICK readies his pistol, cautiously unbolts the door and jerks it open. The COLONEL FROM THE AIRPLANE tumbles in and falls flat on his back. Standing in the doorway, lit by the headlights of two cars, is a party of U.S. OFFICERS, ARVN OFFICERS and WHORES.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - SAIGON OUTSKIRTS NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An elegant house of French design is ablaze with lights. The house is encircled by a stone terrace on which tables have been set up. Over the terrace and strung out for a hundred yards into the surrounding trees are countless paper lanterns which bob and sway in the wind. GUESTS are everywhere -- wandering in and out of the house, sitting at the tables and strolling under the trees. For the most part the GUESTS are AMERICANS and SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The majority of these are OFFICERS IN UNIFORM, but there are numerous CIVILIANS mixed among them and the CIVILIANS are attired in everything from sports shirts to white linen suits and tuxedos. As to nationality there are no limits. There are FRENCH, GERMANS, BELGIANS, SWISS, CHINESE, BRITISH and AUSTRALIANS. WHORES and MISTRESSES abound. WIVES are not greatly in evidence, except to dog the heels of heavily armed ARVN GUARDS who wander about, glass-eyed, drinking champagne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - PARKING AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeeps, personnel carriers, trucks and light tanks are parked side by side with gleaming Mercedes limousines, staff cars from various government agencies and a blitz of civilian vehicles running from sedans to motor scooters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More vehicles arrive by the minute and exotic couples, like plumed birds, debark in the swirling dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - CLEARING IN TREES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dozen ARVN helicopters have put down between the trees. One has crashed and lies on its side with a broken rotor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a mounting clatter in the distance and another helicopter comes out of the sky. As it sets down a dashingly handsome AIR FORCE OFFICER hops out and extends a hand to his WIFE. When his WIFE has descended the OFFICER opens a back compartment in the fusilage and carefully takes out their BABY. He hands the BABY to his WIFE and they stroll off toward the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUBBER PLANTATION - HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gambling tables are set up in all the rooms. The betting is heavy, champagne flows like water and the atmosphere is one of reckless abandon, as if money, like love, were good for an hour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - ROULETTE STAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Low bleachers covered in red velvet are set in a semi-circle facing a small stage. The stage is lit with a single, blindingly bright spotlight and is furnished with a table and two velvet-covered chairs. Two CONTESTANTS, both of them VIETNAMESE, sit opposite one another. Between them, lying on the table, is a revolver. Both CONTESTANTS are dressed in tuxedos. Both wear red numbers on their downstage arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Although the bleachers are not yet full, eager BETTORS jam the first three rows. Here CLERKS with change trays take the bets, signalling each transaction to a MARKER who chalks the shifting odds on a large board.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, standing in the aisle, staring in disbelief at the evolution of the game he once played.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now a REFEREE enters the stage carrying two strips of scarlet cloth.
</DIRECTION>
<REFEREE>
<DIRECTION>
(amplified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Game number seven. Gentlemen will please wrap.

The CONTESTANTS wrap their heads with the scarlet cloth.

<REFEREE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One cartridge. Game to be played to completion. Forfeit automatic after delay of one minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REFEREE>
<DIRECTION>
The REFEREE places the pistol back in the center of the table and spins a wheel whose -intervals are alternately marked L and R. The wheel clatters to a stop with the marker on L.
</DIRECTION>
<REFEREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentleman on the left will now commence play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REFEREE>
<DIRECTION>
The REFEREE steps out of the light. A gong sounds. The CONTESTANT on the left picks up the pistol, spins the cylinder, cocks it and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
places it to his temple. He hesitates, pulls the trigger... and clicks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK is unable to bear it. He turns, starts around toward the back of the stage. AS NICK MOVES THROUGH THE GUESTS WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE CYLINDER CLICKING, AMPLIFIED OVER A P.A. SYSTEM. WE HEAR THE CLICK OF THE HAMMER BEING COCKED...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK turns. The SECOND CONTESTANT has the pistol to his temple. He pulls the trigger... THE GUN GOES OFF WITH A DEAFENING ROAR and he topples on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FIRST CONTESTANT STEPS FORWARD AS THE SPOTLIGHT NARROWS TO CONTAIN HIM ALONE. HE BOWS, CLASPS HIS HANDS ABOVE HIS HEAD AND DANCES AROUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK stares at the FIRST CONTESTANT celebrating his victory. He looks around him. BETTORS are screaming and yelling in five languages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK starts off again, hurrying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - BACKSTAGE AREA NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK comes upon a pile of six naked CORPSES with their heads blown off. Opposite the CORPSES -- sitting, standing, pacing, squatting in the dirt -- are a GROUP OF WAITING CONTESTANTS. Some of these are AMERICAN. Most are SOUTH VIETNAMESE, several of whom have come with WIVES and FAMILIES. A few of the contestants are well dressed, most are in rags. THREE. OF THE WAITING CONTESTANTS ARE WEARING TUXEDOS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a WOMAN WITH A BABY lets out a shriek. NICK spins. TWO BURLY MEN appear, bringing the CORPSE OF THE SECOND CONTESTANT. As the WOMAN WITH THE BABY begins sobbing and screaming with grief the BURLY MEN strip the tuxedo off the SECOND CONTESTANT and then, as each article is summarily removed, they begin dressing one of the WAITING CONTESTANTS in it.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - TREES BY TERRACE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUESTS are still coming in from the cars, strolling down through the trees in bright coveys and flocks, chattering like birds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laughter comes from the terrace. Glass tinkles and the tiny lanterns bob and sway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK appears, hurrying down the steps. Suddenly he stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERLE is sitting at a table under a nearby tree. He is alone, dressed in a tuxedo, watching the arriving GUESTS with an expression of dreamy detachment, as if they were rain drops, or snow flakes, or falling stones.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(shouts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merle!

MERLE turns, watching NICK as he crosses toward him. When NICK reaches the table, he stands.

</NICK>
<MERLE>

NICK sits. MERLE's self-possession has thrown him. He doesn't know where to start.

(stares at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment MERLE doesn't answer. His eyes are pale, like faded robin's eggs, and they seem to look through NICK, as if to some landscape far beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<MERLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like it because it's simple.
	</DIALOGUE>

A BEAUTIFUL VIETNAMESE GIRL steps up and whispers something in MERLE's ear.

NICK sees he can never overtake them directly. He cuts around to the terrace.

NICK maneuvers his way down to the end of the terrace.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me... Sorry... Sorry... Pardon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
NICK reaches the end of the terrace. MERLE and the BEAUTIFUL VIETNAMESE GIRL have disappeared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - TERRACE - NIGHT

NICK sits at one of the tables. The terrace is deserted.

	Gentleman on the right will now commence play.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gaming tables are utterly deserted. AS NICK WANDERS THROUGH THE EMPTY ROOMS THE SOUND OF THE GAME CONTINUES OVER THE P.A. SYSTEM -- THE SOUND OF THE CYLINDER SPINNING, THE SOUND OF THE HAMMER BEING COCKED... AND CLICK AFTER CLICK INTO EMPTY CHAMBERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly NICK can stand it no more. He turns and starts toward the entrance to the bleachers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHOT EXPLODES OVER THE P.A. SYSTEM. NICK freezes, then he runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - ROULETTE THEATRE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK appears at the back of the aisle between the bleachers. The CROWD is going wild, yelling and screaming. NICK pushes through a group of BETTORS and then stops. A look of stunned relief spreads over his features.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the stage a tall figure stands alone in the spotlight, head bowed in acknowledgement of the OVATION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK grins. He begins yelling and screaming along with everyone else.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the stage the tall figure raises his head, pumps his fists in the air and begins hooting maniacally.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... WE NOW SEE, AS DOES NICK, THAT THE TALL FIGURE IN THE SPOTLIGHT IS NOT MERLE AT ALL. IT IS MERLE'S OPPONENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. V.F.W. POST - BASEMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pipes crisscross the ceiling and there is the faint hiss of leaking steam. Seated on a bench and all dressed-up in their uniforms are FIVE OLD VETS. TWO VETS are on the nod. THE OTHER THREE -- rheumy-eyed and ancient -- give patient attention to the SIXTH VET who stands beside the boiler with a bugle, trying to play TAPS.
</DIRECTION>
<VET_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up a little there... What would you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VET_1>
<VET_2>

The VET WITH THE BUGLE tries it again, flubs it, starts over...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. V.F.W. POST - MAIN HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three tables have been set up in the middle of the floor. The tables have been laid with white cloth and the OLDER WOMEN are setting out fresh flowers and laying the places for a funeral breakfast. They work in silence, fussing over the placement of each knife and fork.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS THE WOMEN WORK WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR SINGING AS THE SERVICE PROGRESSES IN THE CHURCH. AT FIRST THE SOUND IS BARELY AUDIBLE, EASILY MATCHED BY THE FAINT NOTES OF THE VET WITH THE BUGLE IN THE BASEMENT BELOW. BUT NOW THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR GROWS -- A SOUND AS DEEP AS WATER, AS DARK AS NIGHT; A SOUND LIKE STONE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gradually, one by one, the OLDER WOMEN stop fussing with the table. They stand motionless, listening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HEARSE waits at the curb. The day is windless, cold and grey Snow is drifting down and the gleaming vehicle emits a ghostly cloud of white exhaust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR IS MUCH LOUDER, ASCENDING IN DARK TRIUMPH TO A SUDDEN, FINAL NOTE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the ringing silence of the MUSIC'S END the doors to the church swing open. NICK, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN appear with MERLE's flag-draped COFFIN. Followed by MOURNERS, they bear the COFFIN slowly down the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snow drifts down from a leaden sky as the MOURNERS stand together on a steep hillside of tilted, weather-worn headstones. The mill looms behind them, breathing roiling clouds of steam and uttering a dull concordia of clanks and groans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY - GRAVE SITE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PRIEST completes his reading of the 23rd PSALM. The MOURNERS join in the LORD'S PRAYER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, VINCE, ALBERT, JOHN and SAL. They help SAL to the side of the grave. It is awkward. The chair gets stuck and they have to carry it. THEY ALL pick up a handful of dirt and then, following NICK's lead, they throw it in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK steps back from the grave, nods to the VETS. The VETS come to attention. The VET WITH THE BUGLE steps forward and tremblingly, but perfectly, PLAYS TAPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. V.F.W. POST - MAIN HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The meal is over. The WOMEN are drinking coffee, the MEN are smoking and putting down the beer. There is muted laughter and conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK sits at the head of one of the tables, flanked by LINDA and SAL. He looks stunned. His food is untouched, there are tears in his eyes and he hardly seems to know where he is.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eat something, Nick. Eat a piece of toast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
NICK nods, picks up a piece of toast and then, forgetting all about it, lays it absently on his plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VINCE comes up behind NICK, looking somewhat officious in a new blue suit.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to say a few words, Nick? I think you should. Like that would wind things up.
