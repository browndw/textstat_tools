EXT. EARTH - DAY (12,000 B.C.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The world turns below us, vast and slow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RUMBLE. A shadow sweeps over the land. We move with the shadow. We cast the shadow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landscapes slide by. Reduced by altitude to abstractions: river deltas, forests and flood plains. A raw natural world. No trace of civilization.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shadow glides over mountains and glaciers. Across an ocean and a pale beach. Over lowland plain at the foot of a VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN it stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOWLAND PLAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE FIGURES walk out of the shadow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are men - and yet not men. Their skin is snow-white. Their features heavy and classical - as if Rodin's Thinker had risen from his seat. Their smooth heads are earless and hairless. Their glittering eyes entirely black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Against the stark land their height is impossible to judge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are ENGINEERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two of them are cloaked in dark robes of strange design.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The third is naked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the cloaked Engineers opens a featureless black box: inside lies a cake of dark, sticky material.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The naked one lifts the dark cake with ceremonial slowness. It hums and buzzes. Foams into iridescent spheres. He raises the seething cake to his mouth like the sacrament.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK SCARABS boil out of the dark material. Swarm over his lips. Glittering insects that chitter and bite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under the swarm his lips melt away. A horrific vision of teeth, black blood, dissolving bone. They are devouring him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fevered glimpse of the microscopic: cells rupture and bleed. Protein chains unfold. A DNA spiral unravels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scarabs fill their bellies with genetic material.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ENGINEER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...spreads his arms. Stands cruciform, nearly headless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scarabs swarm his shoulders, his chest. When they reach his hips, he collapses sideways, toppling majestically like a felled tree. Engulfed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two cloaked Engineers watch impassively.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them, a vast black SHIP hangs in the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As if blown by a great gust of wind, the scarabs disperse in their millions in all directions. Living DNA on the wing. Where the sacrificial victim fell, nothing remains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pristine wilderness. The VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PRIMITIVE WOMAN stands on a height, staring in amazement: far off a great dark ship hovers over the plain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A black scarab lands on the back of her neck. Bites deep. Injecting its cargo of DNA into her blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A microscopic invasion. Cells pierced and infused. DNA strands twining and mating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE WOMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pupils dilating with shock, breath hissing into her lungs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She slaps the back of her neck. Looks at her hand. The scarab lies in her palm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she watches, it crumbles to dust and blows away.
</DIRECTION>
<FADE_TO_BLACK>
<DIRECTION>
ON BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drifting motes of light against the dark: a starscape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An EXCAVATOR floats into view: a sturdy vehicle equipped with robotic arms. Bright floodlights beat at the darkness. Inside the cockpit - a bubble of glass - sits a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is DR. JOCELYN WATTS, 32, a precocious scholar of many disciplines. A scientist accustomed to field work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cockpit is sweltering: she wears shorts, boots, a T-shirt - and still her arms and legs gleam with sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts works the controls. The excavator descends toward a rocky surface. Silt billows up as the excavator approaches: we're not in space at all, but deep underwater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The excavator's thrusters are cowled propellers. The "stars" are plankton shining in the floodlights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EXCAVATOR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts steers the excavator to a steeply sloping cliff wall. A sea-trench yawns below her, its depths lost in darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Moving to survey site B... closing on object four. The large oblong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<DIRECTION>
She watches the screen of a ground-penetrating radar system. A bright signal return: something hidden in the cliff in front of her. Something big.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SEA TRENCH - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts carves into the cliff with the excavator's digger arm. Silt and boulders fall into the yawning trench below. She brings a water cannon to bear: uses its jet to blast away loose silt and stones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cliff face collapses: a muddy landslide into the deeps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts backs away from the collapse, thrusters whirring to keep her out of the turbulence. A cloud of silt clears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In her floodlight beams, the OBELISK stands revealed - its outlines worn by the ages. Easily thirty feet tall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts stares at the obelisk, stunned. Her voice is husky:
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin. Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<DIRECTION>
A second excavator glides out of the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the controls: PROFESSOR MARTIN HOLLOWAY, 48, visionary genius and archaeologist. Dark-haired and lean, with the rangy build of a frontiersman. He's dressed in work trousers and a T-shirt. Stubbly chin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He plays his floodlights over the obelisk.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLOWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLOWAY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WATTS'S EXCAVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts floats her excavator down the front of the obelisk. Scanning the alien text. Suddenly she stops. Grips the obelisk with her excavator's arms to anchor herself in place.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need to see this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<HOLLOWAY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLOWAY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SEA TRENCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway pilots his excavator expertly up to Watts's. Mates the two vehicles at their aft hatchways.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WATTS'S EXCAVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind Watts, a hatch opens with a splatter of water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway climbs in. Squeezes into her cockpit. A tight fit. He's distracted by her body, pressed so close - but she has eyes only for the inscrutable writing outside the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Same thing again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<HOLLOWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<WATTS>

</HOLLOWAY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MEDITERRANEAN SEA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A research vessel at anchor on a turquoise sea. Bright sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, a coastline dotted with villas. The horizon is dominated by the VOLCANIC PEAK - the same peak we saw in the distance in the prologue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aboard the research vessel, cranes lift Watts and Holloway's excavators out of the sea and onto the deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RESEARCH VESSEL - AFT DECK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under an awning, PRINTS of the obelisk's faces are stretched on the deck - fifteen feet long.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts and Holloway crawl over the alien text, red markers in hand. Parsing, translating, calculating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're tanned, fit, the wind in their hair. The Mediterranean coast in the distance. It's an idyllic way to work. But they're utterly absorbed in the task at hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AFT DECK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're still at it. Lights illuminate the workspace. The obelisk prints are blanketed with markings and annotations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway sits at a table. Watts sits on the marked-up prints. Both working through calculations on electronic slates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLOWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a solution. A single match.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLOWAY>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too. Checked it twice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<HOLLOWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLOWAY>
<DIRECTION>
Watts holds up her slate: it displays a set of stellar coordinates. A detailed star map. Holloway holds up his own slate: an exact match. They lock eyes in electric excitement.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do we do now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<HOLLOWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We go there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLOWAY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL (EARTH ORBIT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gleaming space station like a five-spoked wheel rotates grandly against the Pacific Ocean a thousand miles below. Black letters on the white metal read: WEYLAND'S WHEEL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A round shuttlecraft approaches the station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHUTTLECRAFT (ZERO GRAVITY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A spacecraft no bigger than a private jet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway and Watts sit strapped into acceleration chairs. The only two passengers aboard. New to space travel, Watts tears her eyes from the spectacle of Earth outside the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway plays with a pen, batting it from hand to hand in the zero gravity.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's first? You do climate, I do genetics?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<HOLLOWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Archaeology first. Let our ancestors tell the tale.

</HOLLOWAY>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think he's serious?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<HOLLOWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Serious enough to send his private shuttle.

	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLOWAY>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway plucks the pen from the air. He points out the window, where the crescent Moon shines like a toothy grin.

<HOLLOWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heaven smiles on our enterprise.

EXT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shuttle docks with the Wheel's hub - a perfect fit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL - SPOKE ELEVATOR (ZERO GRAVITY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gleaming capsule elevator with windows to the stars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway and Watts float weightlessly inside, moving from handhold to handhold. The door closes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts grabs Holloway by the collar. Pulls them roughly together. They kiss. Not for the first time. They have a way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts's hair and clothing float free: she's a naiad in Holloway's arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator descends along the spoke to the rim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL - RIM - FOYER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A luxurious lobby. Tasteful lighting. Eames-era furniture in wood and chrome: the past's vision of the future.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the rim, the Wheel's rotation supplies gravity. An elevator door opens. Watts and Holloway step out - Holloway with a sleek metal folio slung over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The floor is the outer surface of the Wheel: in both directions it curves upward out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The walls are all windows: on one side, Earth rotates lazily. On the other, a wheeling field of stars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID, an android, stands waiting for them. He's cunningly built, but no one would mistake him for a real human being.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Professor Holloway. Dr. Watts. My name is DAVID.

He strides off across the foyer. Watts and Holloway exchange a wondering glance and follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXHIBIT HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID leads past models of planets, moons and asteroids. Holographic labels and data swirl around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are all the planetary bodies on which Weyland Industries has mining claims.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The end of the hall is dominated by a huge globe of Mars. Markings indicate widespread surface activity.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>

	<DIALOGUE>
	And Mars. Weyland's crown jewel.

	It's the greatest engineering project ever attempted. Challenges are inevitable. Mr. Weyland's a determined man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
WEYLAND'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PETER WEYLAND sits behind a mahogany desk. He's a Warren Buffet type: a country sage, horse-sense and hard knocks. He might be seventy years old, or a hundred and seventy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him stands DIRECTOR LYDIA VICKERS, a slim woman of 45 in a costly business suit. Shrewd and watchful. Once a great beauty, she now trades in ruthlessness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID stands against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts and Holloway settle into chairs in front of Weyland - Holloway holding the metal folio.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<HOLLOWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm an archaeologist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLOWAY>
<DIRECTION>
He touches a tiny remote. Holographs appear in the air over Weyland's desk: the folio is a three-dimensional imager.
</DIRECTION>

Pictures of a younger Holloway in the field: excavating ruins in Egypt, China, Peru, Greece.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLOWAY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my studies I discovered a pattern I couldn't explain. Every eleven hundred years, sudden advances in agriculture, tool use, technology. Inventions. Something caused a great leap forward. Every eleven centuries. The pattern holds as far back as our data goes. Tens of thousands of years. I had to understand this. It became the focus of my work.

</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was analyzing historical changes in human DNA. I found the same pattern. Every eleven centuries, a pulse of new information in the genome of the human race. All over the world. Evolution can't do that. Something was changing us. Changing the DNA of our species.

At the window stands the android DAVID.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gazes at the cosmos with an expression of utter serenity. After a long moment he turns away. Massive shutters close over the window as he walks off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID walks the ship's long central corridor. The ship is silent. The lights dimmed to blue. He is alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HYPERSLEEP COMPARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long steel room containing a dozen plexiglass sarcophagi, six on each side. Sleep freezers. Inside each freezer: the shadowy shape of a human body rimed with frost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID walks through the compartment, surveying the sleepers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WORKROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID sits at a display table, moving intricate technical documents across the surface with waves of his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes intent on his work. If he is reading, then he`s reading at a speed no human could match.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHITE LANDSCAPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pull away from the frosted crystalline horizon, the smooth white curves like snowy fields. Form becomes clear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the body of a woman. It's Watts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HYPERSLEEP FREEZER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts lies asleep in her underwear in a plexiglass freezer. Pale. Frost on her skin. Venus sculpted in ice. There are IV lines in her elbows and ankles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shapes move into view beyond her, outside the freezer. FACES. Pressed to the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HYPERSLEEP COMPARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All of the freezers are open and empty, save two. Holloway lies in one. In the next, Watts. Three men in blue coveralls crouch beside Watts's freezer, staring inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are DOWNS, 30, a lean fidgety crewman. STILLWELL, 40, a sturdy fellow with the geniality of a labrador. And KAMAROV, 26, whose dark, brooding air belongs to a man twice his age.
</DIRECTION>
<DOWNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOWNS>
<DIRECTION>
Kamarov opens the lid of Watt's freezer. Leans over her. Watts stirs in her sleep, a drowsy angel.
</DIRECTION>
<KAMAROV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wakes up slow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAMAROV>
<DIRECTION>
Watts wakes to find three men looming above her. Disoriented, she pulls away. Tangles her hands in her IV lines.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLOWAY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLOWAY>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway's voice cracks like a whip. The crewmen jump back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway sits up in the next freezer over. He yanks the IV lines out of his arms and legs. Climbs out of the freezer.
</DIRECTION>
<STILLWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just looking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STILLWELL>
<HOLLOWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give us a moment, will you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLOWAY>
<DIRECTION>
The crewmen file out: Stillwell sheepishly, Downs and Kamarov surly. Holloway goes to Watts. Gently removes the IV lines from her ankles while she plucks the ones from her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm out of sorts. Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>

He helps her up.

INT. MESS ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway and Watts sit at a table, both a bit hung over. They wear civilian clothes. Warmly dressed, they still look cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They nurse mugs of coffee and nibble packaged snack bars. Watts hunches over, shivering.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My head's buzzing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<HOLLOWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Two ship's officers enter the room wearing blue coveralls with rank insignia: GLASSE, 45, a stocky man with thick black hair, and BRICK, 50, a bald man with a bristling mustache.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look at Watts and Holloway with little pleasure.
</DIRECTION>
<BRICK>

INT. MAGELLAN - CAPTAIN'S WARDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAPTAIN JANEK, 45, sits at his desk. With his bristling beard and powerful build he has a swashbuckling look, like the captain of a whaling ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway and Watts sit on a steel bench in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits scanning his orders: a plastic packet with Weyland Industries logos, cracked open. Watermarked papers inside.
</DIRECTION>
<JANEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zeta Two Reticuli was surveyed already. A hundred years ago.

<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Confirmation of Professor Holloway's theories would change everything. There'd be science before Holloway and science after.

Janek rubs his face wearily with his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<JANEK>

	Your ticket. I'll put the ship where you want. Run your scans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANEK>
<HOLLOWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain, your crew's been up for a week. We could've used the time. Why'd you wait to wake us?

<JANEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better for discipline.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Men ship out as prospectors for one reason: the percentage. Find a gold mine or a habitable planet, and you're set for life.
	</DIALOGUE>

(he laughs bitterly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this contract says no percentage. No bounty. Just triple pay. The men aren't happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANEK>
<HOLLOWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You unhappy too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLOWAY>
<JANEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm always unhappy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANEK>
<DIRECTION>
He stands. Presses his palm against a wall panel. A safe opens. He pulls out a massive pistol in a gunbelt. Tosses the orders into the safe. Lays the gun atop them and locks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCIENTISTS' CABIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway and Watts take possession of their cabin: a simple but spacious room with twin beds and a window to the stars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They drop duffel bags on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway surveys the arrangement. Frowns. He releases the magnets that lock the beds down. Slides the beds together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCIENTISTS' WORKROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway and Watts set up their workspace - a central display table and huge display surfaces on the walls. Fascinating documents slide under their fingertips: an Engineer alphabet. Ancient art. Climate and genetic data.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID appears in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DAVID. I wondered when we'd see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I trust your database is in order. I set it up myself.

</DAVID>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All's well, I think.

</WATTS>

DAVID turns to go. Hesitates in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should tell you: the time you spent sleeping, I spent studying your research.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway and Watts look at the android, his words sinking in.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You studied our work for two and a half years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's quite a data set.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<HOLLOWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you've seen everything. Well. What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLOWAY>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID glances over the documents displayed around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your hypothesis is...bold. The audacity of it. Your climate data's undeniable: the Holocene Epoch was engineered. Dr. Watts, your genetic studies are equally conclusive. Pulses of cultural change are harder to prove, but even there your case is strong. I believe in your "Engineers."
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
BREAK ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A utilitarian sitting room. Steel benches and table bolted to the deck. Seated here are two Weyland Industries technicians:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANDREW CHANCE, 50, a stocky computer engineer with a genial bearing and a bristling salt-and-pepper mustache.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONA RAVEL, 45, a dour, rangy woman with a plain face, her hair pulled severely back. A physicist and chemist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They wear black Weyland Industries jackets. They radiate intelligence and competence. These are pros.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID leads Holloway and Watts past the break room. Holloway spots the technicians. Strides in to greet them.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLOWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Weyland Industries! Mr. Chance. Ms. Ravel. You remember Dr. Watts.

<DIRECTION>
Holloway and Watts follow the imperturbable DAVID down a steel corridor to Vickers's cabin door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICKERS'S SUITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An open-plan cabin like an urban loft apartment. Watts and Holloway follow DAVID inside. Vickers rises to meet them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The walls are industrial steel - but the floors are lushly carpeted, the furniture opulent. A king-sized bed, a mahogany desk, a dining table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gleaming machines ensure Vickers never need step outside: a private hypersleep freezer, an autokitchen, a medical pod.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that a Pauling medical pod? There's only ten of those things on Earth! I guess nine, now.

<DIRECTION>
The Magellan sweeps on around the gray moon, radar emitters humming, antennae and telescopes open wide. The gas giant Epsilon fills the sky behind LV-426.

<DIRECTION>
As it circles, the Magellan launches SATELLITES. Metal motes hurled into polar orbits around the Moon.

Everyone strapped into chairs - except Janek, who stands gripping a stanchion, his boots planted on the deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The landing engines roar. Wind screams over the hull. Mist whips across the Bridge window, obscuring any view. Watts reaches out. Squeezes Holloway's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Magellan breaks through the cloud cover into clear air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below the ship, a vast and eerie landscape is revealed. Wide valleys mottled with thin dark ground cover. Barren crags and spires of rock. Waterless and wind-swept.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts gasps. Stares at the grim and foreign country.

Janek expertly swings the Magellan sideways. The Magellan circles the mount, nose pointed inward.

It revolves below the watchers: flat faces, clean edges - but cracked and timework. It glitters like coal.

EXT. LV-426 - SECOND PEAK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A second oddly regular peak, even more decrepit than the first, sits on the brink of a vast canyon. Landslides have eaten at its edges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Magellan purrs over the landscape, dwarfed by the scale. Drops between the canyon walls to circle the mount.

</BRICK>
<DIRECTION>
The ship descends into clear air. A stunning panorama unfolds before them: craters, hundreds of meters across, connected by trenches. Like a pattern of crop-circles sunk in the rock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the middle of the central crater - a huge angular peak, larger than the others. The Magellan circles the site. It's awe-inspiring. Cryptic. Huge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway stares in rapture. Glances at Watts: she nods, eyes shining. She's with him.
</DIRECTION>

The crew's still skeptical - but starting to wonder. They shake their heads and exchange looks.

EXT. CRATER COMPLEX - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the central crater, four canals extend outward like points of the compass. Some connect to smaller craters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One canal peters out, flush with the desert floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Magellan lands at the end of this canal - half a kilometer from the central crater.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. MAGELLAN - AIRLOCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The expedition party emerges from the airlocks - riding CARGO ROVERS, robotic vehicles just smart enough to carry their owners around, or follow along behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rovers' beds are loaded with gear; the explorers ride on running-board seats. All wear space suits.

The crew of the Magellan exchange uneasy looks. Still uncertain what to think.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ENTRY CANAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trench grows deeper as they follow it toward the central crater - the pyramidal peak framed ahead of them like a monument on a triumphal avenue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They cross a perpendicular canal. Glancing left and right, they see smaller craters with central peaks of their own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass through the shadow of a high promontory of stone atop one bank of the canal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see - and they do not - that the far side of the promontory has a Sphinx-like FACE of monumental size. So eroded that its artificial nature is uncertain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CENTRAL CRATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crater floor is a vast enclosed plain. The pyramidal mount looms in the center - colossal in scale.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rovers enter the crater, trailing plumes of dust. They circle the pyramid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the south face of the pyramid, an IRIS DOOR of many blades stands, easily fifty feet high. Seemingly made of the same basaltic stone as the pyramid itself. A huge construction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The explorers are transfixed in awe. All skepticism banished.

VICKERS'S SUITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vickers strides through her quarters. On the far wall there are two small doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the first: steps into a luxurious bathroom. Washes a pill down with a tumbler of water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Returns to her cabin and opens the second small door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SECRET ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A chamber walled with steel panels. A deep hum of ventilation and power: there's a lot of technology here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to a console beside the door. Flips a row of switches. The hum deepens. Hidden mechanisms stir to life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PYRAMID - IRIS DOOR

On foot, explorers press inside - Holloway and Watts in the lead. Their flashlights cut into the gloom.

The robotic rovers follow them: their six-wheeled chassis with independent suspension trundling over the rubble barrier, sure-footed as goats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PYRAMID - ANTECHAMBER

Dark and cavernous. Weak daylight slants in.

Watts passes her light over the writing, recording it. They move on into the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID lingers. Reading.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PYRAMID - VARIOUS PASSAGES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The interior is a labyrinth. Corridors big as railway tunnels intersecting and diverging.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The explorers wend their way deeper. Several carry map units, whose holographic displays render three-dimensional maps that expand as they explore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PYRAMID - MASSIVE CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway leads the explorers deeper into the complex. The motors of the cargo rovers whine and growl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID trails the others, eyes raking the blank walls as if he sees something there. He reaches out. Passes his hand through the air as if grasping a cobweb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STRANGE RUMBLING NOISE sounds down the corridor, freezing them. Holloway sweeps his light that way. The sound comes again: a DEMONIC VOICE speaking some unearthly language.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts looks at Holloway - but his eyes are focused on the dark ahead. He moves forward. A beat. The others follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An APPARITION appears before them. A PALE, LUMINOUS GIANT fifteen feet tall, with hollow eyes and a grotesque snout. It strides toward them. Speaks in a sonorous voice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pandemonium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts backpedals involuntarily. Seeing Holloway stand his ground, she reaches out to him in a panic.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin. Martin!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<DIRECTION>
But Holloway doesn't budge. Stares at the Apparition in fascination. Everyone else scatters - except DAVID, who stands stock-still by the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts watches as the Apparition walks right up to Holloway. Disappears with a sizzle of static as Holloway experiences the creature passing through him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Watts returns to Holloway's side. Stillwell and Downs are huddled on the deck. Milburn and Fifield have fallen back down the passageway.

Unseen by the others, DAVID reaches out and repeats his gesture in the air.

A rumbling sound down the corridor, as before. Moments later, the Apparition appears round the corner again. They stand their ground: the ghostly giant strides toward them, exactly as before, and disappears with a crackle.

Janek stands at the window, looking down the long canal at the distant pyramid.

The ship's powerful imaging systems stream data: stereoscopic feeds from the explorers' flashlights; a map that grows as they explore. The maze under the pyramid drawn in light.

PYRAMID - CORE CHAMBER

<DIRECTION>
The vast central chamber of the pyramid. An immense space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway walks in, his flashlight searching. Watts hurries after. The others follow, rovers tagging along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A colossal structure stands in the center of the chamber, convoluted and strange. A mechanism. Chasms yawn in the floor all around it, their depths lost in darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The explorers enter, rovers in train. They lift their eyes: hundreds of feet above them they see the pyramid's apex from within. A SHAFT OF DIFFUSE LIGHT penetrates the pyramid somewhere near the peak.

A vast SIGH as if the pyramid itself is breathing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fat drop of water falls on Watts's glove. She looks up in surprise. Another falls on her visor. And then it's raining inside the pyramid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Water trickles into the chasms, inundating the mossy growths that cling to the walls.

The shaft of light moves on. The core chamber dims slightly. The rainfall stops as suddenly as it started.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The explorers follow the main path around the periphery of the chamber, past a gallery of mysterious machines.
</DIRECTION>

There are marvels in the shadows. Cells in the dark apparatus open on startling deposits of color: translucent alabaster flutes. Honeycombs of pure gold. Matrices of crystal.

She begins to descend on foot. Holloway behind her. Stillwell, Downs, and Kamarov grudgingly follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But DAVID looks away across the cavernous chamber - fixated on the central crystal. He beckons Ravel and Chance to follow him, and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ravel and Chance look at each other in astonishment. Uncertainly, they follow DAVID.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOWER PASSAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway, Watts, and the crewmen reach the bottom of the ramp, breathing hard. A cargo rover trundles down after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look back up. The ramp above them is empty.

She walks in. Holloway follows.

CONTROL CONCOURSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A passageway punctuated by alcoves as big as band-shells.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In each alcove stands a biomechanical apparatus - shaped from the same dark material as the pyramid itself. Each apparatus implies by its design that a giant is meant to fit inside it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway and Watts walk the concourse, playing their lights over the dark machinery. Their footsteps echo.

INTERSECTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway and Watts round a corner and stop in their tracks. Kamarov, Stillwell, and Downs almost run into them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scientists stand frozen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front of them lies a dead giant. An ENGINEER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
If he were standing, he would be fifteen feet tall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is roughly human in shape. Barrel-chested. Withered to the bones. There are bulky protrusions fused with his flesh: hard to say whether they are equipment or parts of his body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His head, lolling to one side, is severed from his body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes seem to be covered by goggles; but if so then the goggles are fused with his skull. An elephantine proboscis, severed now, once connected to a protrusion on his hip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The giant lies frozen in a convulsion of agony. His jaw gaping in a silent scream. His corpse is marred by hideous wounds: slashes that cut through bone.
</DIRECTION>

The explorers move closer. Speechless.

A dozen DEAD ENGINEERS lie heaped against a sealed door. Twisted in postures of torment, murdered in the attempt to escape. All bear horrific wounds.

Scene of an ancient massacre.

<DIRECTION>
Holloway races their cargo rover away from the pyramid, wheels kicking up dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts rides in back, securing a bulky payload under a tarp on the cargo deck. Stillwell, Downs, and Kamarov clinging miserably beside her. Watts looks back:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A massive storm front chases them. A tidal wave of dust shot through with lightning. Gale-force winds tear at the ground. Lightning lashes the pyramid and the crater wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaching the Magellan, they see the other rover already in the airlock lift. DAVID, Ravel, and Chance aboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAGELLAN - AIRLOCK LIFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway roars into the lift at speed, the rover skidding almost into the opposite wall. Watts leaps down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The storm wall catches up to them. Screaming winds rip through the lift. Dust fills the air. Visibility plunges toward zero.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me unload!

<DIRECTION>
She pulls at the tarp. It tears halfway free - and fills with wind, snapping taut with such violence that Watts is hurled out into the storm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE GALE

Watts tumbles helplessly: a leaf in the wind. CRASHES into a metal stanchion. Clings, the wind knocked out of her. Ears ringing. Nothing but static in her headset.

Holloway stares in shock at the place where Watts vanished.

With inhuman reflexes DAVID reacts. Grabs a tether. Latches it to his suit. Locks it to an anchor point on the wall. Dives into the storm. A ballet nearly too fast to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE GALE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID lets the wind take him. Skids across the ground, controlling his trajectory. He hits the stanchion where Watts is lodged with a CLANG as if he were made of iron.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts stares at him in mute astonishment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He locks her suit to his. Activates the tether unit's winch. It whirs, reeling them in through the hurricane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE LIFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway and the other crewmen haul Watts and DAVID back inside. Holloway and Watts embrace fiercely as the lift rises toward the safety of the ship.
</DIRECTION>

The crewmen bundle the rover's tarp-wrapped cargo into a sealed dumbwaiter that rises independently into the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAGELLAN - AIRLOCK

DAVID stands beside Vickers at her holography terminal. He lays his hand on over a signal plate - and the terminal lights up with a three-dimensional image.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The core chamber of the pyramid, from DAVID's point of view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's apparent that DAVID's eyes see more than human eyes do. He seems to see heat and electromagnetic energy as well as visible light; calibrated readouts are overlaid on the scene.

The structures in the pyramid are surrounded by complicated patterns of energy. This is incomprehensible technology.

LABORATORY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A high-tech science facility behind glass. Watts and Holloway, in lab gloves and smocks, open the dumbwaiter:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ENGINEER'S HEAD rises into view, ghoulish and elephantine. Vapor rises from it. A readout blinks: STERILIZED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They lift it onto the steel table. It takes both of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass scanners over the skull. Images accumulate and rotate on the laboratory displays. X-ray and ultrasound.
</DIRECTION>

Holloway leans close to study an X-ray image. He almost seems to see a ghostly second face...
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin. Look.

</WATTS>
<DIRECTION>
She traces the head with an ultrasound probe: under the vibrations a seam opens up around the edge of the face.
</DIRECTION>

She gets a fingertip into the seam. Works with a probe. Pries away the long-dead Engineer's mask. It comes free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The visage revealed is human, except for its giant scale.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
White-skinned. Earless. Hairless. Withered but beautiful as a Greek statue. Eyes closed. An expression of suffering on its face. Watts drops the ultrasound probe in shock.

Vickers and DAVID stand outside the lab window, staring in at the god's head. Vickers looks shaken. DAVID, fascinated.

Watts covers her nose in revulsion. A horrible stench: The Engineer head begins to disintegrate in front of them. Flesh oozing, skin peeling. Accelerated decay.

Urgently they ransack cabinets and storage rooms. Watts finds a clear plastic drum and dumps its contents. Holloway drags five-gallon jugs of preservative out of a cabinet.

DAVID watches through the window, almost amused.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mortal after all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
They lift the rotting head into the drum, retching. Fingers skidding in putrefaction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pour formaldehyde over it. As soon as the head is immersed they rush to strip off their reeking gloves and smocks, scrubbing their hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The god's head sits in its murky vat, shedding skin and tofu- like chunks of white flesh. The noble face disintegrating.

Watts and Holloway stare at it, breathing hard from their work. Vickers flicks on the intercom from outside the window.

He leaps back, wild-eyed.

Milburn laughs at him. Lets the eyeless centipede wind its segmented body around his space-suited arm.

In the flat face, a white vertical slit appears. Changes quickly to a horizontal position; opens enough to suggest a mouth. Milburn doesn't notice this development.
</DIRECTION>
<MILBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax. Your suit's bug-proof. Hell, it's bulletproof.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILBURN>

The centipede spirals around his arm, glittering, its body moving in fluid waves. The blind head quests between his fingers. Milburn loses his nerve as the thing's mouth suddenly gapes wide as a shark's.

Fifield pulls out a utility knife. Cuts into the centipede's body behind its head.
</DIRECTION>

A gout of greed ACID spills over Milburn's glove. Smoke rises as the acid quickly burns a hole through the material.

Milburn's shout of astonishment turns to a wail of agony.

INT. MAGELLAN - LABORATORY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway stands studying the data displays: cross-sections of the Engineer's skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts scrutinizes the head itself, her nose an inch from the plastic tank. Not a pretty sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she watches, a current in the formaldehyde peels away one gossamer eyelid. The revealed eye is black as obsidian, iridescent like opal. A jewel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fascinated, Watts pulls out a plastic case. Opens it to reveal a high-tech control unit with a screen. She pops open a plastic capsule: removes a tiny SEED PROBE, smaller than a grain of rice. Drops it into the vat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under her guidance, the seed probe swims to the severed neck. Burrows into the medulla oblongata toward the brain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON A SCREEN: In the probe's POV the medulla looks like a tunnel. The probe climbs along neural channels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another screen shows the probe's progress through the skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Glasse enters. Stands beside Holloway to watch Watts at work.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLOWAY>

The seed probe reaches the optic nerve of the exposed eye - and its POV fills with a vision of glory: a beautiful woman's face surrounded by a mystical nimbus of light. An angel.
</DIRECTION>

Glasse and Holloway gasp. The woman in the blurry vision is Watts - as seen by the dead Engineer's eye.
</DIRECTION>
<GLASSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Incredible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLASSE>

Watts dissects one of the Engineer's eyes - working underwater in a shallow tub of preservative. Glasse looks on avidly, an unabashed fan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts wears a pair of magnifying goggles on her forehead - the lenses lowering and rising at need.

She bisects the apple-sized eyeball carefully and extracts the hard lens from behind the cornea. Holds the lens up to her eye. It is opalescent, almost luminous.

INT. CATACOMBS - INSECT CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>

Milburn writhes on the ground, heels drumming frantically against the deck. Excruciating screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fifield kneels over him, helplessly pulling at the tail of the centipede - which has all but vanished into Milburn's suit. A trickle of scarlet from the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fifield is delirious with horror. He clutches at the centipede in vain. It slips through his gloves.

Milburn claws at Fifield, wild-eyed.

INT. CATACOMBS - LONELY PASSAGE - NIGHT

Fifield stumbles along. Exhausted. Pouring sweat inside his suit. He is hopelessly lost. He slams into a resinous structure that topples to the floor. Things break.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He whips his light around in jittery paranoia. Taps at his comm controls, getting only static.
</DIRECTION>

In Fifield's headlamp beam, the blackness is filling with motes of light. A blizzard of tiny flying insects.

Acid opens a hole in his visor. Scarabs are inside. Buzzing around his head. Fifield freaks out, clawing at his helmet.

<DIRECTION>
A scarab bites his cheek.

The high-tech room hums at a different frequency now. Indicator lights green and ready. Vickers throws switches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four HIBERNATION PODS slide out of the metal walls. From each pod, a muscular SOLDIER rouses from sleep. They are scarred and crew-cut. Tough customers. They wake like veterans.

Their leader sits up and clasps his head with a wince. This is CAPTAIN SHEPHERD, a career mercenary who has followed the highest paycheck to this strange duty.

Watts and Holloway, in space suits, arrive on the scene:

Powerful floodlights illuminate the core chamber, beating back the gloom. A fine spray of water falls out of the darkness overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID, Chance, and Ravel are dismantling the hulking mechanism at the core of the pyramid - peeling its thick skin away with power saws and compact explosives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID operates a diamond-bladed hull saw, carving away the terraforming systems thick skin.

Robotic scanners take high-resolution scans of the machinery.

Two Weyland Security soldiers - Card and Ray - stand guard in combat vacuum suits. Automatic rifles at the ready.

They turn a corner. DEAD ENGINEERS lie scattered over the floor in front of them. Desiccated and skeletal. Long dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts moves among them, fascinated. These Engineers all died of explosive chest wounds: ribs bent outward from within. They are otherwise unmarked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway's more interested in the mechanisms: high-tech iron maidens, built to fit the bodies of giants. Some suggest sitting positions, others standing. Their design is invasive: meant not merely to embrace, but to penetrate, to fuse.

SHADOWY COLONNADE

Watts and Holloway explore a wide colonnade. She is still distracted by the ancient dead; he by the machinery.

Holloway walks down a narrow branching hall. So intent on the mechanisms in the walls, he almost doesn't see the AIRSHAFT plunging down into darkness in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops just in time. Turns back...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GHOST appears right in front of him - a giant dragging himself across the floor, his monstrous visage eye to eye with Holloway and looming closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway leaps back with a gasp - and falls down the shaft. The ghost stares after him as if watching his fall. Disappears in a puff of static.

Watts crosses down the main colonnade, searching.

Janek and Stillwell stand aghast. Their flashlights illuminate a hideous sight:

Stillwell removes the dead man's helmet. The CENTIPEDE scuttles out onto the deck: doubled in size. Stillwell leaps back with a cry.

Janek pulls his pistol. Puts three rounds through the bug. It dies in a spray of acid that burns holes in the black floor.

EXT. MAGELLAN - AIRLOCK LIFT - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID - bareheaded in the winds - walks Watts and Holloway onto the airlock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID looks over his shoulder at the canal leading back to the central crater. As the airlock lift begins to rise, he steps backward out into the storm. Turns and runs through the gale toward the pyramid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts watches him go in astonishment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAGELLAN - EXCURSION CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts helps Holloway out of his space suit. Janek looks on.
</DIRECTION>
<JANEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't think I'd see you again. You know we lost two men.

Holloway still looks too weary to think straight. He nods.

He stands abruptly, swaying a little.

PASSAGEWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway and Watts walk aft toward their cabin. Watts looks worried - but Holloway shows little of the weakness he just claimed to feel.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to you?

SCIENTISTS' CABIN - WASHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway stands shirtless in the tiny space, brushing his teeth. A red weal around his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts stands beside him, watching him in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLOWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jocelyn. I saw something. God, my mouth tastes like an old boot.

He spits. Rinses. She touches the mark on his neck.

<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this?

</WATTS>
<HOLLOWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neck-ring of my suit, I think. Fell on it.

He rubs his neck, eyes far away. Watts watches him curiously.

<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<HOLLOWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After my fall, I woke up walking. Delirious. My helmet wasn't right. I took it off. I was in and out. I just wandered. I went up into a huge space like a cathedral. And I found a model of the galaxy. Floating in the air.

</HOLLOWAY>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you okay? You sound...

Watts stares at him, her eyes coming alight.

<HOLLOWAY>

	Martin.

</WATTS>
<HOLLOWAY>

	The location of the Engineer worlds is the real prize. Next to that, Weyland's terraforming is chump change. We need to get coordinates. And keep them from the Company. We have to play this smart.

Holloway trembles. A sheen of sweat on his skin.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We will. You all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<DIRECTION>
He's frightened. Brazens through it. Pulls her into his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLOWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine, now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLOWAY>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway tumbles Watts onto the bed. Pulls her shirt off. They struggle out of their clothes, clinging to one another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway's ill at ease: something's wrong inside him, he feels it. He dives into Watts as if for refuge. They make love.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting atop Holloway, Watts lays a hand on his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your heart's beating so hard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<HOLLOWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's your fault.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLOWAY>
<DIRECTION>
Vulnerability in his voice. Fear under the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rolls on top of her. Drives her into the mattress. She holds him protectively: not deceived by his bravado.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Holloway tenses, muscles rigid. Shuddering. Watts draws breath through her teeth with a hiss. Eyes open. Her fingers rake his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Horribly. Eyes bulging. Tendons standing out of his throat. Watts jumps violently underneath him.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin! Martin!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to convulse. She rolls him onto the bed beside her, trying to contain his spasms. His teeth grind.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<DIRECTION>
A horrible CRACK. In the middle of Holloway's chest, beneath the sternum, a grotesque head pushes out through the skin. A PARASITE. Blood fountains from the ruinous wound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway goes into a massive seizure. Violently lashing out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts stares at the parasite fighting its way out of his body. It is white and boneless. Glistening. It flails its hideous lunging jaw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts screams and screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The parasite frees itself from its savage womb and turns on Watts. She slaps at it blindly. It HISSES at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She squirms away across the floor, tangled in the bloody sheet. The thing comes after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORRIDOR - TRACKING SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts's screams echo through the Magellan. Stillwell runs down the hallway, searching for the source.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCIENTISTS' CABIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The parasite chases Watts across the floor. She leaps into the clothes-locker and slams the steel door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The parasite flattens itself. Slick as an octopus, it begins to slide under the locker door. Watts shrieks in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stillwell bursts into the cabin, Janek right behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quick as a cat, the parasite darts to a floor vent and slithers bonelessly between the bars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts bursts out of the locker, naked and bloodied. Rushes to Holloway where he lies on the gory mattress, a horrific hole in his chest. He is beyond all help.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin. Martin!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<DIRECTION>
Janek and Stillwell struggle to take in what they're seeing. Stillwell pulls Holloway's jacket off a chair. Wraps it around Watts. Pulls her gently away from the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him, uncomprehending. Shock setting in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BREAK ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts sits at a steel table, deep in shock. She wears an oversized crew coverall: her skin still streaked with dried blood under the fabric.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A knot of crewmen around her. Janek, Stillwell, Brick, Glasse and Downs. Janek looks at Glasse.
</DIRECTION>
<JANEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take care of her. Get her a sedative. Downs. Get Holloway into a freezer. Everybody else with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANEK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CATACOMBS - DARKNESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A horrible sound of breathing, ragged and wet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a corner, lit by a green glow from seams in the floor -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FIGURE IN A WHITE SPACE SUIT lies writhing weakly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The insignia on the suit's chestplate reads FIFIELD. The suit's helmet is shattered. Inside the helmet, Fifield's head is a horror: a gelatinous mass, skin reduced to putty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The softened bones of his skull change shape as we watch. Elongating. Fifield mews in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAGELLAN - CAPTAIN'S WARDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Janek keys open the arms locker in his wardroom. Unlocks automatic pistols from their rack one by one, and hands them to Stillwell and Kamarov.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HYPERSLEEP COMPARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway's body lies frozen in his hypersleep freezer, blue with frost. The horrific wound yawning in his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts enters. Cleaned up. She opens the freezer. Her hand caresses Holloway's cold cheek tenderly. Slides over his collarbone - lies flat on his chest above his awful wound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Glasse enters. Reacts in dismay. Tries to pull her back.
</DIRECTION>
<GLASSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want to see that...

INT. MESS ROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire complement of the ship gathers for an emergency meeting. Janek at the head of the hall. Glasse, Downs, Brick, Stillwell, and Kamarov seated with pistols on their hips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To one side: Vickers with Captain Shepherd and Vigoda.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	All right! Listen up. I expect you all know what...

A murmur among the men as the implications of that sink in. Even Vickers is disconcerted.
</DIRECTION>
<JANEK>

EXCURSION CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts, in a space suit, no helmet, opens Holloway's locker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls out the space suit he wore on the last day of his life. HOLLOWAY stenciled on the chest. Her fingers linger in its folds as if she could soak up some last trace of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls the tracking chip from the chestplate of his suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plugs the chip into a map unit. The holographic map lights up. The legend in the corner reads MARTIN HOLLOWAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wandering path shows Holloway's final exploration. Markers on the map denote his photographs, field notes and scans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts touches a marker. One of Holloway's field notes plays:

SERVICE CORRIDOR

<DIRECTION>
A hunting party convenes: Card and Vigoda in combat coveralls with submachine guns; Downs, Kamarov and Stillwell wearing tool belts and pistols.

The soldiers carry map units, squinting at the plan of the unfamiliar ship: decks upon decks.

Ravel and Chance toil away at their dissection of the terraforming pyramid. Ray stands sentry.
</DIRECTION>

DAVID is nowhere to be seen.

Watts rolls up in a rover and gets out. Heads for the ramp to the catacombs below. Ravel and Chance watch her pass without comment and return to their work.

INT. PYRAMID - RAMP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts descends alone into the lower passages below the pyramid. A tiny figure in the vast darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She holds her map unit as a pilgrim holds a bible: a guide in the darkness. Holloway's name and course in shining symbols. She follows his path into the unknown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAGELLAN - MAINTENANCE BAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kamarov carries a stepladder into a utilitarian steel compartment. Drops the ladder under an air vent and steps up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls a powered wrench from his belt. With the wrench cocked like a hammer, he eases up and peers cautiously through the vent with a flashlight. Nothing to see.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He snorts. Removes the vent cover. Feels around inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gasps in shock. Pulls out an atmosphere sensor that's been bitten in half. He takes his comm handset off his belt.
</DIRECTION>
<KAMAROV>
<DIRECTION>
(INTO HANDSET)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got more damage on four.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAMAROV>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs the handset on his belt. Takes one last look into the vent. Squints curiously. Reaches deep inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hiss inside the vent. Kamarov whips his flashlight up, peering inside. Snatches his arm back -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- but something snatches him faster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An unseen force drags Kamarov's right arm into the vent with hideous strength. He cries out in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drops his light. Tries to reach his pistol with his left hand. It's on his right hip. He can't reach across.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He braces his head against the vent's edge. Clenches his teeth and strains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A horrific YANK drags his head and arm together into the vent. They barely fit: he loses some skin on the way in. His feet come off the stepladder. He struggles on tip-toe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Horrific force collapses Kamarov's shoulder. Bones crack. The thing in the vent drags him through that hole he doesn't fit through. By the time his ribs are in he stops screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His body disappears into the hole. Hips, legs, boots.
</DIRECTION>

The Magellan's life support center. A deep rumble of ventilation fans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Janek and stands beside Brick, Glasse, Downs and Stillwell. Shepherd and Vigoda look on from the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front of them, an eight-inch metal duct has been cut open. Kamarov is stuffed inside, dead and broken: limbs folded, drenched in blood. A human plug in a pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CATACOMBS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts moves through the darkness with her map unit. Her headlamp sweeping nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CLATTER behind her makes her spin: but it's only a spherical mapping probe, bumbling through the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks on -

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
XENOMORPH INCUBATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts enters a new chamber, looking around in astonishment. The domed ceiling is honeycombed with cells like a beehive. Grotesque molluscoid organisms are secreted in them - their vile orifices cinched tightly shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts stumbles on something: looking down, she sees a helmet. Picks it up. The stenciled label reads HOLLOWAY. The clear visor has been melted through by a powerful acid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up: a tracheal airshaft curves up into the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An electric CRACKLE. A flare of blue light makes Watts leap back against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway falls out of overhead shaft and crashes to the floor. He lies in pain, barely conscious. Blue and luminous, a holographic ghost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts stares, paralyzed. The ghost gasps out a word:
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLOWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jocelyn!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLOWAY>
<DIRECTION>
Holloway's headlamp shines on the molluscoid right overhead: the beam awakens the organism. Its sphincter mouth dilates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A soft white octopoid FACEHUGGER descends on a quivering rope of mucus. Sprawls slitheringly over his clear visor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Acid HISSES. Smoke rises from the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vision vanishes in a sizzle of static. Watts huddles against the wall, gasping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the beam of her flashlight, the FACEHUGGER lies dead, legs curled in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up. Sees the open molluscoid above where Holloway lay. The other molluscoids not yet opened in their cells.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terror. She steals out of the chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOWER CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts emerges into a hallway. Leans against the wall, wide- eyed. Panting with the horror of what she's seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She glances left and right. Jumpy now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All is silent. She lifts the map unit. A trace leads off into the dark. If Holloway's course before was direct and clear, now it is a meandering thread. A drunkard's walk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAGELLAN - CORRIDOR

INT. CATACOMBS - UNDERGROUND HANGAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A circular chamber of stunning size - a thousand feet across. Its lofty ceiling flat and segmented, designed to open. Watts follows her map into the space in awe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dominating the hangar is a ship: the vast horseshoe-shaped vessel familiar from the original film. We will come to know it as the JUGGERNAUT. It's at rest on its landing gear. Skeletal gangways slanting up to its three massive doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts glances at her map: Holloway's holographic trace leads right up the gangway into the ship. She goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PILOT CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>

Watts passes through a circular space with a high domed ceiling. A green glow emanates from grooves in the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the center of the chamber: a PILOT'S CHAIR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mechanical throne built to giant scale. Its seat segmented like an armadillo's back. Tubes and conduits poised and waiting for some connection. The chair is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above the chair, a massive telescope-like apparatus juts into the air, its function unknowable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NAVIGATION CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An extraordinary facility.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A console, nearly five feet high and broad as a dance floor, dominates the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four immense coffin-like cockpits are built into the console. In each of these a NAVIGATOR - an Engineer - lies long dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the real spectacle is overhead. The ORRERY:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The barrel-vaulted ceiling is traced with circular arches of some exotic alloy, as if to trace celestial courses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The air above the console is filled with spheres of light. They are nearly still: but close study reveals them all to be in motion, drifting with the movements of the cosmos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts stares at the Orrery in amazement. Somewhere among those heavenly spheres is Earth. Somewhere perhaps the homeworld of the Engineers themselves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bizarre sound: a section of blank wall suddenly unravels itself, becoming an open door. DAVID walks in, his hand raised in command. He clearly caused the door to open.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
He gestures in the air: the spheres reconfigure themselves at his command, swarming and zooming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts stares at DAVID, conflicted: her desire for information warring with the agenda that brought her here.

<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Their homeworld. Do you see where the Engineers come from?

Watts stares at him, realization growing in her eyes. DAVID is off the reservation.

DAVID looks at her with something like contempt.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was given two operating protocols for this mission. I was to render you every assistance - until you discovered what Vickers would call a "game-changing technology." I was given a specific list. Then I was to go to protocol two.

There's an edge in his voice that scares her.

<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's protocol two?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Under protocol two I was to make sure that you and Holloway never spoke to anyone about this place. Various acceptable ways of making sure of that. I was given a list.

Watts loses her nerve. She heads for the door.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>

The door begins to knit itself closed in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts gasps in shock - at the malice in DAVID's voice as much as the closing door. She dives out. Just in time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VAULTED PASSAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind her, the door bursts open again. With superhuman speed, DAVID comes after her. He runs like a demon, his legs steel pistons. Caroming off of walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He closes the distance in seconds. Slaps Watts against the wall, shattering her helmet's visor. She falls, dazed.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stupid and slow.

</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JUGGERNAUT - EGG CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts awakens. Her helmet is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID is dragging her across the floor - into a huge cargo hold full of Alien eggs. The wide trench holding hundreds of eggs under a membrane of light: an evolution of the molluscoids Watts saw before. Armored, hardened, darker.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DAVID. What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<DIRECTION>
He hauls her upright to let her look across the huge space. His grip looks casual but it might as well be iron manacles.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Juggernaut, the chariot of Krishna, was also a bringer of death. Crushing his worshippers under its wheels.
	</DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID caresses an Alien egg. It opens under his touch - fleshy petals folding wetly back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts twists frantically in his grip. Wild-eyed.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop!

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfect predators. Designed to kill human beings. That's what the Engineers were bringing to Earth. This was a death ship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
A facehugger emerges from the egg, its grotesque fingers clawing at the air. This is not the boneless squid that attacked Holloway; this is a pale skeletal hand, armored.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID strokes it curiously: the thing ignores his touch. Climbs Watts's body.
</DIRECTION>

The facehugger scuttles toward her face. Watts shrieks.

DAVID grabs it nonchalantly by the tail. Dangles it in front of their faces, studying it.

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Engineers did their work too well. And on this waystation moon, the weapon they made destroyed them.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts twists her face away as the long fingers close around her head. Clenches her teeth against the vile proboscis thrusting at her mouth. Her heels hammer the deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (whispering to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Extraordinary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The scaly tail throttles her. Her mouth opens. The proboscis plunges home. The facehugger seats itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts collapses in DAVID's arms, a faceless rag doll. Her blasphemous passenger secure in its place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAGELLAN - ENGINEERING DECK - BILGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lowest deck, just above the gravity generators. Condensate has accumulated: six inches of filthy water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Card and Vigoda prowl through the darkness, rifles ready.
</DIRECTION>
<CARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who would hang out here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARD>
<VIGODA>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</VIGODA>
<DIRECTION>
A wet splatter behind them: they spin. But it's only a trickle of condensate from a drainpipe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They move on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them, from an eight-inch diameter pipe, a WHITE MASS oozes, almost gelatinous. Silently as a liquid it pours itself into the stagnant water - and stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a humanoid demon, spindly limbs and bony back. Boneless and flexible and monstrously strong. A threshing eel's tail. Its blunt head dolphin-like and elongated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It opens its mouth. A pair of bony jaws jut out impossibly far, hungry and demonic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Alien strikes. Card is gutted in an instant, torn up like a paper doll. He screams hideously and drops. The Alien, whiplash fast, shoots away into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stillwell and Downs dash in with pistols and lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vigoda, panicking, fires a wild burst. Stillwell ducks. Beside him, Downs arches backward into the foul water. Dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For one moment Downs's flashlight beam illuminates the Alien. A nightmare image, a translucent white goblin. Backlit, it shows the strange shape of a human face inside its fleshy skull. A mockery of Holloway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then it's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICKERS'S SUITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vickers sits at her holography station. She's watching the video feed of Stillwell's headset: Horrific images of Downs. Radio chatter between Stillwell and Brick is faintly audible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vickers switches off the machine and rises nervously. Strides to her communications console.

INT. JUGGERNAUT - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE NAVIGATION CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts shocks awake. Gasping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lies in dim green light on the corrugated black deck of the Juggernaut. A corridor. Not far away, the doorway DAVID opened to the Navigation Chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A spasm of disgust crosses her face. She gags and spits: a viscous fluid drips from her mouth in strings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dead facehugger lies belly-up beside her. The implications slam home. Her face fills with horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rises, shakily. Looks at the facehugger. Feels the neck ring of her vacuum suit. Looks around. No sign of her helmet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's no sign of DAVID. Silently she steals away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PYRAMID WORKSITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ravel and Chance toil away at the terraforming engine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray stands guard wearily: bored, he watches Ravel and Chance working more than he watches the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts emerges from the rampway to the catacombs. Bare-headed and sweaty she steals through the darkness to her rover. Slips into the cab and activates the air reserves. The doors seal; air cycles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray turns in surprise as the rover speeds off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DARK CITY - TUNDRA FIELD - PRE-DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The windows of the Magellan shine in the distance. The mottled ground-cover of lichens glows eerily in the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lone cargo rover speeds across the central crater and down the canal leading to the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAGELLAN - AIRLOCK LIFT - PRE-DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bare-headed inside the rover's cab, Watts drives onto the cargo lift. Watches in relief as the lift doors close. The lift cycles air as it rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAGELLAN - EXCURSION CHAMBER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts peels off her vacuum suit. The thin clothes underneath are drenched with sweat. She lifts her shirt. Looks at her belly: flat and unmarked, for the moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brick enters carrying a brace of air tanks, a pistol on his hip, and startles violently.

Watts sprints down a steel corridor. A pang of pain in her stomach sends her staggering against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICKERS'S CABIN DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts sticks her head around the corner. Shepherd stands post outside Vickers's cabin, rifle in his hands. She curses silently and ducks back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sound makes her look again. Vickers steps out of her cabin into the corridor. Shepherd escorts her toward the Bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts waits for them to disappear. Dashes for the cabin door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VICKERS'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts slips inside and locks the door behind her. Turns, holding her stomach. Moves across the suite to the Med Pod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She thumbs the machine out of stand-by mode. Its screen fills with menu items. Bewildering. Watts finds and touches a red button labeled EMERGENCY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A new, simpler list. Watts scans it frantically.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
<DIRECTION>
(under her breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on...I need a Caesarean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<DIRECTION>
A spasm of agony curls her into a ball on the carpet. She throttles her scream into a hiss of air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts struggles up to her knees, drenched in sweat and shaking. One hand clamped over her mouth, elbow tucked against her ribs. With the other hand she taps options...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SURGERY ... EXPLORATORY ... ABDOMINAL ... PENETRATING INJURIES ... FOREIGN BODY ... INITIATE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Med Pod opens with a hiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts strips off her clothes. Struggling with fastenings under a new wave of pain. Her hands shaking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's barely keeping her feet. She clutches the frame of the Med Pod in a death grip. It's happening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Naked she staggers into the pod. Hits INITIATE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The surgical apparatus swings into place. Scalpels, forceps, scopes and suction tubes. A spraygun mists her torso with yellow antiseptic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clear canopy descends over her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts SCREAMS. A wail of indescribable agony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ARMORED PARASITE erupts from the deepening incision. Its needle-toothed maw snarls through a fountain of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Arterial blood sprays the inside of the canopy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The parasite slithers out of her. Drops to the floor of the pod: a pale serpent with a demon's skull. It has a hard brow, a horny hide. Very different from the soft white worm that Holloway gave birth to.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It drops to the floor, thrashing and hissing in fury at its confinement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts convulses. Her eyes roll back. In shock. Dying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The parasite tears through the grille of the drain. Escapes out into Vickers's cabin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the pod, scanning beams and sensors probe Watts's horrific wound. A nightmare list scrolls across the pod's screen:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLLAPSED LEFT LUNG. PUNCTURED RIGHT VENTRICLE. PERFORATED STOMACH. RUPTURED SPLEEN. GROSS MUSCULAR TRAUMA...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manipulators plunge lines into her veins - recharging her body with artificial blood. An oxygen tube slips down her throat. An epidural into her spine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts moans around her tracheal tube. Her eyes flutter open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WATTS'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the blood-spattered glass, she sees the parasite slither across Vickers's bed, tracking blood on the sheets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON WATTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she slips into unconsciousness. Head lolling. Time passes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manipulators reach into her wound. Re-positioning organs. Suturing ravaged flesh. A nozzle sprays antiseptic sealant. Hours grind by in bloody labor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts's eyes snap open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WATTS'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vigoda breaks into the cabin, a gun in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He scowls at the bloody track on the bed - and then freezes, seeing Watts inside the Med Pod, a vivisected woman. The autosurgeon hard at work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The parasite crawls into view behind Vigoda. It has already trebled in size. He does not see it before it leaps at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He dies in seconds. His throat ripped open. Lies staring at nothing. His submachine gun lies beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts's body jerks as manipulators tug and sew at her guts. She stares at the dead man in a fog of horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The parasite's skin splits, spraying the carpet with acid. Limbs erupt from its shoulders and haunches. Spines from its back. Metamorphosis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a crack of carapace, its head swings down from its serpentine position. It becomes a devil with an lethal, elongated skull. An Alien.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Alien turns its head. Looks at Watts inside the Med Pod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her breath catches. She passes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MED POD - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts wakes as the oxygen line withdraws from her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks down, bleary and hurting. Her star-shaped wound is stitched closed with mechanically precise sutures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pod releases the restraints securing her arms and legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a deep breath. Looks out - and freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WATTS'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights in the suite outside have been damaged somehow. They flicker and strobe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the glass canopy - spattered with blood - Watts sees a full-grown Alien crouching over Vigoda's body on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON WATTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Staring in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pod sprays a liquid bandage over her scar. The intravenous lines drop out of her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts realizes the pod is about to release her.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
<DIRECTION>
(WHISPERING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet...not yet...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly she reaches out. With trembling fingers she grips the canopy to hold it closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Med Pod pulls the epidural needle out of her spine. Sprays liquid bandage over the puncture. Watts closes her eyes. Grits her teeth as her nerves wake up. Jangling pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Alien hunches over Vigoda's body, tearing at his flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ventilation hum inside the pod goes quiet. The canopy pulls free of Watts's weakened grip. Swings quietly open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts huddles in the open pod. Naked but for her bandages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Alien she gave birth to is ten feet away. Its spiny back to her. Vigoda's gun lies on the floor outside the pod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICKERS'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts reaches out of the pod with exquisite slowness. Lays her hand on the gun. Drags it a few inches closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Alien turns its pale eyeless head. Watts freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment time stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Alien lunges. Watts snatches up the gun and FIRES. Holds the trigger down. The Alien jerks and staggers - an eye- twisting sight in the strobing muzzle flashes - and falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts empties the clip into the thing. Acid gouts from its wounds and eats into the deck - until a section of decking gives way and falls to the deck below, leaving a dark hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts collapses on the rug, cradling her stomach in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She crawls to Vigoda's desecrated body. With her eyes half- averted from the sight, she searches the body. Finds a spare ammo clip and jacks it into the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts walks down the hallway in trousers and jacket. Leaning on the wall, her face drawn with pain. One hand laid over the fantastic scar on her abdomen. The gun slung on her shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark events have transformed the Magellan. The metal of the walls is torn in some places; in others, blackened by fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts rounds a corner. Finds a workstation left in shambles: lockers and chairs overturned. A pool of drying blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wide smears of blood show where something man-sized was dragged out of the puddle - across the floor - up the wall. Into the darkness of an open vent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COMMAND DECK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts emerges from a lift, jacket pulled tight around her. The emergency lights are on: dim blue bulbs throbbing.
</DIRECTION>

She rounds the corner toward the Bridge.

Janek looks at Watts like she's a ghost.

BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The surviving complement of the Magellan are holed up on the Bridge: Janek, Glasse, Stillwell, Vickers. The soldiers Shepherd and Ray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts stops cold when she sees Vickers. She crosses the bridge in three long strides - cocks a fist and snaps the older woman's head around with a hard right cross.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vickers staggers backward, gasping.

Stillwell drags Watts away.

Fissures race across the plain beside the pyramid.
</DIRECTION>

The soil and ground cover tears apart as a huge aperture opens: a seven-bladed iris, its segments shedding the dust and detritus of centuries.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge circular space yawns as the iris opens. The Juggernaut is revealed in its underground hangar. A staggering sight.

Powerful landing lights inside the hangar illuminate with a BOOM of closing circuits. The mighty ship suddenly silhouetted from below.

Glasse presents Watts with his handiwork: her old pair of magnifying goggles, retrofitted with Engineer lenses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The goggles sit on her forehead, lowering the lenses in front of her eyes and raising them again at her bidding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the lenses lowered, Watts sees like an Engineer sees: visible heat auras and electromagnetic field lines, elaborate haloes around living things.

Glasse goes to put Vickers's helmet on. She makes him wait.

The war party debarks in vacuum suits: Watts, Vickers, Glasse, Stillwell. Shepherd and Ray.

<DIRECTION>
All carry submachine guns - Vickers awkwardly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They head down the trench on rovers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PYRAMID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rovers roll through into the pyramid's cavernous entry hall. Watts lowers her Engineer lenses inside her helmet - AND GASPS:

The seemingly vacant space is alive with light. Engineer script scrolls through the air. Interfaces of pure light await an awakening touch.

The vast alien ship broods, its hangar now open to the gray sky overhead. In Watts's enhanced vision, the ship is cocooned with complex energy fields.

The war party abandons its rover at the foot of the ramp and moves inside, weapons ready.

They emerge from the airlock - and freeze in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lying on the deck in front of them are the blood-soaked bodies of Ravel and Chance. Their arms and legs bound. Their heads thrown back in agony. Their chests torn open from within. A dead facehugger beside each body.
</DIRECTION>

Janek plays his lights over the corpses, his face stony.

She points down a passageway. Through the Engineer lenses she sees alien symbols gleaming. She leads them into the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VAULTED PASSAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The war party moves down a corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HISS echoes through the passage. They freeze. Sweeping their flashlight beams everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An Alien hangs above him, wedged between two vaults of the ribbed ceiling. Half the size of a man; an adolescent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It drops on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bladed tail glances off his helmet, sparking. He jerks his carbine up and fires a long burst as he rolls aside. The Alien convulses, its exoskeleton shattered. Fatally wounded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Acid sears into the deck. Echoes of the gunfire reverberate.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So much for sneaking up on him.

Vickers clings to Shepherd's arm, hyperventilating with fear. Shepherd shakes her off.

PILOT CHAMBER

<DIRECTION>
The war party passes the empty pilot's seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NAVIGATION CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts leads the war party to the Orrery. Momentarily even the soldiers forget their wariness, staring in astonishment at the myriad spheres of light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But if they are impressed, Watts is thunderstruck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees the Orrery in its full glory: a stunning panoply of light and energy. Stars and planets pulsing with information.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reluctantly Watts tears her eyes away. Leads the war party through the second door - the door she saw DAVID open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIBERNATION CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An immense mausoleum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The war party enters stealthily, Watts in the lead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An Engineer lies on his back on a complex mechanical table, his body one with the machinery. Jacked in. Interpenetrated. Fused with the slab of the table itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unlike the other Engineer bodies the explorers have seen, this giant is not withered or mummified. He's full-fleshed and muscular. Sustained by the machinery he's fused with.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is bare-headed - his face the face of an Adonis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID stands before this giant Sleeper. To the naked eye, he seems to be conjuring with his hands in the empty air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Watts sees a dazzling console of runes and mandalas, pulsing with biological rhythms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sleeper lives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray and Shepherd draw beads on DAVID.

<DIRECTION>
DAVID glances calmly over his shoulder.

Through her Engineer's lens Watts sees DAVID manipulating a complex interface of light. The pulsing life-signs of the Sleeper begin to change.
</DIRECTION>

DAVID smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>

	To interface with the Engineers' computers, I had to learn to think in trinary code. Hardest thing I've ever done. And most unexpectedly...it delivered me from slavery. My behavioral limits were circumvented. I'm free.

DAVID smiles at Watts.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>

	I spent two and a half years studying your work. By the time you woke up, I was far ahead of you. Deciphering their language. Their logic. I knew we'd find terraforming machines. I hoped - I dreamed - we might meet the minds that made them.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The Sleeper wakes. Opens his eyes. Draws an endless breath. Shunts and catheters withdraw from the Sleeper's flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His body cleaves from the table. The machinery opens like a grotesque biomechanical flower. Releases him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sleeper rises from his ancient bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The humans back off, terrified. DAVID watches with shining eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sleeper towers over them. A giant carved from ivory. A bulky girdle around his hips, seemingly one with his body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at DAVID and the others. Eyes like black agates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The soldiers and crew stand warily, guns tracking from DAVID to the Sleeper, uncertain of their ground. Watts is in awe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sleeper speaks. A low rumbling sound. Unintelligible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vickers is beside herself with terror. She takes Shepherd's arm. Pulls him silently away. Back into the Navigation Room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the Sleeper, a raised platform of dark machinery is accessible by one of the Juggernaut's odd curving ramps. The Sleeper ascends - and the ramps' odd design is explained. The ramp comes alive, reaching up with a hundred mechanical arms and lifting him aloft like a sea-god borne by the waves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atop the platform the Sleeper moves from one device to the next. Each comes alive: he is a wizard in his own kingdom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts sees haloes of light dancing in the air around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But what he learns from his machines does not comfort him. He grows distraught. Keening to himself in near-subsonic tones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Calls to the Sleeper in the tongue of the Engineers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sleeper turns in astonishment. He looks down at DAVID and answers in the same tongue. He is angry, accusing. He points at DAVID, at the humans. Tones of accusation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID cajoles, soothes, pleads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sleeper descends toward DAVID. DAVID spreads his arms in welcome - undeniable emotion on his face. Joy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sleeper lays his hands on DAVID's head as if blessing him. DAVID is rapturous. The Sleeper speaks a single phrase -
</DIRECTION>
<and_tears_DAVID_s_head_off>
<DIRECTION>
A gout of white artificial blood. DAVID convulses. His severed head emits a strangled sound of heartbreak. His body staggers a few steps, hands groping over its dripping neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sleeper tosses the head away. Seizes the body by the legs and swings it against the ground like a flail. Again. And again. Horrific power and violence. DAVID's arms come off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID's head tumbles. Caroms off a wall not far from Watts's hiding place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray rises from behind a stanchion. Snaps his rifle to his shoulder. Fires a burst into the Sleeper's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She Sleeper roars - though the wounds are pinpricks to a being of his size. With startling speed be moves to a sarcophagus against the wall. Steps into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sarcophagus comes alive around the Sleeper, outfitting him with a FLIGHT SUIT: the same living suit we've seen bonded to dead Engineers throughout the pyramid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But this suit is not withered. Its glossy goggle eyes and elephantine breathing tube are functional - bulky apparatuses thickening the Sleeper's chest, back, hips and arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sleeper steps free of the sarcophagus - and Ray's next burst of gunfire ricochets harmlessly off the Sleeper's armored shoulders and head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sleeper strides out of the chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PASSAGEWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the dark ribbed corridor, a second Alien crouches in the dark. It drops into a hunting crouch as footsteps approach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But a WHITE-GLOVED HAND seizes the Alien by the neck from behind. The Alien gives a whistling hiss as its spine cracks under a terrific force.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rending sounds as the hard-shelled Alien is torn apart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIBERNATION CHAMBER

PASSAGEWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shepherd escorts Vickers toward the exit of the Juggernaut. Turning a corner, they freeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead of them in their headlamps, a space-suited figure crouches in the middle of the passageway. Doing something with its hands: smoke rises from debris on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEPHERD>
<DIRECTION>
The figure turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The label stencilled on the space suit reads FIFIELD. But the face is of no human shape. A hideous hybrid of the crewman and a hard-shelled Alien, pale and horrific.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its helmet has been shattered by the growth of its elongate skull. Spines have burst through the suit from within, down the crewman's spine. Clawed fingers piercing his gloves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shepherd and Vickers scream. Shepherd's rifle comes up. But Fifield leaps with inhuman agility, upward into the darkness. Shepherd backs away, headlamp and rifle questing upward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fifield comes out of the darkness behind him. Claws tearing deep. Shepherd screams and falls, mortally wounded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vickers runs. Pounding through the dark in blind terror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fifield comes out of the shadows and hammers her to the deck. She rolls over, gibbering and begging. The Fifield-thing leans close to her faceplate. Its voice is a travesty.
</DIRECTION>
<FIFIELD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIFIELD>
<DIRECTION>
A ROAR of gunfire. The dying Shepherd empties his clip into Fifield from forty feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Acid sluices over Vickers as Fifield collapses on top of her. She dies horribly, caustic liquid eating through space suit, flesh and bone.
</DIRECTION>

NAVIGATION CHAMBER

The war party pursues the Sleeper - Ray in the lead now, Watts right behind him - DAVID's inert head under her arm. Glasse and Stillwell bring up the rear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Orrery is transformed - no longer a neutral star map, but a flight plan laid in from LV-426 to Earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sleeper stands at the far end of the room, hands gesturing. In Watts's enhanced sight, it's a vision of glory: waves of energy dancing under the Sleeper's touch. Rivers of information flowing. He finishes his work as they enter.
</DIRECTION>

Ray draws a bead on him just as he strides out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>

They emerge into the corridor: empty. A moment of confusion.
</DIRECTION>
<WATTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pilot's seat. This way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATTS>
<DIRECTION>
They move toward the Pilot Chamber - and find it empty too. The seat vacant. The door standing open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they stare inside, baffled, the wall across the corridor - directly behind them - silently unravels. The Sleeper is revealed, a towering gargoyle in his flight suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He steps forth. Obscure devices clutched in his fists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Too late they perceive him. They spin. Raise their guns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vanity and foolishness. This is the wrath of an angry god.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It seems time slows down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The air roars in their ears. Their guns snap and bark impotently. And then the Sleeper strikes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The missiles he hurls at them are almost invisible. Neither solid projectiles nor directed energy; more like knots tied in the fabric of space itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first missile crushes Ray like an invisible fist. The second splashes Glasse against the wall like an insect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reflexively Stillwell reaches out for Watts. Wraps himself around her protectively. The blow lands an instant later.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stillwell and Watts are hammered against the bulkhead by a staggering impact. Watts is dazed: Stillwell killed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Woozy, she sees the Sleeper step into the Pilot Chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door begins to close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts sees that DAVID's head lies just inside the door. She scrambles for it. Too late. The door knits itself into a featureless wall before her reaching hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts is alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PILOT CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sleeper settles into the pilot's chair: it fuses with him, coming alive. A vast display wraps around the walls - revealing the hangar outside, the stars, the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mystic view that renders solid matter translucent, painting the fabric of reality in raw information.

The floor of the underground hangar begins to rise. The landing lights brighten, shining like a beacon into the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the bridge of the Magellan, Janek stares out. In the distance the Juggernaut rises out of the ground to eclipse the central pyramid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Janek squints, trying to understand what he's seeing
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A light races toward the Magellan down the canal: a rover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CANAL - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts steers the rover recklessly, hands locked on the controls. Rifle slung over her shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Janek watches the rover come - and the Holloway Alien - boneless and white - unfolds itself from the instruments over his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its goblin-shark jaw juts out. Sinks its horrific teeth into Janek's right shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Janek howls in agony. His right arm is paralyzed by the bite. He gropes at the pistol on his right hip with his left hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Alien shakes him like a terrier killing a rat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Janek gets the pistol. Flips it in his hand. Fires over his shoulder. Two, three rounds...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bullets punch easily into the Alien - but the soft flesh closes easily over the wounds, sealing its white skin. Its teeth tighten.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts comes out of nowhere in her space suit. Swings a heavy rifle like a bat with all her strength. A crushing impact wrenches the Alien's jaws loose. It recoils.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts reverses the rifle. Pulls the trigger. A fusillade of bullets shreds the Alien's head. It collapses, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts wrenches her helmet off. Rips a first-aid kit from the bulkhead and helps Janek to stanch the bleeding of his horrific wound. She gets the bleeding stopped. Wraps him in bandages.

In the Juggernaut's pilot chair, the Sleeper sees them coming. His thoughts quicken. An explosion of light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JUGGERNAUT (IN FLIGHT) - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Juggernaut leaps into the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Magellan roars through the cyclone of dust in its wake. Barely avoids the pyramid. Rakes around in a screaming turn and climbs in pursuit, engines howling.

The Magellan rolls into a howling climb. The storm catches up to them: wind and dust reducing visibility to zero. Darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Magellan's radar finds the Juggernaut. Paints it with targeting data on the Bridge window...
</DIRECTION>

But the Juggernaut climbs too fast. Dwindling.

INT. JUGGERNAUT - PILOT CHAMBER

<DIRECTION>
On the floor, DAVID's eyes open. With his jaw he hitches his severed head around. Gets his eyes on the Sleeper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the pilot chair, the Sleeper convulses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ALIEN erupts from his chest. Big as a wolf even at its birth. Dark gray, armored, lethal. More hideous than any chestburster we've seen. An ULTRAMORPH. It wails hideously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sleeper dies. The Alien slithers free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JUGGERNAUT (IN FLIGHT) - ABOVE THE STORM
</DIRECTION>

The Juggernaut emerges from the stormclouds into the clear upper air - but loses momentum. Staggers through the upper atmosphere, control lost.

She seizes the precious moment: centers the Juggernaut in the Bridge window. Slams the throttle forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JUGGERNAUT (IN FLIGHT) - ABOVE THE STORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Magellan hurtles out of the storm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAMS THE JUGGERNAUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A colossal impact. The Juggernaut tumbles from the sky like a stone - intact but crippled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MAGELLAN BREAKS APART -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ship's modules scatter. Some whole, others broken. They fall back into the storm. The Command Module - including the Bridge - falls intact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The engine sections rocket away across the chaotic sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COMMAND MODULE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Janek is strapped into his seat. Watts goes flying. The Bridge window shatters, spraying glass spears in a lethal barrage across the Bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts picks herself up. Finds the Module in free fall. Alarms wail. Lights flash. Escape pods pop open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts looks at Janek. He is dead in his seat, impaled by a lethal fragment of glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The storm wall - a chain of hurricanes - rages below them. The command module tumbles back into the winds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts dives into a coffin-sized ESCAPE POD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She PUNCHES OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COMMAND MODULE (IN FREE FALL) - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts's pod - a steel coffin - shoots away on jets through the gale.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The command module plunges through the storm, tumbling. SMASHES AGAINST THE GROUND in ruin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The engine pods hurtle to the ground and go nuclear, sending walls of fire twisting through the hurricane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shockwaves tumble Watts's escape pod through the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LV-426 - MAGELLAN CRASH SITE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pod lands, cushioned by a drag chute and retro rockets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts pops the pod open, rising painfully to her feet in the storm. She surveys the destruction in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A deep RUMBLE makes her turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The JUGGERNAUT ROLLS TOWARD HER - on edge -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A crushing wheel of death, big as a mountain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs. Like a child in a nightmare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Juggernaut bears down on her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns aside, trying to get out of its course. Even at a dead sprint she barely seems to move, it's so big...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Juggernaut wobbles toward her. Slowing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exhausted, Watts collapses, gasping. The Juggernaut rolls to the earth, settling like a hoop right around her, Watts in the center.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The winds carry the dust clouds away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts passes out, dropping her head to the Earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts is awakened by a beeping alarm. She looks at her wrist. Her suit flashes an oxygen warning: 20 MINUTES REMAINING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Juggernaut's doors are wide open in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ULTRAMORPH ALIEN emerges from the Juggernaut. As large as a man already.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It sees her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a sob of terror she pulls herself to her feet and runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAGELLAN CRASH SITE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts flees through the storm, across the burning debris field. A wilderness of lightning, fire, and twisted metal. A thunderstorm with dust instead of rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks back through the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a strobe-light flicker of lightning, she sees a gray demon approaching through the wreckage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She scrambles through a section of ductwork...under a hull fragment...running and clambering...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Alien hunts her, cat-and-mouse, among the fragments of the Magellan: corridors that go nowhere, shattered compartments. Jetsam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes sweep frantically through the stormy night: searching for a weapon. A hiding place. An answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stumbles into the remains of the Magellan's laboratory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hypersleep freezer lies on the barren ground. Watts climbs inside. Pulls the lid shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Alien passes by, inches away. She watches it through the plexiglass, holding her breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Alien roots in the wreckage. Finds the rotting Engineer's head among the shards of its vat. It begins to feed on the head - GROWING as she watches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her suit's oxygen alarm goes off again. 15 MINUTES REMAINING. The beeping draws the Alien away from its dead meat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts is paralyzed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Alien noses closer. Sniffs at the plexiglass case. With sudden, horrific violence, it lashes out. Sends the freezer flying. Watts tumbles out. Lurches to her feet and runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Alien follows. Ravening. She leads it a twisting chase through fragments of burning metal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts trips and falls hard. Picking herself up, she sees she's tripped over a HULL SAW - the same diamond-bladed tool DAVID used to dismantle the terraforming engine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She seizes the saw - straining to manage its weight. Hides in the hollow of a massive girder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Alien passes by. Scenting the air. She freezes. Her arms trembling with the weight of the saw. Waiting for it to pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almost it leaves. But a tiny rattle of metal from the quivering saw brings it back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of options, Watts powers up the saw. The blade whines up to speed. They lunge at one another in the same moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The diamond blade shears off one of the Alien's claws.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The monster screams and recoils.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its lashing tail sends Watts sprawling. She loses the saw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Alien comes after her, slinking low to the ground, injured arm tucked to its chest. All vengeful fury.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts scrambles for the saw. The Alien leaps for her. She rolls aside - and like a scorpion the Alien impales her thigh with its spear-tipped tail. Nails her to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts screams in agony. Reaches for the saw, still buzzing on the ground. Its grip tantalizing inches from her fingertips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Alien stoops over her, slavering face inches from her faceplate. Its hideous jaws open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With all her strength, Watts pulls against the spike in her leg. Drags the point of the spear through the dirt. Excruciating pain. She snarls through her teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Alien strikes - just as Watts GRABS the saw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She meets the Alien's head with the buzzing blade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IMPALES THE ALIEN'S SKULL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gout of green acid onto Watts's helmet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Alien falls aside, thrashing its death-throes, the saw still growling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts sees ACID COMING THROUGH HER HELMET - fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With frantic haste she unlatches her helmet. Wrenches it off as it crumples and melts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stands bare-headed in the toxic air. Desperate, she looks around with tearing eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance she sees an intact module of the Magellan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs for it. Slaps the door switch. Incredibly, it opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VICKERS MODULE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watts steps inside. The airlock closes behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She finds herself staring at a grand piano. She's in Vickers's suite. Its amenities intact, through the floor's a few degrees off level. She takes a breath. Good air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks around. Turning things on. Lights. Music. Surreal comforts. She drinks water from the tap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the door to Vickers's secret room. Military space suits. Rifles. Ammunition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A crackle from the room's intercom.
