:SC: EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A two-lane road carves through an endless forest of towering black spruce. A flock of pintails skims over the treetops, heading south before the first snowfall. A young BOY (12), undersized and feral, trudges home, bookbag strapped to his back. Black-haired and pale-skinned, the boy looks as if he hasn't had a good meal in a long time. Before we hear anything the boy turns, watching the bend in the road behind him. After a moment we hear the thrum of a hard-charging engine. An Oldsmobile Super 88 rounds the bend, accelerating as it hits the straightaway. The boy steps away from the road but the car comes straight at him. The boy closes his eyes. The Oldsmobile's brakes clamp down on the wheels and the car shivers to a halt with inches to spare. Laughter spills from the car's open windows. Four HIGH SCHOOL LETTERMEN pile out of the car, wearing their leather-sleeved football jackets. GILMAN, the largest of the four, shakes his head and laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<GILMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kid didn't even move. You see that? Where's your survival instincts, boy?

The boy says nothing. He readjusts his bookbag and resumes his long walk northward.

One of the other football players, MASON, walks over and inspects the boy's face.
</DIRECTION>
<MASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the kid whose old man robbed the truck stop last year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASON>
<DIRECTION>
Gilman curls his meaty hand around the back of the boy's neck and pulls him closer, scrutinizing him. The four lettermen tower over the small boy.
</DIRECTION>
<GILMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You the one with the convict daddy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The boy stares back at Gilman, unblinking.

<MASON>

	That's him.

</MASON>
<GILMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter, you about to piss your pants? Answer me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The boy says nothing, never looking away from the bully. Gilman presses his fist, adorned with a heavy class ring, against the.boy's cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<GILMAN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You a tough guy like your daddy?
	</DIALOGUE>

Gilman shoves the boy, forcing him to stumble backwards. The boy regains his balance, never taking his eyes off Gilman.

<GILMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to play tough guy with me? Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Provoked by the boy's lack of fear, by the insolence of his stare, Gilman rears back and punches him in the face. The boy falls to the ground. Blood spills from a gash in his cheek where the class ring cut him.
</DIRECTION>
<MASON>
<DIRECTION>
(a ringside announcer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right cross to the face... and he's down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASON>
<DIRECTION>
The football players laugh, looking down at the fallen boy. The boy stands. There is still no sign of emotion on his face. No fear, no anger, no evident pain.
</DIRECTION>
<GILMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter? You want some more?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The boy doesn't look away. The bully swings, cracking the boy in the side of the head, knocking him down again.
</DIRECTION>
<GILMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (to his friends)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Walking back to the car, Mason slaps Gilman on the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<MASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gave that little pissant something to think about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASON>
<DIRECTION>
Gilman grins and looks back at the boy, expecting him to be sprawled and crying on the ground. Instead the boy stands again, brushes the dirt off his shirt, and walks toward Gilman.
</DIRECTION>
<GILMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got to be kidding me. I'm gonna knock the--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILMAN>
<DIRECTION>
But Gilman's words die in his throat as he sees something impossible happening. The gash on the boy's cheek knits itself shut, leaving no sign of injury. Gilman is so shocked he doesn't see the boy's fist whizzing toward him, striking him in the nose. And then another punch. And then another. The boy is far smaller and weaker than Gilman, but he fights with a ferocity that seems inhuman, punching and kicking and headbutting, doing whatever it takes to fell his enemy. Gilman, stunned by the intensity of the assault, goes down, trying to protect his face from the blur of blows. Mason tries to pull the boy off his friend and suffers a bite to the hand. He howls with pain and backs off. The other two football players, amazed to see their leader getting pummeled by a boy half his size, watch in awe. The boy growls as he batters the bully. He grabs Gilman's collar and lifts the football player's head off the ground, prepared to deliver the coup de grace with his right fist. Three bone claws spring from the boy's hand, serrated and razor sharp. Everything stops. Mason, clutching his wounded hand, quits hollering and stares. The other two football players blink and slowly back away. Even Gilman, moaning on the ground, hushes and tries to crawl backwards, away from this beast on top of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the boy is more shocked than-any of them. He stares with horror at the claws, this part of him he never knew existed. He stands and stumbles away from Gilman. Mason runs over, lifts his punch-drunk friend to his feet, and hustles him toward the Oldsmobile. The other football players pile in, slam the doors shut, and speed off, leaving the boy alone by the side of the road. The boy stares at his claws and for the first time we see fear in his eyes. He screams, a scream that echoes over the black spruce, into the darkening northern sky.

<DIRECTION>
A traveling carnival has come to a seaside New England town. The brightly-lit Ferris Wheel spins a few hundred yards inland from the dark Atlantic. LOCALS roam through the carnival, lining up to ride the Tilt- A-Whirl. KIDS carrying plumes of cotton candy race from shoot- 'em-up games to free throw competitions. A CARNY BARKER of the old school, wearing a patched-suit and a derby, beckons the curious to his attraction.

:SC: INT. SIDESHOW - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
.joining a small crowd of CURIOUS ONLOOKERS. The tent is dark save for a spotlight fixed on a tiny stage. SHERRLENE, a peroxide-blonde in her fifties, whose tanned hide is covered with interlaced tattoos, slaps a tribal beat on a pair of bongos. The crowd hushes. A tall man in a hooded robe shuffles toward, the stage like a boxer long past his prime. He stands in front of the gawkers, head bowed, face shadowed by his hood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally BEAK throws off his robe and raises his wings to the crowd. As advertised, he looks like an amalgam of man and bird, with three-toed, clawed feet and dirty-feathered wings. His very human, tired brown eyes are set in a face dominated by a long sharp beak. He stares back at the gaping crowd. Beak looks more pathetic than monstrous. His skinny limbs don't seem very strong and he projects an air of weary resignation, not menace. But when he flaps his gray wings and caws at the onlookers, the children shriek in terror and bury their faces in their father's legs.

<DIRECTION>
The small log cabin sits in a clearing in a jack pine forest. Winter has come to the north country; the ground and tree branches are covered with several inches of snow. Logan chops firewood behind the cabin, splitting the logs with expert axe strikes, smoking a cheap cigar. His nose wrinkles as he sniffs the air.

Behind Logan, two approaching men in dark suits and black overcoats glance at each other. Logan, halving another block of wood, doesn't turn around. One of the newcomers, STRYKER, was a colonel in the Special Forces. He still has the look. His hair is cropped short, his bearing is military, and his blue eyes are fierce.

Logan parks in the lot of a sprawling brick grammar school. He gets out of the truck and walks toward the main building. The school day has ended. STUDENTS meet up with their MOMS or DADS for the ride home. As Logan rounds a corner, he stops in his tracks, looking around. Something's not quite right.

Rounding a corner on the narrow access road, Kayla nearly collides with a man in a long black coat. She slams on the brakes and the truck shudders to a halt. The man's back is turned to the truck, his head bowed. His hair hangs below his shoulders, clotted with dirt, as if he's been sleeping in the woods for weeks. Kayla leans out of the open truck window. Before she can speak, the man in the long black coat turns. It's not just his size that frightens us, though the man is massive. It's not just the four-inch-long black talons curling from his fingertips, or the gleaming fangs he licks as he smiles at her. What terrifies us most are his eyes. They are a shark's eyes, black and loveless and utterly inhuman.

Logan sees the pickup truck in the distance. Even a hundred yards away he can tell that something is.wrong. It seems impossible that he could run any faster, but now he does, reaching the truck in seconds. He sees the claw marks gouged through the steel hood. He sees.the driver's side door tossed onto the asphalt twenty yards. from the truck. And finally he sees Kayla, curled in the fetal position on the side of the access road. Blood puddles beneath her. Her skin has already begun to lose its 'color. He runs to her, kneels beside her body, hands checking for a pulse, listening for breath, trying desperately to find any sign of life in her lifeless form.

Victor Creed sits at the bar, carving a crude smiley face into the wood with the claw of his index finger. He looks up and sees the BARTENDER staring at him. The bartender doesn't approve of the vandalism, but he's not about to say anything. Creed taps the rim of his glass. The bartender comes over with a bottle of George Dickel Tennessee whiskey. He fills Creed's glass halfway-- a standard pour. Creed stares at the bartender. He taps the glass again. The bartender, hand shaking, fills the glass to the brim.

He swings, raking his talons across Logan's chest, drawing first blood. Logan lunges at Creed and the battle begins. -The pace of the combat is startling, the physical power stupendous. A missed swipe by Creed ends with him clawing out the guts of the jukebox. Logan jumps at his enemy and gets swatted into the wall, smashing the plasterboard. Creed grabs Logan by the collar and tosses him onto the pool table. Creed brings his fist down, looking to pulverize Logan's skull, but the smaller man rolls clear. Creed's fist shatters the slate and the table collapses. Clearing his head on the sawdusted floor, Logan sees the eight ball rolling past. He picks it up and hurls it at Creed's head. Creed catches the eight ball in his left hand and squeezes his fist shut. He opens his hand and lets the powdered remains spill onto the floor. Logan springs to his feet and swings at creed, again and again, his claws whooshing through the air. Creed, despite his bulk, is an elegant fighter. He circles just out of reach, grinning as the claws slash past his face. Creed grabs Logan's right wrist as it flies by. He grabs the left wrist. His wet fangs glisten as they plunge toward Logan's throat.

With no room to dodge, Logan drives his head forward, smashing Creed's face with a glorious headbutt.

As Creed staggers back, Logan kicks him in the chest, knocking the big man over the bar, where he crashes into the bottles of liquor and slides to the floor in a tumult of glass shards and alcohol. Logan sees a lit cigarette in an ashtray on one of the tables. He picks the butt up and flicks it over the bar. The cigarette ignites the spilt alcohol. Creed roars and rises to his feet, a burning man. He vaults over the bar and advances on Logan. The flames consume his overcoat, licking at his skin. Creed slaps them out with his palms, apparently oblivious to the pain.

Logan rises from the broken tank, drenched with water, naked save for dozens of long stainless steel needles drilled into his body and the wires and hoses trailing from the needles.

A pack of GRAY WOLVES emerges from the woods, surrounding Logan. Snow dusts their fur. They look hungry, their blue eyes unblinking as they watch this pale interloper. The LEADER OF THE PACK, a muscular brute far bigger than his comrades, snarls at Logan. Logan stares back at the wolf. The wolf jumps at Logan, fangs bared, aiming for the man's throat. Logan sidesteps and the wolf hurtles past, skidding on the snow when he lands. Logan and the wolf circle each other, looking for weakness. The wolf gnashes its wet teeth and pounces again. Man and beast battle in the moonlight, a shadowy combat of ferocious velocity, of gleaming fangs and gray fur. The wolf lunges for Logan's throat again, but this time Logan catches the wolf in one hand and slams it to the snow. The wolf, desperate to escape, rakes Logan's arm with his claws. Logan ignores the bloody welts.

The other wolves in the pack stare at the strange champion. Intense light shines on Logan's face. He turns and sees that he's surrounded by a dozen SOLDIERS wearing tactical armor. Powerful flashlights are mounted to the barrels of their guns, which are pointed at Logan. The wolves flee, dodging through the pines, their paws kicking up snow.

Logan accelerates and opens up thirty yards of breathing room. He turns and sees Agent Zero catching up again. Logan clamps on the brakes, hard. He holds out his left hand and extends his claws. The tips of the blades scrape the asphalt and sparks fly. The SUV cannot brake in time. As it hurtles past the motorcycle, Logan's claws hit the SUV's front tire and shred it instantly. A split-second later he shreds the rear tire. The SUV totters, falls to its side, and barrel rolls across the empty road. It ends up on its roof in a drainage ditch, wheels still spinning in the air. Logan turns his bike and pulls up next to the upended SUV. He lowers the kickstand, stands, and walks to the driver's side. Agent Zero, bloodied and dazed, has managed to push open the door. He leans out and aims his shotgun at Logan, who slices the weapon into four pieces with a sweep of his claws. Logan grabs Agent Zero by the back of the neck and hauls him out of the car.

Dukes is the biggest man you've ever seen. By a long shot. Just shy of seven feet tall and weighing in at half a ton, he's beyond fat. Beyond obese.

Dukes bellows and runs at Logan. A coconut pelts him in the face, angering him further. Logan jumps out of the way as Dukes brings down his massive fists. Coconuts explode. Dukes charges after Logan, shattering watermelons, stacked grapefruits, clusters of bananas. After a thirty second rampage Dukes is exhausted, his giant chest heaving as he gasps for air, his hands and face splattered with remnants of crushed fruit. Logan jumps onto Dukes' back. The fat man roars and spins around, trying to buck the little rider, but Logan's got one arm wrapped around Dukes' throat and he's not letting go. The spinning makes Dukes a little dizzy and he slows down. Three adamantium claws shine in the big fellow's face, reflecting the overhead fluorescent lights. Dukes quits, his massive shoulders slumping. He sinks to his knees, his great bulk splitting the linoleum floor. Logan presses his claws against Dukes' quivering jowls.

Logan's claws flash through the air again, and another neatly severed hand lands on the table. Logan retracts his claws and curls one finger: come at me.

Logan times his punch perfectly, pivoting on the ball of his foot and hitting Barbarus with an uppercut that sounds like a well-hit baseball. Barbarus crashes to the floor.

Logan and Hines stand at the top of a steel staircase, forty feet above the concrete floor of a massive cavern. Created in the 1960s by an underground hydrogen bomb test, the Alkali Lake cavern is the second biggest in the country, smaller only than the salt caverns of the Gulf Coast, home of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sheer scale of the place is staggering. Three times the size of the Super Dome, with walls of rough granite, the cavern is loud with the constant thrum of ventilation and high-powered machinery. Heavy steel pillars support the ceiling of the cavern. Ten thousand stainless steel isolation tanks crowd the floor, arrayed in a grid, each tank slightly larger than a coffin. TECHNICIANS walk in between the tanks, checking gauges, writing notes in clipboards. More technicians sit on a raised podium in the center of the cavern, overlooking the Eleven, entering information into the computers that monitor the sleeping army. Logan is awed by the sight. Hines has descended the staircase ahead of him. He follows after her.

Creed swings at Logan's head, Logan ducks, and the fight begins. This is melee so efficient that no motion is wasted. Every lunge would kill any other adversary.

Logan brings his knee up hard, smashing his adamantium- enhanced kneecap into Creed's groin. The big man groans. Logan spins Creed around, jamming him against the wall. He tries to skewer Creed with the claws of his right hand but Creed moves his head at the last moment. Logan's claws are buried to the hilt-in the wall. He strikes at Creed with his left hand, but Creed dodges again. All six of Logan's claws are deep in the solid rock wall. He brings his hands. together, the adamantium blades slicing through granite as if it were cheesecake. Creed ducks under the claws an instant before they shred him. He grabs Logan in a-bear hug. A large section of the wall behind them falls out, and, unable to halt their momentum, Logan and Creed tumble through the hole, disappearing from sight. Kayla runs over and stands at the jagged precipice, looking out onto the gargantuan Weapon XI cavern.

CUT TO: Creed pounces on Logan, who is still severely injured from the fall. Creed tears into the smaller man mercilessly, slinging him around the cavern, gouging him with his black talons.

The Eleven charge. From above we can see the full-scale of the onslaught, wave upon wave of cloned murderers closing in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan runs to the next pillar and slices through it. Creaks and groans sound overhead, as the tremendous weight above exerts pressure on the remaining weight-bearing supports. Most of the ten thousand can't get close to Logan, but they all want in on the first kill. Whirling, slashing, stabbing, kicking, Logan scythes a circle of devastation, spray-painting the floor with the black blood of the Eleven. He reaches a third pillar and chops through it. Kayla eyes the ceiling nervously and hurries toward the exit.

Even Logan can't hold back the tide for long. Talons rake his face, his arms, his chest. But still he battles, slicing through a fourth pillar, a fifth. Tremendous fissures split the rock ceiling. Dust and rocks fall onto the cavern floor as the fissures widen. Logan sees that the cavern's collapse is imminent. He can no longer hold off the Eleven's assault. An instant before the clones can shred him, he jumps, using his claws to scale one of the still-standing steel pillars with the grace and speed of a leopard climbing a tree. One of the clones follows, using his black talons in the same fashion, grabbing at Logan's feet. When Logan is forty feet above the throng of teeth-gnashing clones, he severs the pillar below his feet. The clone chasing him can climb no farther, can do nothing but roar and hiss at his escaping prey. Logan swings himself onto the steel staircase, where Kayla waits beside the open door. He races up the stairs. Stryker sees his dream in ruins. He runs for the nearest exit. Kayla and Logan are a few feet from the door, from safety, when the cavern ceiling gives out. Thousands of tons of stone and steel come crashing down. Logan grabs Kayla and hauls her to safety an instant before she would be crushed.

The compound has essentially imploded, the major structures falling into the massive pit created by the cavern's collapse. Severed gas lines and ruptured boilers have turned the crater into a raging fire pit. Smoke billows up from the molten core. A few dazed survivors, SOLDIERS and SCIENTISTS, have escaped the carnage, but Alkali Lake no longer exists as a military base. Thousands of singed documents flutter in the wind. Logan and Kayla walk away from the burning crater, never looking back. They head through the woods toward the lake that glitters in the sunlight.

They stop at the edge of the lake. Paper from the destroyed base drifts through the air, falling on the water and the shore.

<LOGAN>

	Almost looks peaceful from here.

A blossom of blood opens up on her chest. She stares down at it in wonder before sinking to her knees. Logan turns and sees Stryker walking toward them.

Stryker fires again. The adamantium bullet rips through Logan's forehead with an unholy sound. Logan falls to the ground. Stryker stands above him and fires another bullet into Logan's head. Stryker turns the gun on Kayla.

	You don't need to waste another bullet. I'm already dead.

Stryker blinks and hesitates. Kayla coughs, her strength beginning to fade.

For the first time, perhaps, we see something human in the cold blue of Stryker's eyes.

Stryker turns and walks away. Kayla crawls over to Logan. She lifts his head onto her lap. He's unconscious but breathing. The bullet holes in his skin have already healed. She strokes his jaw. and smiles sadly. One of the scraps of paper from the base blows against her leg. She takes it and looks down at the blank page. She has no pen. She touches her chest, just above her heart, wetting her finger with her blood. She writes four words on the page, blows on it to dry it, folds it once and places it in Logan's hand. She kisses his lips and rests his head gently on the ground. Fighting the pain, a dying woman, Kayla manages to stand.

	If you ever remember what I did to you, try to forgive me. I was a fool. And you were right... I always loved you.

She turns and walks toward the lake, never looking back, never hesitating as the waters rise above her knees, above her waist, above her shoulders, above her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ALKALI LAKE - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan's eyes flutter and open. For a moment he squints into the blue sky. He sits up, looking around. The woods are empty. He stands, completely disoriented, a stranger in the world. He realizes that he's holding a piece of paper in his hand. He unfolds it and reads the message written in blood. You are my Wolverine. He stares at it for a moment before folding it carefully and putting it in his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a deep breath of cold air and walks west, toward the falling sun. He doesn't know who he is. He doesn't know where he's going. But the wind blows through his hair, the last of the sunlight feels good on his skin. He is a free man. He walks toward his destiny..

THE END
