</DIRECTION>
<Spock>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning. Two months ago a Federation starship monitored an explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis. We believe it was caused by overmining and insufficent safety precautions. The moon's decimation means an almost eighty percent loss of available energy and a deadly pollution of their ozone. They will have depleted their supply of oxygen in less than half a century. Due to their enormous military budget, the Klingon economy does not have the resources with which to combat this catastrophe. Last month, at the behest of the, uh.... Vulcan Ambassador, I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon high council. He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Spock>
<Admiral_Donald>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Negotiations for what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Admiral_Donald>
<Spock>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The dismantling of our space stations and star bases along the Neutral Zone. An end to seventy years of unremitting hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Spock>
<DIRECTION>
Audible mutterings. Pan the crew. Is the war over?
</DIRECTION>
<Spock>
<DIRECTION>
(Continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If the Klingons sue for peace, we could accumulate savings in defense expenditures, leaving the Federation ecomony free to grapple with urgent social problems......
	</DIALOGUE>
</Spock>
<A_Military_Man>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_Military_Man>
<Commander_in_Chief>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure our exploration and science programs would not be affected, but the facts speak for themselves, Captain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Commander_in_Chief>
<Admiral_Donald>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must protest. To offer the Klingons a safe haven within Federation space is suicide. And if we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenseless before a Bellicose people with a foothold on our territory, led by an unprincipled tyrant. The opportunity here is to embargo trading, force them to run through their own resources faster, and bring them to their knees. Then we'll be in a far better position to dictate terms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Admiral_Donald>
<DIRECTION>
a vocal minority of the briefing supports this, but not all. Kirk simply stares at Spock.
</DIRECTION>

	Sir, I'm no diplomat, but the Klingons have never been trustworthy. I'm forced to agree with Admiral Donald. This is...

<DIRECTION>
(He gropes for tact)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	....a terrible, a terrifying idea!

</DIRECTION>
<Commander_in_Chief>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your son was killed by a Klingon, wasn't he, Captain?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Commander_in_Chief>
<Kirk>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Kirk>
<Commander_in_Chief>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, but Commander Spock has persuaded the Federation that this situation is too promising to ignore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Commander_in_Chief>
<Spock>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is imperative that we act now, to support the Gorkon Initiative, lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it would be better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Spock>
<Commander_in_Chief>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captian Kirk, you are to be our first olive branch.

Kirk is too startled to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<Commander_in_Chief>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As it happens, Kirk, the Chancellor specifically requested you and your officers.

<Kirk>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, in God's name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Kirk>
<Commander_in_Chief>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are some Klingons who feel the same about a peace treaty as yourself, and Admiral Donald. They'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Commander_in_Chief>
<Spock>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have personally vouched for you in theis matter, Captain.

<Azetbur>

	<DIALOGUE>
	"Human rights". Even the name is racist. The Federation is basically a "Homo Sapiens" only club.....

	</DIALOGUE>
</Uhura>
<Kerla>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In any case, we know where this is leading, the annihilation of our culture. Klingons will replace those on the lowest rung of the Federation employment ladder, taking menial jobs and performing them for lower pay......

</Kerla>
<Chekov>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's economics, not racism!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chekov>
<Uhura>

INT. Gorkons stateroom, Flagship

<DIRECTION>
Where they blast a guard at the door, severing his arm and enter. The Klingons have weapons, but are floating

<DIRECTION>
Blood now floats about as well as debtris in the crackling emergency lighting. A good deal of hissing steam......

Chancellor Gorkon is shot. The hit men turn and exit quickly. Linger on a scene of weightless carnage and assassination.

Chang keeps himself upright by grabbing a handhold, but the stricken are still floating...

	What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain, and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.

<Scotty>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least we must keep track of where they are taken, Sir. I....

	How did you....?

<Klingon_Ambassador>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Chancellor of the High Council is dead, the result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see YOU under a flag of truce on a mission of peace. Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime. May I remind you that he, and Doctor McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will. None of these facts are in dispute, Mr. President. And as a matter of these facts, the Klingon people have a right to justice. What I am asking now is, does the Federation plan to stand in the way of our justice? Or do you consider your- self and all Federation personnel above the law?

	Mr. President, let us come to the point. You want the conference to go forward and so said my father. I will attend in one week, after I've had the opportunity to master the details of his position, on one condition: we will not extradite the prisoners, and you will not attempt to rescue them in a military operation.

Kirk and McCoy in the dock, stand in the bottom at the very center of the circle, surrounded by a Klingon audience in rising tiers, while hooded Klingon judges sit invisible in a darkened dugout. (One judge is an albino.)

EXT. Rura Penthe Penal Colony - Day
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three suns glare down on a huge vista, an ice field, the coldest habitable place in the solar system.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small moving dark mass as we push in, reveals
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fifteen prisoners in leg irons and five Klingon guards with jackal-mastiffs moving slowly across the frigid plain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk and McCoy, likewise shackled, are among them. Guards and prisoners alike wear ragged furs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They reach a lone totem and a guard holds up his hand for a halt. He presses and instrument emitting a high- pitched whine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In response, a huge trap door buried in the snow, yawns open. A Klingon guard emerges from steps below, and places a box before the gaping door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Kirk and McCoy watch, the commandant of Rura Penthe and his jackal mastiff emerge. He mounts the box.
</DIRECTION>
<Commandant>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the gulag Rura Penthe. Observe: there is no stockade, no guard tower, no electrified fence! They are not needed here! Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming. Your new home awaits.... underground!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Commandant>
<DIRECTION>
He blows a mechanical whistle. In response, two guards emerge from below with a screaming Klingon convict.
</DIRECTION>
<Prisoner>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Nooooo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Prisoner>
<Commandant>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Punishment means exile from prison to the surface - on the surface, nothing can survive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Commandant>
<DIRECTION>
The guards dump the screaming convict on the ice - without furs. The weather immobilizes him at once - his cries become fainter.
</DIRECTION>
<Commandant>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Below, no one can escape. Work well, and you will be treated well. Work badly, and you will die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Commandant>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves. The box is removed by a guard and proceeds him through the huge door, and down the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Long shot
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the prisoners are herded after him, and the door shuts, leaving the frozen vista as it was: snow flurries obscure the trap door almost instantly. Only the frozen corpse of the convict is left - until it too is covered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. Rura Penthe
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Start looking up at the closing trap door, outside we can see snow flurries as the panel shuts with a clang.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pan down to reveal
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge underground labyrinth with an enormous courtyard surrounded by prisoners huts open to the center. Prisoners wander freely within. The scum of the universe
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone wears furs, leg irons, and is freezing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An endless scaffolding above, the guards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Many of the prisoners look like they could snap Kirk and McCoy in half, with one hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk and McCoy step gingerly around the outside wall, watching the yard. A shadow falls across them.

	We've got a crew of three hundred turning the own quarters inside out, but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?

<Lt_Valeris>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suppose when they returned, they threw the boots into the garbage?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lt_Valeris>
<Spock>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct, those boots will cling to the killers necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them, nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see. No, they're here. Somewhere!

Kirk gets hit in the face. It's already bloody. It's a prison fight. Kirk and an alien are surrounded by prisoners who are sneering and jeering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk and McCoy are distinctly grubbier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk scrambles to his feet and circles. The alien swings a large paw, but Kirk ducks, comes in with an uppercut. He connects, but does little damage. They circle some more. The alien dives legs first, and scissors Kirk, who goes down roughly. Wrestling, Kirk slips free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McCoy and Martia watch....the leg irons make it complicated, they can also wrap around someone's neck....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The alien moves in closely, hits Kirk again. Kirk fights back with a kick to the chest, which doubles over the alien.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Kirk slams the alien on the neck and he goes down. Kirk starts to walk away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But a paw reaches out and grabs him by the ankle. Kirk looks back and the alien is grinning, drags him in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The alien stands, and grips Kirk, chest to back, in a giant bear hug. Surely, he will crush the life out of Kirk. He lifts Kirk right off of the ground. Kirk, almost gone, lifts his legs up high, and swings down hard, smashing the alien in the knee. That does it. The alien falls to the ground, screaming and holding his knee. Kirk staggers away, catching his breath.

McCoy tentatively goes forward, and examines the knee. He is without any medical tools of any kind.

Inside the mine

Everyone is issued a drill and a light helmet. As beams ricochet about, they start digging dilithium crystals out of the rock and putting them into a flatbed shuttle. Kirk and McCoy, and the brute do likewise, under the watchfull eye of fur-clad Klingon guards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An alien next to Kirk sneaks several of the crystals into his garment.
