<DIRECTION>
EXT. AN ANT MOUND - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera swoops towards the entrance, then dives inside, past a couple of tough-looking soldier ants who stand at the gates of the ant colony like insect bouncers...into an access tunnel that snakes this way and that, past a row of ants plodding along...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and into the MAIN CHAMBER of the colony, a huge, teeming vista that seems to stretch away forever, filled with ants rushing here and there on their business. We see -- a "traffic cop" directing foot traffic, waving his arms like crazy so both sides move at once -- a column of soldier ants marching along in formation -- a chain of ants letting down a matchbox elevator filled with workers.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...which is kind of a problem, since I've always felt uncomfortably in crowds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We join Z, a worker ant with issues. He's lying on a couch, recounting his woes.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel...isolated. Different. I've got abandonment issues. My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight. Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker. But I don't have any other options. I was assigned to trade school when I was just a grub. The whole system just...makes me feel...insignificant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<MOTIVATIONAL_COUNSELLOR>
<DIRECTION>
(enthusiastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terrific! You should feel insignificant!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTIVATIONAL_COUNSELLOR>
<DIRECTION>
For the first time, we see the ant MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR. He's a mixture of Tony Robbins and Ron Popiel (the hyperactive late-night TV huckster, and founder of "Ronco").
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I should?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<MOTIVATIONAL_COUNSELLOR>
<DIRECTION>
(hopping around enthusiastically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YES!!! You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter. I don't mind that I don't matter! Do you get it? Do you get it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTIVATIONAL_COUNSELLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Z gives a fake smile.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTIVATIONAL_COUNSELLOR>
<DIRECTION>
(incredibly "up")
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Z, we're part of the fastest growing species in the whole world!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTIVATIONAL_COUNSELLOR>
<DIRECTION>
The counsellor rolls down a chart from the wall. An arrow shows ant population going up, up, up.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTIVATIONAL_COUNSELLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ask me why we're so successful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTIVATIONAL_COUNSELLOR>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are we so successful?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<MOTIVATIONAL_COUNSELLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you asked me that question!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTIVATIONAL_COUNSELLOR>
<DIRECTION>
The motivational counsellor opens some blinds...and we see a vista of the ant-filled chamber below.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTIVATIONAL_COUNSELLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you see out there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTIVATIONAL_COUNSELLOR>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Ants...
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<MOTIVATIONAL_COUNSELLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right! Ants! Millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTIVATIONAL_COUNSELLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Down below, we see a group of ants carrying a boulder up an incline. One worker ants slips, and the boulder rolls down, crushing his leg. The other ants rush over -- it looks like they're going to help their fallen comrade, but instead, they climb right over him, and pick up the boulder, continuing with their task.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTIVATIONAL_COUNSELLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see? Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- I'm meaningless, you're meaningless."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTIVATIONAL_COUNSELLOR>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
The motivational counsellor puts his arm on Z's shoulder...he seems to understand...
</DIRECTION>
<MOTIVATIONAL_COUNSELLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Z...you need help.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at a clock)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoops! We're gonna have to stop there. Your minute is up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTIVATIONAL_COUNSELLOR>
<DIRECTION>
The counsellor ushers Z out of his seat and towards the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTIVATIONAL_COUNSELLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now back to work! We've made real progress! Remember -- let's be best superorganism we can be!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTIVATIONAL_COUNSELLOR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EARLY MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gigantic tunnel, with the size and scale of the "Chunnel". A banner strung overhead reads: "The Mega-Tunnel -- Tunneling Our Way to a Bright Future!" Along the walls hang 50's work- incentive style posters with messages like, "You asked for it, you got it -- more work!" and "TWO MEALS A WEEK IS ENOUGH!!!" Line after line of ants is working on the tunnel, digging, passing clumps of dirt from ant to ant, everyone synchronized.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on a clump of DIRT being passed from hand to hand. PULL OUT TO REVEAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AZTECA, a feisty, cynical, female worker ant, who stands there, waiting to pass the dirt on. Z is daydreaming behind her, with clumps of dirt starting to pile up in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<AZTECA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?! Earth to Z! You better snap out of it, or there's gonna be a lot of pissed off ants!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AZTECA>
<DIRECTION>
Z looks back, and sees the ants behind staring at him angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(snapping out of it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry Azteca. Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt! Alley oop!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at the dirt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shouldn't we be wearing gloves? I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Z's stomach growls)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy am I hungry. I'm so hungry I'm seeing double. It looks like there's two million ants in here. When's lunch? Tomorrow, or the day after?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<AZTECA>
<DIRECTION>
(sweetly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Z, old pal...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shouts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SHUT UP!!! It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AZTECA>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<AZTECA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Z. The squeaky wheel gets thrown away, alright? You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment. I don't wanna see anything happen to you. So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AZTECA>
<DIRECTION>
A WHISTLE BLOWS.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank goodness. Breaktime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
All the ants put down their tools. A beat. Then the WHISTLE BLOWS AGAIN. All the ants pick up their tools again.
</DIRECTION>
<AZTECA>
<DIRECTION>
(resigned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Break's over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AZTECA>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(getting back to work)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground. Why are we even digging this thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<AZTECA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who cares, Z. All I know is, we gotta dig. We're not the ones in charge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AZTECA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The huge, spacious main chamber of the colony. Looming over the scene is the royal palace, which seems to be inaccessible, perched on top of a hill-like pedestal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Around the base of the pedestal, a crew of workers loiters, seemingly aimlessly...can these be the only unemployed ants in the place?
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	STAIRS!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
The workers look up and GROAN. Then they start forming a stairway with their own bodies, linking arms, stepping on each other's shoulders. It's extremely unpleasant work. One ant is a little tardy, and just manages to get in place before...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENERAL FORMICA, the Pattonesque military leader of the colony, STEPS ON HIS HEAD, using it as the first step as he ascends to the palace, his aide-de-camp Carpenter in tow. As Formica mounts the "stairs" we can hear the workers going, "OUCH! OOF! YIKES!" etc.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut the chit-chat down there!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to Carpenter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've spoiled these workers, Carpenter. They've never had it so good, and listen to them -- always grumbling and complaining...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
Formica steps on the foot of one of the "stairway" ants, who muffles a yelp.
</DIRECTION>
<CARPENTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARPENTER>
<GENERAL_FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have they got to complain about? Three square meals a day...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_FORMICA>
<CARPENTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, sir, we've cut them down to three roughly rectangular meals a week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARPENTER>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't give me statistics, Carpenter. I know what I'm talking about. DOORS!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
Formica and Carpenter have reached the top of the staircase. There, the two guard ants on either side of the massive throne room doors pull them open -- and one door hinge SQUEAKS.
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
(to guard ant, while passing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oil that, soldier.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The QUEEN is on her throne, her huge abdomen sprawled behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah! General Formica.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
Formica salutes and marches to her, Carpenter behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Note: Throughout this scene, the Queen is giving birth repeatedly. Each birth is accompanied by a herald playing a short "Happy Birthday" fanfare on his trumpet. Mid-wife ants bring each baby to the Queen for inspection, who COOS a few words. The midwives put the babies on a moving bassinet- line, powered by ants on a treadmill.
</DIRECTION>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...pains me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she shudders; then, to baby)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's the cutest widdle worker? You are! Yes, you! Don't forget to brush your teeth!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to mid-wife)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ship 'er out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(back to Formica)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, what else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me. As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures. I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
The Queen's attention is interrupted by another baby being put in her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
(to baby)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No snacking between meals! Off you go!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Formica)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now -- what were we saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
(Oliver North-style)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, General Formica. Carry on, my good man! I don't know what we would do without you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
Formica clicks his heels and bows his head. Carpenter bows low. Formica smartly about faces --
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	General Formica!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
PRINCESS BALA hurries through a second doorway, carrying a swatch book. Something about her sets her apart from the HANDMAIDEN ANTS with her. Her tiara, probably.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Formica tilts his head quizzically to Carpenter behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<CARPENTER>
<DIRECTION>
(sotto)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Princess Bala, sir. Your fiancee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARPENTER>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Princess! You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- I thought -- since we're getting married...it might be nice if we...got to know one another.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
Formica looks confused.
</DIRECTION>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
(uncomfortable)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Conversation...yes...well...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Carpenter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wasn't she briefed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
(holding up a baby)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, General! A darling baby soldier!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(emotionally, to baby)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't try to be a hero! Just make sure you come back in one piece!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(handing it off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next!
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
(using the interruption)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess. In the meanwhile --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
Formica turns to go.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	General -- we have to talk sometime!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well. Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<CARPENTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule. We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARPENTER>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Outstanding. Princess...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
Bala's a little fazed...but grabs her chance.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, um...how was your day? What did you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
(scouring his mind)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(that's it!)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I declared war!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<BALA>
<DIRECTION>
(sadly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<CARPENTER>
<DIRECTION>
(under his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARPENTER>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Duty calls!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
He strides across the floor. Bala watches him go, her antennae drooping unhappily.
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No squeak. Outstanding!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
We see through the now-open doors into the throne-room as Formica and Carpenter double-time out of the frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Queen sees that Bala is unhappy.
</DIRECTION>
<QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
(sympathetically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I felt the same way before I got married. Confused. Scared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<BALA>
<DIRECTION>
(hopefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings. The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged. Even marriage. You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<BALA>
<DIRECTION>
(unconvinced)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...he's wonderful...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
The doors swing shut on them -- revealing the two guard ants who were CRUSHED in the wake of Formica's exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BALA'S QUARTERS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bala enters, followed by her handmaidens, who are in a state of giggling infatuation over Formica. Bala is scowling as she leafs through a wedding catalogue.
</DIRECTION>
<HANDMAIDEN_1>
<DIRECTION>
(swooning over General Formica)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The General's body segments are so...symmetrical.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANDMAIDEN_1>
<HANDMAIDEN_2>
<DIRECTION>
(giggling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd let him order me into battle anyday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANDMAIDEN_2>
<DIRECTION>
Bala hurls the swatch book against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<HANDMAIDEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Princess? What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANDMAIDEN_1>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wrong? How could anything be wrong? I'm going to marry General Formica and be a queen and have millions of babies, just like my mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(concerned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I look fat to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<HANDMAIDEN_2>
<DIRECTION>
(knowingly, to Handmaiden #2)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pre-wedding jitters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANDMAIDEN_2>
<HANDMAIDEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just need to blow off some steam. Let's go to the bar at the Royal Club!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANDMAIDEN_1>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Club's so stuffy. I want to try someplace different.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<HANDMAIDEN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There isn't anyplace else --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(making a joke)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Except the worker bar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANDMAIDEN_2>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The worker bar! Yes! That's where I want to go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
The handmaidens look shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<HANDMAIDEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But -- we can't -- there'll be workers there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANDMAIDEN_1>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANT BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long bar filled with ants. The bar itself seems to stretch for miles, and there are hundreds of ants trying to get a drink...unfortunately, there's only one bartender. Z is at the bar with WEAVER, a burly ant soldier.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We declared war again?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Weaver's nod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you scared?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<WEAVER>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEAVER>
<DIRECTION>
The BARTENDER, a grizzled veteran, slaps down what looks like a couple of large green beer mugs. Actually, they're aphids, little green critters he fills up from a number of kegs hanging from the ceiling. The kegs are specialized ants with hugely distended stomachs, which spray liquid into the aphids.
</DIRECTION>
<APHIDS>
<DIRECTION>
(as they're slapped on bar)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ouch! Ouch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</APHIDS>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two aphid beers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(as Bartender leaves)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you see that? How he gave you the beers, not me? I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<WEAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEAVER>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers. You soldiers get all the glory. Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<WEAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEAVER>
<DIRECTION>
We can see that Weaver is eyeing a nearby table of "Worker Babes", including Z's friend Azteca.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<WEAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(quaffing his aphid beer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you want your aphid beer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEAVER>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't help it. I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature. Call me crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<WEAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEAVER>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. You were born two seconds after me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<WEAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves. Go with the flow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEAVER>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Down the bar, there's a commotion. A grizzled old SCOUT ant has had too much to drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DRUNK_SCOUT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you been to Insectopia? Have you? No, ya goddam larvas! But I have...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(becoming emotional)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Mosquitos n' caterpillars n' beetles -- all livin' in peace, stuffin their guts with food...No rules, no regulations...you can be your own ant there...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(howling drunkenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Insectopia! Insectopia!

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Weaver, listen!

INT. ANT BAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Princess Bala is peering in at the entrance to the ant bar, accompanied by her worried-looking handmaidens.
</DIRECTION>
<HANDMAIDEN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANDMAIDEN_2>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the Princess, aren't I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<HANDMAIDEN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANDMAIDEN_2>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And do Princesses do improper things?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<HANDMAIDEN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANDMAIDEN_2>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper. Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
She adjusts her "disguise", a hardhat, tied down Jackie O.- style with an ant's version of a Chanel scarf.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just a common worker, cooling off after a rough day!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
Music starts. An ant BARKER takes the mic at one end of the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<BARKER>
<DIRECTION>
(on loudspeaker)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, folks. It's six-fifteen, and that means it's time to dance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARKER>
<DIRECTION>
Every ant gets up to dance. Weaver turns to Z.
</DIRECTION>
<WEAVER>
<DIRECTION>
(draining his beer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time to cut a rug, Z!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEAVER>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not in the mood.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(disgusted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<WEAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEAVER>
<DIRECTION>
Weaver joins the rest of the ants who are lining up for the dance. The Barker calls out the steps in a bored monotone -- all the ants already know the steps. Everyone dances in perfect synch.
</DIRECTION>
<BARKER>
<DIRECTION>
(southern twang)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And a left-right-quarterstep-back step-halfstep -- a left-right- quarterstep-backstep-halfstep -- a left-right-quarterstep-backstep halfstep --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARKER>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE ENTRANCE, Bala smiles mischievously at her handmaidens.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to ask one of these mindless, primitive worker-types to dance with me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<HANDMAIDEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But General Formica would be furious!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANDMAIDEN_1>
<BALA>
<DIRECTION>
(enjoying the idea)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
The handmaidens are appalled. Bala whirls away from them, sets her sights and searches the crowd -- zeroing in on --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Z, who's watching the other ants dance.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a bunch of losers. Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wanna dance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
Bala's standing right there. Z is instantly smitten.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me?! Yes!!! I mean --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(regaining suavosity)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just let me finish my beer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Not breaking eye contact with Bala, Z smiles suavely. Reaches suavely for a beer. Suavely grabs the candle in a glass jar off the bar. Suavely singes his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He plays it off with a rakish little laugh. A bit apprehensive, Bala heads onto the floor. Z follows her.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BALA>
<DIRECTION>
(covering up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The palace, hunh? I bet those royals really live it up. Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BALA>
<DIRECTION>
(shocked)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
Z and Bala step onto the dance floor with the rest of the ants, but Z can't do any of the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, let's see, I -- it's been a while since I -- I think you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Bala watches Z, trying to follow along. It's the blind leading the blind, as Z tries in vain to follow the barker's rapid instructions.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, I'll lead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Z starts doing his own, individual dance. With a suave expression on his face, he leads Bala in a helter-skelter mixture-of Tango, Charleston, and hand-jive.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure this is a real dance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BALA>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why should everyone dance the same way? It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You -- you think I'm right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why can't I just do whatever I want to do? Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
Bala starts to get into it, making up her own steps in reply to Z's, loosening up, having fun. For a moment, the two of them are actually sexy together. Then they get a little too wild -- and the other ants, who are still doing their intricate dance, start to collide with Bala and Z. Z almost knocks over a big soldier ant. We can only see the ant's back at the moment.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Watch your step, worker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
Z has turned around to see the soldier ant, MAJOR MANDIBLE, glaring at him. Mandible is about twice Z's size. He's got one eye missing, and half of his left antenna his been chewed off.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(terrified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering to Bala)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you crazy? This guy's built like a pebble!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(ineptly trying to placate the soldier)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
Z's caught between a rock and a hard place. He doesn't want to get beaten up, but on the other hand, he doesn't want to lose face in front of Bala. More soldiers have gathered around, looking hostile.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come you don't dance like the rest of us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
Z glances over at Bala. Then, shaking with nervousness, he says defiantly...
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because -- because I'm an individual!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<SOLDIER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An individual? Never heard of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER_2>
<MANDIBLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look like a worker to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANDIBLE>
<WEAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, lay off my little buddy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEAVER>
<DIRECTION>
Z, meanwhile, looks far away, ecstatic, as if he's just realized something very important. Unfortunately, just at this moment, A soldier pushes Weaver...Weaver pushes him back...somebody makes a dive for Z -- and before you know it, there's a regular bar brawl going on, with Weaver in the middle of it, cracking heads together, punching ants in the face, having a great time. Just then, the Princess' handmaidens hurries over.
</DIRECTION>
<HANDMAIDEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Princess Bala! Princess Bala!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANDMAIDEN_1>
<DIRECTION>
Z, who's scrabbling around on the floor, overhears.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Princess? You're a Princess?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<HANDMAIDEN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The police are coming!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANDMAIDEN_2>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Z)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye! Gotta run!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! When can I see you again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me think. Hmmnn...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(thinks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never. Bye!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
Bala rushes off with her handmaiden, just before a squad of whistle-blowing POLICE wade into the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! Princess! Wait!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
But she's already gone, leaving Z holding her scarf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

INT. DORMITORY - THE NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Z is talking to Weaver, who's getting ready to go off to war. Nearby, columns of ant soldiers march by.
</DIRECTION>
<WEAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get real, Z! She just dropped the scarf by accident!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEAVER>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you kidding? There were sparks between us! This scarf is a sign!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<WEAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a sign that you're crazy! Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEAVER>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's gonna go wrong?! I take your place for the royal inspection. Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- bingo! Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(wags his eyebrows suggestively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Weaver looks unconvinced.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to help me. Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<WEAVER>
<DIRECTION>
(thinks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't think of any.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEAVER>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I'm gonna start doing things for you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<WEAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEAVER>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bet! They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<WEAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I'll get lucky.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Weaver thinks about it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEAVER>
<DIRECTION>
Weaver hands Z has helmet.
</DIRECTION>
<WEAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wear this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEAVER>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(overjoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEAVER>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<WEAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there. And come right back after the inspection!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEAVER>
<DIRECTION>
Weaver points to a bunch of soldiers hurrying by in formation.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(overjoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks! I owe you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Z skips off and joins the column, marching in time with the soldiers but too excited to keep from jazzing it up a little.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOWN CENTER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ant army has gathered in a huge HALL in front of a reviewing stand. We can hear the murmuring of thousands of soldiers -- but all we can see is a HUGE POSTER of an ant General pointing right at the camera. The poster reads, "GENERAL FORMICA WANTS YOU -- to obey".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Z turns to some of the soldiers near him.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any of you guys know when the Princess will show up? She's kind of a personal friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
The soldiers look at Z like he's nuts.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUD_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ATTEN-SHUN!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUD_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIAL MUSIC sounds, and we hear thousands of ant feet as they snap to attention. Z imitates the soldiers awkwardly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENERAL FORMICA struts to the middle 6f the screen, slapping his thigh with a swagger stick (the antenna of some unfortunate insect)
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First of all, let me make one thing clear. Nobody ever won a battle by thinking for himself. All this "thinking" stuff is a load of crap. If the almighty had wanted you boys to think, he wouldn't have given you huge mandibles and a brain so small you'd misplace it if it wasn't trapped inside your head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
In the audience, Z starts laughing -- he thinks Formica's just made a joke.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(slapping his thigh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Trapped inside your head" -- that's a good one --
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Z notices nobody else is laughing. He stops.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Geez -- tough room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
From the stage, Formica is squinting at the audience, trying to make out who was laughing, but there are just too many ants. He continues.
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
(striding back and forth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We ants survive as a species because we do what we're told. We survive because we work together, as one, we get the job done, we do whatever it takes to persevere!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(dramatic pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell, we're not an army of ants...we're one giant ant, with giant fists, and giant jaws!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
The soldiers CHEER! Z CHEERS along with the rest of them.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(to the soldier ant next to him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he? If you ask me, he's one giant bore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a food shortage. Well you boys are gonna be taken care of. But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for breakfast, we are gonna eat the enemy for lunch, and we are gonna eat the enemy for dinner!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
(reflective moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he looks out at his army)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty. Dismissed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
Z applauds and whistles as the other ants look at him in confusion.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(clapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bravo! Bring on the Princess!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<COLONEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stow the gab there, soldier! Let's move 'em out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLONEL>
<DIRECTION>
The soldiers turn to the right and start to march out past the reviewing stand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A COLONEL marches at the head of Z's column as Z looks around for the Princess.
</DIRECTION>
<COLONEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eyes...left!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLONEL>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, as Z's part of the army marches past the end of the reviewing stand, he sees her, looking bored, standing next to the Queen, who is giving the royal wave.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(waving)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Princess! Princess Bala! Hey! It's me! Z! I've got your scarf!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE REVIEWING STAND, Bala sees Z -- that is to say, she sees one of the thousands upon thousands of ants marching by...
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
<DIRECTION>
(peering out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is that idiot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bala waves unenthusiastically, little more than flopping her hand back and forth on her wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down below, Z takes this as a sign that Bala has seen him.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(excited)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, guys -- That's my date. Well, it's been fun. Have a great war!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Z tries to squeeze his way back towards the royals, but he's surrounded by a solid wall of soldiers -- and they're carrying him along with them.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Wait!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Z loses sight of the Princess as he's carried away. BARBATUS, a hard-as-nails "grunt" soldier ant, taps Z on the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBATUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You new, kid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBATUS>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just joined up. But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BARBATUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trial membership? Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBATUS>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment, Z is swept out of the cramped corridor they've been marching along, as the army emerges into the OPEN AIR outside of the colony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANT MOUND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a starry, moonlit night. The shadows crowd around the panicked Z, who looks up at the sky as we see the army on the march...
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute, there's been a mistake! I've got to get back to the colony!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Z starts to fall out of line, but Barbatus, looking concerned, stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBATUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you crazy, kid? They shoot deserters!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBATUS>
<DIRECTION>
Z swallows hard.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBATUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Z's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatsamatter, kid? Leave a girl behind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBATUS>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Well -- no. She's kind of playing hard to get. As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(nervously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what's on the schedule? A brisk walk? a foraging expedition?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BARBATUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- we're going to attack the termites!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBATUS>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(alarmed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Attack? But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Around Z and Barbatus, the ants start up a marching song, which we intersperse with dialogue between Barbatus and Z to form a montage/time-cut as the ant army marches on to the termite capital.

Z looks up to see...looming high above them...the TERMITE CITY, which is built in the stump of a dead tree. From here it looks like a demonic Mount Fuji. The COLONEL ANT shouts an order.
</DIRECTION>
<COLONEL>

	ATTAAAAAAAAACK!!!

</COLONEL>
<DIRECTION>
The front line of ants starts rushing towards the termite colony...Z is swept along...
</DIRECTION>
<BARBATUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over the TOOOOOOOOOOOOO-OP!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBATUS>
<DIRECTION>
Z is swept along and up the side of the stump as thousands of ants invade the colony through every possible entrance. Up...over the lip of the stump...and down inside, to the very middle of the termite colony...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Into a disquietingly peaceful scene. They're in the middle of the hollowed-out trunk, and ants keep pouring in -- but there's not a termite to be seen. Barbatus looks around suspiciously.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBATUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's too damn quiet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBATUS>
<DIRECTION>
Then we hear a strange tapping noise. Barbatus looks over, and sees that Z's teeth are chattering with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBATUS>

	Don't be scared, kid. Barbatus's got yer back.

</COLONEL>
<DIRECTION>
A nearby soldier ant take a firefly out of his knapsack and pinches him. The firefly, yelling "Yipe! Yipe! Yipe!", shoots into the air like a flare, lighting up the interior of the stump with eery, shifting luminescence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then we notice, hollowed into the inside of the stump like innumerable pockmarks, termite holes staring out upon the stump...and, with an unearthly ROAR, we see the first of hundreds of termites emerging to pour into the center of the tree, right onto the ant army.
</DIRECTION>
<COLONEL>

Within moments, Z finds himself in the middle of a BLOODBATH. The ants have broken into the colony, but are taking heavy losses from the gigantic, blind, acid-spewing termites. The battle scene is as sprawling and chaotic as something out of Braveheart. In a few QUICK SHOTS from Z's perspective, we see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- A squad of ants rushes towards a termite soldier, but are literally melted into smoking heaps of flesh by a jet of acid from its forehead...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- A termite warrior is overwhelmed by a crowd of ants and is pulled to pieces with hideous ripping sounds...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Another termite warrior takes on an ant soldier one on one and slowly crushes his head in his huge jaws...
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(looking around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guys! Guys! It isn't too late for all of us to just talk this over!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, a termite burst up from the ground and turns to face Z. Z is dwarfed by this hulking, roaring, drooling monstrosity.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! Please! Acid makes me come out in spots! -- Could I just say I have always had the greatest respect for your species? I mean, eating wood -- why didn't I think of that? I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
The termite rears, getting ready to melt Z, when OOF! he's knocked backwards by...
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BARBATUS! You -- you saved my life!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BARBATUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get all sappy about it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBATUS>
<DIRECTION>
As Barbatus and some other soldiers kill the termite, the Colonel strides up to Z, puffing on a cigar.
</DIRECTION>
<COLONEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love the smell of formic acid in the morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLONEL>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
A stream of termite acid engulfs the colonel, instantly burning him to a cinder clutching a still-burning cigar; Z's paratroop buddies turn in terror to see a herd of termites rumbling towards them. Z, terrified, dives into the hole that the huge termite made...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TERMITE TUNNEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and tumbles headlong into a corridor of the termite mound. The corridors here are primitive, caveman-like, pocked with jagged access holes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No sooner has Z landed in the tunnel than a termite comes burrowing out from one of the side walls, snapping at Z's head. Z just avoids getting decapitated, and digs straight through the wall in order to escape...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TERMITE QUEEN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...straight into the hub of the entire termite complex -- the Queen's chamber. This is nothing like the civilized court of the ant colony -- it's a huge, stinking, fetid dungeon whose walls are held up by one massive (to Z) column of piled stones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The termite queen, a repulsive, slimy, squirming, foot-long monster, is attended by a crew of diminutive, blind termite nurses. The queen turns to look Z right in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. I seem to be lost, and I was wondering if you could give me --
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Before Z can say, "directions", the queen gives out a piercing, blood-curdling shriek. The nurses start shrieking too.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(backing away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll let myself out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
But the queen's shriek has summoned a soldier termite -- the biggest one we've seen yet -- who is charging headlong at Z, jaws snapping open and shut like huge scissors.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(backing away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoo! -- Torro! Torro!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
At the last moment, Z jumps out of the way -- and the termite runs headfirst into the supporting column of the chamber. As if on a spring release, the termite's jaws clamp shut -- and shatter the base of the column. The walls of the room begin to rumble...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The termite turns to eat Z...but is crushed by a stone falling from the ceiling, which gives a final shudder and collapses, raining earth and stones down on the queen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the walls of the chamber crumble, melees of ants and termites pour into the room from the corridors around and above...they keep struggling until...
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<ANT_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	VICTORY!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANT_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
We can see that the termite warriors, deprived of their leader, are suddenly confused and directionless, easy prey for the ants.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(facetious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is terrific! Let's exact crippling war reparations! Let's set up a puppet government!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<ANT_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's slaughter them all!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANT_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
The ants set about killing the disoriented termites when...we hear another rumble coming from the outside...the ants look up confusedly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...And a (from the ant's point of view) five-hundred foot long tongue bursts through the top of the chamber with a CRASH. The ten or so ants standing directly below are smashed by the tongue, which squirts out a spray of saliva around the crater. As quick as it appeared, the tongue retracts, with a hideous SLUUURPING sound. We can now see the end of the snout of an ant-eater poking through a hole in the ceiling high above...
</DIRECTION>
<ANT_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	INCOMING!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANT_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
The tongue comes down again, smashing some more ants, whose bodies are slurped up by the tongue...the ants scatter, but to no avail, as the tongue comes smashing down again and again...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Z heads into a side corridor as the tongue smashes down again, barely missing him!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Z retreats along the corridor as the tongue searches for him, across the tunnel from intersecting access-tunnels, getting closer and closer to Z, dragging more and more screaming ants and struggling termites...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
....Then the tongue disappears. Silence. Z wipes his brow...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we hear a thunderous SNIFFING noise as the anteater searches for more prey... and the tongue starts rumbling down the corridor right towards Z, the tip squirming as it ricochets along the walls!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Z gets up and runs, the tongue lapping towards him, reminiscent of the stone sphere that nearly crushed Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark! The walls disintegrate under the pressure of the tongue, which gets closer to Z...closer...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and just misses him as Z tumbles out of the stump and down to the ground...Z sits there, dazed, as we see the huge form of the anteater withdraw its tongue and, with a final contented burp, shuffle off into the distance.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. TERMITE STUMP - MORNING

INT. EARLY MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Weaver is "passing" as a worker, working alongside much smaller worker ants. He actually loves the work. He's throwing up dirt like a bulldozer. He's so enthusiastic, he scoops up a WHOLE ANT in his shovel and tosses him aside. Azteca, who's standing next to him in line, is shocked by, and a little attracted to, this turbo-worker.

	Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Bala YANKS Z back onto the dance floor, dancing away from Formica.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You dance...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Divinely?

</Z>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No weirdly...You remind me of someone...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
Formica catches Bala's eye. She frowns at him, and decides to get a little shocking.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was swarthy...primitive... earthy...sensual.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
As she says these things, Z tries to act accordingly.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was a worker. I danced with him at a worker's bar just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?

	<DIALOGUE>
	OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU! YOU'RE A WORKER!!! A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody gasps. The dancing stops cold.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
A livid Formica is stalking over towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
(furious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this? A worker has been masquerading as a war hero?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --

<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ARREST HIM!

Angry officers begin to surround Z, who hides behind Bala in fear, using her as a shield.

</QUEEN>

People shout and scream, as Z backs up with the Princess...into the kitchen.

<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Z backs up into the kitchen, still pulling Bala along with him. Here, ant chefs are preparing food for the party, vomiting little florets onto a platter. Formica and the soldiers follow them in.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(to Formica)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay back, you lunatic! Do you think I don't know how to use this?

Z realizes that he's pointing his finger at them.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-oh.

<DIRECTION>
The officers rush for...and Z, with Bala in tow, falls backwards into an opening marked, "GARBAGE".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD ON: the GARBAGE CHUTE EXIT. Nothing happens for a moment. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From a distance, we hear the faint sound of SCREAMING, dopplering closer --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and then Z and Bala come flying out of the exit, right into the mud, cutting off the scream abruptly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bala sits up, coated in mud. Z is nowhere to be seen. Because she's on top of him.
</DIRECTION>
<PRINCESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is thoroughly unacceptable!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're telling me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
She gets up and runs back towards the colony entrance, where soldiers are already issuing to get her...
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm coming! I'm coming!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
But...just as Bala'a about to be rescued...what looks like a gigantic LASER BEAM sweeps along the rim of the colony, sizzling the ground as it moves along...and IGNITES the lead soldier into FLAMES! Bala looks stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Z watches in horror as another soldier ant is FRIED, and we look up to see a GIGANTIC MAGNIFYING GLASS casting the beam...we can just about make out the huge, grotesque figure (a seven year old kid) holding it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bala, who has no idea what's really going on, turns from the colony and runs the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going! I'm going'
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
...unfortunately, this draws the fire of the laser, which follows after her in what looks like a strafing run, SIZZLING in her footsteps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Z, who's running towards the princess, suddenly realizes that he's running towards certain doom...and joins Bala in legging it away from the colony; under a brown leaf, which bursts into flames...between the redwood-like stalks of some flowers...and finally into the relative safety of some grass...where they throw themselves on the ground, exhausted.

</BALA>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How should I know?

<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I order you to find out where we are!

</BALA>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Z tries to flag down some passing bees.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, I --

<DIRECTION>
(it passes him by; he tries the next)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon me --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(same response)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And they call them social insects.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Climb up that tree and get a better view!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
Bala points to a thin blade of grass. Gingerly, Z tests the grass and starts climbing up it...but his weight bends it, so that he's lowered back to the ground, face to upside-down face with Bala.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
Z squares up with her.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Theoretically, yes. But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course! It defines society! To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! There's no such thing as "just two ants." You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look around, sweetheart.
	</DIALOGUE>

She looks around. She doesn't like what she sees. She glowers at Z.

<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I guess that makes us even.

</Z>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha! Don't make me laugh. You're crazy about me! That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<Z>

	Oh come on, you're the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>

	I was slumming it! I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!

</BALA>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't choose him. What kind of idiot would...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(unconvincingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...choose who she wanted to marry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes herself out of it.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he decides)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You go back. Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Insectopia? You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he knows that was maybe stretching it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	that it exists. Now you follow the yellow egg...

</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
Z, meanwhile, hits the road. Bala has no idea of where to go. Just then, the scariness of the outside world comes through to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We start hearing NOISES -- the equivalent of scary jungle sounds in a Tarzan movie -- the HISSING, CROAKING, CHIRRUPING... Bala sees eyes looking out at her from all directions...and spots a colossal monster (a sparrow) fixing her with his beady gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
<DIRECTION>
(clears her throat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Worker?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no response...louder now)

	Oh WORKER? Where are you?

Bala heads off after Z.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You're nuts, how could a worker do all that?

Weaver and Azteca hold hands. More ants are gathering around, dropping their tools...

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BIKE PATH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT. A glimmering desert landscape (think of "The Sun's Anvil" in Lawrence of Arabia). Two small figures can be seen, tiny dots moving across the arid whiteness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're Bala and Z, who are crossing a concrete path in the park, which they perceive to be a "desert".

<BALA>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ruined your life? Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was happily miserable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Over Z's line, we can see a GIGANTIC WHEEL, getting larger and larger and heading right towards them, a GIGANTIC WHEEL (the front wheel of a bicycle which is heading right towards them).
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
Bala pushes Z out of the way just as the wheel rolls past with a cacophonous CRUNCHING, GRINDING noise -- like a gigantic millwheel.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to die!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on -- it's gone! What are the chances of that happening again?

No sooner has he said it than the rear wheel of the bike thunders past.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I'll be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Bala notices that they're clutching one another in fear; she pushes him away.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's wrong with me?

</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
We can, in fact, hear a low, musical PLUNK.. there's a pause and then we can hear it again...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Z and Bala walk over a rocky "dune" (the soft shoulder of the path). Beyond, the grass starts up again. They have come to the end of the "desert" (i.e. the other side of the path) Through the blades of grass, we can see...
</DIRECTION>
<Z>

<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WATER!!!

<DIRECTION>
EXT. LAKE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LAKE (a puddle) stretches before them. It is, in fact, the overflow of a drinking-fountain whose drain is jammed...as Z and Bala run to the lake, water dribbles from the fountain and into one edge of the pool (to the ants, it's a waterfall).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bala and Z run to the edge of the water and start slurping. They smile at each other, until they remember that they don't like each other.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This lake is huge! And so close to the colony! Think of the vacation potential!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BALA>

	Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.

</BALA>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, "Princess", you can't order me around. Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
-- But before he can finish, a water droplet from the fountain falls on him. It may not sound like much, but to Z it's as though a ten-foot diameter sphere of jello had engulfed him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Z's stuck inside because of the surface tension of the droplet, which doesn't burst, just quivers up and down. Inside, Z is slowly, frantically drowning and screaming for help. But his screams are muffled in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
<DIRECTION>
(annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out here I'm just what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<Z>

	Hlllllllp!

</Z>
<BALA>
<DIRECTION>
(hands on hips)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop fooling around in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
By now the droplet has started rolling, and Z is being turned upside-down. He manages to get one foreleg out of the droplet, and, in a frantic attempt to pull himself out, pulls Bala in by the leg.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me go!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
But it's too late -- they're now both stuck in the droplet, and, as Z continues to drown, he also has to deal with Bala yelling at him -- though we can't hear exactly what it. is she's yelling through the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, having run out of air, she too starts thrashing, alternately trying to swim and trying to slap him as Z tries to defend himself. Finally all this commotion is enough to make the droplet burst, spilling the two coughing, sputtering, drenched ants onto the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They both lie there, miserable, wet, and cold.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
<DIRECTION>
(chants to herself)
</DIRECTION>

<BALA>

</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
She looks out into the grass forest.

A nervous Weaver is sitting across from Formica, flanked by a couple of stoic guards. Carpenter stands smiling by the side door. There is no obvious threat to Weaver, but the atmosphere is truly intimidating.
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<WEAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well now you haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?

	Oh, no, sir!

<WEAVER>

Weaver begins to relax a bit.

<FORMICA>

<WEAVER>

</WEAVER>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
He pats Weaver on the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we? We know that no ant can be an individual. No single ant matters, right?
	</DIALOGUE>

	That's correct, sir!

	Or that one.

</FORMICA>
<WEAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEAVER>
<DIRECTION>
Formica nods at Carpenter, who smiles and opens a door. Two soldiers walk in, holding Azteca. The color drains from Weaver's face.
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
(calmly, with satisfaction)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or that one? Her life doesn't matter, does it?

	Don't tell that tightass anything, Weaver!

</AZTECA>
<DIRECTION>
Weaver starts to get up, but the guards behind him hold him down.
</DIRECTION>
<WEAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! Just let her go! Z's long gone anyway, following some golden egg to Insectopia! You'll never catch him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEAVER>
<DIRECTION>
Formica's face lights up.
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Insectopia, hunh?...See why individuality is so dangerous? It can always be used against you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the guards)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If this sissy here wants to dig, he'll dig. Send them both back to the tunnel project. Double their workload.

The guards exit with Weaver and Azteca.
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do we have on this "Insectopia"?

EXT. GRASS JUNGLE - DAY

Z and Bala are lost, wandering through the grass
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
<DIRECTION>
(looking hopeless)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I swear, we've passed this blade of grass three times.
	</DIALOGUE>

Z keeps marching on.

<BALA>

	Face it, Z, we're lost! We must have walked halfway across the world by now! How did I get into this mess...

</BALA>
<Z>

	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BALA>
<DIRECTION>
(sadly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
But Z is just gawking. The shot expands to show that they have stumbled onto...

<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...The land of red and white...

</Z>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FALSE INSECTOPIA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PICNICGROUNDS...A red and white picnic blanket, which to the ants looks like a vast, undulating pavilion, stretches before them. They gaze up at two obelisks: a salt and pepper shaker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind that is a gigantic tupperware jar full of potato salad, and sandwiches stacked high. It all looks perfect, with the clean lines and monumental proportions of fascist architecture. In fact, it looks a little too perfect.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've found it! Insectopia! Look at all this food'
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BALA>

<DIRECTION>
Z goes over to a gigantic sandwich, but -- BOOIIING! -- he's prevented from getting at it by the saran wrap covering it.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's - there's some kind of force field!
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Bala joins him, laboring against the saran wrap. Then both of them hear laughter from above.

	<DIALOGUE>
	They're simply too much, Chip!

</FEMALE_WASP>

Bala and Z look up to see two large, yellow WASPS hovering in the air above them. The husband and wife wasps have lockjawed, William F. Buckleyesque accents.
</DIRECTION>
<MALE_WASP>

(to Z and Bala)

	<DIALOGUE>
	You down there, haven't you ever been to a picnic?

The Male Wasp zooms in closer.

	Darling, do you have to talk to any insect from off the street?

</FEMALE_WASP>
<MALE_WASP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just being friendly, Poopsie.

</MALE_WASP>
<BALA>

(under his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're Eurotrash, dear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALE_WASP>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a loud RUMBLING noise -- the family is about to sit down for their picnic lunch. Gigantic hands reach down and pull away the "force fields".
</DIRECTION>
<MALE_WASP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lunch!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Z)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little piece of advice, sport -- bob and weave! Bob and weave!

</MALE_WASP>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<MALE_WASP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- like my father used to say -- there's no such thing as a free meal!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALE_WASP>
<DIRECTION>
The wasps dive in to the picnic, darting in for a bite, and then dashing away again...
</DIRECTION>
<THE_WASPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me -- I'll have some potato salad -- thank-you! -- don't mind if I do! After you!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(etc.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- But all is not well. We pull back to reveal that Z and Bala are standing in front of a giant sneaker logo, which is attached to a giant sneaker. Which moves.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sort of imagined Insectopia a little differently --
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Just at that moment, we hear a whistling in the air -- and the female wasp is crushed by a huge swatter that sweeps out of the sky, sending the picnic blanket billowing up in an aftershock that throws Bala and Z to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...my...God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<MALE_WASP>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Muffy! Muffy! Wake up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALE_WASP>
<DIRECTION>
But she doesn't move. The Male Wasp stares up at the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<MALE_WASP>
<DIRECTION>
(heartbroken)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY????
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALE_WASP>
<DIRECTION>
But Z, also looking up, has no time to commiserate.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bala, look out!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
They are only saved by the fact that they are so small - .the holes of the swatter pass over them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman, realizing that the swatter won't work on ants, throws it to the side and tries stomping on them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before Bala can get away, a sneaker falls on her with a thunderous BOOM that shakes the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MMMffllmmm...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
The shoe rises, as the person wearing it steps away...and we see that Bala is stuck in one of the ridges of the waffle- soled sneaker, adhering to a big piece of bubblegum!
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Z! Help me!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
But Bala is carried off on the sneaker in a huge, looping, ferris-wheel-like motion. BOOM. The sneaker on which Bala is stuck falls again, as the woman tries to step on Z, too --
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bala!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(mournfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll never see her again...
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
-- But he does, instantly, as the shoe rises again, showing Bala stuck deeper in the bubblegum --
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Z!!! Get me out of heeeeere!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
-- The woman has decided to walk away from the picnic to get the bubblegum off her shoe...Z heart sinks as the shoe Bala's stuck on lopes off into the distance...
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(thinks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These things always come in twos...
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
He sees a SECOND SHOE starting to rise --
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take me to your leader!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Z runs towards the shoe as it rises... and at the last moment catches on to the snaky, swinging shoe-lace.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoooooooaaaa!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
The sneaker lifts off into the air, with Z holding on for dear life to the lace, and getting further and further away from Bala as he's drawn to a vertiginous height...the landscape can be seen rolling and pitching crazily in the background...
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bala! Come back here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, the sneaker seems to pause in the air...then it descends again, in a stomach-churning, roller-coaster free- fall as the sneaker on which Bala is stuck rises up again...
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Z!!!!!!! I'm stuck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
-- But Z is trying to keep his lunch down as he descends. The sneaker hits the ground, and Z can feel himself again...it's now or never.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(Tarzan whoop)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aa-ee-ya-ee-yaaaaaaaah!!!!!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
As the sneaker rises again, he swings off the lace, hurtling through the air and catching one of the laces of Bala's sneaker...the momentum swings him up and under the sole...
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Z! You're here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
Z gets smashed into the bubblegum next to Bala. Now he's stuck too.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(ruefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I'm here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
The sneaker descends again. Z and Bala hold hands and SCREAM as they see the ground rise too meet them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUD! They're squished deeper into the bubblegum. The sneaker rises again...
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
<DIRECTION>
(emotional)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(touched)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is all your fault!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
The sneaker rises, and seems ready to fall again...but instead it just hovers there. (The person wearing it is balancing on one leg and about to scrape off the bubblegum with a penny).
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're safe...
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, the hand holding the penny looms up...the penny is, by ant standards, about sixty feet high. The huge image of Abraham Lincoln stares down at them.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the hell is that?!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
The penny starts scrapes the bubblegum off the sneaker, bringing Bala and Z along with it. They're carried through the air as the penny gets thrown away...turning over and over in a lopsided orbit as Bala and Z SCREAM...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and land with a CRASH in total darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LAKE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "lake" where Z and Bala were nearly drowned by the water droplet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The earth shakes as a HUGE, MONSTROUS creature approaches the lake - and begins to drink from it. The creature seems to hear something, and, growling, turns its ugly head. It's a Pomeranian, one of those yappy little lap-dogs -- but seen from ant perspective, it's something out of a horror movie.
</DIRECTION>
<TOUGH_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ant Team Six -- take him out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOUGH_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The monster bears its huge fangs at the approaching intruders -- a bunch of flying ants who look as though they're attacking the Death Star!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The monster rears and snaps at two of the ants, who are making a diversionary run...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and then gets it from the rest of the ants, who land on his soft, wet nose and start stinging away like crazy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The monster rears back in pain -- and runs away, YIPPING!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The members of ANT TEAM SIX, a crack team of hardcore flying- ant commandoes a la Seal Team Six, break off the attack and land.
</DIRECTION>
<MAJOR_MANDIBLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And don't come back, you sissy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAJOR_MANDIBLE>
<DIRECTION>
MAJOR MANDIBLE, Ant Team Six's lethal commander, steps into frame. He's the one-eyed killer we met in the bar earlier. The rest of his team fan out to search the area.
</DIRECTION>
<MANDIBLE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Two other commandoes come running up with what looks like a piece of machinery on a tripod -- only it's an ant -- a highly specialized, blind ant with an incredibly acute sense of smell.
</DIRECTION>
<TRACKER_ANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bala...find Bala...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRACKER_ANT>
<DIRECTION>
The tracker, drool running out of its long proboscis, sniffs the air and starts signalling like a geiger counter...

	<DIALOGUE>

Finally the tracker stops swivelling, pointing in one direction and saying, "Yeahyeahyeahyeah..."

Mandible's muscles bulge. The veins in his head throb. This is one ass-kicking ant. Even Mandible's troops look scared of him.

INT. TRASH BAG - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darkness. Out of it we hear the voices of Z and Bala.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Z.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it. You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
In one corner of the screen, we can see an irregular little hole through which a shaft of light is falling. Bala proceeds towards it, the hole appears to get bigger and bigger...
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(defeated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's only one thing worse than an ant who goes around mindlessly following orders, and that's an ant who's too dumb to go around mindlessly following orders.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Bala stops...she notices that they're being watched. She's emerging from a tied off garbage bag -- the yellow ties loop away gracefully. Bala and Z have been tossed into a garbage area. And above them and below them, peering from garbage cans, recycling containers, bags, etc., a multi-cultural assortment of insects are regarding them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A laid-back FLY voices their thoughts.
</DIRECTION>
<FLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's with the bummer attitude?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLY>
<DIRECTION>
A nearby BUTTERFLY joins in.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTTERFLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah -- nobody stresses out in Insectopia!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTTERFLY>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you say...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(joining Bala)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Insectopia?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Z and Bala look around. Just to get things straight, the garbage dump doesn't look disgusting -- that would be seeing it through human eyes. Instead, we're looking at it through ant eyes -- and, reimagined this way, it's Paradise. Not the ordered, sterile, paradise of the picnic, but an earthly land of plenty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sides of the plastic garbage bags are sheer, reflective walls of smoothest obsidian...the garbage cans are gigantic, thick metal columns put there by the gods (think the pyramids); a coke bottle, refracting the sunlight into a gorgeous rainbow, trickles a fountain of sweet nectar into the pink, bittersweet flesh of a grapefruit half, which appears as a multi-chambered concave dome. Everywhere, insects are disporting themselves -- a multi- species love-in that's like an insect version of Woodstock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bala and Z are awe-struck. Bala turns to Z.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
<DIRECTION>
(happily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Z, we made it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<FLY>
<DIRECTION>
(alighting on the grapefruit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon in! The nectar's fine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLY>
<DIRECTION>
Like a kid at an amusement park, Z slides down the smooth side of the garbage bag, whooshing this way and that until he slides into one end of a straw (a red and white striped tunnel), and is shot out...
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yippeeeeee!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
...into a bottle-cap filled with lemonade, which he alternately drinks and swims through...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down at the bottlecap, Z is drying himself off. Then he sees, emerging from behind a lemon peel, a gigantic TERMITE.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(terrified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	AAAAAGH!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Surprisingly, the termite seems equally terrified...
</DIRECTION>
<FLY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, take it easy! There's nothin' to be afraid of!
	</DIALOGUE>

	Yeah, well, I make it a practice not to trust anyone who shoots acid out of their forehead.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, back home, they called me a fruitfly. But here, I'm known as...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Superfly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLY>
<CRICKET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, big Gus is mellow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRICKET>
<DIRECTION>
The termite sticks his hand out. A drop of acid drips from his head and splashes at Z's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(taking his hand, disgusted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charmed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Z reaches out and shakes the termite's hand, as Bala watches, smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INSECTOPIA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The insects are having a cookout, their faces illuminated by the still-red ember of a match. Platters heaped with food lie untouched as they pat their bellies...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Z and Bala sit next to one another, smiling shyly as if they had just met for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>

And a TORRENT starts pouring out -- swallowing the terrified commando as if he were a crumb and heading down the tunnel like a freight train, ripping up the walls as it goes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EARLY MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone turns to hear the rumbling sound coming down the tunnel --
</DIRECTION>
<AZTECA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AZTECA>
<WORKER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's right!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WORKER_1>
<DIRECTION>
From here, we can see deep into the tunnel, at the point where it levels out...and the torrent can be seen rushing down at them...
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LET'S MOVE IT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
All of a sudden there's panic as every ant tries to scramble away from the oncoming water...in the confusion, the Queen's bearers drop her and scramble over her.
</DIRECTION>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You there! Stop! I say!
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
The Queen turns, and for a brief moment is silhouetted against the white-capped torrent of water...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and then she picks her abdomen up like a skirt and high tails it away from the torrent, running so fast that she passes some of her bearers on the way...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then the torrent spits out of the mouth of the Megatunnel, quickly filling up the chamber and branching into all of its side tunnels, as we see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of workers RUNNING up a side tunnel and getting consumed by a wave, which crashes down on them like a hand slapping a table...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another group, the members of which are getting swallowed up one by one; one of the ants runs up on the ceiling of the tunnel and keeps on going, upside-down...it works for a while but eventually he, too is swallowed up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- In the Nursery, nurses are evacuating stacks of crying ant babies...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In one of the larger access-tunnels, down which thousands of workers are fleeing, a group of ants turns and decides to make a stand for it -- they link up in a mass and form a LIVING DAM. It holds for a while but then BURSTS scattering and smashing ants along the sides of the tunnel before eating them up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The huge main chamber of the colony, where most of the workers -- as well as Z, Bala, Weaver, Azteca, and the Queen -- have run to.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chamber is rapidly flooding from all sides. Water flows out of every escape tunnel the workers try...and the crowd is becoming more and more closely packed together as the waters rise around them.
</DIRECTION>
<AZTECA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no way out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AZTECA>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're all going to drown!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Z...what can we do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
Z clenches his fist...he feels utterly powerless...then he shouts...
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dig!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
The workers turn to look at him questioningly.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got to dig a trench around us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
-- But one of the workers raises his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<WORKER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh...we don't dig any more. We're individuals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WORKER_1>
<WORKER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. We're too important to dig. You taught us that, Z. You hate digging!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WORKER_2>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(at his wits end)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but I hate drowning more! Now dig!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<WEAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEAVER>
<DIRECTION>
The workers start to dig a circular moat around themselves, passing the dirt back into the middle of what remains of the dry ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- But they seems to be making little headway against the water as it continues to rush in...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ant labor we saw up to now were nothing compared to this. As the moat gets deeper, the pile grows higher and higher...Weaver is digging up huge chunks of earth...nearby, Azteca is digging like crazy too...Z runs around, directing traffic and encouraging the workers...
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it! Pass the dirt back to the center! Go on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Nearby the Queen stands there, looking squeamish.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your highness...time to get your hands dirty!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Gingerly, the Queen reaches out for a clod of dirt...and passes it along. Next thing you know, she's practically crushed by a huge load thrown up by Weaver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water keeps rushing in...but now we notice that...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the pile of dirt in the middle of the "island" created by the digging of the moat is growing higher and higher, reaching up towards the ceiling of the chamber...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...And the water is getting swallowed up by the moat, swirling around angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Z looks up, and sees that with a little more effort they can reach the top --
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need to form a scaffolding around this mound -- let's DO IT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
The workers start to cluster around the mound, covering it, forming a tight network of living bodies around the mound up towards the ceiling...
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now climb!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
The ants start to scale the scaffolding, up towards the top of the chamber...it's a swarming mass of ants, hauling each other up, giving each other legs up, climbing ever and ever higher towards the top...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where they start to dig through the very ceiling...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...as, at the bottom of the mound, Z starts to organize the hauling away of the Queen, as though she were a big cargo container...
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay boys -- take her up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Z slaps the Queen on the butt, and she's winched away on a cable composed entirely of ants linked arm in arm like those plastic toy monkeys...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...And Azteca's head pokes through the ground...she hauls herself up, and hundreds of ants pour up from the ground, widening the hole...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water is rising...but almost all of the ants have escaped...Z clambers up the mound, as the scaffolding of ants rolls up from the bottom....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the rushing water finally wears down the earthen core of the structure. As Z hauls himself through the hole in the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire structure collapses into the angry waters below, which seem furious to have missed their prey...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANT MOUND - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<WORKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He did it! Z! Z! Z! Z! Z!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WORKER>
<DIRECTION>
The "Z" cheer goes up, with everyone joining in. But the jubilation is short-lived, for, appearing on the ridge, surrounding the workers, is FORMICA'S ARMY, circling the mass of workers, backing them in towards the roiling water behind them. Formica himself appears in the front lines, with Carpenter and Mandible at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Z. I should have known. All that work, all that preparation, come to nothing. All because of one stinking ant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
He steps forward to address the surrounded, trapped workers.
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ALRIGHT. WHICH ONE OF YOU IS Z?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
The workers, trembling but silent, cower inside the unbroken circle of soldiers.
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHAT ARE YOU, DEAF? I ASKED YOU, WHERE'S Z?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
Formica laughs, shaking his head.
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Folks, you may have survived that flood, but there's no way you're gonna escape from me. I'll make you a deal. Hand over the rebel leader Z, and you survive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
This sends a ripple of murmurs through the workers.
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if you don't hand him over, you're all going to die, each and every single..."individual" one of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
The workers all look at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What shall it be, workers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
The workers remain frightened but silent. Z trembles, terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have it your way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
As Formica raises his swagger stick to order the attack, a lone figure steps out from the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait...
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Z stands there, shivering with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'm Z.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, Z stands alone, under the glare of Formica's gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then another figure steps out from the throng of workers.
</DIRECTION>
<WEAVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm Z.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEAVER>
<DIRECTION>
Z turns, astonished, to see Weaver, still and unwavering, bravely risking his life for his friend. Then, AZTECA also steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<AZTECA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Z!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AZTECA>
<DIRECTION>
Next, Bala comes forward.
</DIRECTION>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm Z.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
More and more ants step forward.
</DIRECTION>
<WORKERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Z! I'm Z! I'm Z and so is my brother! I've been Z for weeks now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WORKERS>
<QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
(regally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are Z.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
Now, the workers are all shouting the same declaration.
</DIRECTION>
<ALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am Z! I am Z! I am Z!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALL>
<DIRECTION>
Z is plainly flabbergasted. Formica is outraged. He gives the signal.
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ATTACK!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
The army swells forward on all sides, pushing the workers towards the swirling water. Some workers surround the Queen to protect her. All seems lost, when THE FLY from Insectopia alights on the rim of the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<FLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, guys!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLY>
<DIRECTION>
THE WASP appears on the other side of the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<WASP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WASP>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, on all sides, A MASSIVE INSECT ARMY appears on the ridge, looking not unlike ambushing Indians in a John Ford film. Formica's soldiers stop in their tracks, awed by the unfolding spectacle. It looks like all of Insectopia has turned out: spiders, caterpillars, rhinoceros beetles, all manner of creatures crawling and flying have shown up, and now surround the army, dwarfing them.
</DIRECTION>
<WASP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are these hooligans giving you trouble, Z?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WASP>
<FLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say the word, Z, and we kick their butts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLY>
<DIRECTION>
The ant army remains frozen, unsure of what to do next. Formica is furious. If ants had veins, Formica's would be bulging out of his face.
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?! ATTACK!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(berating his army)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, you yellow-bellies!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning on Carpenter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<CARPENTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, actually, we are outnumbered sir...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARPENTER>
<DIRECTION>
Formica turns towards the insects gathered against him. With his chin raised pridefully, Formica steps forward, and CHARGES Z!
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	AHHHHHHH!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
Formica runs so quickly and with such force that his helmet blows off his head. Z's eyes get big, he stumbles backwards, slipping, and Formica goes flying over him, toward the whirlpool behind. He scrabbles at the edge of the water, and then tumbles over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, it looks as if he's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help...help me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
Z goes to the edge of the precipice and looks over. Formica is struggling in the waters of the very flood he created, which are roiling not far below. He looks up into Z's eyes, a new expression crossing his features: fear.
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please...I...I can't swim...Help me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
Formica goes under for a bit, then his head comes up again -- but he's not going to be able to stay afloat for long...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he sees a line dropped down. Above, Z looks down on him.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you said that the life of one ant doesn't matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Formica looks at the line...and in that moment seems to realize his error...
</DIRECTION>
<FORMICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess it does...to the ant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORMICA>
<DIRECTION>
Formica reaches up and takes the line, and is pulled up by Z and a bunch of other ants (the line, we see, extends from a nearby spider, one of the cavalry from Insectopia).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Formica is left, broken and alone, by the precipice, while HORDES OF ANTS surround Z to congratulate him. Bala fights her way to his side and the two of them embrace. Then the ants pick up Z and Bala, and, CHEERING, bear them away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only Carpenter stays behind. He walks up to Formica, carrying his dented and dusty helmet. He cleans it the best he can with his jacket sleeve and hands it to his fallen general.
</DIRECTION>
<CARPENTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, if it's any consolation, I still think you're completely worthless as an individual.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARPENTER>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP OF Z
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he addresses the audience, stand-up style.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, uh, that's pretty much it. Just your basic "simple worker overthrows the government and winds up with the princess" kind of a story. You know: there was the big parade and everything...
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HUGE ASSEMBLY OF ANTS applauds as Z who is given a medal by the Queen.
</DIRECTION>

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENERAL FORMICA'S FACE, looking extremely dispeptic.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	General Formica was almost unemployable. He eventually got a gig as a honeydew keg.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK TO REVEAL Formica clinging to a wall, his belly hideously distended with honeydew.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Queen asked me to take over his job, but I said "Sorry, but I'm really not the general type. I'm more the specific type." So they gave the job to Weaver instead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WEAVER, in Formica's old office, in a general's uniform, his feet up on Formica's desk, smoking a cigar. Carpenter is on his hands and knees scrubbing the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Weaver cut the defense budget in half. Now we only have an army of five million.

Z, ADDRESSING THE AUDIENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And me, I guess you could say that I lived happily ever after.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
Bala enters the frame, embraces and kisses him.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, I've got the whole package, right? A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<BALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A few?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALA>
<DIRECTION>
WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. Z'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Z and Bala stand in the midst of their living room, up to their knees in THOUSANDS OF CHILD ANTS. The children cover every horizontal surface. They run around, cry, laugh, and tease each other. Z looks around the room, looks back at us, and shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<Z>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, so nothing's perfect. But you know? I wouldn't change a thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Z>
<DIRECTION>
The camera pulls up...and away from the ground...to reveal that this whole story has been taking place in a small area of CENTRAL PARK. We pull back and back, and see all the familiar landmarks from the story: the bike path, the drinking fountain, etc. We tilt up into the NEW YORK SKYLINE. BIG MUSICAL FLOURISH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
