SUPER: 1968
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a darkened living room, a huge summer moon spilling silver through a window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move slowly across the mantelpiece where a pair of candles glow, illuminating family photos. Weddings two, maybe three generations back -- brides in white, their young grooms at their sides, frozen in time. As we pan, we hear two VOICES offscreen: a BOY'S and a GIRL'S.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop pushing it. You're not supposed to force it. You're supposed to just let it happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL_S_VOICE>
<BOY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not pushing it, you're pushing it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY_S_VOICE>
<GIRL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Until,
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're pushing it again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
An exasperated sigh.
</DIRECTION>
<BOY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, hurry up. My foot's falling asleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY_S_VOICE>
<GIRL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mo-mmm. Larry's pushing it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Mom?
</DIRECTION>
<MOM>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (from the next room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Larry, don't push it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<DIRECTION>
And now, we finally pan over to discover two KIDS playing with a Ouija board. For future reference, the players are FAITH (age eleven), and her brother LARRY (ten).
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. I have to write this down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
A groan out of him. She grabs a piece of paper and starts scrawling out a series of letters.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grandma told me everybody has a soul mate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But most people never find theirs, most people settle. I'm never gonna settle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
She gazes up as the ripe summer moon slips behind a bank of clouds.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This way I'll know the name of the man I'm supposed to wait for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
The arrow continues to move around the board, stopping on various letters which she copies down.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be stupid, Larry. If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Another letter.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here? Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And stop talking. You're gonna ruin the spell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Another pause. Another letter. Then... Ever the devil's advocate,
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but... but, Faith, what if he does live here, and one day you just walk past him on the street? I mean, you don't hear his name, you don't get a chance to introduce yourselves. You practically bump straight into each other, but you never even know it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Right in his face,
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll KNOW.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okaaaaayyyy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
The arrow comes slowly to a halt. And she writes down the final letter, as the moon again breaks through the clouds, throwing a bright white beam of light directly onto the name which reads:
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damon Bradley.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she looks up, spellbound)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's the one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>

Beat.

EXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A screaming face. Whirling lights. A local carnival. The small-town traveling kind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPER: THREE YEARS LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up on the ferris wheel, a bunch of JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL BOYS are distinguishing themselves by hurling water balloons down at carnival-goers. Among the participants is Faith's brother Larry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL DOWN from them to "MADAME DIVINA'S FORTUNE TELLING BOOTH". "Know Your Fate". Clustered in front of it are a bunch of JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We should recognize Faith as one of them. Another girl, LESLIE, is egging a friend on.
</DIRECTION>
<LESLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on, go on...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the rest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wants to know if she's gonna marry Alex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESLIE>
<GIRL_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not. I'm not gonna marry Alex.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(obviously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He doesn't even have a car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL_2>
<LESLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he's got pretty eyes. That means your kids would have pretty eyes. You can always get a car later, but you can't always find pretty eyes. You gotta think ahead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESLIE>
<GIRL_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who cares about pretty eyes, Leslie? I'm telling you, stocks, bonds, real estate -- that's what you wanna look for in a man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL_3>
<GIRL_4>
<DIRECTION>
(dismissing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heh...

</GIRL_4>
<GIRL_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL_3>
<GIRL_4>
<DIRECTION>
(the voice of authority)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Definitely sex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL_4>
<DIRECTION>
Somebody else pipes up,
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL_5>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mom told me you gotta want the same things out of life. Have the same values, be able to communicate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL_5>
<DIRECTION>
They all turn to look blankly at this poor, misguided soul.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL_5>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just telling you what she said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL_5>
<DIRECTION>
They're still looking at her.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL_5>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not like I believed her or anything...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL_5>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're all wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<LESLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think the most important thing is, Faith?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESLIE>
<DIRECTION>
There is not a doubt in her mind.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True love. I believe there's one special person out there who's meant for each of us. And when your eyes meet, it'll be magic and you'll both know it instantly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
A couple of dissenters roll their eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to another friend)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you think so, Kate?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
KATE's looking at the ground, trying to sound casual.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(in her next breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Larry here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(she couldn't care less)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. He's around somewhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Up above, Larry takes careful aim, then sends a water balloon torpedoing their way. It hits the ground between them with an enormous SPLAT. They SCREAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORTUNE TELLING BOOTH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move past them, through a beaded window and into the booth where a disheveled older WOMAN, MADAME DIVINA, is paging through a copy of "Scientific American".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a TAP at the door. She checks her watch. Curses. She shoves the magazine in a drawer, then hoists a bowling ball, the kind with the iridescent swirls in them, onto an opening in the center of the table, carefully positioning it so the three holes aren't visible. She flicks on a flashlight above it. Crystal ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back outside, the girl everybody-thinks-is-going-to-marry-Alex is nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what if she tells me something bad? I don't want to hear anything bad...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL_2>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They never tell you anything bad. Nobody'd ever go to them if they did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens. The WOMAN'S imposing hulk casts a shadow down over them. They look up.
</DIRECTION>
<FORTUNE_TELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who knocked?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORTUNE_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
Like deer in the headlights.

	<DIALOGUE>
	She did.

</GIRL_2>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing at girl #2)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She did.

</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Nobody moves, until,
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Faith looks at her friends, shrugs, then gamely ventures inside past the beads and sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<FORTUNE_TELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORTUNE_TELLER>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you wanna know, Faith?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORTUNE_TELLER>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, just basic destiny stuff, I guess. But-- I don't want to hear anything bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If that's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Madame Divina starts laying out a series of tarot cards. Suddenly there's a loud KNOCK at the back door. Faith jumps.
</DIRECTION>
<FORTUNE_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
(dismissing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spirits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORTUNE_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
She lays down a couple more cards. Then a persistent "PSSSSTTTT", "PSSSSTTT". More BANGING.
</DIRECTION>
<FORTUNE_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
(hollering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry, I'm outta change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORTUNE_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
More KNOCKING. Harry is determined. Annoyed, Mme. Divina finally gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<FORTUNE_TELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come I always wind up next door to the freak show?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as she goes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just because they're midgets does that mean they don't have to go to the bank like the rest of us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORTUNE_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
She lumbers to the back of the booth, throws open a back door and looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<FORTUNE_TELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORTUNE_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, Faith is nervously eying the cards. Her friend KATE peeks in through the beads.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(mouthing the words and pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that a bowling ball?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Faith doesn't understand. Kate mimes a bowling motion, swinging her arm. Faith shrugs. As the woman returns, from outside we overhear,
</DIRECTION>
<BOY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Kate. Larry wants you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY_S_VOICE>
<LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Kate grins, ducks out. Mme. Divina sits back down. Closes her eyes. Fingers the ball, entranced.
</DIRECTION>
<FORTUNE_TELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something is coming to me. I'm getting... a name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORTUNE_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
Faith leans forward.
</DIRECTION>
<FORTUNE_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
(straining)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This name is very important to you... Da-- David. No-- no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORTUNE_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
A faint breeze flutters through the room and the candle starts to flicker.
</DIRECTION>
<FORTUNE_TELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORTUNE_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
Faith's heart skips a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<FORTUNE_TELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His name is...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(her eyes pop open
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	with startling
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
intensity)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damon Bradley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORTUNE_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
It is, of course, the same name.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Omigod. Omigod.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(getting up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
She seizes Faith's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<FORTUNE_TELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a minute--
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORTUNE_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
Faith freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<FORTUNE_TELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your destiny's two dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORTUNE_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
Faith pulls out two bills, drops them on the table. Bolts for the door. But the woman stops her again.
</DIRECTION>
<FORTUNE_TELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey--
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORTUNE_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
She leans in very close and pulls Faith toward her. We should sense that this is not part of the act. This is for real.
</DIRECTION>
<FORTUNE_TELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The truth is, no matter what the cards say, you make your own destiny. Don't wait for it to come to you. You understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORTUNE_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
Faith nods. Still in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I be excused now?

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPER: TWENTY YEARS LATER -- SATURDAY NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear pouring rain. But what sounds like rain is actually the shower, as we pull back to find Mitzi Gaynor washing that man right out of her hair. "SOUTH PACIFIC" is on television. We pull back even further to reveal three WOMEN watching. A big Saturday night. There's a lot of chocolate on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The women are: the adult FAITH. Attractive, a little dreamy. The walls of her apartment are adorned with reproductions of famous works all featuring a similar theme, Rodin's "The Kiss", Botticelli's "Birth of Venus", etc. Bookshelves are crammed with volumes of poetry. She's absentmindedly pulling the petals off a bouquet of flowers on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Also in attendance: KATE, her childhood friend turned housewife and sister-in-law. Kate is a pragmatist. She's clipping coupons out of the newspaper as they watch. And, doing her nails, LESLIE. Big hair. Good heart. Not the sharpest tool in the shed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the movie cuts to a commercial,
</DIRECTION>
<LESLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just saying I think it would be a good idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESLIE>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(dubiously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Date police...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LESLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. A guy who says he's gonna call, then doesn't, ought to get slapped with a citation, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Faith glances at Kate. They're used to Leslie.
</DIRECTION>
<LESLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(blowing on her nails)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, like I said, I've given it a lot of thought and I've finally narrowed it down.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A heterosexual with a job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESLIE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't think it's asking too much to want to feel it in my head and my heart and my body and my soul all at the same time, and to have that feeling to be mutual. Pass the M&Ms please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Her friends groan. They're used to Faith. Kate hands the candy over.
</DIRECTION>
<LESLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not as long as you're not hoping to find it on planet Earth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leslie's right, Faith. You've got to start being more practical. Do you know what the statistics are, the marriage odds for women your age?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe in statistics.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<LESLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I saw that. Like on Let's Make A Deal. You've got the Amana freezer and you can keep it, or risk it on what's behind Door Number Three. Which usually turns out to be a donkey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Faith looks at Kate.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have an Amana freezer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a metaphor. It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them. And instead wind up with nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She knows there's probably some ugly truth to this. Luckily, the PHONE RINGS. Faith picks it up.

LARRY, Kate's husband, Faith's brother, is at the kitchen table, munching the last crumbs out of a bag of potato chips and watching television.

INT. FAITH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over the movie, we hear yelling -- Kate's half of the fight -- in the background. Then the SLAMMING of the receiver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she comes back into the room, the "Some Enchanted Evening" number is on. Faith is mouthing the words. Kate starts picking up her coupons.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>

Faith is applying eye cream. She leans in closer, carefully examining the lines around her eyes.

The machine shuts off. Faith gets into bed. Reaches for the light. Then, remembering something, gets up.

There's a daily calendar lying on her dresser. She rips off the top page, crumples it into a ball, drops it into the wastebasket.

A vast audience of PEOPLE, all clad in ridiculous get-ups. Faith is wearing a chicken suit. Her Mother is there, in an octopus costume. Kate and Larry are Siamese twins. Leslie is dressed as a radish. MONTY HALL steps up to Faith.

Faith exits her apartment and heads down the hall, carrying a wastebasket. She opens the garbage chute, lifts up the basket, but as she tilts it, her hand slips and a multitude of crumpled little balls, all those days, go spilling out onto the floor. She just stares down at them, on the edge. When,

EXT. DWAYNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A party. Champagne corks POP, MUSIC plays, GUESTS circulate. We move around the room, picking up snatches of conversation. Dwayne is leading Faith around by the hand. Thrusting her ring finger into people's faces.

<DIRECTION>
She's embarrassedly playing along.

	Oh, sweetie, you won't forget to pick up my cleaning tomorrow, will you?

She turns. Kate continues adjusting the veil, pinning it.

Faith gets up and tries to head into the kitchen, but the unfortunate combination of the big dress and the small doorway stop her.

Click.

	<DIALOGUE>
	But wait-- Hello? Hello??
	</DIALOGUE>

But there is only a dial tone. She stands there clinging desperately to the receiver. A woman adrift in a life raft who's suddenly seen a ship appear, then disappear back over the horizon.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faith, still in her wedding gown, is racing to her car. A crazed gleam in her eye. Kate is tagging after her.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a miracle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a coincidence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The woman at my dry cleaners believes there's no such thing as coincidence.

Kate looks at her. So what?
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(breathlessly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay, but don't you think it's a weird coincidence? Doesn't it seem like somebody's trying to tell me something? And not only that, take a look at this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Faith pulls a clipped copy of the day's horoscope from her purse. Kate scans the column.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Taurus: "Today can be a fresh start and a new beginning."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(dropping it to her side)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on Faith, they all say that. In my case it means I'm gonna empty the dishwasher.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She snatches back the paper, undeterred.

	I just want to get a look at him, that's all.

</FAITH>

EXT. ROADWAY - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faith is driving like a maniac, her hoop skirt crammed in over the edge of the dash, blocking the lower half of the windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIRPORT - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faith screeches to a halt in the passenger loading zone, somehow manages to muscle the round hoop into an ellipse, and springs out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She mashes herself into one of those glass-partitioned revolving doors, but gets stuck, making a few revolutions before a couple of PASSERS-BY help pry her out on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She scans a departure screen for the flight to Venice and buttonholes a SKY CAP. He points to the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hikes up her gown and starts sprinting through the airport, jumping luggage, can-can-ing through the turnstiles, dodging kids, running up the down escalator.
</DIRECTION>

The CLERK gives her the once-over. He hasn't seen this ploy in awhile.

<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I see your boarding pass, please?

</CLERK>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I-- I must've misplaced it.

</FAITH>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>

She starts digging through her purse, at the same time slowly inching her way past the little rope they put up to block people.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(a smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure I've got it here someplace...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles back. And tightens the rope.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, ma'am, just a moment.

	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got a 237 on our hands here. Uh huh. Yeah. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up. The engines can be heard revving outside.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
(back to her with a plastic smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll be just a moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
We see a SECURITY GUARD approaching. The Clerk starts waving him over. Meanwhile, CREW MEMBERS off an arriving flight are entering through a side door. Using her dress as a shield, Faith manages to wedge a foot in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the clerk turns to address the guard, she darts out and starts sprinting across the tarmac for the plane-- where they've just finished pulling the portable stairs away from the cabin door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the plane starts to taxi, the GROUND CONTROLLER waves frantically at her to get out of the way. With an anguished cry, she sinks to the ground as the jet SCREAMS overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRPORT BAR - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on a shooter of tequila. A white-gloved hand picks it up and downs it. When,
</DIRECTION>
<O_S>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, where's the nut in the dress?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_S>
<DIRECTION>
The BARTENDER casts a sympathetic glance towards the end of the bar. Points. She's a pitiful figure, this bride in her torn wedding gown getting bombed all alone.
</DIRECTION>
<SECURITY_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
(taking her by the arm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, ma'am, we agreed not to press charges. But I'm afraid we're gonna have to ask you to leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECURITY_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
The bartender turns to her.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you drive? Do you want us to call you a cab?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(not at all fine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thank you. I'm fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
She gets up shakily.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we better call you a cab.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(picking up the phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is it you want to go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes drift to the DEPARTURE SCREEN. There's another flight leaving for Venice in one hour. And a sudden light in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate is on the telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you're afraid to fly.

<KATE>

	Of course not. I told him I was going to visit a great aunt. And don't tell Larry, either.

Kate glances disdainfully over at Larry, who's engrossed in the Home Shopping Club in the next room.

EXT. DWAYNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Leslie are there. Kate knocks. No answer. She pulls a key from beneath the mat and opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She calls out Dwayne's name. No answer. Nods to Leslie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faith, still in her bridal gown, is waiting impatiently at the TWA terminal entrance. Finally, she spots Kate and Leslie in the distance, carrying a suitcase. She rushes to them.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(anxiously to Leslie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were you able to find it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<LESLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At the very bottom of Dwayne's closet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Faith clenches her fist in victory.
</DIRECTION>
<LESLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But... there wasn't a regular yearbook picture of him in there. He must've been absent that day or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Faith's face falls.
</DIRECTION>
<LESLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	However, he was in the marching band.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Faith brightens again, as Leslie pulls a contact lens case from her purse. She unscrews one side, empties the contents into Faith's palm. A fuzzy little image the size of an eraserhead. Damon Bradley, age 17, in the shadow of a tuba. Faith holds the virtually microscopic black and white speck up under her nose, examining it lovingly.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(touched)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Leslie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Then, ever so carefully, places it back into the case, puts the case in her purse, and reaches for her suitcase. Which Kate is still holding onto.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe we did this. Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. What if Dwayne and I aren't really meant to be? Is it fair of me to waste his life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Kate reluctantly lets go. Faith starts walking through the terminal, pulling clothes from the suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They follow her into the ladies' room, where Faith changes clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<LESLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think she's right. You shouldn't let a chance like this slip by. What if he's really The One?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Les-lie, he's not The One. She's never even met this man.
	</DIALOGUE>

(to Faith)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean to tell me that you've spent your whole life waiting for somebody with this name--

	<DIALOGUE>
	this name you got from a Parker Brothers game when you were eleven--

	No, I haven't. And you forgot about the fortune teller.

<DIRECTION>
(giddy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I've made a reservation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Kate shakes her head. They exit out of the restroom and head towards her gate.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't even know what he looks like. You don't speak the language. You don't know your way around. This is a total stranger, in a foreign land.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She's starting to get a little caught up in this.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A foreign land full of millions of Italian men... speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	How hard can it be? I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--

<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Live happily ever after.

	Maybe.

Off Kate's look,
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, until today, I had forgotten all about this. And chances are I'll find out he's not for me and I'll come home and marry Dwayne and never bring this up again. But what if this is the real thing, Kate? What if this is the real real thing?
	</DIALOGUE>

She steps aboard the escalator.

EXT. AIRPORT PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT

Leslie is behind the wheel of Faith's car, driving it home. Kate is at the wheel of her station wagon, driving it back home. When at the last opportunity to recircle the airport, Kate suddenly cuts the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRPORT WAITING AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on a Let's Go, Italy guide, an Italian-English Dictionary, and a copy of How to Make a Man Fall in Love with You}. Faith is waiting at the gate. She's packing the books into her suitcase when the glitter of her ENGAGEMENT RING catches her eye. She looks around, before furtively sliding it off. She opens the coin purse of her wallet and is placing it inside, when a pair of shoes appear in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<O_S>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you loan me some clothes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_S>

Startled, she looks up. Kate is standing there, holding her passport.

Kate nods. Faith throws her arms around her.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not saying I think it's a good idea. But if you're going to insist on doing this, I don't think you should go alone. You need to be sensible about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Their flight is announced. They get up and start walking towards the gate.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. The key is to go about this sensibly. Logically. Rationally.

As the plane slowly taxis, the FLIGHT ATTENDANTS go through their standard litany of disaster. As usual, everybody is ignoring them. Except for one passenger, who is looking slightly green.

	We're here, we're here, we're here! I can't believe we're really here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
As they make their way to the baggage claim they're instantly subjected to the Italian male's tendency to treat every female in sight as if she were the first woman he'd ever seen in his life. Faith looks around ingenuously,

<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what?... It seems like there's a lot more available men in Italy.

EXT. DOCKS, PIAZZALE ROMA - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our first view of Italy which, visually, is meant to be idealized. A place where the light is always golden, and the streets are full of magic and romance. It's not the real Italy, it's the Italy of guidebooks. Of memories and dreams...

EXT. GRITTI PALACE ENTRANCE - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They enter the elegant lobby of the restored 15th century palazzo.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so glad I got up the nerve to do this. All my life, I've waited for men to call. Waited for them to ask me out. Waited for them to make the first move. Well, no more of that. I am finally taking charge of my own destiny.

They arrive at the CONCIERGE's desk.

<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello. Reservation for Faith Corbett, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>

He nods, starts punching something into his computer. Kate pulls something from her purse.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And put it on this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on a CREDIT CARD which reads "LAWRENCE CORBETT". Faith looks at her. Kate flashes a wicked smile.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And, could you please tell us what room Mr. Bradley is in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CONCIERGE>
<DIRECTION>
(politely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. Mr. Bradley has already checked out.

The three cruelest words in existence, "already checked out".

	Excuse me?

(dazed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.

</FAITH>
<CONCIERGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm very sorry. Perhaps you misunderstood?

</CONCIERGE>
<DIRECTION>
He rings for the bellboy.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you absolutely sure he's gone? Maybe you made a mistake. You must've made a mistake. Could you check again? Please? Sir?

His polite veneer wearing thin, the man pulls a key from the honeycomb of slots behind him.

	Room 217. Would you like to go up and check under the bed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONCIERGE>

She doesn't respond. He replaces it.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, which way did he go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
The man stares at her blankly.

	Nobody here has any idea which way he went?

Kate leans across the counter and grabs him by the collar, pressing her forehead to his.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you don't understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(like she's possessed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My friend was supposed to meet him here.

He starts to wrestle with her. Faith steps in to help pry Kate's fingers from the gentleman's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse us.
	</DIALOGUE>

He's still coughing as Faith leads her away from the desk into the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, he was rude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
They sit down.

	I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.

Kate nods sympathetically.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wait here. I'm gonna go get us a room for the night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Devastated, Faith stares vacantly into space.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll never meet the man of my dreams.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
As Kate heads back toward the check-in desk, Faith gets up and approaches the DOORMAN. She pulls the contact lens case from her purse. Unscrews one side and holds it out in front of him. He starts laughing. She darkens. He sobers, rattles something off in Italian, gesturing toward the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREETS OF VENICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two women race along, over bridges, under streetlamps. Faith is holding the case out in front of her sister-in-law.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Faith starts stopping people on the street, holding out the case, encouraging them to peer in. Some of them look at her like she's nuts, a few shake their heads, one MAN finally stops. Examines it carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(anxiously)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you see him? Do you recognize him?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Candid Camera, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he starts waving)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOURIST>
<DIRECTION>
She snatches it away. Continues on. But the crowd jostles her. She is bumped hard from behind. And the photo goes floating out into St. Mark's Square. Frantically, she gets down on her hands and knees, trying to keep people from trampling it.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(without looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He fell out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Reluctantly, Kate gets down on all fours, too. Faith spots the little face lying about two feet away. She strains to reach out, when a SHOE mashes down on her hand. It lifts back up, taking the photo with it, stuck fast to the sole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faith struggles to her feet, scooting after the MAN who's moving at a fast clip. She fights her way through the crowd, tracing his footsteps, crouched to make sure it's still there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's heading toward the edge of the canal. Is about to step aboard a gondola, when Faith stands up and grabs his shoulder from behind. He turns.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(breathlessly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, sir, I'm sorry, but I think there's something that belongs to me stuck to the bottom of your shoe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Confused, the guy looks down. Faith reaches for his foot.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mind if I just--
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the shoe, turns it over, twisting the man's leg and knocking him off balance in the process. Sending him toppling into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(peering down from above)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
But the shoe is still in her hand. She turns it over, and sure enough, the tiny image is still perched there. She licks a finger and triumphantly picks it up like a crumb. Success... Until a big gust of wind comes up, whisking the little likeness into the Grand Canal.

	It wasn't like I did it on purpose.

Faith is dripping. Looking like her world has come to an end. She's holding a phone book, as Kate drops tokens into a pay phone.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't really blame him for being upset. It was an Armani suit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>

	I don't think he understood what you were saying. What's the airport number?

A MAID walks by, wheeling a cart. Suddenly, Faith's eyes light up.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the receiver from Kate's hand, hangs it up.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just got a dial tone--
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet. Maybe there's something in there that might help us. Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
They both turn to look at the concierge. Look back at each other. Shake their heads. Kate picks up the phone again. Faith takes it from her, hangs it up again. Looks pleadingly at her friend. Beat.

	So far, I'd say we're looking for a rich slob.

Kate stands with her hands on her hips, surveying the scene. Faith spots a wastebasket in the corner. She runs over to it, picks it up, peers in.

A small pile of garbage spread out on the floor -- an apple core, a couple more Butterfinger wrappers, some tissue, an empty shampoo bottle, a soap wrapper. Nothing very helpful. There's only one more crumpled piece of paper yet to be examined.

Kate looks at her.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, my long-lost brother. See, uh, we were separated when we were very young. The last time I saw him we were just babies, but I've recently found out that he's here in Italy. And I'm here trying to find him.
	</DIALOGUE>

That's the ticket.

She smiles nervously.

Teary-eyed, Faith nods.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - SUNRISE

	'Course he does.

</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to? But maybe I was wrong. Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.

Faith turns to look at her sister-in-law. She goes over and kneels down next to her.

	Remember in junior high, when I had that Halloween party? And we were playing Twister. And it landed on right-hand-red, and there was only one red spot left. You reached for it, but you started to fall.

	And instead of taking it, Larry reached out to catch you. He let you win. Larry never let anybody win. That's when I knew. He was a goner.

<DIRECTION>
Dwayne and Larry are playing. Larry's clothes are very wrinkled.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, she just takes off on me. No warning. No explanation. Just this message on the machine, "I'm leaving you. Take the clothes out of the dryer." I mean, what'd I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Larry smacks the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't get it. She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's been acting weird lately, though. I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication". Like I don't know how to communicate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's face it. Sooner or later we all die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat, Larry stops the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's dying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your great aunt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What great aunt?

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD IN TUSCANY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're walking again, both holding thumbs out now. And their prayers are answered. A bright red FERRARI comes screeching to a halt about ten feet in front of them. They exchange a look. Faith dashes towards it. Peers in the window, converses with the driver a moment, then waves Kate over.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(lugging the suitcase)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really think this is safe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
An interior shot of the car reveals a NUN behind the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd say so...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Kate takes a look inside,
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, the Catholic Church is even richer than I thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She climbs in, and the car PEELS OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREETS OF ROME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ferrari zips into the Eternal City. A wonderland of color and history.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Baroque fountains spout cool, clear water; kids play soccer in the ruins; lovers kiss in secluded corners; elegantly stylish men and women sip espresso in sidewalk cafes, engaged in conversations, flirtations, negotiations. All the world's a stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They screech to an abrupt halt directly in front of,
</DIRECTION>
<SISTER_MARGHERITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ai Monasteri.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER_MARGHERITA>
<DIRECTION>
They get out and are still thanking her profusely, standing at the side of the car with suitcase in hand, when there is a whisper from behind,
</DIRECTION>
<O_S>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you believe in love at first sight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_S>
<DIRECTION>
Faith freezes. Gazes heavenward.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(like an oath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
She turns. To discover that God is a practical joker. The guy is talking to Kate. Slicked back hair, ponytail, a lot of leather. He looks awfully young.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<YOUNG_ITALIAN_STUD>
<DIRECTION>
(good-naturedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, I saw your ring. This is no problem. I only want for us to be friends.

</YOUNG_ITALIAN_STUD>
<DIRECTION>
Uh huh.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_ITALIAN_STUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am Giovanni.

He kisses Kate's hand.

<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(in spite of herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kate.

</KATE>
<GIOVANNI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIOVANNI>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Well, I don't know. Well, maybe. Later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<GIOVANNI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is your most lucky day. My family runs a pension not three blocks from here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIOVANNI>
<DIRECTION>
What a coincidence. She looks at Faith. In spite of herself, she's a little charmed, flattered by him. As they continue up the steps,
</DIRECTION>
<GIOVANNI>
<DIRECTION>
(suggestively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wait here for you.

INT. AI MONASTERI - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, a hushed environment, reminiscent of a monastery. The store sells liqueurs, etc. made by monks. Faith approaches the counter, behind which one of those inordinately fashionable Italian WOMEN is positioned.
</DIRECTION>

Overjoyed, Faith extends a hand.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your brother. Fratello tuo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Right. Si. My fratello. And, I was thinking that maybe someone here, well, you, might know him. His name is Damon Bradley?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
The woman's eyes narrow.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damon Bradley.

(more thrilled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. You do know him?

Anna slams her espresso down on the counter.

</ANNA>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me?

</FAITH>

She starts ranting in Italian. Faith pulls out her dictionary and starts flipping frantically through it. Kate comes over with a handful of little bottles.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you say to her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(still flipping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's she saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Faith shoots her a look.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute--
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate rushes to the door,
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Giovanni...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
He comes running. Kate hustles him inside and over to Faith.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(to him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is. Can you tell us what she's saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<GIOVANNI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's saying he's a-- a--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(snapping his

	<DIALOGUE>
	fingers, he can't

think of the word)

	<DIALOGUE>
	porco.

	<DIALOGUE>
	A porco?

<GIOVANNI>

(then suddenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A pig! A pig!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Faith, apologetic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's saying he's a pig.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIOVANNI>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's starting to throw things.
</DIRECTION>
<GIOVANNI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A very large pig.

<GIOVANNI>

</GIOVANNI>

She screams for about a minute. He turns to Faith.
</DIRECTION>
<GIOVANNI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIOVANNI>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ask her if she knows how I might reach him? If she has a telephone number?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<GIOVANNI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha un numero di telefono?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIOVANNI>
<DIRECTION>
She yells some more.
</DIRECTION>
<GIOVANNI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She did, but she...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIOVANNI>
<DIRECTION>
She rips a napkin into shreds.
</DIRECTION>
<GIOVANNI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...misplaced it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIOVANNI>
<DIRECTION>
More yelling.
</DIRECTION>
<GIOVANNI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He thinks she's going to meet him at Mezzaluna tonight, but she--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIOVANNI>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HAH!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
She hits her inner elbow with the edge of her other hand, in the Italian version of the finger.
</DIRECTION>
<GIOVANNI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...has a prior commitment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIOVANNI>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's mezzaluna?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<GIOVANNI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A restaurant. In Piazza Navona.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIOVANNI>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(ecstatic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it. That's it. That's all I need to know.

(to her and Giovanni)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bless you, thank you, thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
The PROPRIETOR rushes in from the back of the store, makes her apologize to the nice customers.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(grudgingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<PROPRIETOR>
<DIRECTION>
(that's better)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cosi va bene.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROPRIETOR>
<DIRECTION>
As Faith heads toward the door, she yells after her,
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry your brother is a pig!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(with the bottles)

<DIRECTION>
EXT. AI MONASTERI - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they emerge from the shop and head down the stairs, Kate is looking skeptical.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All that proves is that she wasn't the woman who was meant for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Faith throws her arms around her in celebration, dancing in the street.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now we know where he's gonna be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PENSION - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON a sign, "PENSIONE DIVINO AMORE". Giovanni is helping them carry their things into the hotel. He leads them to their room, opens the door. Faith enters. As Kate follows, he momentarily pulls her aside,
</DIRECTION>
<GIOVANNI>
<DIRECTION>
(apologetically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must leave town for two days. Was unavoidable. But, day after tomorrow,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with import)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I return...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIOVANNI>
<DIRECTION>
He places the key in her hand. Holding his own there longer than necessary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENSIONE ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faith is in the shower. Kate's got an Italian smorgasbord arrayed before her. Is browsing "How to Make a Man, etc.".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PENSION - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're on their way out the door, dressed to the nines. As Kate turns their key in to the desk, Giovanni whispers in her ear,
</DIRECTION>
<GIOVANNI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forty-eight hours...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIOVANNI>
<DIRECTION>
Nods meaningfully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PIAZZA NAVONA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They emerge from a cab into a dreamlike landscape, illuminated by the lights Bernini's Fountain of the Four Rivers and the strolling FIRE-EATERS performing in the piazza. Everything seems to be moving in slow motion.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(wringing her hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, I hate blind dates. Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself. Smile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Faith smiles. And they enter the restaurant -- a sea of frescoes, flowers, crystal and silver, all awash in candlelight. "Some Enchanted Evening..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From Faith's POV we see various and sundry men acknowledge or appear oblivious to her expectant face. A smile here, a glance there. He could be any of them. Or none of them.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(through her smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
They take a seat at the bar. Unbeknownst to them, an extremely handsome MAN at a table on the terrace is eying them intently.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you going to ask the maitre'd if he's here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
It's all come down to this. A whole lifetime of waiting, searching, hoping...
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly chicken)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN from the terrace is getting up. Is coming their way. Kate elbows her. "Some Enchanted Eeeevening"...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(sotto)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a god.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<ADONIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, I hope you don't think I'm being too forward. I'm here waiting for a friend, but I couldn't help noticing the two of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADONIS>
<DIRECTION>
Faith is giddily kicking Kate under the table, but no words are coming out. Kate steps in.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We noticed you, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
It's really happening.
</DIRECTION>
<ADONIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was wondering if you might be persuaded to join me--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADONIS>
<DIRECTION>
It really is...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(getting up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'd love to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<ADONIS>
<DIRECTION>
(extending a hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. I'm Guiseppe Romano.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADONIS>
<DIRECTION>
Faith's face falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're back at the bar by themselves.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's in a name? I wanna join him. I don't see why we can't join him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you. If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy. I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Kate glances back over at him. Waves.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Faith)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I'm the one who's single.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(sulking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never even got to be single.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure you did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay. You join him. But first will you ask if he's here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
We watch from a distance as Kate gets up and approaches the MAITRE'D. He gestures towards a booth on the other side of the room. She thanks him and makes a beeline back to the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's heeeeeerrre...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(nervously looking around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God. Where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us. He's wearing a navy jacket. If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(not moving a muscle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he looking at us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing over her shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Faith tries to peek around without being too obvious. And slips off her bar stool, almost knocking over the drink of the person next to her. She grabs it, awkwardly climbs back onto the stool. Then pulls out a compact and checks out the view.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(like she's twelve)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oooooo, I can see his sleeve...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I should just go over and introduce myself, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Kate nods. Faith puts the mirror away. Starts to get up.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(sitting back down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who do I say I am?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moments later. Having gotten her story straight. She gets up again.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, right... Okay..
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly seized with self-doubt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith. So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe. At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Okay... It's meant to be right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a deep breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
She straightens her skirt. Starts to walk toward him again, when,
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith--
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(turning anxiously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Faith smiles gratefully back at her. Kate motions, "go on"... Then turns back towards Guiseppe. Faith collects herself. A woman with a mission. Begins striding purposefully towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Focused only on that special arm as, with each step, a little more of it comes into view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only a few more feet. There is nothing between her and him now but that WAITER with the enormous tray of pasta coming from the other direction. But, alas... In a collision worthy of inclusion in the "agony of defeat", the tray and all its contents go sliding down over her. All eyes turn her way, and she stands there, paralyzed in an agonizing moment of dead silence. Then, with an anguished howl, she dashes to the ladies room. Kate gets up and goes rushing in after her. And, back out in the restaurant, a pair of feet get up and step gingerly over the remains of somebody's angel hair pasta.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seconds later, with an enormous wet orange spot on her dress, Faith bursts out of the ladies room. And discovers he's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The women bolt out the door, just in time to glimpse a man in a navy jacket disappear down the subway stairs in the distance. In hot pursuit, Faith flings off her heels and sends them flying. One of them BONKS a PASSER-BY, another MAN clad in a white shirt and carrying a navy jacket, on the head. We may get only a brief look at this guy, but it's enough to establish that while he may not be drop-dead gorgeous, any woman with any sense wouldn't kick him out of bed for munching saltines either. There's an undeniable warmth in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Faith doesn't see him at all, because as he bends down to pick up her shoe, he disappears from sight in the crowd, and she races madly past him. Down the subway stairs, into the tunnel-- and into a mob.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She battles her way through the throng, hopping up and down to try to get an overview, but there is no sign of him. She dashes from car to car, pounding on windows, calling out his name. Until, in a sudden whoosh, the doors close, and the train speeds off into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But she's still running after it. Desperately. Until it finally vanishes around a corner, out of sight. And she sinks to the ground, arms outstretched in the darkness... in vain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:

The two of them are wandering the piazza. Faith puts the shoe back on and, with one bare foot, limps over to a table. Her dress is stained, her nylons are run, a few stray noodles still cling to her hair. Basically, she's a disaster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they sit down,
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(not hearing this)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, here's what I think. We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(not believing this)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then what, Faith?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Simple as that. Kate just stares at her, dumbfounded.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?... My hair?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
When,
</DIRECTION>
<O_S>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like the style. I just don't think this color works for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_S>
<DIRECTION>
They look up. It's the STRANGER in white with her other shoe in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reaching for it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DAMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Allow me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON>
<DIRECTION>
He kneels down and places the shoe on her foot. Then gazes up into her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks very much.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(back to Kate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Kate looks at him. Kind of charmed.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was really sweet...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I meant about my idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's time we got some professional help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like a detective.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... Like a psychiatrist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(looking around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be silly. How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
He's still kneeling there.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(to him again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Now go away. He sits down at a table nearby. Stares over at Faith. She spots an Italian policeman, or CARABINIERE, standing at the edge of the piazza.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna go see what I can find out about speaker rental.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
She gets up, the STRANGER gets up, as if to follow. She looks at him like he's nuts.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Steps around him to head toward the cop. He sits back down.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMON>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what's the story with your friend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(watching her in amazement)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My friend has lost her fucking mind...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DAMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's she doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON>
<DIRECTION>
Kate turns to him,
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DAMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, really. What's she doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really. She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DAMON>
<DIRECTION>
(still not believing her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seriously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON>
<DIRECTION>
Kate just looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Well, what's wrong with that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON>
<DIRECTION>
He gazes over at her, gesticulating wildly in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only... if she's never met this guy, what makes her think he's perfect for her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON>
<DIRECTION>
Kate just shakes her head. Don't ask.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were they pen pals?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DAMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DAMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON>
<DIRECTION>
An exasperated sigh.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She got his name off a Ouija board when she was eleven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She holds out her palms. What can I tell you?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Then,
</DIRECTION>
<DAMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is his name?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON>
<DIRECTION>
Faith comes trudging back, in tears.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said it would take at least six months to get a permit for a loudspeaker. And, you have to get the Pope to approve it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Defeated, she picks up her purse.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's just go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Kate puts her arm around her and they start walking. The STRANGER grabs his jacket off the back of his chair. Tags after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMON>
<DIRECTION>
(anxiously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you be staying in Rome long?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't respond.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your friend said you were looking for someone?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(at her side)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I can help you track him down. I speak a little Italian. And I have a friend who works at the embassy. Maybe we could--
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON>
<DIRECTION>
She's trying to wave down a TAXI.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, but I really don't want any help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DAMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's his name? I'll look into it for you. I could give you a call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON>
<DIRECTION>
A CAB slows to a stop in front of them.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I appreciate the offer, but--
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches for the door. He's standing in the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just tell me his name...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON>
<DIRECTION>
She blows her nose noisily.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(to get rid of him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damon Bradley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMON>
<DIRECTION>
(stunned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, that's-- I'm Damon Bradley...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON>
<DIRECTION>
Still wiping her nose, she notices the jacket in his hands, then looks up into his eyes. The wind rustles through the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
He nods. Amazed.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you're the biggest mess I've ever seen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches for her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I find that very attractive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
And she faints. Dead away.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Having regained consciousness, Faith is across a candlelit table from him. They're engrossed in conversation. In each others' eyes. Tables around them have all emptied. A waiter in the background is trying to prop his eyes open.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMON_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Coming so close and yet just missing each other. Do you know what I mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON_S_MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
Does she know what he means...
</DIRECTION>
<DAMON_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that. About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them. And the last line of it goes, "Who knows? Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
	</DIALOGUE>

DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE. To the Beatles' "I Will"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PENSION DIVINO AMORE - Faith hops out Damon's car. He waits. She dashes inside, practically skipping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moments later, having changed clothes, floats back out and they take off again. Up above, Kate watches wistfully out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DRY CLEANERS - Dwayne is there trying to pick up his stuff. The CLERK is holding out a ticket. "You have to have one of these."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FORUM - The sun is coming up over the ruins. Faith and Damon stroll through them. Damon pulls out a "doggie bag". Sets down a little container of pasta for the wild cats that roam Rome.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McDONALDS - Rome's golden arches. Kate is munching on a Big Mac, and working on a postcard: "Dear Larry,". Somebody cruises by her table, snakes out a hand, reaching for her purse. Without so much as an upward glance, she flicks out a leg and trips him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMPO DEI FIORI MARKET - The enormous outdoor market where everything from orchids, to watermelon, to live eels and octopus are in abundant display. Damon buys Faith a gardenia. She puts it in her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GIOLITTI - A gelateria. Kate's eating ice cream. Still working on the postcard: "Dear Larry". Nothing more. Finally crumples it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SPANISH STEPS - Faith and Damon are sitting on the edge of the steps watching the street show that is Rome, when a LOCAL approaches with a Polaroid. Selling pictures. They pose.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DAMON_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your hair... is perfect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON_S_MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
He leans in and kisses her. And from this angle, except for the clothes, they look an awful lot like Rodin's version, as the FRAME FREEZES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on the photo. She looks up from it.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?

</FAITH>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no.

	Do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
He takes her hand. Both a little unnerved, they walk. Until,
</DIRECTION>
<DAMON_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But... just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON_S_MOTHER>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Good idea. You first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me first? Alright, well,

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something embarrassing, right? Something we don't want to admit in public.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
She nods. He thinks a moment. Then,
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(sheepish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a liberal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him with amazement.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a liberal!

EXT. VIA MARGUTTA - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lantern-lit street of 18th century facades. A faint breeze stirs the trees above. Strains of opera float out a window. Faith is looking around. Finally, though they're not overlooking anything,
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. This is a really pretty view.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMON_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON_S_MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
He leads her out to the center of the street. Tilts his head back. She follows and they walk, with their necks craned back, like two drunken sailors, like two kids.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMON_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON_S_MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
And up above, in the houses and apartments lining either side of the street, visible through the unshuttered windows, are gilded ceilings and candlelit vaults of angels. And beyond those, the star-studded, indigo summer sky.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all a matter of how you look at it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENSION BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate's down at the bar, talking to the Italian BARTENDER.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you're saying you think I should call him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
He draws a beer.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is your husband, no?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but... He was having an affair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Si.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
So what? He picks up a napkin and sets the glass down on it.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The point is, he was sleeping with another woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
How much clearer can she make it?
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were having sex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, it dawns on him.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding gravely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was your sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, she wasn't my sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head in sympathy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mother.

</BARTENDER>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
(another stab)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your grandmother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Big deal. He rolls his eyes and dismisses it with a wave of his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, how much longer 'til Giovanni gets back?

</KATE>

EXT. THE TREVI FOUNTAIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's all lit up. And deserted at this late hour. The water glows, ethereal blue. They sit at the edge, bare feet dangling in. Damon picks up one of her shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMON_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'll have it bronzed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON_S_MOTHER>

She smiles. Then sobers.

<DAMON_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON_S_MOTHER>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember. With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun... And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.

</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
He takes her face in his hands. Solemnly, almost mystically, kisses her eyes... her mouth...

Until,

	There is one other thing you should know about me.

She gets up. Heavy with guilt.

affair)

	It just happened. I didn't plan it. I was alone. And he was... there. But now everything's changed. I owe it to him to let him know. I need to tell him.

</FAITH>
<DAMON_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're sure...

	Let's find a telephone.

<DAMON_S_MOTHER>

	Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too.

She pauses,
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

He looks at her worriedly.

He takes a deep breath.

<DAMON_S_MOTHER>

	Okay. Okay, the thing is... I'm not exactly... I mean-- only in the most literal sense-- I'm not Damon Bradley.

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, am I glad that's over with.

</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
She's frozen. He's noticing this. Until she extricates herself from his arms.

She shoots him a look. Starts putting on her shoes.

	Everything else is true. I swear. I am a liberal. I do live in Boston. I am a zoologist. I did see "Local Hero" fifteen times. I am single. I don't believe in Scientology and I don't smoke. But, okay, I admit it, mea culpa, I lied about one little thing.

She runs out to the street. Starts waving for a cab.

	You've never lied?

Beat.

<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not the point.

</FAITH>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said whatever it was you would understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was before I found out what it was.

</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
A taxi approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're leaving?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
No response.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait-- Let's put this in perspective. You're going to let a few little letters keep us apart?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
No response. The cab stops.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(grasping at straws)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, if the name's that much of a problem, why don't you just call me that? It'll be my nickname.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the taxi door.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(on the brink of tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could you do this to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(innocently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm in love with you.

</PETER>
<FAITH>

	Oh, come on... What kind of an excuse is that?

And this time, the door SLAMS in his face.

EXT. PENSION LOBBY - NIGHT

The cab pulls up. Faith gets out, drags into the hotel, looking shell-shocked. From the bar, Kate spots her and rushes over.
</DIRECTION>

DISSOLVE TO:

<DIRECTION>
INT. PENSION BAR - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Faith are both at the bar, staring off into the distance. Getting bombed.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Sociopaths. They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(tearfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But how could he know? He only just met me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Men have ways.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a drag. You finally meet the man of your dreams and he turns out to be a pathological liar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Faith wails.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PETER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's on the telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still busy? Okay, can I leave another message, please?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, the message is, would she rather have the wrong guy with the right name or the right guy with the wrong name?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No-- no, no. They alternate, see? It's the wrong guy--

</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENSION ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE on the receiver, off the hook. Faith is in bed, wide awake, staring mournfully up at the ceiling.

DISSOLVE TO:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. PENSION ROOM - THE FOLLOWING MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate is on her way out the door. She opens it-- to find Peter outside in the hallway, carrying a bouquet of flowers the size of a refrigerator.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(moving past her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to talk to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's not here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She went out to check into skywriting. I can't believe you lied. Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! That's not fair. That's not it at all. Look, something somewhere got screwed up. Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed. I may not have the right name, but I was there. I'm the guy. I'm-- skywriting??
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
She eyes him skeptically.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't think this would be a problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts pacing.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was an emergency. I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her. I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good strategy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome? My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles. The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three? So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either. I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out. So I was wandering around. Just wandering... When I got hit in the head with this shoe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
He gazes out at the Roman skyline,
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then I saw her. And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light. And life and passion and yearning. And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mania.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever. And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever. And He did. She told me the name. Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to Kate.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(touched)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's really romantic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She places a consoling hand on his shoulder,
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad she hates your guts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Starts leading him toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just a name for chrissakes. The whole thing is so ludicrous. For all she knows, this guy could be the biggest loser on the face of the planet. He could have a criminal record.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(throwing up his hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He could think Ronald Reagan was a great president.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
Kate shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(flatly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten billion to one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a KNOCK at the door. She opens it. It's Giovanni -- with a single rose.
</DIRECTION>
<GIOVANNI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess who-oooo...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIOVANNI>
<DIRECTION>
He sees Peter and the other flowers.
</DIRECTION>
<GIOVANNI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIOVANNI>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.

	Oh, hello.

<DIRECTION>
(to Kate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIOVANNI>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd love to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She heads for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(pleading eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. You've got to help me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
She considers him.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see what I can do.

</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COCKPIT OF A TEENY TINY PLANE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faith is strapped into the passenger seat of a miniscule two-seater. White-knuckled. Staring wide-eyed out the window at a faint trail of vapor.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(over the roar of the engine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure people are gonna be able to read this?...

</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
The pilot nods. The plane goes into a dive. Faith's eyes roll back in her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PENSION TERRACE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Giovanni are at a table, overlooking the domes of the city, bathed in the honeyed late afternoon light. Giovanni's pointing out the sights. A plane buzzes overhead. Kate looks up. Some faint gibberish is being scattered to the wind. She shakes her head. Giovanni takes her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(a little nervously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you have to be getting back to work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes sparkle.
</DIRECTION>
<GIOVANNI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's siesta.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIOVANNI>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<GIOVANNI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, in America they care for work, they live to work. But in Italy, they care for food, for love, for pleasure...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIOVANNI>
<DIRECTION>
His lips graze her wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How old are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<GIOVANNI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do the years matter? I've known you for centuries...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIOVANNI>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENSION LOBBY - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faith enters. Her hair looking like she stuck her finger in a light socket. She's handed an enormous stack of messages. Peter, Peter, Peter, etc. There are a lot of cross-outs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She forces herself to drop them into the trash on her way up the stairs. Then opens her door and sees the flowers. She fingers one, momentarily softening, then turns resolute. She pulls her suitcase from beneath the bed and is unzipping it when Kate enters, grinning from ear to ear.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi-iii...

</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. Where've you been?

(sobering as she realizes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you doing?

</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Packing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning. This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you've had a little bad luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little bad luck?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, a lot of bad luck. But that means the odds are probably in your favor now. This is no time to give up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Faith smiles wanly. Starts pulling stuff out of drawers.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place? Children are very impressionable, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're just quitting? Just like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>

Faith pauses.

	I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.

	Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be. I've got forty-eight hours. I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Peter?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peter? Peter was a mistake. An imposter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>

	The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.

	I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.

</KATE>

There's a tap at the door. Giovanni pokes his head in.
</DIRECTION>
<GIOVANNI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ready, Kate? Oh, hi, Faith. Did you do something different to your hair?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIOVANNI>
<DIRECTION>
Kate shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He promised to take me on a tour of the fountains...

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I don't have to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>

Faith looks at the two of them. Realizing.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No, you go ahead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure you'll be okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>

	I'm sure. And Kate, thank you for coming. Thank you for being such a good friend.

Faith's eyes drift to the window.

Click.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREETS OF ROME - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faith is taking the same walk that was so magical the night before. But it's not the same. She takes a few steps, tilts her head back, and-- trips. She's holding her foot in pain when,
</DIRECTION>
<O_S>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kate told me you were going home. Is that true?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_S>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up, sees Peter. Turns around and starts limping briskly back towards her hotel.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(tagging after her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
No response.

<PETER>

(realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're limping.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<FAITH>

No response.

</PETER>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it's any of your business, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?! To be married, I suppose.

</PETER>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</FAITH>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To the foot doctor.

He stops in front of her. Looks her straight in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(stepping around him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(dismissingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's safe.

	Does he love you?

</PETER>
<FAITH>

	He wants to marry me, doesn't he?

	You didn't answer my question.

(exasperated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you asking me this?

</FAITH>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way. Does he know who you are?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
He touches her arm. She pulls it away.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(utterly serious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a podiatrist. Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong. Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
She rolls her eyes, continues limping.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?... Just tell me what it is, I'll say it. I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(softening, she stops)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking. We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it wasn't real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that wasn't a lie. That was...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(almost more to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	a mirage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him. Then, softly, sadly,
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you see?.. We're not the ones who are meant to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(earnestly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I don't have the right name?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
She starts walking again.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going home. I never should've come here in the first place and I'm going home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
He calls after her.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. Okay. Forget me. Leave me out of it. But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(she turns)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who says I don't love him?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see. Well then, go home. Get married. I hope you'll be very happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
And he walks quickly away, disappearing into the shadows. She starts to call after him, but he's already gone.

EXT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peter's helping her bring her things back inside.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(out of breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel. So, I called there, they said he left yesterday. But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route. He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano. I called. And they told me he's checked in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Positano?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's in the south. I've still got my rental car. I can get you there by morning...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I know there's no going back for us. That's not it. I just want to make this up to you. Clear my relationship karma. And I know the area, I've got some cousins down there. Please. Let me do this for you. Let this be my gift to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
She searches his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because-- I want you to be happy.

INT. DWAYNE'S APARTMENT - DAY

The answering machine is recording Faith's message.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dwayne, you're still not there?... I was really hoping we could talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted to tell you she's made an unexpected recovery, but she's a little confused and she needs me to stay here one more day. Just to be sure.

</DAMON>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate's in the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peter found him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Isn't that amazing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Kate looks over at him. He shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amazing...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's down in someplace called Positano. Peter says we can make it there by morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
As they head out the door, Peter turns quietly to Kate,
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(relishing this)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's travelling with his mother...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They speed down darkened the highway, Faith and Peter in the front seat, Kate and Giovanni in the back. The wind in their hair.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(to herself, encouraged)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He likes to read...
	</DIALOGUE>

(to him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he mention anyone in particular?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, I'd rather not say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>

<DIRECTION>
(a little unnerved)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mickey Spillane?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or Hustler.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
The car shoots down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AMALFI COAST - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They drive past sheer cliffs dropping off to silvery rocks, azure seas, transparent depths. Around hairpin turns skirting the Gulf of Salerno, before finally winding into the impossibly beautiful seaside town of Positano. An enchanted land of steep hillsides overgrown with lemon trees, jasmine, bouganvilla... cliff hanging villas... emerald and sapphire grottoes... cerulean skies... heaven on earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LE SIRENUSE HOTEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another "Lifestyles" hotel. An elegant old villa perched above the village and the deep blue sea. The four of them head for the desk, where Kate cheerfully plunks down Larry's credit card.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joan Collins stayed here.

<CONCIERGE>

	Si. A la piscina.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONCIERGE>
<DIRECTION>
He gestures towards the terrace.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's out by the pool right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(nervously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, and I forgot to tell you. He's here with his mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
She checks her hair, starts adjusting it in the reflection of a window. Then peeks around the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON a MAN reclining on a lounge chair. We start at the feet which don't quite reach the end of the chair. Move up the legs, past the pot belly, to, sure enough, an enormous gold medallion resting on his chest. A fringe of hair skirts the perimeter of his head -- and his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A copy of Mickey Spillane's latest rests on a table next to him. He's lying back, eyes closed. This is Damon Bradley. This is Him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peter smiles broadly. Faith's face falls.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's him?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Faith elbows her.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(eating this up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(not particularly anxious to)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want me to do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a good look. Swallows hard. Reluctantly approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't look up. She stands awkwardly over him, looking back at Kate for support.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-hem, excuse me, hello...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
He cracks one eye, squints up at her.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_AT_POOL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're in my sun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_AT_POOL>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(hopping out of the way)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
He closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon me, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
He squints up again.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_AT_POOL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_AT_POOL>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(like an idiot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have the time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
He eyeballs her like she's some sort of curious life form.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_AT_POOL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I look like I'm wearing a watch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_AT_POOL>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I guess not. I just thought maybe--
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
When someone at the edge of the pool calls out,
</DIRECTION>
<O_S>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Damon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_S>
<DIRECTION>
But the person she's talking to doesn't respond. Instead, somebody else, another MAN who'd been doing laps in the pool, emerges.
</DIRECTION>
<HIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HIM>
<DIRECTION>
This is no ordinary mortal, this is a living monument to mankind. He could've modeled for Michelangelo. Mel Gibson feels like Jo-Jo-the-Dog-Faced-Boy next to this guy. The guys in the Calvin Klein ads-- okay, let's say he looks like one of those guys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate's eyes shift to Peter, who suddenly sobers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back at the pool, a LITTLE KID is talking to Damon.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for letting me borrow this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
The kid sets the Spillane tome back on his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<HIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HIM>
<DIRECTION>
He gets out and starts toweling off, a halo of sunlight glistening off his tanned, muscular body; reflecting in the deep green pools of his eyes. She grabs hold of a nearby chair as her knees start to give way.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(barely audible)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're Damon Bradley?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<HIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HIM>
<DIRECTION>
Oh. My. Goddd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's now or never. She takes a deep breath. Lets it out.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
It's never. She goes running back inside.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatareyoudoing?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>

(spinelessly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if he doesn't like me?

</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.

</KATE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God... you're right.

</FAITH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, I'm kidding.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stopping her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this how you plan to get what you want from life? When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She gazes fearfully back out to the terrace.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, if she doesn't wanna meet him, she doesn't wanna meet him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
Kate glares at him. Takes Faith by the shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have overcome everything it took to get here. Every obstacle to reach this moment. This fateful moment. Now, it's in your hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She points toward the terrace.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Is this a trick question?
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then go get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POOL - MOMENTS LATER

He's picking up his things.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Just since yesterday.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, we just got here... I mean, I just got here. I'm single.

He looks at her. Uh huh.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(chickening out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'll probably be seeing you around, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>

She starts to skulk away.
</DIRECTION>
<HIM>
<DIRECTION>
(politely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope so.

<DIRECTION>
She pauses, turns,

<FAITH>

	</DIALOGUE>
</HIM>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you be willing to have dinner with me?

A slow smile creeps across his lips. Why not?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.

</HIM>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(somehow maintaining)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You would? Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
He nods.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Okay, how about I meet you at the restaurant at the base of the stairs at, say, 8:30?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
A smile that would melt Nome in January,
</DIRECTION>
<HIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll look forward to it.

<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(backing away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Good. See you then, then.

She's about to trip over a chaise lounge.
</DIRECTION>

<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HIM>
<DIRECTION>
He takes her hand. Kisses it. Peter rolls his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns around and dashes back inside. We hear an ear-splitting SHRIEK of excitement come from inside the hotel. Damon smiles to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POSITANO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The jet-setters have Sardinia, this is a resort with bohemian roots and small town charm. A barber sets his chair in the street outside his shop. A workman is polishing the bronze mermaid out in front of "Siren Travel".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Two Gentlemen from Verona" is being performed at the community theatre. Housewives open shutters, shopkeepers sweep storefronts of fruit stands, pottery and linen shops. Men carry armloads of flowers, boxes of lemons and gleaming fish to market. Children play at the edge of the sea. Mayberry in Italy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Giovanni are down at the beach, frolicking in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Faith is strolling through town, floating on air. She spots a dress in a clothing store window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLOTHING SHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faith emerges from a dressing room in something summery and flowing. She looks beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ROOM - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A jar of green goo. Faith's plastering one of those green clay masks to her face. Her dress is hanging on the door. She's got rollers in her hair. She and Kate are getting ready for dinner.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you see his eyes? I've never seen eyes that green. And he was so nice. Did you see how nice he was? He was really nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
There's a KNOCK at the door. She freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you were meeting him there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Panicking, Faith dashes to the bathroom, starts frantically rinsing off the mask.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Kate opens the door. It's Peter.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, it's you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Faith)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's only Peter.

</KATE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry...

Relieved, Faith steps out from behind the bathroom door, still wiping green stuff off her face.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Peter.

</FAITH>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>

</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
An awkward beat.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
He does.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. You found him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You found him. I don't know how to thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
He shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it looks like we both lucked out. I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(a little surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. That's nice.

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she's a knock-out, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, good. Good for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, that's why I came by. I need to fix this button. Do you have a needle and thread?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
This is pretty transparent, but she politely plays along. As she starts looking through her stuff, he starts idly fingering their toiletries. Smells her perfume, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you're going to dinner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
She nods.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going? Just-- out of curiosity...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs. Nothing fancy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him the needle and thread.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(really trying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, have a good time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(heartfelt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
As he exits,
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey--
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice dress.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(gracious and indebted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Peter. Thank you so much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
He nods and leaves. She looks at Kate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faith emerges from her room and starts down the steep hillside stairs that lead to the village. Lights along the shore are beginning to glitter; a warm breeze flows in like silk. It's the sort of moment and sort of place where all dreams seem within reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down below she can see him waiting for her outside the restaurant door. She pauses a moment to take it all in. He looks up and sees her. Blows a kiss up to her. She practically swoons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she arrives at the foot of the stairs, he takes her hand,
</DIRECTION>
<HIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look like a goddess.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
INT. BUCA DI BACCO RESTAURANT - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A open-air place, overlooking the sea. Waves crash. Moonlight glistens on the water. Guitarists stroll by, singing sentimental Neopolitan ballads. It's all almost too good to be true. They're led to a table and he pulls out her chair. The perfect gentleman. A WAITER comes over to welcome them. Asks if they'd like a drink.
</DIRECTION>
<HIM>
<DIRECTION>
(to Faith)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wine?

They're still pondering their options when another COUPLE stroll in and are led to the table directly next to theirs. It's Peter and his date, FRANCESCA. And this time he was telling the truth. She's stunning. All suntanned legs and skintight spandex. Beaming, he pulls out her chair. Faith just stares at him. As he moves around the table to sit down, his eye catches hers.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Faith is packing. She picks up her "Let's Go Italy" guide, and the polaroid of her and Peter falls out. "The Kiss". She sighs. Tucks it back inside the book. She picks up her wallet, opens the coin purse, reaches in to pull out her ENGAGEMENT RING. As she does, something else falls to the floor. Dwayne's DRY CLEANING TICKET. She stares down at it. Then takes the ring, places it back in her wallet. And picks up the telephone.

She looks back down,

She hesitantly opens it. Inside is a college catalogue. A note: "Please turn to page 51". Puzzled, she opens it to page 51. The Sociology section.

She looks up. Tears in her eyes.

Faith is on her way back to her room. She passes the community playhouse where two teenage kids are up on ladders, suspending a banner across the stairs announcing a new play: "The Odyssey". One kid accidentally drops his end, and it goes fluttering down across her path. Faith stops to retrieve it and is handing it back up to him when she glances at the window where the eight-by-tens of the play's stars are being changed. The new star of the show is noneother than Damon Bradley. Only his name isn't Damon Bradley. It's LEONARD GILINSKY. She stares at the photo. And suddenly has trouble breathing.

	I can't believe you did that!

</PETER>
<FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(turning on him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sabotaged it? You're the one who lost him, remember?

	Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.

<PETER>

	As I recall, you were on your way home. And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.

Silence.

	Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here? We're talking about love, okay? Let's be rational.

	Rational?! Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(throwing up his hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I'm crazy. You have driven me crazy. No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you. Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up? How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?

<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, I'm flattered. What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very funny.

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real. Granted, ideally, me. I didn't do it to hurt you. I did it for you.

EXT. DRIVEWAY OF THE LE SIRENUSE HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

<DIRECTION>
Kate is yanking Larry into a taxi.

	What do you mean we have to stop her before she does something crazy?

EXT. AMALFI DRIVE - DAY

Faith goes screeching around a curve. A few beats later, the TAXI follows.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. STREETS OF ROME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faith speeds through the tangled web of Roman traffic. Kate and Larry in close pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROME AIRPORT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faith screeches to a halt in the passenger loading zone. Dashes inside. Scans the DEPARTURE SCREEN for a flight to BOSTON. Finds it: AMERICAN AIRLINES, GATE NUMBER 7, "ON TIME", at 5:00. She checks her watch. It's 4:57. She starts racing down the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aboard the plane, Peter is settling into his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRPORT CORRIDOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vending machine. SOMEBODY at it with his back to us pushes the Butterfinger button. The "SOLD OUT" light blinks on. A FIST starts banging on machine. Faith sprints by. Oblivious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GATE 7 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faith rushes to GATE #7. Slaps something down on the desk in front of the CLERK.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boarding pass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Blows past him. He sticks out an arm.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid you're too late, m'am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
She stops. Breathing hard. Uncomprehending. He looks at the pass.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this isn't for this airline, either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
Faith turns to the window to see the portable stairs once again being pulled away from the cabin door. Deja vu. She notices a side door. Only this time there are MEN with MACHINE GUNS standing guard directly outside it. This, after all, is Rome.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With her hands pressed plaintively against the glass, she watches as the plane taxis away from the gate toward the runway, to join the LINE-UP of other PLANES waiting for take-off clearance. This jet, which we'll call "Peter's" jet, is fifth in line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL ENTRANCE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Larry come barrelling in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRPORT GIFT SHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faith is buying one of those little portable Igloo ICE CHESTS. With an "I Italy" logo. And an enormous roll of MASKING TAPE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A JET takes off. Peter's jet moves up a notch. Three to go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GATE NUMBER 7 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON the ICE CHEST. With a lot of tape wrapped around it. And large lettering, "MEDICAL EMERGENCY" "DO NOT OPEN." And a little red cross. It looks pretty tacky.
</DIRECTION>
<O_S>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A heart transplant?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_S>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. She's been waiting a long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
The clerk picks up the ice chest, starts trying to examine it. Faith stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid I can't let you do that. Hearts are very fragile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Somebody else comes up. A SECURITY GUARD. He and the clerk start conversing Italian.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUT THE WINDOW --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faith sees another jet take off. Two to go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faith is anxiously looking from one authority to the to other, vainly trying to follow their conversation. Finally the guard turns to her,
</DIRECTION>
<CARABINIERE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARABINIERE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the cardiologist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
The Clerk eyes the ice chest suspiciously.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't have that with you before.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the guard,

chest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prima non l'aveva con se.

<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was late in arriving.

	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's here now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<CARABINIERE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have any I.D.?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARABINIERE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I've given you my credit card, my passport number. I've paid for the flight. Now, while you two sit here cross-examining me, someone's future is hanging in the balance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
OUT ON THE RUNWAY --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last jet in front of Peter's is given clearance. It races down the runway and disappears into the sky. And Peter's jet taxis into position. ENGINES REVVING furiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A whole flock of AIRPORT PERSONNEL are now conferring. A crowd of other ONLOOKERS have gathered. A few of them start mumbling opinions.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a heart, for godssakes. You guys are Italian. Don't you get it? It's the greatest gift one human being can give another. Are you telling me you're going to stand there and deny her the chance of a lifetime?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
A GUY in the crowd with a "Dianetics" book in one hand and a cigarette in the other, tosses in his two cents,

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm afraid we've got a temporary delay. We have a medical emergency and are going to have to head back to the gate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
Passengers groan. The engines wind down, and the plane taxis off the runway, back toward the terminal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUNWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The portable stairs are being wheeled back toward the cabin door. Faith is waiting inside. Triumphant. When,
</DIRECTION>
<LOUDSPEAKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damon Bradley. Signore Damon Bradley. E pregato di recarsi all'ufficio informazione.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUDSPEAKER>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, for just a fraction of a second, she hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUDSPEAKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damon Bradley. Mr. Damon Bradley, please meet your party at the information booth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUDSPEAKER>
<DIRECTION>
Then we see the decision has been made. Ice chest in hand, she strides confidently out the door toward the plane, without a backward glance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRPORT INFORMATION BOOTH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Larry are waiting there.
</DIRECTION>
<O_S>

Larry turns,

<DIRECTION>
It's the smoker with the "Dianetics" volume.
</DIRECTION>
<STRANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought that was you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he extends a hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damon Bradley. Remember me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGER>
<DIRECTION>
He calls to a woman nearby,

<DAMON_BRADLEY>

	Honey...

	<DIALOGUE>

INT. JET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faith walks up the steps and through the cabin door. She spots Peter seated about halfway back. But he doesn't see her. He's staring blankly out the window. She makes her way to the open seat next to him. He looks up. Does a double take.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I brought you something. Something I didn't want you to leave without.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
She sits down. Hands him the ice chest. Puzzled, he opens the cover. Inside is a little chocolate heart. He takes it out, looks at it.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was hoping for the real thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I brought you that, too.

He looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do know you're insane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love that in a woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
And the plane takes flight. As we,

<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
