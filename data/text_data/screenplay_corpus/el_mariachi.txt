EXT. A JAIL IN MEXICO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's an early Friday morning and a patrol car drives up an unpaved road and parks next to a gutted police car on cinder blocks. The camera pans with the OFFICER as he exits his car and walks up to a ramp leading to the babay blue JAIL HOUSE. He is carrying a greasy bag of fast food.
</DIRECTION>

INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Officer enters the lobby, tosses the bag of food to his PARTNER who is sitting at a desk. He grabs a tin cup and walks over to barred entrance to Block A. Twenty or so CRIMINALS, from drunks to drug dealers are sleeping peacefully in their cell on Block A. The Officer rattles the tin cup between the entrance bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAIL CELLS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The inmates stir, rubbing their dirty faces and trying to sit up. The camera dollies slowly down the narrow hallway of the block which has three cells: Two small ones side by side, and one bigger cell that faces the block entrance. The sound of scribbling and business dealing can be heard from inside the cell. It is AZUL jottin ginto a business ledger while chatting on his cellular phone. His cell is equipped with a small desk and a refridgerator. He hangs up the phone and continues writing.

EXT. EL MOCO'S RANCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gorgeous, bikini-clad BABE struts slowly into a tighly framed glamour shot. She pauses, takes a deep breath, then dives a 'perfect ten' dive into a house-side moat. She swims long, slow motion strokes around the moat as the camera tracks alonside her, lovingly admiring her tan lines and hydrodynamic build. She slides out of the water and walks up a cobble stone walk, dripping as she passes a seated GENTLEMAN in a white suit. His face is unrevealed. As she enters the house, he sets his drink down by a phone. He lifts up the receiver and dials.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAIL CELLS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Azul's phone rings. He looks up at it, startled, as if no one has ever called him before. He glances at his watch, and then back at the phone, hesitating to answer it. He looks around the cell block as if someone might be playing a trick on him. Finally he answers it, pausing before saying hello. It is El Moco.

	Yes, I figured you'd want your money, my friend. That is why I have called you. I heard you were getting out soon, and figured I should deal with our situation. But do you really need me to help you get out? From what I hear, you're running quite a business out of your cell with a phone and some loyal men. It keeps you well protected I hear. Not a bad idea. I may try that myself sometime.

The Tall Men walk steady and alert, ready to kill. They enter Azul's block and scope out the cells.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bodyguard, seeing the tall men, retrieves his shotgun from under his mattress and grabs his machete from under the sink. He stands ready to fight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Tall Men move slowly towards the big cell, somewhat cautious. They see the Bodyguard a second too late, for he sticks the shotgun between the bars, and shoots one of them before they can react. The shot one stumbles back into his buddy's arms. Azul's Bodyguard, amused by all this, opens his cell door effortlessly, and walks out as if to greet them. The Tall Men hear the sound of the other cells opening, so they turn around. The other prisoners on the block begin exiting their cells, carrying guns and Molotov cocktails. The Tall Man drops his gun. Finally, Azul exits his cell carrying his phone. The Bodyguard forces the Tall Men into an empty cell, closing and locking the door.

The Guards exchange glances when they hear the screaming, they smile and shrug, then go back to what they were doing. As Azul and his Bodyguards exit the block, the Guard with the magazine stands up as if to stop them, but Azul tosses him a wad of money and the guard sits back down to count it.

A blue truck races towards the jail.

Azul exits the jail carrying a shotgun. His Bodyguards get inside the Tall Men's truck and start it. Azul waits patiently for his blue truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the blue truck pulls up, two little rat-like VATOS exit the blue truck, one handing Azul a guitar case. Azul tosses it onto the hood. The Bodyguards wave as they drive away. Azul waves back. He opens the case, revealing an arsenal of weaponry. Azul notices one piece is missing. One Rat quickly pulls the missing weapon from his jacket and replaces it in the case. Azul is unamused. He grabs his MAC-10 machine gun from the guitar case and aims it at the thieving Rat's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the Guard bolts out the jail waving the wad of money, as if complaining.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Azul turns his MAC-10 onto the Guard instead. A few blasts later Azul and his rats pack up and go as the Guard twitches helplessly on the ground, still clutching the money in his bloody hand.

EXT. AZUL / MARIACHI ON HIGHWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blue truck barels down the highway and the camera pans with the truck as it passes a hitchhiker, MARIACHI, standing in the sun with a thumb in the air. The truck passes him up so he continues walking. Mariachi is carrying a guitar case in one hand and a black jacket in the other. He is wearing a white T-shirt, black pants. The camera pans to a sign that reads "ACUÑA 18 miles".
</DIRECTION>

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mariachi is walking around downtown Acuña. He notices a bar across the street and, liking the way it looks, he puts on his jacket and crosses over to it. He stops to read a sign on the building that says "MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS ONLY". He prays silently to himself before confidently walking inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORONA CLUB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mariachi enters the club, greeting the PATRONS as ge makes his way to the bar. No one seems to greet him back. He sits on a barstool near some OTHER DRINKERS, laying his guitar case down lovingly beneath his stool. He looks around the place, as if sizing it up.

Glancing around the room, Mariachi notices a small, table-shaped object draped with a cloth in one corner of the room.

</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
Mariachi gives him a silent "what" look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BARTENDER motions to a YOUNG MAN sitting near the small draped table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Young Man removes the drape revealing a keyboard. Puts on his mariachi hat, dips his fingers into his shot glass and rubs his fingers together (as if warming up for the big show). He hits a few switches in EXTREME CLOSEUP as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Mariachi adjusts himself to the seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Young Men gently taps one switch and the keyboard sounds like an accordion, pulsing out a beat. He then presses another switch and a horn section swells to a crescendo and waltzes the familiar riffs. He adds the string and horns accents by banging on the keys. He sounds awful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mariachi grimaces slightly then turns back to the Bartender who seems to enjoy it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Keyboard Mariachi finishes his song, sits back down.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding with satisfaction)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you see? Either I can pay one guy to sound like a full mariachi band...

</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
Mariachi picks up his guitar and lays some money next to his full drink. He looks disappointed.

Mariachi walks out and looks up and down the street. He decides to walk south.

</DIRECTION>
<AZUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bartender... one beer.

Azul is staring at the three Mean Dudes. They stare back.

<DIRECTION>
The Bartender slaps the unopened bottle down at the counter.
</DIRECTION>

<AZUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AZUL>
<DIRECTION>
Azul opens the case and pulls out the MAC-10. The other two Mean Dudes are already reaching for their pistols.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bartender ducks beneath the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Azul fires a million bullets into two of the Mean Dudes, (the other is holding the case in shock). Their chests explode, causing neat little dollops of flesh and blood fly everywhere. The Mean Dude holding the guitar case is frozen with fear. He manages to look up at Azul, who is watching the Mean Dudes die a slow, bloody death. The barrel of the MAC-10 is smoking. Azul turns slowly to the Mean Dude holding the case. Azul aims his MAC-10 in the Dude's face. Still frozen holding the case, he spends his last moments looking down the gun's barrel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shots caused Old Mean Dude to peer out from his stall as the toilet paper fell to the ground and started to roll across the floor. He now watches it roll as more shots ring out. He pulls up his pants and and walks toward the door slowly. He is sweating profusely. He slowly picks up the toilet paper, plotting his next move. It grows silent... He takes a deep breath and rushes out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORONA CLUB MAIN ROOM - DAY

The Old Dude bursts into the room with a roll of toilet paper in his hand, and a sheet of sweat sliding down his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bartender rises up from behind the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera dollies slowly by the dead Dudes. Their blood-bathed faces twisted into odd shapes and expressions. The camera continues to dolly to the one dead Dude still holding the guitar case. His face is a bloody pulp. The camera stops dollying to the old Dude's mixed drink. A hand is stirring it with a straw. The camera pans up the arm to reveal Azul, standing expressionless with his gun sling over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shot at 16fps the Old Dude quickly drops the toilet paper and runs back inside the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Azul turns to his guitar case and carefully chooses another weapon. He grabs the drink and tosses a napkin over his arm like a waiter, then casually follows the Old Dude into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bartenders glance at each other. One pours a shot glass full of tequila and raises it to his lips to drink it. Shots ring out and the Bartender spills the drink over himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without warning Azul bursts from the bathroom and walks calmly to his case. He replaces the weapon, picks up the case and leaves.
</DIRECTION>

Azul walks right up to the Bartender.

The Bartender shuts his eyes. The sound of the beer bottle popping open canbe heard, along with the sound of thirsty guzzling. The Bartender opens his eyes to Azul.

<DIRECTION>

He is about to walk off with the bloody towel and he turns back pointing at it. She waves her hand at him, as if granting him permission to take it. She cleans his glass, and when he is gone she slams the glass down and runs for the stairs. A few seconds later she comes back into the bar, grabs the gun from under the counter and calls her assistant to watch the bar. He sees the gun and wonders what she's up to. She storms upstairs.

Domino tunrs to a counter and her smile fades. She looks like she wants to rip Mariachi's throat out with her teeth. She puts the gun down on the counter. She finds an omnious-looking knife and then grabs a bottle of shampoo. She walks over to him, then pulls the knife up to his throat with one hand while grabbing his hair with the other.

She gets up slowly, and turns to leave. Mariachi settles back, smiling triumphantly. Suddenly she darts around and slams the knife between his legs again with a furious look on her face. He bolts up out of this triumphant daze with a look of complete shock. She loosens up and laughs.

She flings her knife aside. It sticks into a wall. She shrugs, smiles a beautiful smile, turns, and goes downstairs. Mariachi settles back down, closing his eyes.

Moco fires into Mariachi's left hand. Mariachi grimaces, crumbling to the floor. He keeps a tight grip on his hand. When he opens his hand to see the damage, the camera can see right through his hand for a reverse shot of his face through the hole.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Now get the hell off my property and take your hand with you!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOCO>
<DIRECTION>
Moco is laughing and looking at his men for support, but no one else laughs. Mariachi tries to stand, but he falls back. When he rises again he has the gun in his hand. He shoots Moco in the chest. Moco falls back and hits the ground hard. He gasps for air...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moco's men gather around him. Mean Dude #5 crouches down to check Moco's throat pulse. Moco's dead. Mean Dude #5 strikes a match across Moco's face and lights up a cigarette. He turns and walks away. The others follow.

Mariachi wraps a tourniquet on his arm, kisses Domino, opens Azul's case, sees the weapons, and rides off with it.

MARIACHI ON THE ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks back at the town behind him, then places his hand on the motorcycle to drive off. We notice the metal brace on his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mariachi rides into the sunset road. He speeds pas a sign: "ACUÑA 18 miles"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Coming soon EL MARIACHI II"

<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT

THE END
