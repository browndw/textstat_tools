INT. ZITO'S BREAD STORY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several dozen loaves of golden Italian bread are standing on end in a shaft of morning sunlight. They are standing on end in bins. In the window, ZITO'S can be read in reverse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We leave the loaves and DRIFT DOWN TO a Progresso Products calendar, which hangs from the wall by a nail. The month is November. Various phone numbers and delivery dates have been penned in in a rough scrawl. Now WE GO TO a white formica counter, scuffed and pocked from long use. On the counter, in a rinsed out olive jar filled with water, are three fat red roses. The TITLE APPEARS IN BLACK SCRIPT AGAINST THE WHITE BACKGROUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOONSTRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now WE FAINTLY HEAR THE VOICE of Zito himself, and a low TAPPING SOUND. SOME CREDITS ROLL.
</DIRECTION>
<ZITO_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(barely discernable)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three times they cancel the order with me, and three times they come back. Who they kidding? They cheap, cheap, cheap. The other bread they get is no good. They save pennies. Everybody complain and they come back. "Zito, your bread is the best." They're like children stupid in school who cannot learn. The water. It's the water. You buy bread in Hoboken, you get Hoboken water. Hoboken water is dry. Ask anybody who knows. Ask your father. He knows.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZITO_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
During Zito's plaintive words, WE LEAVE the roses and MOVE DOWN the counter TO a calculator being tapped very efficiently with the eraser end of pencil. When the results appear, the pencil notes the figure in a threadbare old ledger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOW WE SEE ZITO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's a middle-aged Italian man with a kind face. But it's early in the day, and he's already been working for hours, so he's a little tired and disgruntled.
</DIRECTION>
<ZITO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to make you some coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZITO>
<DIRECTION>
NOW WE SEE LORETTA FOR THE FIRST TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's entering a few final figures in the ledger. LORETTA is Italian, 37. Her hair black, done in a dated style, is flecked with grey. She's dressed in sensible but unfashionable clothes of a dark color.
</DIRECTION>
<LORETTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What d'you know about coffee? Gimme a loaf of bread.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORETTA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ZITO'S BREAD STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loretta emerges with her little weathered leather bookkeeping satchel and a loaf of Zito bread in a white paper bag. She moves off briskly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A.J. CONTI FUNERAL CHAPEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a little Italian funeral parlor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE "WAKE" ROOM"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A generic little room filled with many flowers and wreathes, many folding chairs, a few OLD PEOPLE sitting and, up front, the star of the show, the CORPSE on display in his gold and formica casket. Before the casket is a little kneeler. We discover an OLD LADY there, who crosses herself and rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes and sits by RUBY, another old women. She leans over and says.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He looks great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_WOMAN>
<RUBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That Al Conti is a genius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE OF THE FUNERAL PARLOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
First WE SEE a name plate on a desk. The plate reads ALFONSO CONTI. We HEAR his VOICE.
</DIRECTION>
<CONTI_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am a genius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONTI_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The SHOT WIDENS TO INCLUDE the loaf of bread which is half cut up and being buttered. Next to the bread are two steaming mugs of coffee. We HEAR the subdued TAPPING of Loretta's tabulations.
</DIRECTION>
<LORETTA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're such an artistic genius, why can't you keep track of your receipts? How am I going to do your income tax?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORETTA_S_VOICE>
<CONTI_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am an artistic genius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONTI_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The SHOT WIDENS and now we can see Al Conti and Loretta sitting at the desk having Zito's buttered bread and mugs of coffee. Loretta's got her calculator going and is entering figures in Al's black, gold-lettered ledger.
</DIRECTION>
<LORETTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're an artistic genius, how come you got butter on your tie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORETTA>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down and sees the stain. He's at a loss.
</DIRECTION>
<LORETTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give it here. I'll give you this, Al, you make good coffee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORETTA>
<DIRECTION>
She downs her coffee, accepts the stained tie which Al has taken off, and slams the ledger shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROBERT'S DRY CLEANERS - DAY - MORE CREDITS ROLL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are looking at a wall of dry-cleaned clothes bags. They are hanging from an automated grid. As we watch, the wall starts to move off to the left. A gap appears where no clothes are hung. The gap creates visual frame. In the frame is ROBERT. He is operating the grid with a little stick shift. He stops it and takes down a garment. He leaves the frame, heading off to the counter. When he moves away, WE SEE that Loretta is behind him, working her calculator, entering in a ledger. She slams the ledger shut, waves goodbye, and goes. After beat she reappears, produces Conti's tie, says something to Robert, who is out of view, leaves the tie, and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE a cleaver whacking an oxtail into section.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now WE SEE Loretta, a few feet away, tabulating on a chopping block that is partially obscured by a row of hanging rabbits, unskinned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A FLORIST SHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long white box is being filled with red roses. We HEAR the FLORIST'S VOICE.
</DIRECTION>
<FLORIST_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Red roses. Very romantic. The man who sends these knows what he's doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLORIST_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Now WE SEE Loretta tabulating and the Florist working on the box of roses.
</DIRECTION>
<LORETTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The man who sends those spends a lot of money on something that ends up in the garbage can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORETTA>
<DIRECTION>
The Florist gives her a look and then smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<FLORIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad everybody ain't like you, Loretta. I'd be outta business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLORIST>
<LORETTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Without me, you'd be out of business. I like flowers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORETTA>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him a sudden, brief, blinding smile. It's the first time we've seen her smile. She has gold work around one of her two front teeth. The Florist grunts and hands her a red rose. Camera moves close to Loretta and the rose.

EXT. THE GRAND TICINO - AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A red neon sign hangs in the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a quaint downstairs restaurant in Greenwich Village. A YOUNG COUPLE stop, look at the menu, become more interested in each other, kiss, and decide to go in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
White tablecloths and dark green walls, a tiny bar up by the door. The WAITERS all look a little alike. That's because they're all related. The place is about half full, and bustles along pleasantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A VIOLIN PLAYS a melancholy Neapolitan air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. JOHNNY and Loretta sit at a table for two talking quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They have their menus and glasses of red wine. Mr. Johnny is Italian, around 42. His wavy salt-and pepper hair is impeccably combed back; but there is so much that it threatens to fall forward someday and engulf his face. He is wearing a pinky ring, a dark suit, a gold watch, and, on his face, a mustache and a look of incredible seriousness. Loretta is Italian, 37. Her black hair, done in a dated style, is flecked with grey. She is wearing a dark blouse, black skirt, and high heels. One of her teeth is framed with gold work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Johnny is really timid of life, an overgrown boy, who hides these qualities behind a veil of dignity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loretta is tough and efficient, loyal and watchful; she watches out for Mr. Johnny, and defends him against life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOBO, an Old World Italian waiter, comes over to take their order.

<BOBO>

Loretta comes in and takes off her coat. A single MAD HOWL is HEARD, followed by a PANDEMONIUM OF BARKING. FIVE DOGS charge into the hall to greet Loretta. They are totally cockeyed, crackpot mutts. Their names are JUDAS, LUCY, LEO FATBOY, AND JONES.

This is the source of the Vicki Carr song, which is just ending. COSMO CASTORINI, Loretta's father is just turning off the old stereo. He is a powerful man, about 65, with a huge shock of white hair and gold wire glasses. He's wearing a big old red silk robe over blue pajamas, and royal blue slippers. The room it filled with lumpy upholstered furniture, once grand, now threadbare; shawls and doilies cover holes in failing fabric. There's a fireplace containing a dying fire. Cosmo's wing chair, with his newspaper on it, is beside a lit fringed lamp. Cosmo sees Loretta as she comes in.

Now that he has the gates open, he gets in the car and drives out to the curb. He gets out and goes back to lock the gates. As he does this, the Old Man approaches the house with the Five dogs and the open umbrella.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Old Man and the Dogs go to the front door of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cosmo goes to the door of his car. The two men, father and son, see each other at the moment they grab their respective door handles. They each raise a hand in greeting; it is the same gesture for both men, an eccentric chopping motion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then they open their respective doors. The Old Man disappears within the house. Cosmo drives slowly away in his car.

INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RED-HOT, WELL-SEASONED CAST IRON FRYING PAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Receives a big lump of butter with a hissing gasp of satisfaction. A wooden spoon pushes the sinking lump around until the pan is coated. Two square slices of yellow bread with round holes punched in their middles land in the pan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two circles of green pepper land next to the bread. A spatula flips over the bread which has become glistening gold on the cooked side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two eggs are broken and dropped sunnyside into the holes in the bread.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The circles of green pepper are pushed around by the spatula, scooped up deftly, and each is made to frame one of the eggs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WOMAN'S HAND garnishes each bright yellow yolk with a slash of red pimento. The spatula reappears and lifts the results from the pan, and slides them onto two small dark blue plates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now WE SEE that Loretta is just finishing setting the tin table for two. In the b.g., Rose is turning away from the big, old-fashioned six range gas stove where an old speckled coffee pot is steaming up a sun-drenched window. Rose comes toward the table with the laden blue plates. She's wearing a nice old apron over a blue housedress. She's thoughtful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Rose comes to the table, Loretta in a blue denim work shirt and pants, goes to the stove and gets the coffee. As Rose puts breakfast on the table, she speaks to Loretta, who's at the stove.

There are two coal-fired ovens, one at either end of the room. There is a large wooden table roughly center. And various pieces of baking equipment, dough-mixers, etc., scattered willy-nilly. And everywhere there is bread.

<DIRECTION>
PIETRO, a baker, is working at one of the ovens with a long wooden spatula. RONNY is working at the other oven.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Actually, he is just staring in the open door at the baking bread and burning coals. He's dressed in black jeans streaked with flour, a white restaurant shirt, white cotton gloves, and around his neck, a red handkerchief. He is black-haired, handsome and intense.

</RONNY>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls off the glove. The hand is made of wood.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNY>
<LORETTA>

	That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?

He goes to the big table, which is floured and covered with bread. He sweeps everything off the tabletop during the next.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it just a matter of time till a man opens his eyes and gives up his one dream of happiness? Maybe. Maybe. All I have... Have you come here, Stranger, Bride of my Brother, to take these last few loaves from my table? Alright. Alright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNY>
<DIRECTION>
The table is bare. He stares at it blankly. He wanders away, to the back room where the flour sacks are kept. We hear a single sob escape him from that room, and then silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone in the oven room looks after him. Then Chrissy approaches Loretta. She holds the big knife at her side.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the most tormented man I have ever known. I am in love with this man. He doesn't know that. I never told him cause he can never love anybody since he lost his hand and his girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISSY>
<DIRECTION>
She holds out the knife.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. Why don't you just kill him? It would be so much more kind than coming here and inviting him to a wedding like he'll never have.

Loretta considers Chrissy, decides what she's going to do, and goes to the flour room.

An album of "NEAPOLITAN FOLK SONGS" is PLAYING on the cafe's SOUND SYSTEM.

DARK NOOK IN THE CAFE

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a two-bedroom apartment. The decor reflects Ronny's love of the opera. The furniture is overstuffed, fringed in the colors of Italian passion. But it is all a bit faded, the remains of an old flamboyance. The walls are decorated with opera posters; and over the fireplace there is a painting depicting a scene from "La Boheme": Mimi is standing in the snow. Ronny stares at the picture of Mimi in the La Boheme poster. Loretta comes in from the kitchen and sets down a cup of coffee.

And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love.

A TUB OF APPLES FLOATING IN WATER

An old, gnarled hand reaches in and pulls one out, dries it with a towel. The CAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING that the hand belongs to Lucy, who is standing behind a table with the Old Man and Felix. She hands the apple to the Old Man, who drives a small wooden stake into it with a little wooden hammer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the Old Man hands this staked apple to Felix, who dips it into a deep metal pot. It emerges shining with red candy goo. Then Felix sets the candled apple onto a papered tray where a dozen already sit. They repeat this process. But the Old Man, because his thoughts are elsewhere, takes forever to drive the stake into the apple. This frustrates Felix.

Loretta approaches a young woman, MER, who works there. Mer is about thirty, trendily dressed, and French. Mer and Loretta greet and talk. Loretta makes vague gestures trying to convey what she wants, but the truth is she doesn't know what she wants. Mer takes the situation in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There follows a MONTAGE of Mer showing Loretta various dresses, some outlandish, some beautiful, some incomprehensible. Loretta tries on several of the dresses in a big triple mirror. Some horrify her, some frighten her because they're so sexy, one bores her. We don't see the dress that she ultimately does buy.

</DIRECTION>

Two NUNS are walking by. Loretta, backing up from the dummy, bumps into the Nuns. She's flustered, makes a brief apology, and hurries away, casting a furtive last glance at the shop window.

She wheels it to a central place in the room. Satisfied, she picks up her drink again, leaves the room for a moment, and then returns with her shopping bag. She throws it on a chair. Then she goes to the stereo and looks through the albums. She selects one and puts it on.

INT. THE CASTORINI LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP of LORETTA'S FACE as she puts the final touches on her make-up. Music continues to PLAY. The CAMERA PULLS BACK. WE SEE her full figure. She has changed into her evening dress and put on her heels. She's swaying to the music. The evening dress is sensational. She leans forward and kisses the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE THE LIPSTICK KISS ON THE MIRROR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the mirror, all around the kiss, is reflected the fire.

EXT. EAST RIVER NIGHT

The moon is reflected in the water as WE SEE the dock of the night before. We can SEE Jersey lit up across the river.

But then something starts to replace Jersey. It's a huge white liner coming down the river now, all of her lights burning, heading back out to sea. FLASHBULBS go off along the deck. We watch the length of the great ship pass as the

LINCOLN CENTER - LORETTA'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CROWDS OF PEOPLE in beautiful clothes fill the plaza created by the three great buildings. A glorious fountain filled with lights forms the centerpiece. Behind the fountain, grand and splendidly lit, is the magical Metropolitan Opera House. Two huge Chagalls, one to the right and one to the left, inhabit the face of the building, filling it with marvelous color.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LORETTA COMES TO THE FOUNTAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fountain is quiet and dark now. Loretta is puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She remembers that it was going. While she looks, it lights up. Then small jets of water begin to appear. Then larger jets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then with a roar the central shaft of water rises high, higher into the night sky. She follows the column of water with her eyes up into the sky. Right above the crest of the water, like a beanball on a seal's nose, is the moon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM OVER LORETTA'S SHOULDER WE SEE THE RUSHING WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Forming an opaque wall before her. Then the fountain, for its next piece of aquatic choreography, drops away to nothing quite suddenly. And there, facing Loretta, on the opposite side of the fountain, is Ronny.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's looking incredibly handsome and dashing in a tuxedo and topcoat and, of course, gloves. He smiles slightly and raises a hand in greeting. Loretta, caught off guard, smiles brilliantly at him. Then she remembers her situation and starts to put on her usual serious expression. But the fountain has rushed up into the sky again, obscuring her attempt at composure from, Ronny.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronny COMES INTO VIEW again, walking toward Loretta around the fountain's perimeter. He comes close to her.

He's stunned by her beauty. He's at a loss. He mumbles.

His eyes are bright with tears. Loretta is touched and starts to put her hand out to him. But she stops herself.

THE OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA PICKS OUT A SERIES OF COUPLES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first couple is PEGGY and CLIVE, a very distinguished pair of silver-haired lovers dressed magnificently. They are in their seats, delighted to be where they are, holding hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next is the CELEBRITY COUPLE. Maybe Jackie O and her son, John. They are seated and people are looking at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next is Cosmo and Mona. Cosmo is helping Mona to sit down, something she could probably handle herself. He's wearing good but old-fashioned suit. She is in a dress that makes her look like a big piece of hard candy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next is Ronny and Loretta. They are sitting in the first row of the First Circle; in other words, very good seats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are holding their programs. Loretta opens her program.
</DIRECTION>

THE OPEN PROGRAM - LORETTA'S POV

<DIRECTION>
The opera is LA BOHEME. But then the page fades away into the dark as the house lights go down.

WE SEE RONNY AND LORETTA FROM BEHIND

Ronny leans his head toward her and whispers.

The dinner crowd is in and most of the tables are occupied.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entranceway door opens and Rose enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's got herself up very nice. The host, JIMMY, quickly approaches her. She's very dignified.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Mrs. Castorini. Who's coming?

</JIMMY>
<ROSE>

<JIMMY>

Jimmy leads her to a table for two against the wall.

<JIMMY>

He seats her.

<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enjoy your meal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy breezes off. There's another table-for-two against the wall to Rose's front. WE SEE a woman's back from Rose's POV, and a pretty head of hair. This woman, whose name is SHEILA, is having an argument with the man across from her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the man's face is blocked by Sheila's back and head, and the argument is too low to be made out. Bobo approaches Rose's table.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening Mrs. Castorini. You eating alone tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBO>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Bobo. Yes. Let me have a martini, no ice and two olives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<BOBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBO>
<DIRECTION>
Bobo heads off for the bar. The couple at the next table catches Rose's attention again, and their argument becomes a little louder.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEILA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm trying to explain to you how I feel. Every time I try to explain how I feel, you explain how you feel. I don't think that's really much of a response.

<UNSEEN_MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, its the only response I've got.

Bobo reappears with the martini and serves it.

<BOBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna see a menu?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBO>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet. I'll wave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Bobo is gone. Rose is mildly intrigued with the argument at the next table now. She tries to see past Sheila, to see the man, but she can't without making too big a move. The argument goes on.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEILA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really do hate it though, when you take that tone with me. Like you're above it all and isn't it amusing.
	</DIALOGUE>

<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it is, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<SHEILA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not to me! This is my life, no matter how damned comical it may seem to you. I don't need some man standing above the struggle while I roll around in the mud!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEILA_S_VOICE>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you like the mud and I don't. That's fair, isn't it? If I don't care to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheila stands up abruptly and flings a glass of water in the man's face. She pulls her coat off the back of her chair and stalks off. This whole operation took about two seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she stalks off, the face of the man becomes visible to Rose for the first time. It's Perry, the professor in his 50's, who appeared and was treated in a similar way in the earlier scene in this restaurant. His face is covered with beads of water. He pats his face with his napkin and apologizes to CUSTOMERS at neighboring tables.
</DIRECTION>
<PERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about that, folks. She's a very pretty mental patient.

</PERRY>

The Shy Waiter arrives to assist Perry in drying himself.

<SHY_WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely!

The Shy Waiter heads for the bar. For the first time, Perry notices Rose.

They are facing each other with no obstacles in the way now.

	Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PERRY>
<PERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.

Loretta has stopped suddenly, transfixed by the sight before her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loretta and Ronny are standing face-to-face with Cosmo and Mona. Mona's wearing a coat like a wrapper for hard candy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cosmo is wearing his coat and has his hat in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stunned at seeing Loretta, he unconsciously puts his hat on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he thinks about it and takes it off again. He looks at Ronny. Then he looks at Mona.
</DIRECTION>
<LORETTA>

Ronny looks at Loretta. He waits to follow her lead.

Cosmo puts on his hat again. He glares at Ronny. He looks at Loretta, but he's at a total loss. At last, he stalks off. Loretta looks after him, angry and disturbed.

	I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.

	Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!

Just as the door shuts. A moment passes. Lights go on in Ronny's apartment. Out of a doorway on the opposite side of the street steps the figure of a woman. She walks to the middle of the deserted street and looks up at the lighted windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOW WE SEE THE WOMAN CLOSE UP -- IT'S CHRISSY FROM THE BAKERY

Her heart is about to break. She loves this man. She looks up at the lighted windows, her feelings hanging by one slender, slender thread.

MUSIC

<DIRECTION>
It's "MIMI'S ARIA"- from the snow scene in LA BOHEME.

<DIRECTION>
WE SEE THE STREET WITH THE FIGURE LOOKING

At the lighted window above. "MIMI'S ARIA" PLAYS. This tableau reminds us of the scene in the opera where MIMI stands in the snow. The MUSIC PLAYS and the WOMAN SINGS for a long moment. Then, the lights in the apartment go out. Chrissy shudders almost imperceptibly. Her heart has broken. She hangs her head. Then she lifts her head and slowly walks away down the street.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<MR_JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_JOHNNY>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But why would a man need more than one woman?
	</DIALOGUE>

EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We watch the effect of the sun coming up on the house. It begins in darkness, and goes through the many graduations of light very quickly until it's lit by the light of bright morning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FRONT DOOR OPENS AND THE OLD MAN AND THE DOGS COME OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's got them on their leashes and, over his head, he carries the black umbrella. He walks off toward the park and disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY - LORETTA IS WALKING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Along a sidewalk a couple of blocks away. She is a wreck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's still in her clothes of the night before. She hasn't slept. Her hair's a bit funny. And she's tormented by the complications in her life. And, at the same time, she looks great. She looks like she's been loved up and down. She has a hickey on her neck. Her eyes are dreamy and her walk is slow, utterly careless, and sexual. She's carrying, crunched in her hand, her program from La Boheme. She starts SINGING. We follow her as she SINGS and walks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE WATCH LORETTA WALKING FROM THE BACK NOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's still muttering. She comes to a tin can. She kicks lt. She comes to it again. She kicks it again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loretta appears kicking her can. She abandons the can and enters the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rose is at the stove. The kitchen is filled with steam and sunlight. Rose is stirring a pot filled with oatmeal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another range has the coffeepot heating. Loretta shuffles into the kitchen, goes to the tin table, and sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are red roses on the table. Rose sees Loretta.

Loretta is suddenly electrified.

	A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORETTA>
<ROSE>

<DIRECTION>
With a long low MOAN, Loretta lowers her head to the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronny is walking along the same stretch of sidewalk as Loretta just was. He looks like hell, too. His hair is wild and he hasn't slept. He's thrown on an old leather jacket and brown leather gloves. He has a love bite on his neck, too. He starts to SING "O SOAVE FANCIULLA". He SINGS it any old way, occasionally getting a good attack, occasionally just muttering his way through. SINGS as much of it as he remembers, which is a lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE WATCH RONNY WALKING FROM THE BACK NOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's SINGING away, carelessly sauntering along. He passes an ITALIAN COUPLE of middle age. They smile as they recognize what he is singing. They start to SING along with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They SING till they get to the ceiling of the aria, and to a resting place a little beyond. Then they nod to each other appreciatively and go on their ways, Ronny turning his back to the CAMERA, and they WALKING INTO IT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronny appears and approaches the door. HE KNOCKS, waits, and then RINGS THE BELL. Rose answers the door and invites him in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rose walks in with Ronny behind her. There's no one in the kitchen. Rose calls out.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not Johnny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>

Loretta comes out of a closet, where she was hiding. She's very surprised to see Ronny.

</LORETTA>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would anyone like some oatmeal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
LORETTA continues arguing.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(ignores Loretta)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I would like some oatmeal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Ronny and Loretta sit down and Rose serves them oatmeal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COSMO WALKS IN dressed for business. He regards the trio, puts on his hat in shock and then takes it off again.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<COSMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSMO>
<DIRECTION>
Cosmo sits down. Rose puts a bowl of oatmeal in front of him. He absently begins to eat it. A silence reigns. Then he puls down his spoon.
</DIRECTION>
<COSMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're Johnny's brother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSMO>
<RONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Cosmo picks up his spoon and they all eat silently once more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUND OF DOGS BARKING comes up and then fades away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OLD MAN WALKS IN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at the assemblage. The assemblage looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He points at Rose. Then his pointing drifts to Cosmo and his hand opens in a gesture of supplication.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am old. The Old are not wanted. And what they say has no weight. But, my son, I must speak. You should pay for the wedding of your only daughter. You are breaking your house through pride. There. I've said it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN>
<COSMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, Pop. If she gets married, I'll pay for the whole thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSMO>
<DIRECTION>
The Old Man lets go a great noise of relief, sits down at the table, and waits. Rose brings him a bowl of oatmeal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is content now, and eats his oatmeal with great relish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The others eat with a more meaningful silence. Rose puts down her spoon. She looks at the table, but she is speaking to Cosmo.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have I been a good wife?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<COSMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSMO>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to stop seeing her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone stops eating. A tremendous silence falls. An old clock goes tick, tick, tick. Suddenly Cosmo smashes his fists to the table and stands. He doesn't look at Rose during this. Then slowly, he sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<COSMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSMO>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And go to confession.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<COSMO>
<DIRECTION>
(still not looking at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSMO>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
She puts her hand across the table to him.
</DIRECTION>
<COSMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ti amo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSMO>
<DIRECTION>
He slides his hand out and takes her hand. Slowly, he lifts his eyes. Their eyes meet. It's the first time he's been able to hold her gaze in this whole story. The DOORBELL RINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<LORETTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Johnny. I'll get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORETTA>
<DIRECTION>
Loretta's tone is fatal.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get it.

</RONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Rose gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>

She goes to answer the door.

	<DIALOGUE>

Loretta looks at her father.

<LORETTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you Pop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORETTA>
<DIRECTION>
It's a private moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But who appears at the kitchen door is not Johnny. It's the CAPPOMAGGIS.

They have their coats on and they look very serious and concerned and timid.

</RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Loretta runs out of the kitchen and reappears with her everyday bag. She takes out the night deposit bag and hands it to Raymond.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.

(a sudden outburst to Loretta)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Raymond covers his face to hide his emotion. Rita, meanwhile is clearing the oatmeal bowls.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen. Who wants coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
There is a general acknowledgment. Everybody wants coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rose passes out white mugs and begins pouring steaming drafts of coffee. Raymond and Rita are standing. The rest are sitting.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what are we doing?

</RITA>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>

The DOORBELL RINGS. And RINGS AGAIN. Everyone is frozen for a moment, then Rita mobilizes.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get it.

</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
She goes. Loretta puts down her coffee and deep breathes, preparing herself.

<LORETTA>

RITA APPEARS WITH MR. JOHNNY IN TOW

DISSOLVE INTO:

<DIRECTION>
EIGHT FULL CHAMPAGNE GLASSES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Glistening in sunlight on the white tabletop. Into each is dropped a lump of sugar. A bottle of recently employed bitters sits nearby with its cap off (like a respectful peasant in aristocratic company. And the roses in the center.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the CAMERA PULLS BACK. WE SEE the table is surrounded.
</DIRECTION>

Cosmo is dropping the last of the sugar cubes in the last glass of champagne. Rose is by him. Rita and Raymond are side by side, as are Ronny and Loretta. The Old Man sits, staring at his son, intent and approving. But where is Mr. Johnny?

The Old Man takes the glass and walks over to a corner of the kitchen where Mr. Johnny, deeply disturbed and somewhat catatonic, sits on a step-ladder.

But the Old Man, wise and merry and tough, presses the glass on Mr. Johnny, who takes it.

Who knocks back his drink lustily, and then with a glittering eye looks away from the table.

<DIRECTION>
MR. JOHNNY FROM THE OLD MAN'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Johnny sits without moving, holding his glass. A long moment passes. Mr. Johnny is thinking. Then he nods to himself. He lifts his glass and murmurs for no one to hear

	<DIALOGUE>
	To family.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP OF THE OLD MAN LOOKING AWAY FROM MR. JOHNNY

And he laughs his laugh. This laugh could kill him. The CAMERA PULLS BACK a little. He pounds the table and knocks over the roses.
