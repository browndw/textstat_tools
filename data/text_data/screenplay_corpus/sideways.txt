Mr. Erganian and Jack get to their feet and shake hands with Miles. Jack remains affable, but we can discern his genuine irritation.

	About time you got here, bud. Mr. Prompt.

The Erganians laugh. Miles works up a smile too.

Although Mr. Erganian presses MUTE on the remote, he keeps watching for an extended moment, as do Jack and Miles.

<MR_ERGANIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What subject is your book? Non- fiction?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_ERGANIAN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's a novel. Fiction. Although there's a lot from my own life, so I guess technically some of it is non- fiction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MR_ERGANIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, I like non-fiction. There is so much to know about the world that I think reading a story someone just invented is kind of a waste of time.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So which one do you like better?

Jack turns around, and starts rooting around in a CARDBOARD WINE BOX.

<MILES>

	Why did you tell them my book was being published?

</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said you had it all lined up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...

</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, Conundrum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring.

Jack sits back in his seat holding up a bottle of CHAMPAGNE and TWO GLASSES.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>

	But I know it's going to happen this time. I can feel it. This is the one. I'm proud of you, man. You're the smartest guy I know.

Jack now begins to remove the foil from the champagne bottle.

<MILES>

	Don't open that now. It's warm.

<JACK>

	Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>

	That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it!

Jack untwists the wire. Instantly the cork pops off, and a fountain of champagne erupts.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Just tell me.

</JACK>
<MILES>

	Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.

He burrows through his mother's lingerie until locating a CAN OF RAID. A can of Raid?

He twists open the bottom and pulls it apart, revealing it to be a SECRET STASH for valuables disguised as a common household product. Inside are stacks of ONE-HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.

His task complete, he closes the drawer, and as he stuffs the bills in his pocket, his glance falls upon FRAMED PHOTOS atop the dresser --

-- A Sears portrait shows the RAYMOND FAMILY: a much younger Phyllis, her husband, and their two children -- a 12-year- old Miles and seven-year-old Wendy.

As Jack gets up, we see he has crashed on Phyllis's bed adorned with all her decorative PILLOWS.

Still in her pantsuit and smeared makeup, Phyllis lies sprawled and snoring on the sofa. On the TV, ostensibly never turned off the night before, is an inane CARTOON.

As Miles opens the front door, he spots Jack heading toward the TV to turn it off. Miles waves him off.

Miles shrugs off the comment.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.

	No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.

</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.

Jack spots the waitress coming out of the kitchen and motions for more coffee. She nods and smiles, indicating she'll be right over. Jack returns the smile and holds up a hand to signal he'll wait. Jack turns back to see Miles watching him.

MUSIC accompanies this sequence that anchors us into the rhythm of a road trip.

	I thought you hated Chardonnay.

The boys now pass vineyards of immaculate grapevines.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, what a day! Isn't it gorgeous? And the ocean's just right over that ridge. See, the reason this region's great for Pinot is that the cold air off the Pacific flows in at night through these transverse valleys and cools down the berries. Pinot's a very thin-skinned grape and doesn't like heat or humidity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks at Miles, admiring his friend's vast learning and articulateness.
</DIRECTION>

The Saab now pulls of the road and makes its way down a long gravel DRIVEWAY.

</JACK>
<MILES>

	I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?

Miles must curb his eagerness to go inside the tasting room as Jack SPEED DIALS.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, honey. So we're up here about to taste some whites, and we need to know how the caterers are going to make the salmon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack listens, then grows suddenly impatient.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I know, I didn't forget, but we wound up at Miles's mom's house, and it got really late, and it was hard to call, so I'm calling you now. I said I was sorry. Yes, I did.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Miles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You heard me say I was sorry, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles just shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miles heard me say I was sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
As Jack gets more and more involved with the phone call, he wanders off across the parking lot, progressively out of earshot.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me a break, will you? I just called to find out about the salmon -- for our wedding -- to be more involved, like you said -- and all you want to do is get into it about last night and, okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't call. You're totally right. I know, but I'm trying to make this the best wedding I can with the best wine we can find. Don't I get any credit for that? Okay. Look, I've got to go. I'm out here in the parking lot, and Miles is waiting for me...

TWO GLASSES are filled with small amounts of PINOT NOIR VIN GRIS.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is rose, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pinot noir? Not again!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(joking, to Chris)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, not all Pinots are noir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
They laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles swirls his glass in tight circles on the bar, then lifts it to smell. Jack clumsily imitates Miles, perhaps even spilling some wine in the process.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me show you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
We see details of what Miles now describes.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What color is it supposed to be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack waves the glass under his nose as if it were a perfume bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be shy. Get your nose in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack now buries his nose in the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you smell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles smells.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's not much there yet, but you can still find...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(more sniffs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...a little citrus... maybe some strawberry... passion fruit... and there's even a hint of like asparagus... or like a nutty Edam cheese.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack smells again and begins to brighten.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Miles expertly swirls the wine. Jack follows suit.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oxygenating it opens it up, unlocks the aroma and the flavors. Very important. Now we smell again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
They do so. Jack smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what you do with every one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When do we get to drink it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack gulps his wine down in one shot. Miles chews his before swallowing.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How would you rate this one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Chris)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the new one, right, Chris?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Released it about two months ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(to Miles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, you could work in a wine store.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that would be a good move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Now Miles notices something about Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you chewing gum?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want some?

The Saab makes its way into this very average-looking Central coast town right off the freeway.

BUELLTON.

EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY

The Saab pulls into the parking lot of this motel. And look -- there's the WINDMILL itself, its decorative blades motionless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles and Jack enter the room and throw their suitcases onto their respective beds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sounds of a SHOWER and OFF-KEY SINGING come from the bathroom while Miles sits impatiently on the bed. He pounds on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Jack, hurry up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a minute!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Opening the bedside drawer, Miles finds a GIDEON'S BIBLE and tosses it in the trash -- apparently his hotel routine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY 246 - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freshly showered and dressed for dinner, Miles and Jack amble along the shoulder of this busy local two-lane highway. They pass a mall and a car dealership.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not even a mile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We should have driven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're going to stop acting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If that's what feels right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(convincing himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It does. Feels right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it's a good thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding, feeling better)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles leads them away from the road and across a parking lot. The camera PANS to reveal --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HITCHING POST, a local institution.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HITCHING POST BAR - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles and Jack belly up. GARY, the Samoan bartender, spots Miles and extends a welcoming hand.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gary.

</MILES>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When's that novel of yours coming out? We all want to read it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<GARY>

(shaking Jack's hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My condolences.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you pouring tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lot of good stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at a row of bottles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutement.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They have their own label that's just outstanding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Gary pours Jack and Miles a generous sample and the two men swirl, sniff and taste. Jack is beginning to get the hang of things.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Tight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
<DIRECTION>
(to Gary)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pour us a couple.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Gary fills their glasses and corks the bottle. Jack raises his glass to toast.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's to my last week of freedom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's going to be great. Here's to us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
They clink their glasses and take a drink. We linger on them as Miles retreats inward and a restless Jack scans the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HITCHING POST DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Miles review their menus. Jack looks up and spots a PRETTY WAITRESS placing an order at the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miles. Check it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles glances at the waitress and returns to his menu.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure I know Maya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know that chick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is very hot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack leans forward and squints.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(focusing on the menu)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Just then Maya comes by carrying a tray of food on her way to another table.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maya, how are you?

</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?

<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no, actually. Busy night.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
She goes.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, she does know a lot about wine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she likes Pinot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She works for tips!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're blind, dude. Blind.

	I also recommend the ostrich. Very lean. Locally raised.

<DIRECTION>
TWO BURGUNDY GLASSES --
</DIRECTION>

are refilled with the contents of yet another bottle of Hitching Post Pinot Noir.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Miles are enjoying a post-prandial drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks like he's thinking about something. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate Tony Levin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack swirls his wine and downs it in one gulp. Just then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAYA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walks into the bar and takes a seat a few stools down. She has changed into a black cashmere sweater and corduroys, lovely but tired.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Gary)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Highliner, please.

Maya looks over and smiles as Gary pours her a glass from their bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Maya gets an American Spirit Yellow out of her purse and lights it while Gary pours her a glass.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to join us?

</MILES>
<MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(polite)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
In no hurry, she takes a long sip of her wine, gets up and comes down the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I finished it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's getting published. That's what we're up here celebrating.

Miles shoots Jack a look. Jack responds with a "don't-fuck- it-up-brother" glower.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's fantastic. Congratulations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
She offers her glass, and all clink.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you a writer too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm an actor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything I'd know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe. Recognize this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack takes a deep breath, and out comes a perfect VOICE-OVER VOICE.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Now with low, low 5.8% APR financing."
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Maya's mouth drops open and curves into a big smile.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.

</MAYA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am one of those guys.

	You are not.

<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is.

Jack launches into another one of his sure-fire hits.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(very fast)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Consult your doctor before using this product. Side effects may include oily discharge, dizziness, hives, loss of appetite, difficulty breathing and low blood pressure. If you have diabetes or a history of kidney trouble... you're fucked!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
This makes Maya laugh a big throaty laugh. Jack joins in. Nervous about Jack's aggressive flirtatiousness, Miles musters a tight courtesy smile.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(winding down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. I needed that. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
They all take a drink of wine.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what are you guys up to tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Before Jack has a chance to speak --
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're pretty wiped. Probably go back to the hotel and crash.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
This makes Maya slightly embarrassed at her apparent availability, but she recovers quickly, remains breezy.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Windmill.

</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Windmill.

Maya downs the rest of her wine, stamps out her smoke, and picks up her jean jacket and purse.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>

As she leaves --
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll catch up with you later, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
But she's gone. Jack gives Miles a slow burn look.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll probably go back to the hotel and crash?

<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The guys walk drunkenly along the shoulder as CARS WHIZ BY.

	The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

The screen is absolutely BLACK.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack begins to make a soft BUZZING noise, growing gradually louder and more rhythmic.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you no shame?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
There's now a rustling noise and footsteps. Then a LIGHT is flipped on in the BATHROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles closes the door behind him, and the only light visible is at the bottom of the bathroom door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles PEES -- a series of semi-forced SHORT SQUIRTS. Then a FLUSH as a door opens and the light goes off. Jack starts BUZZING again.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut the fuck up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack stops and Miles climbs into bed. Silence. Then --

Miles and Jack are glancing at the menus. For some reason Jack is humorless and grumpy.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(not amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's the plan today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack sarcastically taps an index finger to his temple.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack exhales and looks away, as though he doesn't want to get into it.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>

	Hey, guys. How's it going?

WHOOMP! Under the bar Jack stomps on Miles's foot. Miles winces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephanie slides TWO GLASSES in front of them.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right -- I'm here to learn. I never had that much interest in wine before, but this trip has been very enlightening. Always like wine, of course, but I don't know. More of a beer man, really. Microbreweries.

</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
She THUMPS the cork off a bottle of Chardonnay.

	Cabernet Franc.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as they taste)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHANIE>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --

	<DIALOGUE>
	So what does everyone feel like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHANIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we're paying for the wine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, in that case...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Miles draws a long breath.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHANIE>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactement!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack shoots Miles a look.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm having the salmon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I'm having.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<STEPHANIE>
<DIRECTION>
(still scanning the wines)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm thinking about the duck breast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHANIE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(slapping his menu shut)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that narrows things down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Stephanie lowers the menu so that only her eyes peer over the top. She looks at the others, and they look back at her.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds like... Pinot Noir to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHANIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks at Miles and raises one hand for a HIGH-FIVE.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pinot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles reluctantly slaps Jack's hand. This causes the girls to laugh. MUSIC STARTS -- they're OFF!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DINNER is improvised, but includes:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- The arrival of the FIRST WINE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- The SALADS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Maya takes a turn with the wine list. Miles pushes her finger down into the prices with THREE DIGITS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- New stemware is provided with the arrival of the SECOND WINE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- The four of them DRINK. Particularly Miles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Stephanie and Jack get cozier and cozier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- The SALMON and DUCK arrive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Miles is too shy to look into Maya's eyes. She's interested and available -- it's too much for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- As Miles gets DRUNKER, the camera angles become sloppier, the cutting choppier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Miles PONTIFICATES about some aspect of wine that Maya and Stephanie find interesting. Left out in the cold, his jaw tight, Jack wants to find a way in but can't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Miles reaches over to refill his glass, but Jack's arm shoots out to stop him -- "Slow down."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MILES as a distant RUMBLE begins to sound, the rumble of an oncoming ANXIETY ATTACK. By now he has drunk so much that he spaces out, descending into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERWORLD - DARK AND TIMELESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles is boarding an OPEN BOAT atop this underground river, the River Styx. Just beyond a ghoulish HUMAN CARGO the hooded boatman CHARON wields a long staff. Miles is crossing over to the dark side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOS OLIVOS CAFE - BACK AGAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles returns to earth to find Jack and Stephanie now in their own little world -- Jack explaining something to Stephanie that she finds fascinating, just FASCINATING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Miles converses with Maya, but it's clear from her bemused expression that he's being charming if not entirely coherent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- ANOTHER WINE reaches the table -- a Comte Armand Pornrnard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Miles looks over at Jack and Stephanie. They share a short but sensual kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOMENTS LATER --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles is on his feet threading his way through the tables. He is very unsteady, and we cut between first and third person perspectives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BATHROOMS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries the MEN'S ROOM door but it's locked. He pulls the XANAX out his pocket and pops one in his mouth, swallowing it dry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He notices a PAYPHONE nearby. Thinking better of it for a moment, Miles makes a drunken bee-line for the receiver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE KEYPAD --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as many numbers are dialed, and we HEAR the TONES, completely out of sync, along with a sound melange of interior phone RINGING and a PICKUP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RECEIVER --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Miles presses it desperately to his head.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTORIA>

(ON THE PHONE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Miles laughs at his own non-existent joke.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.

	Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.

</VICTORIA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?

</MILES>
<VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
(ON THE PHONE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<MILES>
<DIRECTION>
(rushing to keep her on)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, Vicki, I just heard about this today, you getting married that is, and I was kind of taken aback. Kind of hard to believe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
(ON THE PHONE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
Miles sucks something from between his two front teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever you say, Vicki. You're the boss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
He HANGS UP as nonchalantly as if it had been a sales call and heads back to the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DEEP CANYON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a flash, Miles is walking an unstable, narrow ROPE BRIDGE extending vertiginously across a great CHASM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOS OLIVOS CAFE - BACK AGAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles reaches the table, tries to sit and SLIPS ONTO THE FLOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Although at first Jack blinks heavily in disgust, the girls burst into hysterical LAUGHTER. Jack then laughs too, perhaps OVER-LAUGHING.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy, boy. Easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Maya helps him back into the booth.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. Just slipped.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(picking up his glass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is my blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Miles drinks. Stephanie makes a head gesture to Maya, who nods in return.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHANIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the guys)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHANIE>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry to make you get up again, Miles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Miles and Jack allow the girls to pass. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck, man? What is up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles reaches for his wine glass, but Jack moves it away.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pull yourself together, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
But in throwing open his arms for emphasis, he spills a WATER GLASS. Jack rights it and throws a napkin on the tablecloth.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where were you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bathroom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you drink and dial?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles's silence confirms his guilt and shame.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you always do this? Victoria's gone, man. Gone. Poof.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles looks down and squeezes his eyes tight while pushing out an exhale through his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Jesus, Miles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles belligerently reaches for his Comte Armand. Jack lets it pass.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up. Shut your face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(passing a glass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drink some agua.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles looks at the water, takes it and drains it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girls now return to the table. The guys slide over.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to appear sober)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should we get dessert?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<STEPHANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
	</DIALOGUE>

Jack raises both arms like a football referee.

INT. SAAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trees and bushes lit by the headlights show us we're headed into the woods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack drives. Miles blinks heavily as he tries to make a sense of A HAND-DRAWN MAP.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(grabbing the map)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me see that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Saab pulls into a gravel DRIVEWAY and comes to a stop outside this wood-framed cottage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Miles get out and head for the front door. On the way, Jack reaches into his coat pocket and produces a string of FOUR CONDOMS.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(tearing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. One for you, three for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles wordlessly takes his. Just before they climb the porch steps --
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure you want to do this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack stops and looks at him for a moment with almost hostile incredulity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FRONT DOOR is open. Jack knocks twice on the SCREEN DOOR before going in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys enter this modest living room furnished with weathered but charming old furniture. Scattered here and there are CHILDREN'S TOYS. FINGER-PAINTINGS are taped to the walls. CANDLES are lit, and MUSIC is playing.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Stephanie sails in.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to you guys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHANIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Couple of wrong turns.

(pointing a thumb at Miles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks to Magellan, here.

After a brief hug, Stephanie and Jack peck-kiss.

Miles hesitates a moment before Jack elbows him toward --

EXT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Miles wanders in to find Maya squatting in front of a little temperature-controlled WINE STORAGE UNIT.

</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.

</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She got anything good?

</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(calling out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<STEPHANIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHANIE>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who do you think you're dealing with here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Maya slips out a bottle of ESCHEVAUX.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Miles nods vigorously. Maya looks back and forth between Miles and the wine, her eyes narrowed. Then she slides it back in.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope. I don't think we know each other well enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(picking out another bottle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd say this guy's more our speed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
They rise, and Miles glances at the ANDREW MURRAY SYRAH and, raising his eyebrows, agrees. Maya begins opening it.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what gems do you have in your collection?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pushing him, playfully stern)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right now. Hurry up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Miles laughs, fights back a bit.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Understanding, Maya considers her response.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long have you been into wine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I started to get serious about seven years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was the bottle that did it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Miles whistles and raises his eyebrows. Maya pours, and they clink their glasses together before savoring the wine.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(tastes again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
<DIRECTION>
(tasting again, impressed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Then Miles absently scans the REFRIGERATOR DOOR and spots a PHOTO of Stephanie holding a LITTLE GIRL.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she sleeping or...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>

Jack's voice-over voice from the other room...

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"And now for a low, low 4.8% APR..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
...is followed by PEALS OF LAUGHTER.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got kids?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, same here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Maya nods as she sips again, looking distant for a moment, thinking about something else.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Maya takes the bottle, and they wander into --

INT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Stephanie are gone. From a distant bedroom comes more laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like our friends are hitting it off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
While Maya goes to turn down the STEREO, Miles sits on the couch. Maya's shirt rides up as she crouches, giving Miles a glimpse of the small of HER BACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a seat opposite Miles on the couch. They look at each other without speaking. Just what is the vibe here?
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, weird. But great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Definitely.

<DIRECTION>
An awkward silence, broken by Maya.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's your novel about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the title?

</MAYA>
<MILES>

</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>

(squeezing it out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A paper?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sipping the wine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I ask you a personal question?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
<DIRECTION>
(bracing himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Miles laughs at first, then smiles wistfully at the question. He searches for the answer in his glass and begins slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. It's a hard grape to grow. As you know. It's thin-skinned, temperamental, ripens early. It's not a survivor like Cabernet that can grow anywhere and thrive even when neglected. Pinot needs constant care and attention and in fact can only grow in specific little tucked- away corners of the world. And only the most patient and nurturing growers can do it really, can tap into Pinot's most fragile, delicate qualities. Only when someone has taken the time to truly understand its potential can Pinot be coaxed into its fullest expression. And when that happens, its flavors are the most haunting and brilliant and subtle and thrilling and ancient on the planet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Maya has found this answer revealing and moving.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Why are you into wine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? Like what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what a fraud he was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Miles laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, but I do like to think about the life of wine, how it's a living thing. I like to think about what was going on the year the grapes were growing, how the sun was shining that summer or if it rained... what the weather was like. I think about all those people who tended and picked the grapes, and if it's an old wine, how many of them must be dead by now. I love how wine continues to evolve, how every time I open a bottle it's going to taste different than if I had opened it on any other day. Because a bottle of wine is actually alive -- it's constantly evolving and gaining complexity. That is, until it peaks -- like your '61 -- and begins its steady, inevitable decline. And it tastes so fucking good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Now it is Miles's turn to be swept away. Maya's face tells us the moment is right, but Miles remains frozen. He needs another sign, and Maya is bold enough to offer it: reaches out and places one hand atop his.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bathroom over there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Miles gets up and walks out. Maya sighs and gets and American Spirit out of her purse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STEPHANIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bathroom's a MESS -- the shower curtain is filthy, and the chipped and water-stained tub is filled with CHILDREN'S BATH TOYS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles is bent over the sink splashing water on his face, trying to sober up and gather his courage. He stands, and without drying his face, presses his palms against his cheeks. Then he takes a deep breath and drops his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are such a loser. Come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles comes out of the bathroom and looks for Maya, but she's not there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he hears a noise from the kitchen, so he goes through the door into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maya is at the sink, filling a glass with water.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just getting some water. You want some water?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Miles goes to stand by her and accepts a glass of water. Just as she's about to fill a second glass, he stops her and looks her in the eye, trying to recapture a moment that is long gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her and she kisses back, but the whole thing feels strained and awkward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a few seconds, Maya breaks away.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
But instead of resuming the kiss, she steps past him, heading back into the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should probably get going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Miles realizes he's blown it and silently berates himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles drives down the hill behind Maya's car, which leads him through this very rural road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHERE THE ROAD MEETS THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maya's car comes to a stop just ahead of the Saab. She puts it in PARK and gets out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE SAAB --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles rolls down his window as Maya leans over.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. So did I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. See you around.

</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um... did you still want to read my novel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Miles turns to the backseat, locates a large MANUSCRIPT BOX, and hands it to Maya.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. Great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
He turns around again, produces a SECOND BOX, and hands it over as well.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodnight, Miles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him a friendly peck on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After she gets back in her car, she heads in one direction while Miles heads in the opposite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDER BLACK --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TUESDAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack's cellphone RINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOW EARLY MORNING --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still fully clothed, Miles staggers across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fishing the phone out of Jack's windbreaker pocket, he looks at the CALLER ID: "Erganian, Christine" and the number. He briefly considers his options -- answer it? shut it off? -- before placing it atop Jack's suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The moment he lies back down on the bed, the MOTEL PHONE RINGS. An old DIGITAL CLOCK next to it reads 7:l0.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Miles closes his eyes and pulls the pillow over his aching head, we again --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VROOM! Outside a roaring MOTORCYCLE comes to a stop. Then over the sound of an IDLING ENGINE come familiar if indistinct VOICES and LAUGHTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles opens his bleary eyes and listens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOOTSTEPS pound on the balcony outside, and Jack lets himself in, flushed and exuberant.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking chick is unbelievable. Un-be- lieve-able!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He pounds on the wall, then goes into the bathroom and without closing the door unzips his pants to PEE.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
A hungover Miles gets up and looks out the door Jack has left open. Down in the parking lot he sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STEPHANIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
atop a mid-sized MOTORCYCLE, wearing a weathered fringed suede jacket. She gives him a big friendly wave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
returns the wave and goes back inside.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't invite Stephanie to come with us, did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
With a FLUSH Jack emerges from the bathroom and opens his bag.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were supposed to play golf.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(slapping some cash on the dresser)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
<DIRECTION>
(sitting down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Count me out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>

Miles looks down. Jack heads for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack stops, eyeing Miles suspiciously. Miles tosses Jack his phone. Jack flips it open and scrolls down with his thumb. He doesn't like what he sees.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing at the room phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's been leaving messages here too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He SNAPS the phone shut and puts it back.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should call her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will.

<DIRECTION>
(heading out the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See ya!

<MILES>

	Right now.

</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay! Jesus!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack picks up his phone, sits on the bed and looks defiantly at Miles.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got no problem calling her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Now Jack closes his eyes and brings the heel of his hand to his forehead as he begins to concoct the BIG LIE.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait outside, will you?

Miles wanders out and looks down at Stephanie.

<STEPHANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was fun last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHANIE>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<STEPHANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her.
	</DIALOGUE>

Miles says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Jack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHANIE>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He had to make a phone call.

</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Stephanie cuts her bike's engine and climbs off, propping it up on the kickstand.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what are you up to today, Miles?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHANIE>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.

</MILES>
<STEPHANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh.

<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You golf?

</MILES>
<STEPHANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.

Stephanie and Jack PEEL OUT, leaving Miles alone on the balcony.

As we begin to hear a SNIPPING sound which carries us to --
</DIRECTION>

EXT. MOTEL ROOM BALCONY - DAY

Miles sits outside carefully trimming his toenails. SNIP, SNIP, SNIP. MUSIC BEGINS for this mournful montage of solitude.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles takes a styrofoam cup and helps himself to a cup of complimentary COFFEE from a PUMP THERMOS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he takes a look at the rack of pamphlets of local TOURIST ATTRACTIONS -- a water park, a mystery cave, and of course winery after winery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WINDMILL INN JACUZZI - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amid turbulent water, Miles corrects his students' papers. He is alone in the tub, but at the nearby pool STOCKY KIDS play noisily with SUPER-SOAKERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER MILES'S SHOULDER --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PAPER he's reading is marked up with circled spelling errors, and one entire paragraph has been crossed out. Finding a new error, Miles writes "NO!!!"

CAMERA PANS to reveal a STACK of papers already heavily marked with corrections, some of them mottled with water stains.

Miles FLOSSES, his lips pulled back into a grotesque moue. Then he brushes with a SONIC-CARE TOOTHBRUSH.

Miles checks his machine.

The Saab roars past us, perhaps going a little too fast.

INT. SAAB - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whistling absently as he drives, Miles leans over to turn the radio on and fiddle around to find a good station. Then all of a sudden --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHUMP! The car has struck something with a hideous sound followed immediately by the receding "ARF-ARF-ARF-ARF" of an injured DOG in the Saab's wake. Miles applies the BRAKES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles gets out of his car just in time to see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DOG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
scampering into the nearby woods. Miles looks around -- has anyone seen him? Is there a nearby residence? Finding nothing, Miles momentarily weighs his options before finally GIVING CHASE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He follows the path of the dog into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROADSIDE WOODS - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still hearing occasional distant barking, Miles finds his way among the trees and bushes, looking in vain for the ill- fated cur.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a frenetic search, Miles reluctantly gives up and heads back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles has returned to where he hit the dog. Just then, Miles notices TWO MEXICAN CHILDREN watching him from just down the road. They disappear into the bushes.

<DIRECTION>
Looking like a criminal, Miles trots back to the Saab climbs behind the wheel and speeds away.

<DIRECTION>
(to Miles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stephanie took me out into the Pinot fields today. It was awesome. I think I finally got a handle on the whole process, from the soil to the vine to the -- what do you call it? -- selection and harvest. And the whole, you know, big containers where they mix it. We even ate Pinot grapes right off the vine.

<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I've been doing some thinking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you've been thinking. And?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles looks at him with incredulity.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I fully realize that making a change like that might be tricky for certain people to accept at first, but life is short, Miles. I've got to be sure I'm doing the right thing before taking such a big step. And not just for my sake. I'm thinking about Christine's feelings too. I take marriage very seriously -- always have. That's why I've never done it before. The day I get married, it's going to be the real thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles just looks at his friend, waiting for more.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Deep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Miles draws a long sigh.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get all judgmental on me. This is my deal. It's my life, and it's my call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
They fall silent for a moment. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Understanding of what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like I might be in love with another woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look who's talking. You've been there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Of course I like Christine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was three years ago after that first party!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(his hand on his chest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Just then Stephanie walks in. She cozies up to Jack, and he kisses the top of her head.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
	</DIALOGUE>

as a crazy car races through the obstacle-ridden track, often leaving the road, much like Jack's libido.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZOOM OUT

<DIRECTION>
to reveal six-year-old SIENA seated in Jack's lap as they drive together. A delighted Siena laughs and giggles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles sits nearby with Stephanie and her fifty-something, two-pack-a-day MOTHER CARYL.
</DIRECTION>
<CARYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stephanie's heard this a thousand times, but if I'd done what I wanted and I'd bought up in Santa Maria when I had the chance, I would have made a fortune when they put in that outlet center and that Home Depot.

	Your father knew it too, but he was a fucking chickenshit. Always was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARYL>
<DIRECTION>
Caryl looks over her shoulder, her gaze drawn to Jack and Siena, so completely happy together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Caryl exhales a puff of smoke as she watches. Stephanie is equally enthralled. Miles takes it all in, trying his best not to shake his head in disgust.
</DIRECTION>

Caryl is behind the wheel of her OLDSMOBILE as Stephanie gets Siena buckled up in the backseat. Jack pulls Miles aside.

	Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>

(dispirited)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POP! Miles opens a bottle of Pinot and pours himself a glass. He carries it to bed, takes a nice big slug, lies down on the bed and opens his magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOW SNEEZING ATOP THE BED -- ANGLE ON TOP OF HIM --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Barely Legal face down on his chest, Miles awakens with a start and looks at the clock-radio. He thinks a moment, takes a deep breath, and bounds off the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON A WATER-SAVER SHOWER HEAD --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as little needles of water come at us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE BATHROOM DOOR --

Miles takes a nice hot SHOWER. But wait -- he has forgotten to put the shower curtain inside the tub. A closer look reveals a growing PUDDLE OF WATER on the floor.

</MILES>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?

</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Crap.

</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles, disheveled and sullen, approaches the teebox, sticks a tee in the ground and sets his ball.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?

</JACK>
<MILES>

Miles refocuses and SWINGS just as Jack offers more helpful advice.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>

	Don't whiff it.

WHACK! Despite the distraction, Miles manages to make a good, long drive.

NOW ON THE FAIRWAY --

	Huh.

</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or fuck those New York publishers. Publish it yourself. I'll chip in. Just get it out there, get it reviewed, get it in libraries. Let the public decide.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Giving Jack a look that says Jack has no idea what he's talking about, Miles takes a stance over the ball and focuses.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't come over the top. Stay still.

(holding out a cup of wine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.

Still fuming, Miles begrudgingly accepts the wine and has a taste. He's immediately distracted from his woes.

<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?

</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girls have led them to a beautiful spot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN A SERIES OF SHOTS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
we see the progress of their picnic. We don't hear them, but there is a growing intimacy about their interaction. Even Maya and Miles seem to be overcoming residual awkwardness from the other night. Jack and Stephanie lean on each other as they eat and sip wine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, the two couples are SILHOUETTED against the SUNSET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WINERY #3 PARKING LOT - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The parking lot is crowded. The foursome join others headed toward the main building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WINERY #3 - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LECTURE by British wine sage LESLIE BROUGH is in progress. He holds aloft a RIEDEL BURGUNDY GLASS containing one of the few but growing number of local reds worthy of his attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE AUDIENCE --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As our foursome listen attentively, Jack leans over to Miles.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Stephanie leans forward and signals to Maya with a YAWN or a GAGGING FINGER IN MOUTH that they hightail it. Although Miles protests at first, they stand and leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephanie finds a DOOR which she tests to see whether it is open. It is! She leads her pals furtively inside --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WINEMAKING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is an enormous, dimly-lit chamber filled with stainless steel FERMENTATION TANKS and stacks of OAK BARRELS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the two couples walk in the near-darkness, they are entranced. Maya takes Miles's hand and leads him away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the background, Stephanie and Jack lean against a tank, kissing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA DOLLIES to reveal Miles and Maya among the barrels in the foreground. They are shy with each other, on the verge of kissing but holding back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MUSIC CONTINUES...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE BOTTLES OF WINE sit empty on the coffee table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The four friends sit on the floor around the coffee table. They drink wine and pass a JOINT. Suddenly they explode in LAUGHTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sleepy Siena appears at the hallway door rubbing her eyes. Stephanie gets up, but Jack stops her, gathers Siena in his arms, and takes her back to bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Saab pulls away from the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles sits in his own passenger seat as Maya tries her hand at the Saab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAYA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maya leads Miles up her back stairway. They're both a little woozy from the hours of drinking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE DOOR --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maya searches through her purse for her keys while Miles hovers directly behind her, staring at her ear. Her ear?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as Maya puts the key in the lock, he impulsively leans forward to kiss the nape of her neck. Maya's reaction is immediate -- she turns to embrace Miles, giving him a long KISS. Then she opens the door, pulls him inside and closes the door in our face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera PANS to the nearby ROOFTOPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC ENDS AND SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SAME VIEW BY DAY, SUPERIMPOSED WITH --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THURSDAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS back to Maya's door, tilting down to find a blue-wrapped NEW YORK TIMES. The door opens, and Maya's hand picks up the newspaper. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Maya inside to --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a small, clean apartment furnished with simple taste.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maya is dressed in a ROBE and holds a COFFEE MUG. She drops the paper on the dining table and continues into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEDROOM --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where Miles lies on his stomach DEAD TO THE WORLD. His stubbly face is squished against the mattress and he SNORES lightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maya looks at him for a moment before shaking his foot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FARMERS' MARKET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a weekly event in a big PARKING LOT -- organic produce, candles and incense, honey and cider.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maya and Miles are shopping. Miles carries the bags.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ORCHARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across from each other at a PICNIC TABLE, and surrounded by the remnants of BREAKFAST, Miles and Maya read the NEWSPAPER. Miles is doing the CROSSWORD PUZZLE.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
	</DIALOGUE>

<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. What's the latest we can get there?

</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About two-thirty.

</MILES>
<MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(noticing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Miles has just figured out a difficult clue. As he writes it down --
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What rehearsal dinner?

Miles stops writing.

INT./EXT. PARKING AREA NEAR THE ORCHARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maya leads the way toward the Saab.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were you ever going to say anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Maya turns to confront Miles with a look of "Give me a break." Miles reaches out to touch her.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(jerking away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't touch me. Just take me home.

INT. SAAB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles drives, glancing occasionally at Maya, who stares straight ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know what he's been saying to her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's an actor, so it can't be good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure he believed every word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
A stony silence.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you wanted to fuck me first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Maya. No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAYA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles brings the car to a stop. Maya opens the door and begins to get out.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Maya wants to let Miles's words reach her, but she can't just yet.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could I have my paper, please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Unsure what she wants at first, Miles reaches into the back seat for the New York Times. He hands it to her and watches until she goes inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles pulls up and parks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Miles enters, a shirtless Jack drops the Barely Legal and is immediately upon him, grabbing him in a big BEARHUG. The TV is on, perhaps showing an E! True Hollywood Story.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put me down, Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack continues his paean to Miles's triumphant night.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said put me down. Jack!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Still gripping Miles in a bearhug, Jack flings the both of them onto the bed. Now on top of Miles, Jack KISSES both cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so proud of you! Let me love you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Now they get up off the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's private.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's leave it alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks at Miles, his face frozen with incomprehension.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't get any, did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Miles's silence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a homo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles begins to calm down. Jack grows concerned and sensitively puts one arm around his friend.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
The phone RINGS and both men look at it, silenced by the ominous sound.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't answer it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
But Jack is drawn to it as though enticed by a strange game of Russian roulette.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm telling you, don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack picks up the receiver and puts it to his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Oh, hey, honey. How you doing? Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(mouthing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles lies on his bed and clamps both hands over his ears. His face is dark with resentment.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, honey. Let me call you back. Miles and I are in the middle of something. No, it's nothing serious -- Miles is just having one of his freak- outs. Yeah. Love you too. I'll call you right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(deadly serious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We gotta slow down.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(closing his eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.

</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you need.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SEARS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack watches Miles be fitted for SNEAKERS. A SALES ASSOCIATE ties Miles's laces.
</DIRECTION>
<SALES_ASSOCIATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALES_ASSOCIATE>
<DIRECTION>
Miles gets up and walks in a circle.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you like them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are they too sporty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys exit Sears, Miles wearing his new shoes and carrying a PLASTIC BAG with a string handle.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feel better?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(noticing something)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh here, wait a second. I want to run in here real quick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He heads toward a TOYS STORE.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(over his shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to get something for Siena.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Mildly concerned, Miles watches Jack go into the store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles is slumped in the passenger seat as Jack drives. They pass a BIG COMMERCIAL WINERY. Jack slows down, preparing to turn in.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ever actually been in there, Miles?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have to.

EXT. LARGE WINERY PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Saab finds a place in the large parking lot. A TOUR BUS, whose flank reads "Solvang Wine Tours," is in the process of letting out WINE TOURISTS, many of them elderly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LARGE WINERY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room boasts not only a large TASTING BAR but also display after display of t-shirts, golf shirts, olive oils, chocolate sauces and other gourmet tourist items emblazoned with the winery's logo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the corner an ACOUSTIC GUITARIST with a small amp plays soothing Windham Hill-ish music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tasting bar is packed three-deep with TASTERS attended to by HARRIED POURERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally the POURER gets to their glasses. Miles chews a sip and swallows, then downs the rest in a single gulp.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Tastes okay to me.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.

</MILES>
<EVELYN>

(ON THE PHONE)

	<DIALOGUE>
	And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.

	I'm sorry, Miles.

<DIRECTION>
(off his silence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Miles is at a loss for words. A distant RUMBLE begins to sound, the familiar harbinger of an anxiety attack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DEEP CANYON - INSERT

MOMENTS LATER --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles STAGGERS toward the tasting room, unpocketing his Xanax and downing a couple, as Evelyn's clichés of consolation continue in his head.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(ON THE PHONE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just hang in there, and who knows? After you get something else published, we can revisit this one. And next time we can try a different title.

Once back at the tent, he leans against it in a vain attempt to steady himself. The RUMBLE grows deafening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LARGE WINERY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now inside, Miles grabs the first DIRTY WINE GLASS he finds and shakes it out as he approaches the closest tasting station. He pushes his way to front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pourer offers the usual one-ounce dollop. Miles jacks it back, immediately extending his glass for more.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hit me again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
The same small amount is poured and downed. Once again Miles holds out his glass.

<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.

</MILES>
<POURER>

Miles slams a TWENTY-DOLLAR BILL on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just give me a full goddamn pour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
The pourer turns away to serve another party. Miles looks around indignantly, as though everyone should be sympathetic to this injustice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Miles boldly reaches over and pours himself a glass right up to the brim and beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<POURER>

In the ensuing struggle, the wine spills, and everyone nearby steps back.

<POURER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to have to leave, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POURER>
<DIRECTION>
The pourer signals to a SECURITY GUY at the door. Across the room Jack notices the disturbance and heads over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles hoists up the SPIT BUCKET, holds it aloft and starts to GUZZLE it. Wine cascades down the sides of his face, onto his shirt and even onto his shiny new shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Security Guy yanks the bucket away from Miles, and drags him toward the EXIT. Jack catches up.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(to the horrified onlookers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right. His mother just died.

EXT. BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two PELICANS soar low over the water. One of the DIVES, crashing into the water and disappearing from view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Miles sit on the hood of the Saab, gazing at the ocean, sharing a bottle of wine.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a dark laugh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that supposed to mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't give up. You're going to make it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.

Unable to respond, Jack looks up and down the beach.

EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY

The CAMERA lingers behind and PANS to reveal THE DEAD DOG, now covered with FLIES AND MAGGOTS.

<DIRECTION>
Jack and Miles pull into the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(lighting up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, look. There's Steph!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles broadly and honks his horn. Miles turns to see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STEPHANIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
seated halfway up on the motel stairs, her HELMET in her lap, watching patiently as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SAAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulls to a stop in a parking space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles masks his concern as he gets out of the car and reaches in the backseat for his Sears bag.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(calling out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Stephanie stands up and slowly descends the steps, as Jack reaches into the trunk and pulls out a BIG CUDDLY LION DOLL.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look what I got for our favorite girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Stephanie walks toward Jack as he waddles toward her hugging the lion. When they get close, Stephanie's face transforms with rage.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU MOTHERFUCKER!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHANIE>
<DIRECTION>
She swings her helmet and HITS JACK FULL IN THE FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack falls, blood spraying out of his nose. Stephanie stands over him and continues to BEAT HIM with her helmet as he rolls back and forth, protecting his head with the stuffed lion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles ineffectually attempts to stop her, dancing just out of range.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stephanie! Stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<STEPHANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHANIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can explain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<STEPHANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHANIE>
<DIRECTION>
With that she backs away. Glancing at her bloodied helmet, she tosses it onto the pavement before getting on her bike.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuckface!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Miles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You too!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHANIE>
<DIRECTION>
As she speeds away, Miles is left to comfort his wounded friend. The lion lies nearby, staring blankly at the sky.

<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Seated in the passenger seat and in great agony, Jack presses a BLOOD-SOAKED TOWEL against his face.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON A COSMOPOLITAN open to an article titled "24 Ways To Please Your Man."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles reads, while nearby a YOUNG BOY dry-heaves into a garbage can held by his FATHER. An OLD WOMAN parked in a wheelchair faces the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles is at a PAYPHONE. As he speaks he tries to peel off the metal LONG DISTANCE STICKER.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(ON THE PHONE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(bracing himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
What else to say? He hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He returns to his seat. A moment later he extends his legs to look at his new SHOES now STAINED WITH WINE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack emerges unsteadily from the bowels of the emergency room, his face purple and swollen beneath the HUGE WHITE BANDAGE that holds the NOSEGUARD in place. Miles walks with him toward the exit.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good thing you have a voice-over career.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's thoughtful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(disgusted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
They walk by us and out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET IN SOLVANG - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack sits in the Saab's passenger side with the seat almost fully reclined. When his agony allows him to open his eyes, he glares at the DANISH THEMED STORES lining the street. An ABELSKIVER MAKER plies his lofty trade in a nearby window. He hears a strange CLOMPING NOISE and turns his head to see a MAN IN WOODEN CLOGS walking noisily down the street, dressed in a TRADITIONAL DANISH COSTUME and carrying a TUBA. Jack takes a slug of wine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then Miles gets back in the car.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate this place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles tears open a paper bag and removes a bottle of pills. A closer angle reveals them as VICODIN.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a couple of these, and you'll learn to love it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Miles opens the bottle and hands Jack two PILLS.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two for you. And two for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack washes down the pills and passes the bottle to Miles, who follows suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WINDMILL INN JACUZZI - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Miles sit across from each other. For the first time we see LARGE PURPLE BRUISES on Jack's arms and chest.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh. Let me think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack takes a long lie-detecting look at Miles.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Just seems fishy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys lie on their respective beds staring at the TV. Jack gets up and lumbers slowly to the dresser MIRROR like a large dog who has just been neutered.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's it look like to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack turns to Miles, nodding and thinking. Then he looks back in the mirror.

Miles and Jack are finishing their SALADS in the rustic- themed restaurant festooned with animal trophies.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I'm thinking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack nods his head with no self-awareness or acknowledgment of the irony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOW TWO PLATES ARRIVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
mounded high with ribs, slaw, beans and butter-whipped mashed potatoes.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm. Mm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Their cheery, saftig blonde WAITRESS removes several FOIL PACKETS from her apron and places them on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And here're your Handi-wipes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, so that's what those are? For a second there I thought you guys were promoting safe sex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
The waitress OVER-LAUGHS and swipes a hand at her naughty customer.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be right back with more corn bread.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
Jack watches her go and leans in close to Miles.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I wouldn't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Now she comes back toward the table carrying a BIG BASKET. Beneath the hideous uniform, her nylons SH-SH-SH as she walks. When she arrives, she replenishes their corn bread basket using big TONGS. Jack watches attentively.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice technique there...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(checking her name tag)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Cammi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<CAMMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all in the wrist.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a moment later)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMMI>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we're from San Diego. Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<CAMMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMMI>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<CAMMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMMI>
<DIRECTION>
Miles looks away and sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to imagine him with a bandage and shorter hair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
As Cammi stares at Jack, her face transforms in astonishment.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Way. No way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMMI>
<DIRECTION>
Jack smiles and nods.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMMI>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you tell me where the bathroom is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<CAMMI>
<DIRECTION>
(her eyes barely leaving Jack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, sure, it's right over there, right past the buffalo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMMI>
<DIRECTION>
IN A WIDE SHOT --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles gets up and heads toward the bathroom as Jack's flirtation with Cammi continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera PANS with Miles as he walks by us and goes through the bathroom door, which closes behind him, filling the frame with the word "MEN."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TOOTHPICK DISPENSER as a finger tips it forward to dispense one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles stands by the cash register and PICKS HIS TEETH as he watches Jack finish speaking with Cammi and head his way.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're joking, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(seeing that he isn't)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack rests one hand on Miles's shoulder and drops his head, thinking how best to put it.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Miles. I know you're my friend and you care about me. And I know you disapprove. I respect that. But there are some things I have to do that you don't understand. You understand wine and literature and movies, but you don't understand my plight. And that's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MILES --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the disappointment in his friend deepens by the moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDER BLACK, SUPERIMPOSED --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRIDAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now comes the sound of hysterical KNOCKING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Despite the knocking, Miles remains motionless in bed, his expression serene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally he awakens and drags himself toward the door, opening it to find --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
silhouetted against the first rosy fingers of dawn. He is barefoot. In fact he is clad only in his UNDERWEAR. Hugging himself, he PANTS and SHIVERS.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus fucking Christ, it's freezing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He limps past Miles, yanks off the bed covers and wraps them around himself.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vicodin. Where's the Vicodin? My nose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles hands him the bottle, and Jack frantically pops a couple of pills, chewing them like candy. He sits down and bends over at the waist as though preparing for an airplane crash.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking chick's married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's five clicks, Jackson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles has now awakened to take in the absurdity of the whole scene, and he LAUGHS HARD. The blanketed bulge just sits there. Finally it looks up and shows its pitiful visage.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We gotta go back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way. No way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(a pitiful whine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Miles, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack stares straight ahead, breathing through his mouth as he considers this. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we've got to get my wallet! Those rings are irreplaceable! We've got to get them, Miles! I fucked up! I know I fucked up, okay? I fucked up. You gotta help me. You gotta help me. Pleeeease!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack now descends to a level of wretchedness and desperation that Miles has never seen before in Jack, or in anyone else for that matter.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God, please... Oh God. I know I'm bad. I know I did a bad thing. Help me, Miles. Just this one thing, this one last thing. I can't lose Christine. I can't. I'm nothing without her. Please, Miles, please... uuuuu... uuuuuu.... uuuuuuu......
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
No longer able to form words, Jack is reduced to emitting low, primitive sounds. Snot flows from beneath his bandaged nose.

INT./EXT. SAAB - MORNING

Miles drives in the early-morning light. Jack is now subdued, quieted by his pain and exhaustion.

</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what the fuck were you thinking?

</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.

<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cutting it a little close, don't you think?

(off Jack's silence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah! This is it. There's her car.

Miles pulls over and cuts the engine.

(sarcastic, clearing his throat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>

Miles gives Jack a withering look. Jack reaches for the DOOR HANDLE.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you. I'll get it myself.

EXT. CAMMI'S STREET - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles crosses the street and approaches --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMMI'S HOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles presses his ear against the front door. Nothing. Then he notices --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SLIDING GLASS DOOR a few feet away, just barely cracked open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILES creeps over, sticks his hand into the open space and pulls back the curtain to reveal --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LIVING ROOM the is hideously MESSY. Draped over a deformed beanbag chair are JACK'S LEVI'S.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles gathers his courage, carefully slides open the glass door, and creeps inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAMMI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A furtive search of Jack's pockets reveals NOTHING. Then Miles notices a HIGH-PITCHED SOUND wafting from an open door down a short HALLWAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles feverishly begins foraging through the debris on the floor. Again nothing. Meanwhile the noise from the bedroom grows louder -- female MOANING in odd rhythmic unison with a MAN'S VOICE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE HALLWAY --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles gets on ALL FOURS and starts crawling, weaving his way through a trail of shoes and clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nearing the open door, the sounds grow more distinct --
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<CAMMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMMI>
<DIRECTION>
Miles peers around the corner of the open door to see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAMMI'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cammi is TIED to the faux brass headboard. A BIG GUY slams away at her. In the corner a soundless TV shows a PRESIDENTIAL PRESS CONFERENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<CAMMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMMI>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<CAMMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMMI>
<DIRECTION>
Whoa!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles manages to tear his eyes away from this nature documentary and scan the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IRIS IN --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
to the WALLET atop the dresser.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles's eyes dart back and forth between the couple and the wallet. His HEART BEATING LOUDLY, he goes for it. He scrambles to his feet, dashes across the room, seizes the wallet and tears out. Behind him he hears --
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fuck was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<CAMMI>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMMI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles comes flying out of the sliding glass door, followed swiftly by the man, who is of course STARK NAKED. And he's fast for a man his size.

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get him!

<DIRECTION>
INT. SAAB - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack is reclined in the passenger seat FAST ASLEEP. On the radio NPR'S CARL KASSEL reads the news.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE DRIVER'S WINDOW --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles comes sprinting towards us, mere steps ahead of Cammi's naked husband. Finding the car door locked, Miles knocks loudly on the glass, startling Jack awake.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open up! Jesus! Open the goddamn door!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Jack flips the electric locks just in time for Miles to get in before --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHUMP! The guy's BELLY hits the window. He pounds on the roof before trying the door, now re-locked.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You motherfuckers! I'll kill you! I'll kill you motherfuckers!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Miles starts the car and begins to drive away. The guy tries to keep up but can't, running barefoot on asphalt. Jack turns to look --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUT THE BACK WINDOW --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guy recedes in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
removes the rings from the wallet.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did it! You fucking did it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
They LAUGH and SLAP HANDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MILES --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For all his failures, this time he did something right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shades are drawn. Jack is CRASHED OUT on the bed, snoring loudly. Miles folds his shirts and trousers -- readying his bags for departure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At one moment he stops and watches his friend sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A KNOCK at the door. Miles goes to answer it, but once his hand is on the knob, he pauses. If we're perceptive, we will know he's hoping against hope that it's Maya.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens it. It's just the MAID with her big CART.
</DIRECTION>
<MAID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Housekeeping.

Miles drives while Jack stares out the window, WATCHING THE LANDSCAPE CHANGE as they leave wine country.

Jack's eyes close, but his lips spread into a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep. Quite a day.

EXT. FILLING STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles pumps the gas, while nearby Jack stretches his legs. As Miles puts the nozzle back in place --
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want me to drive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're so negative.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles replaces the hose and screws on the gas cap.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, let me drive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine. You rest.

	I feel like driving.

INT. SAAB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the car makes its way back toward the freeway, Jack looks over at Miles and slows the car to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles obeys. Without hesitation, Jack accelerates and JUMPS THE CURB, heading into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VACANT LOT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Saab plows INTO A TREE.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said it looked like a car accident.

</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck!

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll pay for it.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. VACANT LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They get out to inspect the damage. The hood is slightly crumpled, and the front fender is bent.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need a new car anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles looks at his friend, incredulous.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said I'd pay for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
MOMENTS LATER --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trunk is open, and the guys are unloading their cases of wine. Miles notices that one box is DRIPPING.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You broke some.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever. Sorry.

</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not whatever. You fucking derelict.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
MOMENTS LATER --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles looks on as Jack hoists a FOUNDATION BLOCK toward the open driver's door of the Saab.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Miles waves his hand in a gesture of "Get it over with."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grunting with effort, Jack leans inside the car and drops the foundation block onto the GAS PEDAL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Direct hit! Jack leaps backward and hits the dirt just in time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles and Jack watch the driverless Saab race toward the tree, its speed increasing. But just before hitting it, the car drifts to one side and SAILS RIGHT PAST.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, fuck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
The car zooms wildly across the vacant lot and, missing the tree, continues on until CRASHING THROUGH A FENCE and finally toppling headlong into a CEMENT TRENCH. Only the back of the car remains visible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The whole thing is finished in a matter of seconds. Still frozen in place, Miles and Jack turn slowly to each other.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. I've got Triple A.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY

The Saab approaches the end of the line.

AT THE FRONT PORCH --

Miles has helped Jack carry his bags and the wine. He plops the last case down.

<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. That about does it.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
They give each other a brief manly back-slappy hug.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love you, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back at you.

Miles heads toward the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MILES>
<DIRECTION>
(over his shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, why wasn't I injured?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were wearing your belt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
BACK AT HIS CAR --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles gets in and watches through the side window as Mrs. Erganian opens the front door and welcomes Jack with shock and dismay. Jack points back at --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILES raising one hand in a feeble wave. The camera slowly MOVES CLOSER as he continues to watch --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
weaving his story of woe. He's a great actor when he wants to be. Mr. Erganian and a mortified Christine come to the door too. Mr. Erganian takes a few steps toward the car to get a better look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERY CLOSE ON MILES --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watching the drama play out. Then his eyes drop as he momentarily loses himself in melancholy. This reverie is interrupted by --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE VOICE OF AN ARMENIAN PRIEST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Startled, Miles turns to look at --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PRIEST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who is singing the BLESSING OF THE RINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are now in --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARMENIAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The church is packed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE RINGS as the priest holds them aloft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
If those rings could talk... Jack shoots a quick look at Miles, who looks right back. The priest continues his blessing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARMENIAN CHURCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WEDDING FAMILIES greet the exiting guests in a RECEIVING LINE. Smiling and exuberant, Jack seems utterly at home as the new groom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles watches the scene, not without melancholy. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Miles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
Miles turns and looks up to see Victoria, standing one step above him. Just behind her is her NEW HUSBAND. He exudes the quiet confidence of a successful businessman who played college football, takes expensive skiing and sailing vacations, and hasn't read a novel since high school.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Vicki.

(taking her in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.

From his spot hovering over Miles, Ken leans down and offers his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<KEN>

</VICTORIA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's great.

</MILES>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how're you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's happening with your book?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Universally rejected. Strike three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
Just then a BLACK LINCOLN NAVIGATOR pulls up alongside the curb. The passenger side window is halfway down, and the sounds of Adult Contemporary Jazz waft out. Victoria gives Ken a little wave.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
<DIRECTION>
(shifting gears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not me. I'm not drinking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>

</VICTORIA>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
As she gets in the car and cruises away, Miles glances back at --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RECEIVING LINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- where Mike Erganian is introducing Jack to some dear old FRIENDS. Mike throws a loving arm around his new son-in-law, and Jack is drawn into Mike's bosom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HAND-PAINTED SIGN, attached to a STOP SIGH and decorated with balloons, reads: "RECEPTION THIS WAY!" with an arrow pointing RIGHT.

One by one, CARS are making a right turn. But when his turn comes, Miles turns LEFT.

The Saab pull up outside. Miles leaves the car idling as he sprints inside. Moments later he sprints back to his car, this time carrying SOMETHING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FAST FOOD PLACE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His bowtie undone, Miles sits at a booth eating. He washes down a bite by draining the contents of a big wax-coated soft drink cup.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He brings the cup to his lap and refills it from a BOTTLE OF WINE hidden next to him. As he sets the bottle back down, we glimpse the label: 1961 Cheval Blanc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes another sip. As the camera MOVES CLOSER, all the complex emotions inspired by the wine ripple across Miles's face.

Miles sits behind his desk at the front of the class.

Miles enters his tiny apartment. He loosens his tie and puts down his satchel.

On his way to the kitchen, he presses a button on his ANSWERING MACHINE. As it plays, he opens the REFRIGERATOR and looks inside.

Miles FREEZES, not wanting to miss a single syllable.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for your letter. I would have called you sooner, but I think I've needed some time to think about everything that happened and what you wrote to me. Another reason I didn't call sooner is that I wanted to finish your book, which I finally did last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Miles's heart pounds.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's really lovely, Miles. You're so good with words. Who cares if it's not getting published? There are so many beautiful and painful things about it. Did you really go through all that? It must have been awfully hard. And the sister character -- Jesus, what a wreck. But I have to say I was really confused by the ending. Did the father finally commit suicide, or what?

	Anyway, it's turned cold and rainy here lately. But I like winter. So listen, if you ever do decide to come up here again, you should let me know. I would say stop by the Hitching Post, but to tell you the truth I'm not sure how much longer I'm going to be working there. I'm going to graduate soon so I'll probably relocate. We'll see.
