EXT. ALL-WHITE HIGH SCHOOL, WESTERN CAPE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big, rich, powerhouse all-white high school located near the freeway into Cape Town. The RUGBY FIELDS are immaculate. FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BOYS in striped rugby jerseys train with total intensity under the critical eye of the COACH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Right ACROSS THE BOUNDARY FENCE from the rugby fields is an area of WASTE LAND leading up to the freeway. There, BLACK AND "COLORED" (MIXED-RACE) BOYS of the same age play a loose game of soccer with a tennis ball. Most of them have bare feet and threadbare, dirty clothes, most of them are noticeably smaller and skinnier than the white boys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two cultures, separated by more than the high boundary fence.

SUPER TITLE: SOUTH AFRICA, FEBRUARY 11, 1990 A COMMOTION ON THE FREEWAY intrudes on the soccer game. Horns honking, cars pull over onto the shoulder, people jump out.

Lead by police motorbikes, then patrol cars, a white Mercedes approaches, heading towards Cape Town. Whoever is in the Mercedes has stopped traffic.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The soccer players abandon their game and run for the freeway, whistling and shouting.

The rugby players are more disciplined -- or obedient -- and do not acknowledge the commotion until the convoy passes right by them. The coach shakes his head in disgust.

A short, STOCK-FOOTAGE MONTAGE which spans the tumultuous four years between NELSON MANDELA'S release from prison and his inauguration as President of South Africa.

Footage would include:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- Mandela's release from prison - negotiations with the apartheid regime - scenes of white fear and emigration - the horrifying sectarian violence leading up to the

<ELECTIONS>
<DIRECTION>
- the khaki-clad AWB (Afrikaner right wing) attack on the World Trade Center (where negotiations were taking place) - the lifting of economic sanctions and cultural boycotts - the lifting of the international ban on the Springbok rugby team and immediate Test match losses to New Zealand and Australia. - popular black leader Chris Hani's assassination by white
</DIRECTION>
<RIGHT_WINGERS>
<DIRECTION>
- black retaliation - Mandela's frantic intervention to keep the country from going up in flames - the election itself, with those incredible images of thousands and thousands of people, black and white, lining up patiently, some to vote for the first time in their lives - the African National Congress victory - Mandela's inauguration as President, where he delivers the FAMOUS WORDS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another, and suffer the indignity of being the skunk of the world."

INT. MANDELA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark. We can make out the FORM OF A TALL MAN SLEEPING ALONE at the very edge of the big bed, as if not wanting to rumple the blankets too much.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the bedside table, the clock clicks from 4:59 to 5:00. The man's eyes open in the dark, instantly awake. He reaches out, switches on the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NELSON ROLIHLAHLA MANDELA, 76, sits up and gets out of bed in one movement. He has the physical vigor and energy of someone twenty years younger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second he is up, he turns around and makes his bed, leaving it as flawlessly smooth as a hospital bed. Or a prison bunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For this is the discipline of twenty seven years behind bars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dressed in a tracksuit and cross-trainers, Mandela comes down the stairs and heads for the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a nice, big house but it is amazingly modest for the President of a wealthy nation, and arguably the most famous man on the planet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mandela steps outside, closes his front door quietly, takes a moment to savor the air. It is bone dry and cold -- typical conditions in the Highveld at this time of year.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is so quiet that, for a moment, it seems as if Mandela is completely alone in the world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The big yard is fenced. There is a small GUARD HOUSE at the driveway gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Mandela steps away from the house, A UNIFORMED SOUTH AFRICAN POLICEMAN IN THE GUARDHOUSE pushes the button that opens the gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the gate begins to open we see that there are TWO GREY BMWs parked either side of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREY BMW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LINGA MOONSAMY comes to full alert as the gate opens. He is a big, scowling man dressed in a suit. He checks the load on a pistol, tucks it into his shoulder holster.
</DIRECTION>
<LINGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here he comes. Like clockwork.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINGA>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It makes him such an easy target.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JASON>
<DIRECTION>
Behind Linga, in the back seat, sits JASON TSHABALALA, a naturally tense and suspicious man. Both of them are hollow- eyed, exhausted, running on adrenaline.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They get out of the BMW, fast and quiet. This does not look good.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
As Mandela walks out through the gate, Jason and Linga intercept him.

<MANDELA>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning boys. How are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANDELA>
<DIRECTION>
Jason is Mandela's head of personal security, Linga his number one bodyguard. They are both former "terrorists", and they are utterly devoted to Mandela.

</LINGA>
<MANDELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANDELA>
<DIRECTION>
Mandela picks up the pace. Jason and Linga fall back, so that they are a few steps behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They share a quick look. They hate this walk. It scares them. There's no way for it to be anything but completely unsanitary, from a security point of view.

Mandela strides along the big, wide, tree-lined streets. Jason and Linga shadow him, eyes and ears alert.

Mandela, Jason and Linga pass a HUGE POSTER OF MANDELA in the window of CORNER GROCERY. Mandela does not react to this giant picture of himself, Jason and Linga do, proudly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(A GENERAL NOTE: starting with the window of this grocery, there are pictures of Mandela everywhere. Magazine covers, newspaper centerfolds, T-shirts, children's art -- as if to make up for all the time Mandela's image and words were banned.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- until they HEAR THE SOUND OF THE VAN tearing towards them. They turn, SEE HEADLIGHTS VEERING TO THEIR SIDE OF THE STREET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOTH MEN DROP THEIR HANDS TO THEIR GUNS. Linga steps in front of Mandela, shielding him, Jason steps out wide, ready for anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mandela is completely calm. The van screeches to a halt just past them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GUY jumps out of the van holding a tied BUNDLE OF NEWSPAPERS, which he drops with a thump at the grocery door. The guy doesn't see them. The delivery van is gone before the newspapers stop moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mandela heads for the newspapers -- he wants to see the headlines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason and Linga take their hands off their guns, but they do not relax. These are dangerous times.

GO IN ON THE TOP NEWSPAPER, which shows a PHOTO OF THE INAUGURATION, and the following words, in Afrikaans: HE CAN WIN AN ELECTION, BUT CAN HE RUN A COUNTRY?

<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does it say?

Mandela turns and marches for home. Jason and Linga fall in behind him. In the east, the first milky hint of day.

INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - BEFORE DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house is now bustling with activity. A pretty member of the KITCHEN STAFF sets a single place at the head of a big, formal dining table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LADY CHEF stirs the porridge, a KITCHEN ASSISTANT cuts fresh fruit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mandela's PERSONAL SECRETARY, MARY marches out of her small office with a STACK OF CORRESPONDENCE AND FIVE NEWSPAPERS, places them neatly next to the table setting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, Mandela is surrounded by men. Inside, he has surrounded himself with women of all shapes, colors and ages, to make up for twenty seven years without.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MANDELA SHAVES UPSTAIRS IN THE BATHROOM. The razor is dull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mandela opens drawers looking for another. He opens a drawer that is empty but for a WOMAN'S BEADED BRACELET, broken and shedding tiny colored beads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mandela looks for it for a moment, then closes the drawer, looks at himself in the mirror. Mostly, Mandela's face is warm, animated, energetic and this is how we see him, almost all the time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But, sometimes, his face can be a remote, sphinx-like mask that conceals all emotion, all feeling. This is his prison face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is the face that looks back at Mandela, right now, in the mirror. It is the face of a man whose long, hard journey has marked his very soul.
</DIRECTION>

Expressionless, Mandela shaves himself with the dull razor.

Mr. Pienaar turns and addresses his son, FRANCOIS PIENAAR, 27, a big, blond, almost-handsome man with a fighter's face and mangled ears. Brutal toughness and honor in his features. A powerful physical presence, possibly dangerous. Francois drips with sweat, wears running clothes. Whatever he does, he is strong, fit and driven.

EXT. UNION BUILDINGS, PRETORIA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magnificent, sweeping government buildings made of carved African field stone, with an Italian tiled roof, situated on a hill overlooking Pretoria. The seat of power.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Today, the entrance is mobbed with a huge, joyous, multi- racial throng, plus news crews from all over the world. Lots of new South African flags evident.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move through the throng and swoop up into the air, so that we can soar along the outside of the building and LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOWS into the offices of state --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- where people who worked for the De Klerk regime are packing up, in anticipation of being booted out by the Mandela regime. These characters run the gamut from little old Afrikaner tea ladies in tears, to the stoic fossils of grand apartheid. They are all white. A good third of the offices are already deserted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The deserted offices have open doors. Through a window, through an open door, we see Mandela and his bodyguards striding down a Union Building hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We swoop in through the window --

INT. UNION BUILDING HALLWAYS - DAY

PORTRAITS of the architects and champions of apartheid look down sternly on them as they pass.

They pass a WORKER hanging a PORTRAIT OF MANDELA next to one of De Klerk, the previous President.

Mandela, on the other hand, looks into the empty offices, and into the offices being packed up.

Lots of OLD SOUTH AFRICAN FLAGS -- the blue, white and orange apartheid flag -- make a defiant statement against the NEW SOUTH AFRICAN FLAGS ringing the stadium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the field, THE RUGBY TEAMS ASSEMBLE and face each other in two lines. The BRITISH LIONS in their white on white with black and red trim, the SPRINGBOKS in their green and gold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like their supporters, the Springboks are all white, but for one man, who is "colored" (mixed race).

Big, tough, brutal-looking men. Scary. (We may or may not notice Francois Pienaar, standing at the head of the line of Springboks.)

Behind the line of cops, in the tunnel, we find JASON AND ALL THE OTHER BODYGUARDS but for Linga. They are keyed-up, intense -- none more so than Jason.
</DIRECTION>
<JASON>

They nod. They are like the players at game time, only the stakes are much higher. Jason looks deeper into the tunnel, straightens up.

Mandela strides down the tunnel towards them, wearing a dark suit. Big crowds energize him. His eyes are alive with excitement.

One pace behind him, like a huge, dark shadow, comes Linga.

Mandela gives Jason a look, Jason nods.

We follow Mandela and the bodyguards out of the tunnel --

-- onto the field, towards the waiting teams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd rise to their feet. Lots of them jeer Mandela, lots cheer. All the old South African flags are waved at him defiantly -- plus some new ones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mandela waves to them all, smiling proudly. To him, a crowd is an opportunity to make new friends. But he stays in the center of the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason and crew are hyper-alert, a human fence around Mandela.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mandela reaches the rugby players.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Waiting for him at the head of the Springbok line, wearing the NUMBER 6 JERSEY and captain's armband, is FRANCOIS PIENAAR. Now we know what he does.

Mandela shakes hands down the line of Springboks, then returns, shaking hands with the British Lions. Quick, perfunctory handshakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Mandela does this, we take BODYGUARD POV SNAPSHOTS of the crowd, increasingly keyed-up and restless. Time to play rugby.
</DIRECTION>

Mandela finishes, waves to the crowd, and begins the walk along the center of the field, back to the tunnel.

Crowd noise increases. They know the opening whistle is about to blow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, Mandela sees something in the crowd, at field level.

Some shake his hand, some -- very pointedly -- do not.

The crowd noise takes on an ugly undertone -- Mandela is delaying the rugby.

Mandela is undeterred. He's into this one-on-one outreach. He turns, looks for more hands to shake --

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ORANGE WHIZZES PAST MANDELA'S HEAD, explodes juicily on the field.

Mandela didn't see it, doesn't react. If anything, his smile widens as he heads across the field. The bodyguards close around him protectively, get him back to the tunnel.

Two international front rows come together with bone- crunching force.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Huge, violent men grunt like bulls. The crowd roar vibrates the stadium. The scrum -- a phalanx of eight men locked together against eight -- wheels, buckles, then steadies under the watchful eye of the referee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fanning out behind each scrum are the backs -- faster, more glamorous players who will run with the ball, or kick it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lions scrumhalf thrusts the ball into the maw of the scrum, the huge men lock up against each other with maximum force.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ball comes out the back of the Lions' scrum, the scrumhalf dive-passes it away to the backs, who flick it out laterally to the wing, with lightning speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wing lofts a delicate kick just over the onrushing Springbok defenders. The Lions charge the ball, which bounces erratically --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- right into the hands of the man who kicked it. One last burst of speed, one quick juke to avoid a desperation tackle, and the wing scores in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the Lions kicker gets ready to convert the try, we find the Springboks huddling under their goal posts, hands on their hips, stunned.

At the center of the huddle Pienaar bleeds behind his gum guard as, furiously, he tries to inject some fire into his team.

One last, bloody, violent bit of play -- then, mercifully, the final whistle blows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Final score: LIONS - 32 SPRINGBOKS - 15.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lions celebrate. The Springboks head off the field, heads down, shoulders bowed in defeat -- none more bitterly disappointed or bloodier than Francois Pienaar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the stands, the unheard of happens -- the Springboks are booed by their own fans. Not by everybody, but by enough.

We STAY WITH THE `BOKS as they trudge across the field, then clatter along the concrete tunnel to their dressing room.

INT. LOFTUS VERSFELD STADIUM - SPRINGBOK DRESSING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The atmosphere is absolutely dismal as the men undress and shower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nobody catches anybody else's eye. Huge, powerful, pale bodies have been ploughed purple with rake marks, bruises and roasties. Plus, one dark body -- that of CHESTER WILLIAMS, a skilled wing from the Cape, a reserved and private man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pienaar takes off his green and gold jersey, sits, begins taking off his cleats. His body hurts. He has been raked, scratched, bruised, and his ankle is swollen.

IN HIS BEDROOM, Mandela pauses to take off his dressing gown. He looks at his bed. It is as smooth and as blank as a sheet of paper.

He peels back the bedclothes at one corner, slides under them and pauses for a moment while reaching for the light switch. He switches off the light and lies down, still and straight.

A very poor township outside Johannesburg. A stark reminder of how much work Mandela has ahead of him. A STAMPEDE OF KIDS runs by.

We FOLLOW THE KIDS and find a SMALL, BEAT-UP CHURCH. A noisy LINE OF THREADBARE KIDS leads from outside into the church. There is a pecking order in the line, based on size.

At a table near the altar, the kids rummage through bags of second-hand clothes under the watchful eye of MRS. COLEMAN, a stout and charitable woman. Next to her, MRS. DLAMINI hands out a lollipop and says --
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_DLAMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God bless you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_DLAMINI>
<DIRECTION>
-- to each kid. The clothes and lollipops move fast, rhythm kept by Mrs. Dlamini's "God bless yous".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last bag of clothes empties fast as the line of kids reduces until there is only ONE SMALL BOY (SIPHO) left and only one article of clothing. An old SPRINGBOK RUGBY PRACTISE JERSEY. Green and gold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sipho could use it. His clothes are more holes than anything else. He looks at the Springbok jersey mournfully.

	You're a very lucky boy. It's a real Springbok practise jersey! It's a bit big, but it's warm and it'll last for ever!

Pienaar relaxes, visibly. This is small talk he can handle. This is Mandela's gift.

	The truth is, sir, you never play at a hundred percent, no matter what.

A KNOCK at the door, and MRS. BRITS the old Afrikaner tea lady enters, carrying a laden tea tray.

Mandela stands again, immediately.

	Ah, Mrs. Brits --

Eyes twinkling, Mrs. Brits puts the tea tray down on the coffee table in front of them. The finest china, cookies on a plate.

	Mrs. Brits, this is Francois Pienaar. He's the captain of the Springboks.

Mrs. Brits leaves. Mandela does not sit until the door closes behind her. Pienaar only sits after he does.

Mandela pours tea for both of them.

Both men have big hands. Fine china dwarfed and threatened.

<DIRECTION>
In the exact moment that both their hands hold the same saucer, Mandela looks Pienaar in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<MANDELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a very difficult job.

Pienaar grins. True.

<MANDELA>

	It is not so difficult to get people to do their best. And I imagine that anybody who plays for their country does their best, almost automatically.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Or they wouldn't be chosen in the first place.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Yes. But to get people to be better than that? Better than they think they can be? Now, that is difficult, I find.

</MANDELA>
<PIENAAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes sir, it is.

<DIRECTION>
(searching for the right WORD)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... inspiration, perhaps.

Pienaar is engrossed. This is a master lesson on leadership, from a master.

	Yes! I remember when I was a guest at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. The whole stadium welcomed me with a song.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At the time the future -- our future -- seemed very bleak. But to hear that song, in voices from all over our planet ... it made me very proud to be South African. It helped me to come home and do better. It allowed me to expect more of myself.

<DIRECTION>
Thirty completely wiped-out athletes. Some are too tired to shower, some have made it that far, but are too tired to change.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pienaar has showered and changed and slumps next to his locker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SPRINGBOK MANAGER enters, followed by the RUGBY PRESIDENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pienaar and the boys drag themselves upright.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Rugby President looks them over as if they were his very own stable of race horses -- a stable he's not entirely sure he likes.

<RUGBY_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Afternoon men. It's good to see you working so hard. I have a short announcement.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As part of the PR buildup to the World Cup, you will be conducting coaching clinics in townships all over the country.

<DIRECTION>
The players greet this announcement with complete silence.

	The very top.

The Rugby President turns on his heel, and leaves, followed by the Manager.

The players say nothing for a long moment, but body language alone shows that they are completely disgusted.

	<DIALOGUE>
	We're looking at the remains of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, America, which was destroyed today in a massive explosion.

<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to reveal that we are in Mandela's offices. Barbara, Mary, other assistants look on. So do the bodyguards. All faces stunned, appalled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mandela approaches slowly from his office, drawn in by the horrible, irresistible images. He stands behind his people.
</DIRECTION>
<TV_ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one has claimed responsibility yet, but authorities say that the timing and target mark this as the work of white, right-wing fanatics. An act of revenge for the FBI killings in Waco, Texas.

<DIRECTION>
Jason and Linga share a pointed look. South Africa is a global leader in white, right-wing fanatics.

Then, Jason realizes that Mandela is standing right next to him.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOWNSHIP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same township where Sipho rejected the Springbok rugby jersey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At one edge we find what passes for a SOCCER FIELD. Just a littered rectangular expanse of Highveld winter dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TV VANS and a very nervous SPRINGBOK MANAGEMENT CREW drive to the edge of the field, stop, get out --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and are immediately mobbed by THREADBARE, EXCITED KIDS, many of them begging for cash and candy. SIPHO in the thick of things.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the Springbok management crew pulls a ROLLED BANNER on two spiked poles out of their van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mallet and banner in hand, the management crew head to the edge of the field, mobbed by shouting, whistling township kids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They hammer one pole into the ground, unroll the banner (seen from the back so that we can't read the words), get set to hammer the second pole into the ground --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- except that there is a SMASHED BEER BOTTLE in the way. Broken glass everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look at the broken glass, then turn and look across the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Broken glass glints in the low sun, all over the field.

INT. LUXURY BUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bus hits a rut in the dirt road with an almighty jolt, which wakes the sleeping Springboks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look out of the windows and see the absolutely hellish outskirts of the township. Every possible incarnation of poverty, as far as the eye can see.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This shocks them. Most of them have never been anywhere like this township.

<DIRECTION>
As the kids approach the bus, they dump their broken glass under the banner, which reads --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE TEAM, ONE COUNTRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- brown, green, white, blue shards tinkling and piling up, like lethal jewels, backlit in the low winter sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the big kids gets the R100. Attention focussed on
</DIRECTION>
<THAT>
<DIRECTION>
-- until the bus door opens with a loud hiss of hydraulics and the Springboks exit, one by one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pienaar first, with a huge NET BAG OF PRACTISE BALLS over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Springboks are all so big, so strong, so healthy, they look like gods, or aliens, emerging from a spaceship. The kids go quiet, awed and uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until Chester Williams steps off the bus, and there is a collective sigh of recognition and wonder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, the kids can relate to the Springboks. Even Sipho, who looks on from the side of the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Springbok management notes it.

The TV crews note it.

<PIENAAR>

</PIENAAR>
<DIRECTION>
Chester boots the ball out over the crowd, high and incredibly far in the thin winter air. (60 yards, easily.)

Pienaar tosses balls to the others.
</DIRECTION>
<PIENAAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's do our best.

The kids go after them. Sipho stays on the sideline.

BEGIN RUGBY CLINIC MONTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barely controlled chaos. Each Springbok works with one ball and a group of kids. There are THREE THEMES to this montage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIRST, a primer on the basic rules of rugby, with demonstrations.
</DIRECTION>
<SPRINGBOK_HOOKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who here knows the first rule of rugby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPRINGBOK_HOOKER>

	Only hit the other players when the ref isn't looking!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOWNSHIP_KID>
<DIRECTION>
Laughter. A good ice-breaker.
</DIRECTION>
<PIENAAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. The first rule of rugby is you can only pass the ball backwards or sideways.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIENAAR>
<DIRECTION>
Pienaar demonstrates. (NOTE: All the rules are demonstrated.)
</DIRECTION>
<VARIOUS_SPRINGBOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- If you drop the ball, or pass it forwards, you scrum for possession. - This is a scrum. - You kick forwards. If you kick it out of bounds, you throw it back in to a lineout. - This is a lineout. - You score in four ways: a try, when you dot the ball down behind the try line. That's five points. - Another two points when you convert the try by kicking the ball through the uprights. - Three points for a penalty kick. - Three points for a drop kick. - Have you got all that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VARIOUS_SPRINGBOKS>
<KIDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!

<SPRINGBOK_HOOKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Agh, bugger it, let's just run and pass. Whoever drops the ball does pushups!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPRINGBOK_HOOKER>
<DIRECTION>
SECOND, as the players work with the kids, they get into it. Much to their own surprise, they enjoy the energy, they enjoy the kids, they enjoy the giving. Even the grumpiest, most conservative Springbok.
</DIRECTION>
<SPRINGBOK_LOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Who wants to scrum against me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPRINGBOK_LOCK>
<DIRECTION>
One huge man scrums against a horde of kids. He pushes them backwards with a roar -- then lets them push him backwards. They love it, the cameras love it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE THIRD THEME shows the emergence of Chester Williams as the face of the Springboks. The crowd of kids around him is twice as big as any other player's crew. Given Chester's basically shy nature, he finds it all a bit overwhelming. The TV cameras follow him even more closely than they follow Pienaar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT ONE POINT, an errant pass puts a rugby ball right at Sipho's feet. He hesitates, then picks it up. He doesn't just hold it, he feels it. END THE MONTAGE as the luxury bus pulls away, surrounded by a horde of cheering kids, many of whom hold new rugby balls under their arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One blast on the horn, one answering cheer from the kids and the bus slowly accelerates away.

The entire Springbok squad has been on a training run through Cape Town, on ordinary streets, through ordinary people.

(This is unthinkable in top-level sports anywhere else. It really happened.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When they are recognized, drivers toot their horns, pedestrians cheer, kids on bicycles ride with them (mostly still white).

As they approach the hotel grounds, Pienaar surges to the front, so that he can give them a message as they pass through the hotel gate.

Room dark but for one small desk light. Pienaar stands at the window, looking out across Cape Town. He is deep in thought.

Pienaar turns away from the window, goes to the desk, where, under one small light, we see "Invictus", the poem Mandela wrote out by hand.

Pienaar begins reading it. There is a soft knock at his door. Pienaar goes to it, opens it. It is Nerine, accompanied by a cop.

Pienaar nods at the cop, steps back so that Nerine can enter. As soon as the door closes behind her, Nerine says:

<DIRECTION>
The Springbok lock rises high into the air, supported on all sides, takes the ball out of the air perfectly --

-- just as the Wallaby pack closes in and huge men meet with an adrenaline-fueled crunch of bodies.

Back to action on the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The highlights we see here should match the rugby primer we saw in the township. This continues the education of those who do not know rugby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So, for instance, we see a ball knocked forward, and the resulting scrum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a ball kicked out of bounds, and the resulting lineout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see scintillating passing, rucking, mauling, tackling, strategic kicking at it's very best. Both teams are crisp and strong.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT SHOTS OF THE RUGBY MATCH --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- with SHOTS OF THE SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS (snipers, lots and lots of uniformed cops inside and out, sniffer dogs etc. all overseen by Jason) --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- with SHOTS OF THE CROWD, which, unlike the earlier test against the Lions, is completely and passionately united behind the Springboks (all commentators talk about the extraordinary passion of the crowd, that day) --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- always returning to the VIP BOX, where something interesting is taking place right behind Mandela: Linga Moonsamy, the rugby scorner, the soccer lover, loses his scowling reserve and gets sucked into the game.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When a ball soars between the uprights and everyone in the box groans, Linga leans towards Hendrick and asks:

<DIRECTION>
ACTION ON THE FIELD, as a Wallaby drive combining backs and forwards moves relentlessly towards the Springbok try line. Six times the drive is stopped by Springbok tackling, but the Wallabies keep possession and, on the seventh wave of the assault score a beautiful open try, which is converted.

Nerves in the box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But not on the field, as Pienaar starts a drive with a tackle we feel ourselves, resulting in a change of possession --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and a stunning, open field try scored in the corner by the Springbok wing, who raises his fist in the air, after juking the last Wallaby to try and tackle him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd roars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the VIP box, Mandela is on his feet, shaking hands with everyone he can reach, including Linga and Hendrick, and the waiter.

<DIRECTION>
Two things to note: The crowd roar grows and grows and grows and is echoed in the VIP box. Even Jason turns to look at the action on the field -- but only for a second. Also, this match serves as the coming-out party for the SPRINGBOK FLY HALF, who scores 22 of South Africa's 27 points this day.

The man is a major flirt, and really enjoying himself. But, once again, he is dancing with a stranger --

We follow the crowd into a big sports bar --

<DIRECTION>
INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- where the Springboks are pounding beers and blowing off the steam of months of training grind, plus a huge win.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even though most of the players are with their wives or girlfriends, pretty, single women crowd them, two and three deep, men pay for round after round of beers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pienaar and Nerine are part of the action. Then Pienaar gets a TEXT MESSAGE which makes him shake his head, give Nerine a chagrined look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs the Springbok closest to him, puts his mouth near the player's ear and screams again the hubbub:
</DIRECTION>
<PIENAAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	COACH'S RUN, NINE A.M. SHARP. PASS IT ON.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIENAAR>
<DIRECTION>
The Springbok shakes his head -- bloody coach -- grabs the player next to him, repeats it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pienaar watches the message travelling through his team -- and grins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, something catches his eye on one of the big overhead TV's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE TV: news footage of the Mandela victory boogie. The boogie is followed by a quick "How far we have come" type of montage. One of the images shows an island ringed by rough surf.

Ahead of the ferry, one of the most notorious island prisons in modern history --

-- ROBBEN ISLAND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROBBEN ISLAND - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robben Island lies only eight miles from the mainland. It is two miles long, with sandy beaches full of penguins and seals. It would be pretty --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- but for its MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON. Concrete, barbed wire, guard towers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(In 1995, the political prisoner wing was shut, but the island still housed criminal prisoners, so the island still had the feel of real incarceration. Today, it is a tourist destination.)

As they approach the island, a sense of dark history settles over the Springboks and their partners.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Section B is the bleak political wing. Tiny cells line each side of a damp concrete hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PRISON GUARD shows the Springboks into the hallway, and they dwarf it, as they stand there, shocked. Shocked at what was done in their names. This group is as quiet as we have ever seen them.
</DIRECTION>
<PIENAAR>
	<DIALOGUE>

They reach a cell with a piece of white cardboard on the door, showing the number 466/64 -- MANDELA'S PRISON NUMBER.
</DIRECTION>
<PRISON_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That means he was the 466th prisoner admitted in 1964.

The Prison Guard unlocks the door, pulls it open, then unlocks the metal grill that is the inside door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MANDELA'S CELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pienaar peers into the cell. It is tiny. There is no bed, just a sisal mat on the concrete floor, with a couple of blankets. A chamber pot, a short bench, a tin cup and plate are the only other objects in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A couple of small lockers are screwed high to the wall. The barred window is opaque. It lets in light but does not allow the prisoner a view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Pienaar enters, we see how small the cell really is. He can reach out and touch the opposite walls at the same time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a bleak, horrible, dehumanizing place. Pienaar is stunned by it. He turns, slowly, looking at Mandela's world for over twenty years.

Barbara makes sure he is breathing. He is. She unplugs his phone, takes it. Unplugs his TV. Sweeps the room for papers, articles, legal briefs. For the first time, she takes an arm load of stuff away from him. She gives Mandela one last, long look, closes the door behind her.

As they wait, they hear the CRUNCHING APPROACH OF BIG MEN IN CLEATS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down the opposite stairway come THE ALL BLACKS. This is the first time we have seen them in the flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Huge men, black on black uniforms, arrogant. Been here before, done this before. The best in the world, expecting nothing but the best from the day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They ignore the Springboks, dismiss them, line up next to them in the tunnel.

The SOUND OF THIRTY MEN JOGGING IN PLACE in their cleats, on the concrete, sounds like a drum roll before a medieval battle.

The Springbok wing sneaks a peek at JONAH LOMU.
</DIRECTION>

The biggest, fastest wing ever. Even bigger looking in this confined space. Bigger than the Springbok wing, bigger than any of the Springbok backs, bigger than most of the Springbok forwards.

The referee nods to both captains, turns, and leads them onto the field --

Lomu looks down at Mandela, eyes glowing with aggression --

-- and suddenly, he bares his tattooed Tongan tongue in a FIERCE WAR CRY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As do the rest of the All Blacks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE HAVE SEGUED TO THE FAMOUS HAKA, a Maori war dance that tells an opponent they're going have their daughters stolen, their wives ravaged and their brains eaten right out of their skulls with a sharpened tea spoon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is abundantly clear why, as the Minister of Sports told Mandela, half of the All Blacks matches are won before the whistle blows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is very intimidating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Especially because, this day, the All Blacks push the haka closer and closer to the Springboks --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- who do not back down. In fact, they close ranks and advance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Major, major international smackdown. This is not fake. The emotions, the aggression are real.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MANDELA, whose diplomatic mask slips a little showing a warrior's glitter in his eyes. He wants to respond, primally. His fists clench at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The HAKA ENDS with a fearsome, guttural Maori yell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE SPRINGBOKS, massed together, faces red with emotion, pulses racing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mandela takes a deep breath in.
</DIRECTION>

Then the boys answer.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Game on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We have only seen snippets of rugby, so far. And mostly from a somewhat polite distance -- the usual distance of TV coverage. Say, at closest, the referee's point of view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not now. Not for the climax. We experience this beautiful piece of mayhem up close and personal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're inside the heaving scrums. We are the ball. We see the way cleats leave a pattern of round white dimples on abused skin, which quickly turn to purple as they fill with subcutaneous blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We feel a tackle in our own spine; we see teeth sink into flesh in the intimacy of a loose scrum; we feel a hard fist smacking us again and again in the hot privacy of a rolling maul.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For this is not a pretty match, not for one moment -- just as the Springbok coach wanted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This match is all about a less talented team stifling the best team in the world by sheer determination and fitness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is about the Springboks applying continuous, unrelenting pressure, and forcing the vaunted All Black attack into making mistakes. Lots of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dropped balls, errant passes, knock-ons. No fluency of movement, no electric building of momentum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Because of one thing: tackling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tackling and tackling and tackling again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first time Lomu touches the ball, the stadium, the nation holds its breath --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- until the Springbok wing scythes into him at thigh height, wraps him up and brings him down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second time Lomu gets the ball he is brought down from behind by Pienaar, with a picture perfect tackle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can cut away to the faces of the spectators when we want; from Mandela to Nerine to Sipho and on and on, all over the country. But, in truth, our attention belongs on the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON PIENAAR, continually exhorting his men, leading by example, wreaking havoc in the All Black backfield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON LOMU, who always seems just one broken tackle away from running one in -- except that there are no broken tackles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THIRTY BIG, STRONG, BATTLE-SCARRED MEN, who have devoted their entire lives to this moment. They are not playing for money. They are playing for pride, for their countries.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outdated notions. We miss them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No tries are scored in the Final. The two fly halves match each other, penalty goal for penalty goal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With each made kick, the goal posts shrink for the next. The penalty goals are unchallenged. It is up to the kicker to make them or fail. That is pressure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The score is 6 - 6 when, just before half time, the Springbok fly half takes a long, perfect pass from the scrum half, and with the All Black defenders looming, kicks a drop goal through the uprights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Springboks lead 9 - 6. A tight match.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So tight, in fact, that there is only one score in the second half -- an All Black drop goal that levels the score at 9 -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until right before the end of the match, when the All Blacks camp in the Springbok half.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scrum half sends a long, spiralling pass to the fly half, who is in perfect position to go for a drop goal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kick soars into the air, high and straight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
43 million South Africans hold their breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All around the world, fans lean forward on their chairs. This will be the decisive blow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the kick just goes wide. Relief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The referee blows his whistle to signal the end of regulation. Both teams are spent.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Springbok manager grabs Pienaar's shoulder, points.
</DIRECTION>
<SPRINGBOK_MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're waiting for you over there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPRINGBOK_MANAGER>
<DIRECTION>
Pienaar turns, looks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mandela waits at the podium, eyes alight with joy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front of him is the WILLIAM WEBB ELLIS TROPHY, a big gold confection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes meet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes stay locked as Pienaar fights his way through the press, the officials, his own team, to the podium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mandela holds out his hand. Pienaar takes it. Big hands, one black, one white, one with bruises visible, one with a lifetime of bruises implied.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both wearing the NUMBER 6 SPRINGBOK JERSEY.
</DIRECTION>
<MANDELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Francois, I want to thank you most sincerely for what you have done to our country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANDELA>
<DIRECTION>
Pienaar shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<PIENAAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President, I want to thank you for what you have done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIENAAR>
<DIRECTION>
Eyes lock again, for just a moment, blue eyes, brown eyes -- African eyes, both.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then PIENAAR RAISES THE TROPHY HIGH. A very traditional sports hero's moment, richly deserved.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Real gold, against the green of the battered field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But that is not the real prize.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The prize is what happens next, all over the nation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALL OVER SOUTH AFRICA, people spill out into the streets, to celebrate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Utter joy, everywhere, as black and white, servants and employers, strangers, enemies, foreigners are swept up in love and happiness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People who have been suspicious of each other, hated each other, feared each other all their lives ... they hug each other on this day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOHANNESBURG STREETS - END OF THE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Housewives, gardeners, cops, kids dance in the middle of the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car horn beeps politely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BMW, Mercedes, BMW come slowly down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd begins to dance and ululate as they part to let the convoy through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRESIDENT'S MERCEDES - END OF THE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linga in front. Mandela is alone in the back seat. He looks out at his people as they cheer him through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He also looks exhausted. Spent. None of that shining life force that makes him so big.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</JASON>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOHANNESBURG STREETS - END OF THE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The convoy switches to another street --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- which is just as crowded as the first, with happy South Africans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is as if every single person in the Rainbow Nation wants to celebrate together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREY BMW (LEAD) - END OF THE DAY

</JASON>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOHANNESBURG STREETS - END OF THE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The convoy switches to yet another street --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- to no avail. South Africa is literally dancing in the streets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRESIDENT'S MERCEDES - END OF THE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mandela leans forward, taps Linga on the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<MANDELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell Jason it's all right. There's no hurry.

INT. GREY BMW (LEAD) - END OF THE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason nods, puts down his radio, settles back with a deep sigh. So do the rest of the boys in the car. This day is almost over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREY BMW (TRAILER) - END OF THE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Etienne, Hendrick loosen their ties, bask in the feeling. Hendrick looks out at the rolling street party -- and shakes his head in amazement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRESIDENT'S MERCEDES - END OF THE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela undoes the top button of his rugby jersey, settles back with a deep sigh --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and drives home through a nation that has begun the process of forgiving itself. His nation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GO IN ON MANDELA'S FACE as it settles into the now-familiar sphinx-like mask.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Except for his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mandela's eyes glow with deep joy and satisfaction as he moves slowly through a moment in history that he has worked for, all his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MANDELA'S EYES ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE EVER SO SLOWLY TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
