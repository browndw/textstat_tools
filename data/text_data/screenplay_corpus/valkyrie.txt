<DIRECTION>
I swear by God this sacred oath:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That I shall render unconditional obedience to Adolf Hitler, the Führer of the German Reich, and that I shall at all times be prepared, as a brave soldier, to give my life for this oath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And from out of the blackness a voice. A man speaking in German - faint at first, crackling over the radio. Subtitles translate the voice of Adolf Hitler.
</DIRECTION>
<HITLER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My comrades. Once again - I don't know how many times it has been now - an attempt has been made on my life. I speak to you tonight for two reasons. First, so that you can hear my voice and know that I am unhurt. And second, so that you may know the details of a crime without parallel in German history...

EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES: SMOLENSK, RUSSIA - THE GERMAN EASTERN FRONT. 13 MARCH 1943.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lonely airfield. A NAZI OFFICER and his AIDE stand rigid by a gleaming limousine. The officer's uniform denotes a man of high rank - a man of weight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES: MAJOR-GENERAL HENNING VON TRESCKOW - CHIEF OF STAFF FOR ARMY GROUP CENTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tresckow smokes a cigarette, his arm the only movement in the frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK TO REVEAL the airstrip is surrounded by Army Group vehicles and personnel - SD and SS escorts, photographers, aides, Nazi party dignitaries, etc. - all frozen like statues. Eerie. Whatever is going on, it's big. The faint sound of distant airplanes brings tension, subtle but sharp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Approaching the field are three Focke-Wulf 200 Condors escorted by a formation of Messerschmitt-109 fighters. Silence gives way to an escalating roar that seems to have no maximum. One by one, the massive four-engine Condors land while the fighters roar overhead and circle the airfield. The Condors come to rest and, needing no introduction:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ADOLF HITLER alights from the lead plane, obscured by the surrounding platoon of heavily armed SS GUARDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(Note: Hitler is obscured throughout the entire sequence proving how inaccessible he truly was.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tresckow and his Aide step forward to greet Hitler, but they are pushed back by SS guards. The Führer marches past without so much a glance at his hosts or their waiting limo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To Tresckow's surprise, a second limousine roars onto the airfield from out of nowhere. It is dirty, the windscreen spotted with bugs from a long drive. Hitler gets in the dirty car and speeds off.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not so much your car he doesn't trust... It's your driver.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Tresckow and his Aide turn. Standing behind them is:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES: COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT - SENIOR STAFF OFFICER OF THE ARMY OPERATIONS SECTION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The consummate Nazi, he is always scribbling notes in a small datebook. Without looking up, Brandt hops into the limo they brought for Hitler.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tresckow and his Aide share a glance and get in. A beat later they are speeding after Hitler's car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Est. Hitler's headquarters for the Eastern Front is bustling. Security is tight, everyone is on edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - MESS HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Long tables packed with SOLDIERS straining their necks to get a glimpse of their leader at the head table, but he is obscured by his detail of SS guards. ONE MAN dares to approach. The room falls silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HITLER'S PERSONAL CHEF places a tray before the Führer, producing a knife and fork, cutting a bite. We think he is going to hand feed Hitler until he places the food in his own mouth, chewing slowly, deliberately. He swallows. We wait for him to die. When he doesn't, Hitler begins to eat. The rest of the room relaxes slightly and digs in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: Seated further down the table are Tresckow and his Aide. Between them, once again, is Brandt, eating like a pig, still making notes in his book. Tresckow stares.
</DIRECTION>
<TRESCKOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Managing the Führer's security must be quite an undertaking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<BRANDT>
<DIRECTION>
(in between mouthfuls)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Irregularity is the Führer's precaution of choice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDT>
<TRESCKOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can assure you he's safe here. Relax, Brandt. Enjoy your meal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<DIRECTION>
Brandt's look says, "Don't be ridiculous." He cleans his plate in seconds. Then he gently dabs his mouth, takes out his datebook and starts writing - once again the precise man we saw on the airfield.
</DIRECTION>
<TRESCKOW>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand you're returning to Berlin this afternoon...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<DIRECTION>
Brandt nods.
</DIRECTION>
<TRESCKOW>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could I trouble you to deliver a package to Colonel Stieff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<DIRECTION>
Brandt nods again, too busy writing to notice the knowing glance Tresckow shares with his Aide...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - PRIVATE OFFICE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tense silence. Tresckow and his Aide are hunched over two bottles of Cointreau on a large desk next to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO PAIRS OF BRITISH `CLAMS' - a small black plastic casing held together by magnets and adhesive tape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tresckow inserts a short, pencil-shaped fuse through the narrow opening. All that remains exposed is a small glass capsule. The trigger. Tresckow turns his attention to the bottles of Cointreau...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Condors' engines roar, ready for take off. Soldiers stand at attention as Hitler boards. Brandt is with him, scribbling in his ever-present datebook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tresckow and his Aide approach. Tresckow gently handles a carefully wrapped package.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: Tresckow presses a key against the side of the package, crushing the glass capsule inside. The explosive armed now, he hands it to Brandt.
</DIRECTION>
<TRESCKOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With my regards to Colonel Stieff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<DIRECTION>
Brandt accepts the gift, looking up from his book. He studies the familiar shape.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cointreau? You better hope I don't get thirsty on the flight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDT>
<DIRECTION>
Tresckow politely smiles, hiding his nerves, having just handed a bomb to Hitler's Head of Security. Brandt unknowingly carries it onto the plane with Hitler. The door to the Condor is sealed behind him along with, we hope, the Führer's fate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tresckow looks at his watch and we DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - PRIVATE OFFICE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A clock shows us that thirty minutes have passed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tresckow and his Aide are seated on either side of a desk staring at the telephone. Smoking. Waiting...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - PRIVATE OFFICE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three hours later. The ashtray is overflowing but Tresckow and his Aide have not moved. Finally...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The phone barely rings before Tresckow answers. He doesn't say a word, he only nods and hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<TRESCKOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's... landed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<DIRECTION>
It takes a moment for the gravity of this to set in.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDE>
<DIRECTION>
Tresckow is already dialing the telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<TRESCKOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get me Colonel Brandt...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(staying cool)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colonel? Tresckow... I trust you landed safely... I hate to trouble you but there's been a bit of a mix up. It seems you have the wrong bottles for Colonel Stieff. You... do still have the package?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<DIRECTION>
Long pause. Torture. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<TRESCKOW>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can be at your office first thing tomorrow morning to pick it up. Terribly sorry for the inconvenience... Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<DIRECTION>
Tresckow slowly hangs up the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think he knows?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDE>
<DIRECTION>
Tresckow shrugs, opening a bottle of Cointreau and pouring two glasses with a shaking hand.
</DIRECTION>
<TRESCKOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's only one way to be sure...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OKH HEADQUARTERS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Est. An early morning fog blankets the ground, obscuring our view. Eerie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OKH HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Footsteps echo through the cavernous hallways. Tresckow marches with purpose through the numerous security checkpoints. It is a long, suspenseful walk. He is aware of someone walking up behind him, getting closer. We think he's done for, but a BESPECTACLED, MIDDLE-AGED OFFICER overtakes him and whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES: GENERAL FRIEDRICH OLBRICHT - CHIEF OF GENERAL ARMY OFFICE IN BERLIN.
</DIRECTION>
<TRESCKOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can only guess the altitude caused the fuse to malfunction. First the beer hall, Memorial Day - now this. Someone is watching over that sonofabitch, I swear it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<OLBRICHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been discovered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLBRICHT>
<DIRECTION>
Tresckow halts and faces Olbricht, expressionless.
</DIRECTION>
<TRESCKOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What makes you think-
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<OLBRICHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oster's been arrested. The Gestapo came for him last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLBRICHT>
<DIRECTION>
Tresckow thinks for a beat and resumes walking. Olbricht hurries after him.
</DIRECTION>
<OLBRICHT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you hear what I said?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLBRICHT>
<TRESCKOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Gestapo could have arrested him for anything. Find a replacement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<OLBRICHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no one we can trust. Not in Berlin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLBRICHT>
<TRESCKOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then stop looking in Berlin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, they approach the final threshold, a SENTRY guards an office marked:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olbricht stops, regarding the door with dread. But Tresckow presses on, reaching the door, about to enter when:
</DIRECTION>
<SENTRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your pistol please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENTRY>
<DIRECTION>
Oh shit. Tresckow plays it cool, removing his pistol from its holster and handing it over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And with a nod to Olbricht, Tresckow squares his shoulders and enters Brandt's office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OKH HEADQUARTERS - BRANDT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brandt is at his desk, writing as always. Tresckow notices Brandt's pistol sitting within arm's reach. A clock ticks loudly. Imagine it. Then wait. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brandt puts his pen down, stands and salutes, but the gesture is almost casual. Pure formality.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll forgive me, General. This little round-up has had me writing reports all day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDT>
<TRESKOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Round-up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESKOW>
<BRANDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dissenters. A plot against the Führer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDT>
<DIRECTION>
Tresckow makes a good show of laughing that off.
</DIRECTION>
<TRESKOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who would even have the balls?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESKOW>
<BRANDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd be surprised, the number of cowards in this army that would be willing to stand against the Reich.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDT>
<TRESKOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only if the Führer were dead, of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESKOW>
<BRANDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. It's one thing to think you know what's right. What matters is having the strength to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDT>
<DIRECTION>
Clunk. Brandt produces the package, putting it on the desk in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANDT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this what you've come for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDT>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. Staying cool, Tresckow reaches for it:
</DIRECTION>
<BRANDT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps we should open it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDT>
<DIRECTION>
Tresckow freezes, studies Brandt's cold smile.
</DIRECTION>
<TRESCKOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beg your pardon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<DIRECTION>
Brandt sits back, smiles. Does he know?
</DIRECTION>
<BRANDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've come a long way. You must be thirsty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDT>
<TRESCKOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wonder how the Führer, who does not partake, would feel about an officer who did so on duty... Colonel Brandt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<DIRECTION>
Brandt's smile fades. We can't decide why. He picks up the package carelessly. Tresckow stays cool despite the armed explosive just a few feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I took you for another sort, General.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDT>
<DIRECTION>
And we realize he really did just want a drink. He knows nothing about what the package hides.
</DIRECTION>
<TRESCKOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<DIRECTION>
Tresckow reaches out, grabbing the package and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG. The sound of an EXPLOSION O.S. takes us to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES: TUNISIA, NORTH AFRICA - THE RETREATING 10TH PANZER DIVISION. 7 APRIL 1943.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving rapidly through an olive grove in the otherwise wasted desert. A column of tanks, trucks and heavy equipment flow by with a sense of barely contained chaos. Men dismantle tents from around others dumping documents into burning oil drums.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the middle of it we find a tall, handsome young officer (age 35). He wears an Afrika Korps uniform complete with Colonel's badges, staying cooler than the other side of your pillow. He directs men this way and that, holding back panic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES: COLONEL CLAUS VON STAUFFENBERG - STAFF OFFICER, 10TH PANZER DIVISION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A jeep speeds up to him from the distance, driven by a YOUNG LIEUTENANT.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_LIEUTENANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colonel Stauffenberg, sir. A new headquarters has been established at Mezzouna. I'm to take you there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_LIEUTENANT>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg looks over the scene, expressionless.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now they tell us to disengage - a day late. No matter how many times we tell Command the reality, they always manage to leave us-
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
But he stops himself, containing his rage.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_LIEUTENANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colonel, the enemy is less than five kilometers from here. You've done all you can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_LIEUTENANT>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg glances at his right hand, contemplating a ring on his finger. After a beat:
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wonder... Was there even a point in our coming to Tunis?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<YOUNG_LIEUTENANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To get taken prisoner, it seems.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_LIEUTENANT>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg smiles bitterly and gets in the jeep as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM. The first bomb explodes before we even see the tight formation of BRITISH FIRE-BOMBERS overhead. Fighter planes strafe with machine-guns. Artillery blasts strike in front and behind the retreating column. The 10th Panzer Division is trapped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Panic hits the column like a tidal wave. Stauffenberg taps the Young Lieutenant who drives into the melee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soldiers abandon their vehicles but cover is in short supply and many are left in the open. So they run. Dozens are gunned down by the assailing fighters. The survivors watch in horror as the fighters slowly turn to make another run. In a panic, the soldiers run the other direction, halted by a jeep blocking the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg stands in the passenger seat.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	STOP. WAIT UNTIL THEY COMMIT.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
The men calm when they see the Colonel, trusting him. They turn and watch the formation of planes complete their turn and bear down, gaining speed. Knees tense, some jerking from the natural inclination to flee.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	STAND FAST, I SAID.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
They do, despite the menace of the planes' engines growing louder, meaner...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LEAD FIGHTER COCKPIT - DAY

The confused PILOT takes in the mass of motionless men below. His finger tenses on the trigger and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NOW.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
The mob of soldiers breaks - some right, some left - as the fighters open fire on what had been the center of their mass. Unable to change course quickly enough, they spray their lead into the sand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In that same instant, Stauffenberg drops into his seat, the Young Lieutenant jams the jeep in drive and a wave of hot lead misses them by mere feet. Stauffenberg watches his men regroup, waiting out the turning squadron. They've got the idea now. He turns to his Lieutenant who smiles admiringly. But Stauffenberg's eyes widen. He grabs his Lieutenant's head and jams it down, revealing a STRAY FIGHTER coming up from behind. Stauffenberg ducks out of frame, shielding the Young Lieutenant with his body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG. Blood sprays across the jeep's windshield before bullets rip it to pieces, leaving only clear blue African sky... And then the EXPLOSION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SILENCE. FADE TO WHITE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES: MUNICH, GERMANY - FIRST GENERAL MILITARY HOSPITAL. 21 APRIL 1943.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fast clicking. Heels on linoleum. A beautiful, dignified woman keeps herself from running. She is:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NINA VON STAUFFENBERG (30), Stauffenberg's wife and mother of his four children. Beside her is BERTHOLD VON STAUFFENBERG (38), Stauffenberg's older brother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the door of a private hospital room just as A DOCTOR comes out. Awkward pause.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Stauffenberg?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<NINA>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding, gesturing to Berthold)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Colonel's brother, Berthold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps before you see the Colonel we should go to my office and-
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will see my husband now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
The Doctor wants to argue but Nina's eyes shut him down. He opens the door and they enter to find:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mass of mummy-like bandages with only small openings around the mouth and one eye. The arms and hands are also wrapped in heavy dressing. No movement but for the rise and fall of the patient's chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Berthold cannot look. Holding back her anguish, Nina bravely turns to the Doctor. "Well?"
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's been constant with fever but he refuses any pain killers. The right hand has been amputated above the wrist. He's lost the fourth and fifth fingers on the left. We... couldn't save the left eye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Berthold covers his face. Nina is a rock.
</DIRECTION>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His ring.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't-
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He had a ring on his right hand. Where is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry... His hand was amputated in the field... I'm afraid-
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
As in: "That will be all." The Doctor leaves. Nina sits beside her husband. She shows him a photo of FOUR BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN - three boys and a girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg tries to speak but can't. His eye begins to tear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nina removes a ring from her finger, placing it on a chain with a cross she takes from around her neck. It is identical to the ring Stauffenberg wore in Africa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: The engraving inside the band - finis- initium [end-beginning]. Nina places the ring and chain on her husband's chest, her hand lingering. She cannot hold the tears back any longer. She stands and turns away, not wanting her husband to see.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Berthold takes her place. Stauffenberg struggles to speak. Berthold puts an ear to the hole where Stauffenberg's mouth is - making out his question, even if we can't. Berthold debates answering, then:
</DIRECTION>
<BERTHOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've lost North Africa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERTHOLD>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: That one eye staring at us closes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAYS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg's bandages are gone - a black patch covering what had been his left eye. The chain with the cross and ring from Nina hangs around his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER PATIENT lies motionless in the next bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man's belongings tell you more about him than he ever could. Stauffenberg's side of the room is neatly arranged, books of poetry and philosophy are well worn. Beside them are his own writings - the print meticulous and flowing. Up to a certain date. After that a new, child-like hand has taken over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A family photograph shows the Stauffenberg's of another generation - wealthy aristocrats from a bygone era. He is a teenager in this photo and smiling broadly. A smile he left in Africa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg's three fingers push a cotton ball under his eyepatch to dab the empty socket. Then he goes to button his shirt. Holding his collar in his teeth, he tries to do the buttons with the use of only three fingers on his left hand. It is heartbreaking to watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is about to give up when he notices a figure looming in the doorway. General Olbricht. He winces at the sight of Stauffenberg's deformities.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what I ever did with ten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
Olbricht manages a smile, he moves to speak, but Stauffenberg beats him to it.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>

	STAUFFENBERG

<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can speak openly, General. He died just before you came in.

Awkward moment. Finally:

<OLBRICHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could use your help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLBRICHT>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>

Olbricht steps closer, speaking openly now.

Stauffenberg nonchalantly tosses the medal into a nearby bedpan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - CRITICAL WARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: A field of white. A three fingered hand enters the frame, gently placing a medal identical to the one just saw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Stauffenberg, done up in his finest dress uniform, placing said medal on an unconscious WOUNDED SOLDIER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN AIDE stands behind him, carrying a silver tray stacked with MANY BOXES containing such medals.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL: Stauffenberg stands between two long rows of beds, each with A WOUNDED SOLDIER. Those that can respond to Stauffenberg do so with reverence. The ward is eerily silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With only three fingers, Stauffenberg cannot pin the medals to his men. He has to settle for simply laying them on a each soldier's chest or a pillow. With each medal he presents, the task becomes harder to watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Stauffenberg freezes, finding himself looking at THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT - his driver in Africa. The young man is a mass of bandages, his legs gone, his face smashed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: Stauffenberg's face - the reality of Africa taking the wind out of him. Over this we hear a familiar clicking of heels and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg's boots pound the floor as he rushes for the door, desperate to get out, barely able to breathe. At first he does not hear:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colonel... COLONEL.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A hand grabs his shoulder. Stauffenberg turns, ready to strike. He stops when he sees the Doctor holding a small, square box. Another sort medal perhaps?
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>

	</DIALOGUE>

The Doctor opens the box to reveal:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GLASS EYEBALL sitting atop a layer of satin, staring blankly back at Stauffenberg. Creepy.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When will you be going back to the front?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Stauffenberg just stares back at the eyeball.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to the front. I'm needed in Berlin.

</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BERLIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The city sleeps. An unsettling image knowing that, in war, quiet can turn to chaos in the blink of an eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOWNHOUSE FOYER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soft knocking at the front door is further muffled by heavy black-out curtains. A YOUNG OFFICER enters the frame, dousing the lights, parting the curtains and opening the door to reveal a SHADOWY FIGURE on the stoop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure steps into the half light to reveal his fresh scars and eye-patch. And from the dark quiet of the foyer we CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SMOKY ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chaos. The air is thick with cigar smoke and harsh words. A DOZEN MEN - some officers, some civilians - are fighting bitterly, everyone talking at once. Stauffenberg enters unnoticed, escorted in by the YOUNG OFFICER who immediately ducks out again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg scans the faces in the room. We recognize Olbricht and Tresckow. With them we find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A distinguished gentleman in his early sixties:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES: ERWIN VON WITZLEBEN - FORMER FIELD MARSHAL OF THE MILITARY DISTRICT. FORCED OUT BY HITLER, 1938.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beside him is a rough-hewn, charismatic man despite his 59 years. A face millions might follow. He is:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES: DR. CARL GOERDELER - FORMER MAYOR OF LEIPZIG. RESIGNED IN PROTEST, 1937.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And finally, a grandfatherly sort with surprisingly kind eyes, sitting outside the fight - tired and saddened by it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES: LUDWIG BECK - FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF FOR THE GERMAN ARMY. RESIGNED IN PROTEST, 1938.
</DIRECTION>
<WITZLEBEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...He is not a man, he's a lunatic. He doesn't drink, he doesn't fuck. He has no weakness to exploit, no vice to manipulate. His only passion is complete control. How can you expect to reason with him?

</WITZLEBEN>
<GOERDELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After this most recent failure I'd say we've no other choice.

	He's a man like any other. Flesh and blood. Take him head on and-

	<DIALOGUE>
	When that day comes, I'll be sure to remember you.

<GOERDELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit, Tresckow-
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOERDELER>
<DIRECTION>
And the shouting resumes. It is Beck who finally sees Stauffenberg. He touches Tresckow's arm. He, in turn, nudges Olbricht and so on. A moment later, the room is silent, all eyes on the Colonel. Everyone is a little embarrassed. Olbricht clears his throat:
</DIRECTION>
<OLBRICHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, may I present Colonel Stauffenberg. He's been reassigned to my office at the War Ministry.

But before he can finish, Beck is seized with a gravelly cough that sends an uncomfortable chill through the room. He is very ill.
</DIRECTION>

(to the others)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't welcomed him. Not yet. Where does he stand?
	</DIALOGUE>

<TRESCKOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For God's sake-
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<GOERDELER>
<DIRECTION>
(re: Stauffenberg)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a field officer. He knows the army better than any of us. I want to hear his opinion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOERDELER>
<TRESCKOW>
<DIRECTION>
(to Stauffenberg)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. What do you think, Colonel? Confront Hitler, force him to resign? Or the central solution?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<DIRECTION>
But before Stauffenberg can answer:
</DIRECTION>
<GOERDELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Central Solution." You soldiers are all the same. Say what you mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOERDELER>
<WITZLEBEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a laugh coming from a politician.

<DIRECTION>
Silence. Then a wave of laughter. "The balls on this guy."
</DIRECTION>
<GOERDELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beg your pardon, Colonel, but you are in the presence of men who would have been Hitler's inner circle. Instead we resigned. We put our principles above personal gain.

<GOERDELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now see here, Colonel-
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOERDELER>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said yourself, I'm a field officer. You all may understand government, but I know the men. A great many of them may hate Hitler, but they all fear him - they fear Himmler, Goebbels, the whole of the Reich. That kind of fear won't just die with Hitler. And as for respect: the army, and the people, respect only one thing. Authority. And if just one man questions that authority, you can lose them all.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Beck, pointed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were fooled into following Hitler... How will you fool them - force them - into following you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. The conspirators look at one another again, unsure of how to answer. For Stauffenberg it is a dreadful revelation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BERLIN - STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A depressed Stauffenberg walks down the deserted night streets. Silent but for the echo of his footsteps. Eerie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the street, an OLD WOMAN peers nervously out her window. The instant Stauffenberg makes eye contact she steps back, drawing the curtains. Afraid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches a cozy brick cottage - the Berlin home he shares with his brother, Berthold. He is surprised when he looks through the window to find FOUR CHILDREN laughing and playing - the sound of music on a phonograph. Bittersweet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the next house over, he catches sight of a TEENAGE BOY, the picture of Aryan youth, watching him suspiciously from the upstairs window. It seems everyone is watching everyone in Hitler's German.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg comes through the front door, the sound of the phonograph blaring now. Meet the children: BERTHOLD (9), HEIMERAN (7), FRANZ (5), VALERIE (2).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They chase one another around the house in their pajamas making such a racket that the phonograph skips. (It will do so throughout the scene.) The children see Stauffenberg and charge, screaming:
</DIRECTION>
<CHILDREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PAPA.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDREN>
<DIRECTION>
He scoops them up, one by one, and kisses them, instantly putting the day's events behind him. Berthold follows them into the room, smiling.

<DIRECTION>
INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nina nervously fixes her hair in the mirror. LOOK DOWN TO REVEAL a small datebook with a smaller monthly calendar in the corner of the page. A red dot marks one date in particular, followed by black dots for each day that has passed since. She turns sideways, smoothing her dress over her belly. In every way she indicates to us that she is pregnant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tucks the datebook under some sundries in her luggage and rushes down to greet her husband.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We stay in the room, hearing her greet Stauffenberg O.S. Laughter at children's antics we cannot see. The phonograph skips. More laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We want to go see them in their happiness. Instead we linger on Stauffenberg's dresser - neat and orderly. We focus on a photograph of the family from happier times.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beside it is a small box containing a glass eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg and Nina dance with one another to the delight of the children. We gradually PUSH IN tight on their faces, watching an entire conversation take place without dialogue. Each has a secret the other can guess. Stauffenberg looks at Nina, then her belly, first realizing and then questioning. Nina smiles and nods. Stauffenberg hugs her, delighted, but his delight is tainted with worry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the tables turn. Nina looks at Stauffenberg, as if divining his secret. His face never changes - a statue with that same tainted smile. In her face we see slow, grim realization. She may not know exactly what is going on, but she knows it is something. She does her best to keep smiling for the children. After the longest of moments, she nods. "All right." Then she puts her head on his shoulder, hiding her fears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is an important moment. Read it again, taking the time to picture it in your mind. Then leave it alone. Done right it's a beautiful scene about a man, his family and the fate of the world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nina reads a story to the children in the adjoining room - an idyllic scene. The sound of the phonograph is soft and constant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg picks at a late dinner, now adept at the use of only three fingers. Berthold sits across from him, deeply troubled by whatever conversation we have just missed. They speak in hushed tones.
</DIRECTION>
<BERTHOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean you quit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERTHOLD>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I came to join the Resistance, not some sewing circle of discarded generals and politicians.

<BERTHOLD>

	Beck is a just and capable man. As for Goerdeler, well, he's popular. He'll make a good Chancellor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERTHOLD>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like Hitler before him, yes? Lately I have to wonder if Germany is even fit to choose her own destiny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<BERTHOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't blame the people for this. You have to see the beginning of something to know how it'll end. It's no different than a farmer watching the corn grow. One day it's over his head.

Before Stauffenberg can answer, new music comes blasting from the phonograph O.S. The unmistakable sound of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Children, that is far too-
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
He is cut off by the appearance of his four children, all wearing cloaks made of bed sheets, pots for helmets and brandishing makeshift swords. They charge into the room, singing loudly and attacking their father. He does his best to defend himself with one hand. Their commotion causes the phonograph to skip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And you'd think that's where it ends. We even pull back, creating that effect. It takes a moment to notice the wailing sound we're suddenly hearing is not on the phonograph. Nina hears it first, then Stauffenberg and Berthold. Finally the children freeze and the phonograph skips without their help. The glasses on the table rattle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we hear the wailing quite clearly. A siren.

INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - BASEMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The family rushes down the stairs, huddling in a corner - adults holding shivering children. The bombs are closer, louder. The Wagner, the siren, the explosions fray the nerves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg reaches for Nina in the darkness, finding her belly. Her hand clamps around his - around their unborn child.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM. So close the children scream. Dust and debris fall from the ceiling. The needle rakes the phonograph upstairs going back to the beginning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON STAUFFENBERG - on his eye. His thoughts as the bombs fall all around his home - a moment of profound realization...

INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Move across the room to the phonograph, looking down at the 78 spinning on the turntable. The camera begins to turn until all the world around us is spinning and only the record is still. We read one word of the title of the 78 quite clearly:

MUTED SHOUTS from O.S. Someone is getting reamed. Fromm's adjutant, LIEUTENANT FRANZ HERBER - a young, dedicated soldier - sits at his desk, trying to ignore the screaming from the other room in between stolen glances at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Stauffenberg and Olbricht waiting patiently, sitting across from:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAJOR JOHN VON FREYEND, a dutiful Nazi whose face we immediately don't like. He smiles coldly, taking pleasure in the shouting O.S. He stares at Stauffenberg, studying him, making us nervous.

Fromm's door finally opens and A BIGGER THAN LIFE NAZI storms out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES: FIELD MARSHAL WILHELM KEITEL - HITLER'S CHIEF OF STAFF.

Freyend stands, holding Keitel's hat and coat for him. A perfect toady.

Keitel storms out, leaving a pall. Freyend gives Stauffenberg a last once-over and follows. Beat:

Stauffenberg and Olbricht step inside to find:

The haggard Fromm sits at his desk, rubbing his temples. Stauffenberg and Olbricht share a confident look. Surely this guy hates the High Command. Without looking up to see them:

Freeze. But after a tense beat, Fromm relaxes and laughs, taking a cigarette from a box on his desk and nudging it toward them.

They sit. Fromm lights a cigarette, leans back and exhales a cloud of smoke. We let things sit for awhile. The game of recruitment is about to begin and no one is sure where to start. The longer the quiet, the more awkward things seem. Finally:

Fromm frowns at Olbricht. This was a bit too obvious. Stauffenberg shoots Olbricht a look. "What the hell are you doing?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fromm casually stamps out his cigarette in the ashtray and picks up the telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olbricht and Stauffenberg steel their nerves - certain they are going to be reported. But Fromm doesn't dial. Instead, to our relief, he disconnects the line. When he is certain that it is dead:

EXT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car loaded with luggage. Stauffenberg hugs his children, one by one, before placing them inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he turns to face Nina. As always, there is much to be said that they cannot say. She gently touches the silver chain around his neck, the ring and the cross she gave him. They embrace tightly and kiss. She gets in the car, looking at him through the back window as she is driven away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darkness. As our eyes adjust we realize we are in the middle of the woods. Is this a dream? A nightmare? We are drawn toward a flickering light in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST - CLEARING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From out of the darkness comes a candle held by a nervous, almost mousy young woman, FRAULEIN VON OVEN. Walking just behind her is Tresckow. He carries a small but heavy case in one hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They come to a clearing in the woods and find a strange sight. In the center is a tree stump surrounded by papers, including the original orders for OPERATION VALKYRIE, next to a leather valise marked with the seal of the Reich. The orders have been meticulously annotated.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were you followed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Fraulein Oven gasps. Tresckow turns, pistol drawn. The tip of his barrel comes up just inches from Stauffenberg's eyepatch. Stauffenberg smiles, emerging from the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<TRESCKOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit, Stauffenberg. You scared me half to death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll be closer than that before we're finished.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wearing white gloves, Fraulein Oven opens the case Tresckow brought, revealing a portable typewriter. She carefully feeds a sheet of crisp parchment into the machine and sets the margins carefully. Pause. Then she starts typing with remarkable speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(Note: The sound of typing runs throughout the scene, punctuated by the crack of the carriage return - each time a little louder.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg and Tresckow carefully pore over the Valkyrie orders, scribbling copious notes.
</DIRECTION>
<TRESCKOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looking this over, I'm not satisfied that the Reserve Army is enough to shut down Berlin completely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
(handing over papers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I've been giving that some thought. We should include any field units that are home on leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
Before Tresckow can respond, more papers:
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've also drawn up an outline for orders to streamline combat groups in order to quietly concentrate forces at vital points - state and government buildings, of course, but also the radio and newspapers.

</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
More papers. Tresckow can barely keep up.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Combat groups will be reorganized as reinforced grenadier regiments. One or two of them can be quickly mobilized, eliminating the usual six hour lag. We blitz the government quarter, arrest all Ministers and Party leaders, surround all SS and police barracks. Any officers who resist will be arrested... or shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
CRACK. A carriage return as loud as a rifle-shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BERLIN - STREET - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A truck full of soldiers roars past. Stauffenberg, Tresckow and Fraulein Oven walk across a dimly lit bridge on a foggy night in Berlin, stopping in the middle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg carries a leather valise with the Valkyrie orders, Tresckow carries the typewriter case. They stop at the center of the bridge, looking around carefully. No one is in sight, but anyone could be watching from the shadows. Eerie.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Fraulein)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If anyone comes to you, play ignorant. Just tell them-
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<FRAULEIN_OVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell that I was serving the German people. Then I'll tell them to go to hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAULEIN_OVEN>
<DIRECTION>
Both men smile, a bit taken aback. Von Oven shakes each man's hand and walks away, swallowed up by the darkness. When she is gone:
</DIRECTION>
<TRESCKOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To Operation Valkyrie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg nods. Tresckow heaves the typewriter case over the railing and into the water below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPLASH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They watch in silence as the water settles, then:
</DIRECTION>
<TRESCKOW>

Obviously not. Then it occurs to Stauffenberg.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think Fromm reported us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<TRESCKOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's more likely just... an unfortunate coincidence. Anyway it doesn't matter. You wrote the orders. You know them better than anyone.

<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't mean to say-

	We both know Olbricht hasn't the wit or the spine. No. It's you.

A million thoughts are running through Stauffenberg's mind. Fear. Anxiety. But he knows what he must do.
</DIRECTION>
<TRESCKOW>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One more thing. You were right what you said that first night. It's not enough to kill Hitler. We need to isolate his chain of command. The slightest confusion could crush us. We need to be certain that no conflicting orders get out after the flash.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRESCKOW>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg considers this for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That greatly limits our options of where and when to make our move, but it's the only way.

Pause. A sad smile and nod from Tresckow, a moment ago he was in charge. Now he has no clearance.
</DIRECTION>
<TRESCKOW>

	God promised Abraham that he would not destroy Sodom if he could find just ten righteous men.

INT. OFFICERS' CLUB - BERLIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wild party - a small band, German officers, plenty of women.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In stark contrast, two GESTAPO MEN sip coffee at a corner table, keeping a watchful eye on the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WAITER carries a tray of drinks to a rowdy group in the corner who are immersed in the denial common to Berlin these days. The Waiter serves carefully, making sure one particular drink goes to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES: GENERAL ERICH FELLGIEBEL - CHIEF OF THE ARMY SIGNAL CORPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The group toasts and downs their booze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: Fellgiebel's smile suddenly fades. He looks into his glass, his good mood vanishing. He politely excuses himself over the noise of the rowdy mob and heads for the bathroom. He looks ill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fellgiebel walks to the sink and dumps what is left of his drink in the basin.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: Mingling among the melting chunks of ice is a GLASS EYE staring back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He scowls in the mirror at Stauffenberg, waiting.

<FELLGIEBEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You realize how close I am to Hitler. With one word I could have the Gestapo make you disappear.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Why haven't you then?

Fellgiebel checks the stalls to make sure they are empty. Stauffenberg collects his glass eye from the sink, dabbing it dry on a hand towel.

	None of my associates know we've been talking if that's what you're afraid of.

<FELLGIEBEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you know. And when the SS catch you, they'll pull you apart like warm bread. It'll be a crime just to have known you then. I warn you. If it means protecting myself, I will expose you. Do not try to contact me again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELLGIEBEL>
<DIRECTION>
Fellgiebel heads for the door but stops on:
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't report me. Maybe if you had when I first approached you, you'd have been keeping your oath. But now you're just as guilty as-
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<FELLGIEBEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you think that makes me a sympathizer, eh? You give a man the choice of betraying a fellow officer or his Führer and assume his actions will show you his heart. It's not that simple.

	It is to me.

In that moment we see a side of Stauffenberg we were starting to doubt existed. We see his humanity. This puts Fellgiebel in his place. He adjusts his tie and we see the wedding ring on his finger.

	But don't delude yourself. You were involved in a crime against your country long before you met me. There's still time to redeem yourself. Only God can judge you now.

BANG. The door bursts open, startling them both. But it is only a DRUNKEN OFFICER and a YOUNG WOMAN looking for some privacy.

What first catches our eye is the enormous portrait of Hitler looming over Stauffenberg's desk.

Stauffenberg sits before a mountain of paperwork, surrounded on all sides by a flurry of SECRETARIES and AIDES. He looks up to find:

Olbricht leaves. Stauffenberg lets this sink in. He takes a seat and goes back to work. After a moment:

A HANDSOME SOLDIER (36) quietly enters.

<DIRECTION>
TITLES: LIEUTENANT WERNER VON HAEFTEN - RESERVIST. WOUNDED DURING THE RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN.

Haeften clicks his heels and offers the Nazi salute, but before he can say the words:
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be seated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
Thrown, Haeften sits. Stauffenberg continues writing, ignoring him. Haeften looks up at the portrait of Hitler, startled when Stauffenberg finally speaks:

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know how this war will end, Haeften? The portrait will be un- hung... And the man will be hung.

Stauffenberg looks up - looking for a reaction to such frank and treasonous talk. He gets none. He sighs, too tired to play games.

And the strangest thing - a reaction no one would suspect - Haeften relaxes, almost sighs, like someone who has at long last found a home.

NEWSREEL FOOTAGE OF D-DAY. Allied forces invade Normandy. The liberation of Europe has begun.

Stauffenberg rubs his forehead. The car stops. SOLDIERS are waiting outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg gets out of the car wearing an ornate dress uniform and carrying a leather valise. He has arrived at a meeting of great importance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to face Haeften directly and we are surprised to see both of his eyes - for an instant the young lion he once was. But a closer look is unsettling - we see the faint scarring, one eye glowing and alive, the other cloudy and dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His glass eye. Stauffenberg only wore it on special occasions. This is one.
</DIRECTION>
<HAEFTEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe this is a blessing in disguise. Maybe he'll finally listen to reason - consider a truce while he still can.

TITLES: THE BERGHOF. 7 JUNE 1944.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg walks up a flight of wide marble stairs - at the top he sees a group of WAITING ADJUTANTS quietly smoking cigarettes - a clique of devoted Nazis. In the group is Major Freyend, the wormy officer we saw outside Fromm's office. He watches Stauffenberg pass, aloof. We hate him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then Stauffenberg is greeted by TWO SS OFFICERS who move to physically search him - one his body, the other his valise.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't need to search him.

ANGLE ON: Fromm's adjutant, Lt. Herber approaches, waving off the SS.
</DIRECTION>
<HERBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colonel Stauffenberg is an honored guest. The hero of Africa.

The SS officers stand down. Herber and Stauffenberg share a friendly smile, about to speak when Fromm walks up on them:

INT. THE BERGHOF - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg and Fromm enter to the last thing we would expect. Laughter. Drunken laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK TO REVEAL: THE BIG SIX.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hitler and five men - some of them almost caricatures, their features so distinct. The first man we recognize as Keitel - the general who reamed Fromm. The others we know from history and TITLES:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MINISTER ALBERT SPEER - ARCHITECT FOR THE NEW REICH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DR. JOSEPH GOEBBELS - REICH MINISTER OF PUBLIC ENLIGHTENMENT AND PROPAGANDA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REICHSFÜHRER HEINRICH HIMMLER - HEAD OF THE SS AND GESTAPO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REICH MARSHAL HERMANN GOERING - HEAD OF THE GERMAN ARMED FORCES, HITLER'S SECOND IN COMMAND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We have arrived in the sanctum sanatorium of Nazi Germany on the day after the Normandy invasion. But you would never know the tide of the war had just turned against Germany. A series of situation maps are scattered before them, ignored.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only Speer seems to be reserved, smiling politely but clearly tuned into the present reality. Looking closer at Goering we see he is wearing heavy make-up - adding to the already surreal nature of the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is also the first time we are allowed a clear, unobstructed view of Hitler.
</DIRECTION>
<FROMM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mein Führer... I wish to present Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg - our new Chief of General Staff for the Replacement Army.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROMM>
<DIRECTION>
The laughter stops. Hitler and his cronies turn toward Stauffenberg, looking him over. Hitler stands and crosses to him. Fromm meets him first, whispering in the Führer's ear - perhaps reminding him who Stauffenberg is. Hitler nods: "Ah yes." He takes Stauffenberg's left hand with both of his. We are surprised by his charm.
</DIRECTION>
<HITLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I say, I am honored to meet a hero who has sacrificed so much for Germany. If only more of my officers were like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HITLER>

Hitler's cronies smile despite the subtle insult to themselves. To make it worse, Hitler turns to them.
</DIRECTION>
<HITLER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let this man stand as an example to all of you. He is the ideal German officer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HITLER>
<DIRECTION>
Fromm nervously clears his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<FROMM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mein Führer, we have asked Stauffenberg here today so that he might brief us on mobilizing troops from the Home Army to support those in Normandy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROMM>
<HITLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmm? Oh yes, Normandy. That will no longer be necessary. General Goering has assured me that Normandy is under control.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HITLER>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg's good eye flickers. "Are you insane? Normandy is a catastrophe." Another glance at the situation map shows Allied forces over-running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the painted-on smiles of Hitler's nodding cronies promote the lie. No one has the courage to tell Hitler anything close to the truth. Somewhere in their eyes is the fear that someone will.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>

	Mein Führer, if I may... The situation in Normandy is-

	<DIALOGUE>
	Send your man home, Fromm. Then bring us some brandy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEITEL>
<DIRECTION>
Fromm is stung - a man of his rank being treated like a waiter. Stauffenberg steps back, clicks his heels and salutes, just managing to say:
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heil Hitler.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
Hitler half waves, walking slowly back to his seat. Fromm and Stauffenberg leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BERGHOF - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fromm escorts a visibly shaken Stauffenberg to his waiting vehicle. Haeften opens the car door for Stauffenberg to get in. Fromm leans in.
</DIRECTION>
<FROMM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what you've got brewing and I don't want to know... But when the music stops, I'd be much obliged if Keitel should find himself without a chair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROMM>
<DIRECTION>
Is Fromm saying he's in? Is Keitel's death a condition? Hard to say and meant to be. Before Stauffenberg can inquire, Fromm slams the door shut and returns to the madness inside the Berghof.

Stauffenberg leans back in his seat, mentally calculating his next step.

	They're all insane. Every one of them except for Speer, and he's nothing but an architect.

INT. CHURCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We find ourselves in an empty church. Beck is seated in a pew staring straight ahead. Stauffenberg sits directly behind him. They can't risk being seen together. They speak in hushed tones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first thing we notice is how weak and ill Beck looks. He struggles to hide a persistent cough.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out of the question. It won't work. We need you here in Berlin.

	Orders are not enough. They need a man to follow. The right man.

Pause. Stauffenberg knows he's right. The fucking pressure. He thinks for a moment, then with a sigh:
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olbricht will oversee operations in my absence. I can be back in Berlin three hours after Hitler is-
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>

Stauffenberg shuts up, lowering his head in prayer as a CLERGYMAN passes. Once they are again alone:
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three very crucial hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We both know there's no other way.

<DIRECTION>
Beck nods, resigned.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell the others-
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
As if on cue, Beck loses control of his cough. Stauffenberg leans forward, handing him a handkerchief and putting a reassuring hand on his shoulder until the old man's hacking subsides.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid whatever the outcome, I won't be there to see it.

EXT. STAUFFENBERG HOME - BACK LAWN - CONTINUOUS

Once again, the scene idyllic. The Stauffenberg children play football in the distance. Stauffenberg himself is out of uniform for the first time since the hospital, but he does not seem relaxed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nina sits across from him, half-reading a book, half talking to her husband. Stauffenberg cannot hear a word she is saying - he is miles away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over at his children. One would never suspect that Germany has waged a calamitous war and that the country is facing total devastation.
</DIRECTION>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...After that I thought I'd take the children to the country for a few days to see my- Claus?

	Nina. Listen. I want you to delay your trip. Just for a while.

She wants to ask, he wants to tell her. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does this have something to do with... your work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would just be more comfortable knowing where you are - until I'm back from Berlin. Things will be different then. I promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
Long pause. Once again, a couple who know each other well enough to not have to say things plainly. Nina is worried but strong.
</DIRECTION>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long until... until we see you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A few days. If all goes well. Then we can travel as a family.

</STAUFFENBERG>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if things... don't go well?

<STAUFFENBERG>

</NINA>
<CHILDREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PAPA, COME AND PLAY WITH US.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Etc.)
</DIRECTION>

The children kick the ball toward Stauffenberg - the one sport he can play. He is about to say something to Nina, but she cuts him off.
</DIRECTION>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go be with your children.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg stands, touching Nina's cheek and kissing her forehead. We stay on her as he joins the children. She watches them play together, seeing her husband laughing for the first time in a long while. Her eyes well with tears - a mixture of happiness and anguish. Too good to last, too much to bear.

Haeften, Olbricht and Stauffenberg stand around a table giving their undivided attention to:

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He empties the contents of two tawny leather briefcases onto the table:

Along with a crude drawing covered with calculations he produces two brick-like lumps wrapped in butcher paper, two small caps and two thin metal cylinders.
</DIRECTION>
<MERTZ>

	Two 975 gram packs of plastic-W. Enough explosive to cripple a panzer.

The others are stunned.

<OLBRICHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just how did you manage that?

</OLBRICHT>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my job, isn't it? While Hitler's inner circle is still regrouping, you will initiate Valkyrie and seize control in Paris and Berlin. Even if Hitler survives, we'll have momentum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<MERTZ>

(to Olbricht)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But as you said yourself it would take a miracle. Anyone in that bunker when just one of these goes off is not coming out alive.

Haeften places the items back in the briefcases.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BERLIN - VARIOUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shots of scattered elements of the Reserve Army coming together, taking shape:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RESERVISTS and CADETS, from all walks of life, rush to their homes, hastily trading their civilian clothes for uniforms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIRFIELD - RANGSDORF - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES: 15 JULY 1944.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg and Haeften board a waiting courier plane, preparing for departure. Both are clutching their briefcases, faces like stone. Stauffenberg is dressed once again in his ornate, formal attire - his patch gone, glass eye in place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DEUTSCHLAND GUARD BATTALION - BERLIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AIR SIRENS wail. A SCULPTED EAGLE AND SWASTIKA loom over a large pillared stronghold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From out of the surrounding barracks, RESERVE SOLDIERS scramble to march readiness, assembling on the center parade grounds, awaiting orders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vehicles move into place along the perimeter. All in all, a well-oiled machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE BERLIN COMMANDANT - GENERAL PAUL VON HASE - issuing the alert signal. AIR SIRENS wail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RESERVE SOLDIERS scramble into readiness. Vehicles move into place - a well-oiled machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We focus on two officers in particular: MAJOR OTTO ERNST REMER, Commander of the Deutschland Guard Battalion, and SECOND LIEUTENANT DR. HANS HAGEN. Loyal Nazis both.
</DIRECTION>
<REMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you suppose this is all about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REMER>
<HAGEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably just a drill.

</HAGEN>
<DIRECTION>
But Remer doesn't seem convinced. Remember him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. VARIOUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Shots of Stauffenberg and Haeften deplaning/getting into a waiting car/slowly making their way to their destination. Finally, they arrive at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Est. A 625 acre compound hidden deep in the mosquito infested forests of Wilhelmsdorf. Security is tight - barbed wire fencing, checkpoints, flak towers, machine gun nests, trenches, land mines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES: WOLFSCHANZE - "THE WOLF'S LAIR". HITLER'S BAVARIAN HEADQUARTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - MAIN GATE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car carrying Stauffenberg and Haeften arrives at the first security checkpoint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO GUARDS check identity papers and confiscate pistols from Haeften and The Driver. Stauffenberg boldly extends his valise to one of the Guards, but rather than reach for it, the young soldier snaps to attention and raises his hand in a Nazi salute, eyes straight ahead, stone-like. A drone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After an awkward pause:
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Driver)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drive on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - VARIOUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON STAUFFENBERG'S BAG. A series of JUMP CUTS follow the bag through the extensive security layers one must endure before getting to the meeting. ID is checked frequently. The bags, not once. The men here are Hitler's inner circle, after all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - COMPOUND - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Stauffenberg and Haeften are escorted toward the bunker where the meeting will be held. Pausing, Stauffenberg looks back over his shoulder to find:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COMMUNICATIONS HUT - through the open door of the small shack we see a mass of radios and telegraphs. A LONE FIGURE stands outside, smoking a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<HAEFTEN>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering to Haeften)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAEFTEN>
<DIRECTION>
Yes. And it is none other than GENERAL ERICH FELLGIEBEL, the man Stauffenberg confronted in the bathroom at the Officers' Club so long ago.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He and Stauffenberg share a long, intense stare. Finally, Fellgiebel nods, dropping his cigarette and crushing it with his boot. He's in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg and Haeften head inside the impervious bunker through the heavy steel door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WOLF'S LAIR - BUNKER - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg and Haeften find themselves in a cramped, hot, windowless room filled with VARIOUS OFFICERS waiting around a large conference table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. A moment later, Hitler enters - Keitel and Fromm follow close behind. Heels click in unison. Keitel starts the meeting, but Stauffenberg isn't listening. While all eyes follow Hitler, Stauffenberg watches the door, scanning the faces in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Himmler. Where is Himmler?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
Haeften doesn't see him either. Shit.
</DIRECTION>
<KEITEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Now for the first order of business. Fromm, I believe you will brief us on blocking divisions for the Eastern Front...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEITEL>

Stauffenberg silently excuses himself from the room. We hold on his briefcase. Remember where he left it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The phone rings. A waiting Mertz grabs it.
</DIRECTION>
<MERTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	General Olbricht's Office.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly nervous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold the line.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Olbricht)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stauffenberg says Himmler's not at the briefing. He wants to proceed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERTZ>
<DIRECTION>
All color drains from Olbricht's face.
</DIRECTION>
<OLBRICHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call Beck.

</OLBRICHT>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves. Mertz rolls his eyes and dials a second phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SMOKY ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beck and Goerdeler sit impatiently by the telephone, waiting for any word on the assassination and impending coup. When the telephone RINGS:
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
He presses the receiver tightly to his ear, a look of concern washing over his face. He turns to Goerdeler.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Himmler is not in the briefing.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Goerdeler's reaction is vintage politician. Blank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WOLF'S LAIR - BUNKER - HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON A CIGARETTE. We watch as Stauffenberg smokes, waits, looks at his watch - the sounds of the meeting going on behind him. He drops his cigarette and we see a pile of three more. He has been waiting while the others deliberate. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<MERTZ>
<DIRECTION>
(ON PHONE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They say no. Wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERTZ>
<DIRECTION>
(Note: Intercut between Mertz and Stauffenberg.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg is furious. He calms himself.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. Mertz looks around, makes sure he is alone.
</DIRECTION>
<MERTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I say do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERTZ>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg hangs up the phone. The moment of truth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WOLF'S LAIR - BUNKER - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg quietly slips back into the briefing unnoticed. He freezes:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: The spot where Stauffenberg left his briefcase. Remember? Well it's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around frantically. Some officers notice him. Tension mounts. He gets Haeften's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
(mouthing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My briefcase.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
Before Haeften can answer, Fromm shoots them both a glare. "What the hell are you doing?"
</DIRECTION>
<KEITEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Gentleman. You are dismissed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEITEL>
<DIRECTION>
And like that, the briefing has ended. Stauffenberg is sickened - the opportunity lost. Hitler exits, walking right past him. Keitel and the rest file out. The last to leave is Fromm.
</DIRECTION>
<FROMM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That call better have been important.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROMM>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg turns, coming face-to-face with Freyend, Keitel's hateful toady. He holds the missing briefcase. For a moment we're sure the jig is up.
</DIRECTION>
<FREYEND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your bag... Colonel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREYEND>
<DIRECTION>
He hands it over and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DEUTSCHLAND GUARD BATTALION - BERLIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A military sedan skids to a stop outside the Guard Battalion headquarters. Olbricht jumps from the car, racing to get General Hase's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LARGE FORMATIONS of soldiers stand at attention in the hot sun, awaiting orders.
</DIRECTION>
<HASE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is going on? My men have been standing here for an hour. I don't know what to tell them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HASE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON REMER (the officer we told you to remember) standing before the ranks. He eyes Hase and Olbricht suspiciously, trying to hear what they are saying. After a moment, Hase addresses the men.
</DIRECTION>
<HASE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At ease, gentlemen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HASE>
<DIRECTION>
Olbricht addresses the men, trying unsuccessfully to hide his nerves.
</DIRECTION>
<OLBRICHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This has been a drill. You're all to be commended for your quick response. Dismissed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLBRICHT>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. The men linger, confused until:
</DIRECTION>
<OLBRICHT>

	HEIL HITLER.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLBRICHT>
<SOLDIERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HEIL HITLER.

</SOLDIERS>
<DIRECTION>
And the men fall out, nowhere to go so they just light up and shoot the shit. Hagen approaches Remer.
</DIRECTION>
<HAGEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did I tell you? A drill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAGEN>
<DIRECTION>
But Remer is not so sure. The way he stares at Olbricht makes us nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: Olbricht sees Remer looking at him, making note of the esteemed KNIGHT'S CROSS pinned to Remer's uniform. Olbricht leans toward Hase.
</DIRECTION>
<OLBRICHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That man there. Who is he?

</OLBRICHT>
<HASE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Major Remer? He commands the Deutschland Guard Battalion. What about him?

</HASE>
<OLBRICHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get rid of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLBRICHT>
<HASE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remer? Don't worry about him. He's an order taker. To the bone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HASE>
<DIRECTION>
Ah yes... But whose orders?

INT. WAR MINISTRY - OUTSIDE FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>

As usual, Lt. Herber sits at his desk and, as usual, he tries to ignore:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUTED SHOUTS through Fromm's office door. PULL BACK TO REVEAL Stauffenberg and Olbricht waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They sit across from, Freyend. A beat later, Keitel storms out of Fromm's office, his face red with anger. Deja vu. When Keitel and Freyend are gone:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Herber looks up from his desk with a nervous smile.
</DIRECTION>
<HERBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The General will see you now.

Stauffenberg and Olbricht stand, hats in hand.

<FROMM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll hear you say it, Colonel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROMM>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg stops, glaring at Fromm with his one eye. He squares his shoulders, clicks his heels loudly and delivers a downright Nazi-like:
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HEIL HITLER.
	</DIALOGUE>

Still managing to make it sound spiteful. He leaves without being dismissed, slamming the door.

<DIRECTION>
INT. SMOKY ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It has been a long day, the Resistance leaders are all exhausted. Beck, Olbricht, Witzleben, Haeften and Mertz watch Goerdeler circling a rigid Stauffenberg.
</DIRECTION>
<GOERDELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The point of your central solution is to replace Hitler so that we can negotiate a truce with the Allies. The Allies, I suspect, would be more amenable to a truce... IF WE OFFER IT TO THEM BEFORE THEY ARE IN FUCKING BERLIN.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOERDELER>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Today was a matter of indecision - nothing more. A military operation in the hands of a politician.

Stauffenberg's lack of respect infuriates Goerdeler.

Beck turns to the bar, pours two drinks. Stauffenberg stiffens, ready for the axe.

	I consider you a friend. And I look forward to the day when we can once again live as free men. But you've become a liability.

Goerdeler smiles smugly. But the smile fades when Beck turns, offering a drink to him.

</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
Goerdeler stands, confronting Stauffenberg.
</DIRECTION>
<GOERDELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is your doing, isn't it? ISN'T IT? You can't just get rid of me like this. I am the man Germany will follow. I'm... I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOERDELER>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg says nothing. He's too cool. Goerdeler looks at the other conspirators, but no one is going to speak for him. Finally, almost in tears:

	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Disappear, Carl. Avoid contact with anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>

Ugly pause. Goerdeler snatches the envelope and sulks out. We could not be happier to see him go. Beck coughs, turns to Stauffenberg.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>

	<DIALOGUE>
	No more indecision. From now on, Stauffenberg has discretion.

Nina and her children eat supper around a single candle, Bamberg is experiencing a blackout. Though Nina manages a tranquil facade she is anything but.

In these waking hours Berlin appears quite peaceful. Only the distant sound of shelling reminds us that the city is surrounded by war.

INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tawny leather briefcase sits on a neatly made bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg, freshly bathed and wrapped in a towel, shaves in front of the mirror. For the first time we see his scars and deformities in full. He looks himself over, finally focusing on the chain around his neck, contemplating the small cross and the ring - its engraving: finis-initium [end-beginning].
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Though his face is clean-shaven now, he continues, slowly running the razor down his throat. Then he stops, pressing the blade a little too hard and bringing blood. It almost seems intentional.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: The box that holds his glass eye, staring.
</DIRECTION>

INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - BEDROOM - LATER

Stauffenberg has since mastered the process of dressing himself. JUMP CUTS take us from a wounded soldier to an officer of the General Staff.

INT. SMOKY ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of 30 RESISTANCE OFFICERS talk quietly, smoking cigarettes and waiting anxiously. Many of the faces we recognize, some we see for the first time. We notice Witzleben has donned his old military uniform, looking a little too proud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beck looks over the faces of these men, trying to contain his own fear. His eye catches the door opening and a MAN IN A DECORATED POLICE UNIFORM entering the room. We tense.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One by one, the men in the room stop talking, staring at the police officer. Just as we think it's over:
</DIRECTION>

	Gentlemen, may I introduce Chief Helldorf. He's guaranteed the full support of the Berlin Police.

Stauffenberg and Haeften are driven in a topless sedan. Each carries his leather briefcase.

	Once in position, he will signal us once to alert the troops and again after the flash...

EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - BUNKER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg and Haeften quickly get in the sedan - the concrete bunker just behind him - its steel door closed. They speed out of frame a beat before a muffled explosion rocks the bunker - the steel door bulges but holds fast. Only a wisp of smoke escapes.
</DIRECTION>

INT. WAR MINISTRY- FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY

SOLDIERS burst into Fromm's office and arrest the bewildered General without incident.

Olbricht paces before his desk. Mertz watches him, anxiously waiting for:

EXT. AIRFIELD - RASTENBURG - DAY

The plane touches down and taxis to a stop. Stauffenberg and Haeften deplane and immediately step into a waiting courier car driven by a young, dutiful Nazi. SECOND LIEUTENANT KRETZ. Remember him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even this early, the heat is oppressive.

We watch from a distance as the courier car is stopped at the outer checkpoint. Once again, the GUARD carefully examines Stauffenberg and Haeften's identification and takes their pistols before allowing the car to pass. We follow.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Colonel Stauffenberg. This is an honor. They say you're the man that will defend Berlin from the Red Army single-hand-
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER_1>
<DIRECTION>
The officer realizes what a faux pas he has made as soon as he says it. Unfazed, Stauffenberg smiles, raising his briefcase with his single hand.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed. I've got the whole bag of tricks right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
The officers laugh nervously, relieved he was not insulted. Idiots. Meanwhile, Freyend steps toward Haeften, reaching for the handle of his briefcase.
</DIRECTION>
<FREYEND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me take that for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREYEND>
<DIRECTION>
But Haeften snaps the case back. Freyend raises a suspicious eye. Before he can press:
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colonel Stauffenberg?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Everyone turns to find General Fellgiebel standing at the door. Everyone stands at attention.
</DIRECTION>
<FELLGIEBEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At east, Gentlemen.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Stauffenberg)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	General Fellgiebel, communications. I just wanted to meet the hero of Africa... And see if there's anything you need.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELLGIEBEL>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir, there is. I'm expecting a call of the utmost importance. Even if it comes when I am in conference with the Führer I'd appreciate it if you had a man come and get me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Fellgiebel and Stauffenberg share an instant look of understanding.
</DIRECTION>
<FELLGIEBEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, Colonel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELLGIEBEL>
<DIRECTION>
Fellgiebel salutes. Stauffenberg and the others return it as Fellgiebel departs. Just then, Keitel bursts from his office, fixing his tie.
</DIRECTION>
<KEITEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen. The meeting has been pushed forward to 12:30. Mussolini is arriving on the afternoon train and Hitler wants to have lunch with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEITEL>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg is excited by a potential bonus.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will Mussolini be in the briefing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<KEITEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I only wish he were. Then some ambitious officer might take the opportunity to shoot the dago bastard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEITEL>
<DIRECTION>
Keitel makes a beeline for the door and the others follow like good sheep. Stauffenberg holds back, however, attracting Freyend's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll need a place to wash up - change my shirt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg points to the shaving cut on his throat and the tiny blood stain on his shirt. The cut was intentional after all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Annoyed, Freyend motions to the adjoining anteroom.
</DIRECTION>
<FREYEND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, do be quick. You heard the General.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREYEND>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg nods in appreciation. He motions for Haeften to follow him. Freyend watches, curious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - CHANGING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fast on Stauffenberg's heels, Haeften closes the door. A large portrait of Hitler looms, watching. Stauffenberg positions himself at a small desk with his back to the door. He removes a brick of plastic explosive from his briefcase.
</DIRECTION>
<HAEFTEN>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're arming them... now?

Stauffenberg quickly unbuttons his shirt, taking a clean one out of his bag and putting it on as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Haeften assembles a fuse.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No room for error this time. Assume I have ten minutes in this heat.

</STAUFFENBERG>
<STAUFFENBERG>

	Leaving just three minutes to place the bomb.

</STAUFFENBERG>
<HAEFTEN>

	If the bomb goes off in ten.

He carefully inserts the fuse into the explosive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The RING OF A TELEPHONE startles us.

<DIRECTION>
INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON THE TELEPHONE. Freyend answers.

Freyend hangs up, glancing impatiently at his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - CHANGING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neatly dressed again, Stauffenberg carefully places the primed explosive back in his briefcase. He and Haeften turn their attention to the second explosive - assembling the fuse, about to insert it when:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG. The door swings suddenly open - stopped short by Stauffenberg's backside. He nearly drops the fuse.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit man, what is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
It's Freyend, of course, trying to peer through the partially opened door. Stauffenberg hides the bombs with his body.
</DIRECTION>
<FREYEND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	General Keitel insists that the Colonel please hurry.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Haeften scoops the unarmed explosive into his briefcase. Stauffenberg motions for Haeften to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Haeften comes out, moving Freyend back with his body and shutting the door behind him - a charged moment.
</DIRECTION>
<HAEFTEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Colonel is changing, Major. You understand this can be difficult.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAEFTEN>
<DIRECTION>
Freyend backs down. A little.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - CHANGING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg produces a pair of pliers (one handle specially bent for easier use by a man with only three fingers). With some effort, he manages to secure the pliers around the fuse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE ACID CAPSULE OF THE FUSE. The jaws of the pliers gently squeeze, crushing it. The bomb is live. There is no turning back now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg closes his briefcase and opens the door, greeted by Freyend and Haeften.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - OUTSIDE KEITEL'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freyend scurries, trying to catch up with Keitel. Stauffenberg and Haeften lag behind.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
(to Haeften)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See that the car is ready.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
Haeften looks down at the briefcase in his hand - the second, unarmed explosive inside.
</DIRECTION>
<HAEFTEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But sir-
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAEFTEN>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have everything I need, Lieutenant. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
Haeften reluctantly takes his leave just as Freyend turns back, eager for Stauffenberg to pick up the pace. He reaches for the briefcase.
</DIRECTION>
<FREYEND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. Let me help you with that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREYEND>
<STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
(pulling it away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can manage, thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
Freyend seems more than just a little peeved. But Stauffenberg doesn't notice. He is focused straight ahead, mentally calculating what time he has left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bunker suddenly seems miles away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - OUTSIDE BUNKER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Security Perimeter I. Keitel and his men file through the heavily guarded entrance. Each man holds up his pass for the GUARDS to inspect. Stauffenberg is last.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keitel heads toward a wooden structure up ahead - AWAY FROM THE BUNKER. Stauffenberg is confused.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are they going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<FREYEND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's too hot. The briefing has been moved to the conference hut.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREYEND>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: The conference hut. The door and many windows of the flimsy wooden structure are all open. Not ideal for generating the deadly air pressure vital to Stauffenberg's plan. But this obstacle only seems to strengthen his resolve. He is a soldier after all. And no military operation goes according to plan. Making matters worse:
</DIRECTION>
<FREYEND>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, your briefcase. I insist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREYEND>
<DIRECTION>
Annoyed but not wanting to arouse suspicion, Stauffenberg finally acquiesces, handing it over. He watches Freyend carry the bomb into the hut. Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg looks back over his shoulder to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fellgiebel - standing by the communications building. The man who will get Stauffenberg out of the room before the bomb goes off. They share a nod. Then Stauffenberg steps into the hut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONFERENCE HUT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the room beyond we see Hitler at the end of a long table surrounded by RANKING OFFICERS. One by one, they present their individual briefings to the nodding Führer. Stauffenberg whispers to Freyend.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My injuries left me a bit hard of hearing. See that you place me as near the Führer as possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
Freyend nods, but for now his concerns are elsewhere - wrangling everyone into the meeting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like the other officers, Stauffenberg hangs up his belt and hat on hooks at the entrance to the briefing room. He catches sight of SERGEANT-MAJOR ADAM, the conference hut's young telephone operator.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sergeant. I'm expecting an urgent call from Berlin...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONFERENCE HUT - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small room measuring 15 by 32 feet. Stifling heat. We notice again that the windows are open to let in some air. Hitler and his officers hunch over a long, heavy table covered in detailed maps of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIEUTENANTS and SERGEANTS continually tiptoe in and out of the room. A GENERAL stands beside Hitler in the middle of his briefing:
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Eastern Front forces are assured a victory... but they need reinforcements.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL>
<DIRECTION>
In other words, they are getting pounded but he can't say that. The General is relived to be interrupted by Keitel's arrival. The briefing stops momentary as:
</DIRECTION>
<KEITEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please pardon our tardiness... You remember Colonel Stauffenberg?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEITEL>
<DIRECTION>
Hitler makes a deliberate effort to shake Stauffenberg's hand, their eyes lock - an unnerving moment. Stauffenberg has come to kill this man greeting him. The moment is broken when the General clears his throat, continuing his presentation.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you can see, Mein Führer, the situation in the East Prussian sector is increasingly critical...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(and on and on...)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freyend startles Stauffenberg slightly when he takes him by the arm, moving him to his place at the table - less than half a step from Hitler. He is squeezed in between two other officers. We suck in wind when we see who one of them is...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT - the same Brandt who carried the bottles of Cointreau onto Hitler's plane so long ago. He still scribbles in his damn datebook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freyend sets the briefcase beside Stauffenberg - bumping Brandt's leg. Brandt looks down at the briefcase - long enough to make us nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches as Stauffenberg nonchalantly bends down, sliding the briefcase as close to Hitler as possible, leaning it against the heavy wooden table support immediately to the right of Hitler's foot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg looks back at the open door, glances at his watch. He can clearly see Sergeant Adam, the telephone operator. Where is his God-damn phone call?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Around him generals talk, Hitler nods, but we hear nothing. Only the pulse of Stauffenberg's heartbeat in his own ears - the only thing betraying his otherwise outward calm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down at the briefcase - the bomb just under his feet. He looks at Hitler nodding. The longer we stay, the more excruciating it is. So we milk it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg is startled when a hand touches his arm. The annoying Freyend is there, whispering in his ear. Keitel sees this, irritated by the interruption. Stauffenberg makes a gesture to Keitel with his hand, indicating a phone call. Keitel is not pleased.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONFERENCE HUT - HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freyend leads Stauffenberg to Adam who offers the telephone receiver.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	General Fellgiebel, sir. He says it's urgent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg takes the phone and stares at Freyend and Adam - they get the idea that this is a private call and leave. When they are gone, Stauffenberg simply lays the receiver down and walks out. Fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later, Adam returns to the room. He sees the receiver laying there. Odd. Looking down the hallway he sees Stauffenberg quickly exiting the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he notices Stauffenberg's hat and belt still hanging outside the briefing room.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>

INT. CONFERENCE HUT - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hitler leans on his elbows carefully studying the map before him as the General's presentation drags on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brandt moves in closer, filling the void left by Stauffenberg. His foot hits something. He looks at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg's briefcase as it falls over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, Brandt reaches down, picking up the briefcase, looking around for Stauffenberg. He considers the bag for a moment and we are sure he is going to open it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then he puts it back under the table. But now the heavy wooden support is BETWEEN Hitler and the bomb.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...And now I believe Colonel Stauffenberg will present us with his deployment for the Replacement Army should the unthinkable occur and the Russians reach-
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL>
<DIRECTION>
Where is Stauffenberg? Keitel shoots Freyend a look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONFERENCE HUT - HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freyend steps into the hall. No sign of Stauffenberg. Sergeant Adam approaches, looking confused.
</DIRECTION>
<FREYEND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where the hell is Stauffenberg?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREYEND>
<DIRECTION>
But Adam shrugs, holding out Stauffenberg's hat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - COMMUNICATIONS BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fellgiebel and Haeften watch anxiously as Stauffenberg clears the security checkpoint and walks toward them, slow and deliberate - eerily calm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONFERENCE HUT - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hitler at the far end of the room, bent over the conference table, leaning on his elbows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MASSIVE, EAR-SPLITTING EXPLOSION lifts the table up, throwing Hitler back and simultaneously vaporizing the men standing on either side of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - CONFERENCE HUT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hut explodes outward like a house of cards. Bodies are thrown clear. Everyone hits the deck except Stauffenberg. He just keeps walking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A great cloud of smoke billows from the ruins. The sky is alive with a swirl of burnt paper scraps and ash. STUNNED OFFICERS are running about. Shouting. Screaming. Absolute chaos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even knowing it was coming, Haeften is stunned. Stauffenberg walks up to the communications building and takes him by the arm, turning to Fellgiebel.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Contact General Olbricht in Berlin. Tell him Hitler is dead. Proceed with Operation Valkyrie. Then sever all communications.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
Fellgiebel nods and rushes to make the call. Stauffenberg leads Haeften to their waiting car - still driven by young Lt. Kretz.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He too is stunned by the explosion - so much so that he does not think to get out and open the door for his passengers. Stauffenberg climbs in next to Kretz, pushing Haeften in the back.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (to Kretz)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drive.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LIEUTENANT.

</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
Kretz snaps out of it and jams the car in gear, speeding off down the forested trail. Stauffenberg and Haeften look back for a clear view of the total destruction. Bodies are carried out of the demolished hut - the grounds littered with the wounded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Surly there is no way the Führer could have survived.

COME AROUND TO HIS P.O.V. Share his horror. Through the window, Fellgiebel has a clear view of the conference hut, or rather what's left.

Kretz brings the car to a sudden stop at the first checkpoint. A barricade is in place. A GUARD approaches. Stauffenberg and Haeften hold up passes.

	We have to get to the airfield at once. Orders form the Führer.

The guard signals his men to remove the barricade.

<DIRECTION>
INT. COMMUNICATIONS HUT - MOMENTS LATER

Fellgiebel waits to be connected to the War Ministry in Berlin. His Communications Officer awaits orders. This makes it hard for Fellgiebel to speak plainly. He plays up his distress for his audience.

Stauffenberg wipes a single bead of sweat from his brow. With the guards hovering over him, he turns and casually sits on the desk, blocking the phone with his body. He surreptitiously rests his hand on the telephone cradle, hanging up. He talks to no one.

P.O.V. IN REARVIEW MIRROR. Haeften rummages through his briefcase, removing objects Kretz can't make out - tossing them, one by one, into the woods. Haeften realizes he is being watched by Kretz in the mirror and shoots him a look. "Mind your own business."

Forty-five precious minutes have slipped away.

Mertz sits alone at Olbricht's desk, lighting a fresh cigarette with the remains of another. The ashtray says he's been at this for quite a while. He stares at the clock, as if attempting to will time forward.
</DIRECTION>

His eyes sweep across Olbricht's desk, past his files, his stationery, framed photographs of his family. Then he looks up at a portrait of Hitler.

Mertz is struck suddenly with a notion. He looks again at Olbricht's desk. His stationery...

"Fuck it."

He grabs the stationery and feeds it into a typewriter.

The TELETYPE OPERATOR looks up at Helm. "What do I do?" Helm glances over his shoulder to the uptight Lt. Haan - oblivious. Helm shrugs.

We get our first good look at the demolished briefing hut. That anyone survived is a miracle. Officers crowd around the smoldering ruins, the Führer himself heading this procession. He wears new clothes, nodding, smiling politely to the jabbering Italian O.S. A slight wince is the only indication that he was damn near blown to bits just hours ago.

INT. WAR MINISTRY- HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg, Mertz and Olbricht march with great purpose. They are joined by Beck, coming the other way, wearing a plain dark suit. It is moving to see the old man manage the long walk.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not in uniform.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This has to be seen as a movement of the people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
Then he takes Stauffenberg's arm, letting Mertz and Olbricht walk on, lowering his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're certain he's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
Certain? Stauffenberg can see the private fear in beck's eyes. But before he can answer, he is interrupted by a gasp O.S. as Olbricht opens the door to his office, stepping back in shock. The others turn to see what it is...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking out at the shocked faces of Olbricht, Mertz, Beck and Stauffenberg. PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olbricht's office is packed to the four walls with GERMAN OFFICERS - all of them standing in silence, looking at the leaders of the Resistance with great respect. Stauffenberg walks in and the crowd parts, solemn and silent, nodding and whispering thanks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A YOUNG OFFICER steps forward. He looks hauntingly like the Lieutenant who drove Stauffenberg in Africa.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colonel Stauffenberg, sir. We're reporting for duty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg is moved beyond words. Suddenly, what was once a small clutch of discarded generals and politicians is now a movement of motivated men. Stauffenberg nods, collects himself. In the crowd he finds Helldorf, the head of the Berlin Police, whom we met earlier. At first he speaks quietly, humbled.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Helldorf, I'm... glad to see you. We're getting a late start and we need all of the manpower we can muster. Can we count on the police?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<HELLDORF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a lot of talk that Hitler isn't really dead. Is this true?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLDORF>
<DIRECTION>
Awkward pause. Good question. The men in the room share nervous glances. Then all eyes on Stauffenberg.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't offer you any guarantees. The decision is yours and yours alone. Can we count on you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
Long pause. PAN ACROSS the uneasy faces of the men in the room, perhaps all of them waiting to see what Helldorf does before making their decisions. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<HELLDORF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLDORF>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg can barely hide his relief. There is a palpable shift in the room. One by one, the officers in the room reaffirm their commitment to the coup.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have your men surround the building. No one gets in or out of here without my permission.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the others)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want every available soldier on task - we need simultaneous control of every government building in the city. Dismissed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
The soldiers move, but Beck's voice stops them - surprisingly loud and clear for a sick old man.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Acts of vengeance will not be tolerated. We represent a different form of government. We represent what is good and just in Germany.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
AN EXPLOSION OF ACTIVITY:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAR MINISTRY - STAUFFENBERG'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg stands at his cluttered desk, a flurry of activity surrounding him. He is frantically speaking into the phone and to those present.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Deploy troops to seize and protect all Reich agencies. Of most importance are communication centers - newspapers, radio stations, telephone and telegraph offices. All Nazi officials and government leaders are to be arrested at once...

INT. MILITARY COMMANDANT'S OFFICE - BERLIN - DAY

General Hase, the Berlin Commandant, stands before a giant map of Berlin, addressing a roomful of NAZI OFFICERS.

<HASE>

	... Completely blockade the government quarters. Everything from the Brandenburg Gate to Potsdamer Platz. Nobody, not even generals or ministers, should be allowed to pass.

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have your orders, gentlemen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HASE>
<DIRECTION>
Again, we focus on Major Remer, Commander of the Deutschland Guard Battalion and always suspicious.
</DIRECTION>
<HASE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there a problem, Major?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HASE>
<REMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It just all seems very... vague, sir. Protocol dictates we should receive orders in writing-

</REMER>
<HASE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are the orders as they were presented to me, Major. Now move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HASE>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. Just before the pause becomes insolent, Remer clicks his heels and salutes, leaving. But the look on his face tells us he's hatching a plan of his own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
You are right to be nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GOVERNMENT QUARTERS - BERLIN - VARIOUS - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The city center is abuzz with soldiers and military vehicles as they frantically cordon off the streets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOLDIERS come out of various government buildings with SEVERAL NAZI GENERALS in custody, hands bound. They push them into waiting trucks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, PASSING CIVILIANS walk quickly by, trying to pretend they don't see anything. Years of Nazi rule have told them to mind their own business.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: A staff car - Major Remer in the back, watching the entire scene with cold eyes. Lt. Hagen emerges from the chaos on the streets.
</DIRECTION>
<HAGEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Major Remer. We've just had orders from the War Ministry. The battalion is to blockade the government quarter and place Minister Goebbels under arrest.

INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg, Beck and Olbricht lead a continued effort to manage the coup. Each man shouts orders into the phone, all the while signing dispatches sent by a steady flow of RUNNERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRAULEIN VON OVEN (the secretary who worked with Stauffenberg and Tresckow to compile the Valkyrie orders) rushes in, whispering to Stauffenberg.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Send him in.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Oven hesitates)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right. Send him in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the door and motions to someone outside. After a beat, the door is filled with an almost classic looking Nazi - A FAT GENERAL bristling with medals. He enters the room, confused when he sees Olbricht at Fromm's desk.
</DIRECTION>
<FAT_GENERAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Begging your pardon, but I have orders to report to General Fromm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAT_GENERAL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Beck? What are you- What is going on here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAT_GENERAL>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Führer is dead. The SS is staging a coup. We've initiated Operation Valkyrie to crush the uprising and save Hitler's Germany.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
The Fat General assesses the scene with suspicion.
</DIRECTION>
<FAT_GENERAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd say there is a coup all right, but it's not the SS.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAT_GENERAL>
<DIRECTION>
Olbricht offers a sheet of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<OLBRICHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will present these orders to your troops.

<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have your orders. Join us or face the consequences.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg and Olbricht take an imposing step in the Fat General's direction. He carefully backs away.
</DIRECTION>
<FAT_GENERAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is treason. I won't take part. The Führer is not dead. THE FÜHRER IS NOT DEAD.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAT_GENERAL>
<DIRECTION>
The Fat General makes a break for it. The conspirators chase him out into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAR MINISTRY - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Fat General pushes past ONLOOKING OFFICERS.
</DIRECTION>
<OLBRICHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	STOP THAT MAN.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLBRICHT>
<DIRECTION>
But they just watch the commotion, stunned. A ranking general being chased like a common criminal. Surreal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Haeften and Mertz appear at the other end of the hall - pistols raised, blocking the General's path. With Stauffenberg and Olbricht they overpower the Fat General who screams wildly to the amazement of the gawking officers.
</DIRECTION>
<FAT_GENERAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THE FÜHRER IS NOT DEAD. I'VE SWORN AN OATH. YOU ALL HAVE...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAT_GENERAL>
<DIRECTION>
When they have him under control, Stauffenberg turns to the onlookers. He finds a familiar face in the crowd. A face he can trust. He finds:
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lt. Herber. Come here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: Lt. Herber. "Who, me?" He reluctantly steps forward.

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lock him up with Fromm.

Herber hesitantly takes hold of the General, but the act of taking a General into custody is a strange one. Herber is clearly conflicted.

Est. Remer arrives, followed by a wave of trucks. Soldiers deploy, surrounding the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REICHMINISTRY - GOEBBELS' OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Propaganda Minister Goebbels - the most ghoulish of Hitler's Big Six. His spooky, deep-set eyes watch the action on the street below. Already he can hear troops coming down the hallway. He takes a pistol from his desk drawer and leaves it within reach. Then he picks up the phone and dials. After a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<GOEBBELS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am ready to be connected.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOEBBELS>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of footsteps outside his door. It bursts open. Remer enters, followed by ARMED SOLDIERS.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can I do for you, Major?

<REMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Minister Goebbels, my battalion has an order to blockade the government quarter and place you under arrest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REMER>
<DIRECTION>
Remer sees the pistol on Goebbels desk. But Goebbels makes no attempt to grab for it. Instead:
</DIRECTION>
<GOEBBELS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you a dedicated Nazi, Major?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOEBBELS>
<DIRECTION>
Remer is caught off guard.
</DIRECTION>
<REMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REMER>
<DIRECTION>
With that Goebbels turns his attention to the phone in his hand. We hear a faint voice: "Hello?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With an eerie smile, Goebbels simply extends his arm, offering the phone to a confused Remer. Silence as the Major takes it, holding it to his ear...
</DIRECTION>

<HAANS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it now, Sergeant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAANS>
<HELM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just that now we're getting conflicting orders, sir. The Wolf's Lair says one thing, Stauffenberg another.

Haans sighs, genuinely irritated now.
</DIRECTION>
<HAANS>

	Our job is not to interpret the orders. Our job is to pass them along. Regardless.

<HELM>

</HELM>
<HAANS>
	<DIALOGUE>

Haans thrusts the orders back at Helm who sheepishly walks back to his pool of radio operators.

As day turns to night, the soldiers surrounding the government quarters wait for further orders.

Major Remer comes out a new man - invigorated and focused. He walks over to a truck loaded with RANKING PRISONERS, turning to the soldiers guarding them.

INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fromm is a prisoner in his own quarters - staring at a portrait of Hitler with equal parts disdain and reverence. The door suddenly opens.
</DIRECTION>

Herber enters, leading the handcuffed Fat General. Avoiding Fromm's gaze, he removes the restraints and turns to leave. But the wily Fromm can see the look in Herber's eyes.
</DIRECTION>

	Well, Lieutenant. What do you make of all of this?

INT. REICHMINISTRY - GOEBBELS' OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Goebbels' office is now the scene of great activity. Soldiers rush in and out carrying orders. Goebbels is on two phones at the same time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the melee comes none other than Heinrich Himmler - the bespectacled villain whose appearance is unmatched in fiction. His arrival cannot be good.

Goebbels and Himmler, two of the most evil men who ever lived, smile coldly. Being taken alive by this mob is obviously a fate worse than death.

	It's a coup all right... And when it's over, we'd better wind up on the right side. Now we can't afford to remain neutral any longer. We have to make a decision.

CLOSE ON: Haans. All eyes watch him weigh the decision of his life, of many lives. Millions in fact. Finally he relents, handing one paper to Helm.

Stauffenberg works frantically in a room full of officers - the energy here being the antithesis of Goebbels' office - the morale quickly waning.

He ignores the radio, writing orders, making phone calls, fighting to keep the coup alive. But we know now his orders are hitting a dead end.

He sits at his desk. With a long trembling sigh, he puts pen to paper and writes:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"My dearest wife..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A commotion from the anteroom startles Olbricht and he drops the pen. A loud, shrill scream follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door bursts open to reveal Herber and his TWO COHORTS. They are supported by A HALF DOZEN ARMED SOLDIERS, all training their weapons on Olbricht.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the anteroom behind the soldiers we see Fraulein Oven quietly slipping out into the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beck, Stauffenberg and Haeften are still making calls and writing orders - doing all they can to keep the coup alive. They are startled when Fraulein Oven bursts in. It is written on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAR MINISTRY - HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg and Haeften rush toward Olbricht's office, stopping when they see a MASS OF SOLDIERS surrounding the doorway. A chill runs down our spines when we see Herber talking to none other than Major Remer. Just then, he spots Stauffenberg and Haeften.
</DIRECTION>
<REMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU THERE.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REMER>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg and Haeften turn and run.
</DIRECTION>
<REMER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HALT.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REMER>
<DIRECTION>
BANG. A shot is fired. Stauffenberg and Haeften take cover in a nearby doorway. Haeften returns fire. Stauffenberg clamps his pistol under the stump of his right arm, managing to cock it with the three fingers of his left hand. Awkward. Then he aims and fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg takes a bullet in the shoulder of his good arm. He drops his gun, bleeding badly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But MORE SOLDIERS appear at the opposite end of the corridor. The loyal Haeften covers Stauffenberg with his body, aiming to fire. But Stauffenberg stops him, shaking his head. It's over. They toss down their guns. Boot-steps approach loudly O.S.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Stauffenberg looks down at the cross and ring around his neck:
</DIRECTION>
<HAEFTEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Colonel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAEFTEN>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg is genuinely confused. "For what?"
</DIRECTION>
<HAEFTEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better I die for Germany than for Hitler.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAEFTEN>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colonel Stauffenberg.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg turns to find Remer standing there.
</DIRECTION>
<REMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're under arrest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REMER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg, Olbricht, Beck, Mertz and Haeften, the last of the conspiracy, are held at gunpoint. A smug Fromm enters, followed by Herber, the Fat General, Remer and numerous GUN-TOTING OFFICERS.
</DIRECTION>
<FROMM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you have any last messages, you'd better write them now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROMM>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My actions speak for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to his men)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd rather my wife and children remember our last time together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
The others bravely nod in agreement. But then:
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like a pistol, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg looks at Beck with surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For personal reasons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
Fromm thinks about it, then matter-of-factly hands Beck a pistol. Remer quickly steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<REMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	General, my orders are to deliver the prisoners alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REMER>
<FROMM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Noted, Major.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Beck)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get on with it then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROMM>
<REMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, sir-
	</DIALOGUE>
</REMER>
<FROMM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THAT WILL BE ALL, MAJOR.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROMM>
<DIRECTION>
Fromm glares at Remer who angrily backs down. Then he turns to Beck and with a casual wave of the hand:
</DIRECTION>
<FROMM>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Continue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROMM>
<DIRECTION>
The moment is surreal. Beck, seated at the desk, looks at each of his fellow conspirators. A look of thanks, goodbye. With a badly trembling hand he places the gun to his temple.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm thinking of earlier times...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: The conspirators turn away, unable to watch. Except Stauffenberg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And as if none of the last minute has even occurred, Fromm turns to the other conspirators.
</DIRECTION>
<FROMM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well then... A court martial, convened by me in the Führer's absence, has pronounced sentence: Colonel Mertz von Quernheim, General Olbricht, Lieutenant Haeften...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glaring at Stauffenberg)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the Colonel, whose name I will not mention, are condemned to death.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to his men)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take them outside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROMM>
<DIRECTION>
Remer is clearly upset by this. Herber, on the other hand, seems clearer than ever. He nods to his men who drag the conspirators out. Herber personally takes Stauffenberg by the arm. The two men share a look. Nothing needs to be said. Each has found his place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg turns to confront Fromm. He is weak, white from fatigue and loss of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Führer will want to put us on trial, make an example of us. This won't win you any favor. And it won't hide you're involvement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<FROMM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Involvement. I don't know what you-
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROMM>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You knew and you did nothing. You're just as guilty as we are. Even more so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<FROMM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spare me, Stauffenberg.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROMM>
<DIRECTION>
And those words bring a genuine smile to Stauffenberg's face. He almost pities Fromm now.
</DIRECTION>
<STAUFFENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one will be spared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAUFFENBERG>
<DIRECTION>
And as Fromm motions for Herber to take Stauffenberg away, we hear music, faintly at first - accompanied by the subtle hiss and crackles of a phonograph... It is the piece Stauffenberg and Nina were dancing to one night long ago... Over this:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A voice. A man speaking in German - faint at first, crackling over the radio.
</DIRECTION>
<HITLER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My comrades. Once again - I don't know how many times it has been now - an attempt has been made on my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HITLER>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. BERLIN - VARIOUS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A series of images of the coup being reversed as the Nazis take back power, made all the more poignant by the lonely sound of the phonograph, the music slowly rising, growing clearer and eventually becoming score over the silent images of:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Conspirators being rounded up and arrested. Among them are faces we recognize...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Goerdeler, dragged from a hotel bed by SS OFFICERS as his informing INNKEEPER watches from the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES: DR. CARL GOERDELER - TRIED, 7 SEPTEMBER 1944. HANGED, 2 FEBRUARY 1945.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WAR MINISTRY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Military vehicles are hastily arranged in a semi- circle - headlamps marking the scene in stark white light and long black shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg, Haeften, Olbricht and Mertz are marched into the courtyard, squinting in the harsh light as they are placed against the wall of the War Ministry.
</DIRECTION>
<HITLER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I speak to you tonight for two reasons. First, so that you can hear my voice and know that I am unhurt. And second, so that you may know the details of a crime without parallel in German history...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HITLER>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. BERLIN - VARIOUS - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Fellgiebel is swarmed by SS in his office at the Wolf's Lair and summarily beaten.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WAR MINISTRY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TEN SOLDIERS of the Deutschland Guard Battalion scramble to form a line opposite Stauffenberg and his conspirators. We can clearly read Fromm's lips, shouting: "MAKE READY..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg and Haeften share a reassuring smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Remer watches bitterly from the shadows, focusing his hatred not on the conspirators... but on Fromm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. BERLIN - VARIOUS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Berthold, Stauffenberg's brother, is taken from his flat in Berlin.

Fromm smiles to himself, satisfied.
</DIRECTION>
<HITLER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A small clique of ambitious, dishonorable, stupid officers have conspired to eliminate me. Except for a few bruises and burns, I was completely untouched.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HITLER>
<DIRECTION>
Fromm raises his arm, his lips reading: "TAKE AIM..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES: GENERAL FRIEDRICH FROMM - TRIED, 7 MARCH 1945. EXECUTED, 12 MARCH 1945.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stauffenberg takes a breath and shouts defiantly, his lips reading: "Long live sacred German-"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fromm drops his hand. Ten rifles open fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRANE UP and away as the music swells, as what is left of Berlin comes into view, as the few lights that remain suddenly go out as if a dark shadow were passing over the land.
</DIRECTION>
<HITLER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see in this the hand of Providence... directing me to complete my work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HITLER>
<DIRECTION>
And the last strains of music resolve in a single, sustained note as we CRANE UP FURTHER, looking at last to the overcast darkness of the night sky. The last note goes on as if it might play forever...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until suddenly it dips and we realize we are no longer hearing music at all, but the urgent wailing of an air-raid siren - the warning of allied bombers coming to deliver their nightly assault on Berlin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hitler's gift to Germany.
</DIRECTION>
