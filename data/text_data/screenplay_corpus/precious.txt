EXT HARLEM STREET ­ DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A COLD WIND blows a bright red scarf tangled high on a street lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An iron waste bin is blown sideways into an intersection. A stray dog investigates it briefly, urinates and then moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A book bag drops onto the pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Visible from the waist down, a LARGE YOUNG WOMAN in a disintegrating leather jacket turns the waste bin upright and then maneuvers it onto the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once finished, her thick hands wipe each other until they stop abruptly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Here, for the first time, we see her PLUMP, YOUTHFUL, VACANT AFRICAN AMERICAN FACE. It is 16-YEAR-OLD PRECIOUS JONES. Something inside the bin has caught her attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Precious gazes down upon a soiled and tattered paperback book as the breath from her nostrils steams. The title of the book staring back up at her is unintelligible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes debris aside to get to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The book plunges deeper into the trash, as if trying to flee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of an ONCOMING CAR approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Precious pins the book against the bottom of the bin as the sounds of the oncoming car close in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Precious finally comes up with the book. Its title is still unintelligible. When she flips it over, however, the letters on the cover, which are facing us now, make sense. They read CRYSTAL STAIR: SELECTED WORKS BY LANGSTON HUGHES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car sounds incredibly close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Precious looks sharply to her left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN EERIE SKID precedes an eerier THUD! Precious, almost hit, falls back on to the pavement as her book skips across the intersection and down into a drain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lays on the sidewalk pressed against the base of the street lamp with her eyes closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car reverses, skids, stops for a sec, shifts and SCREECHES off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The garbage bin, overturned yet again, rocks side to side until settling, to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ambulance eases up to the intersection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the stoplight changes, the ambulance motors past Precious in no hurry. A moment later, its sirens BLARE and it speeds off into the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stray dog returns, re-investigates the garbage bin, and turns to Precious. He licks her face. Tom Cruise walks up to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Precious' still vacant eyes finally open to see Tom, and the red scarf falling from the street lamp towards her. Tom gives her a hand up.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>

An unconvinced Precious grins sadly as Mrs. Lichenstein motions for Precious to step out ahead of her.

Mr. Wicher looks abandoned. The door closing behind Precious might as well be to a prison cell block. Noise inside the classroom returns immediately.

Precious lunges for a trash bin into which she promptly vomits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She quickly catches her breath. Wipes her mouth and looks 10 feet away at a brightness coming from an open doorway. Her HEART BEATS loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Precious stands up. She seems to be there for a considerable spell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A blur of a young girl darts into the room from the other end of the hall without looking at her.
</DIRECTION>

MS. RAIN, PETITE, AFRICAN AMERICAN, BEAUTIFUL, THIRTIES, ALERT EYES enters the hallway looking at her watch and then up to Precious.

A seventh desk sits well apart from the others back beneath the windows.

She sits with the other girls delicately, as if she were a visitor in a complete stranger's home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ms. Rain finishes marking the roll sheet, places the cap on her pen and holds up a notebook identical to the one Precious left at the Kickin Fried Chicken.
</DIRECTION>
<MS_RAIN>

Precious dashes after her but winces in pain grabbing her pelvic area along the way.

The Bug Lady follows Precious as a speed walker might.

<MS_RAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last night I had a conversation with my mother, and that never happens cause our relationship is.... complicated.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some folks got a light around them that shine for other peoples. I think maybe some of them was in a long tunnel before.

<DIRECTION>
She stops momentarily to straighten her clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she finally reaches a day room at the other end of the hall, she looks through its window for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary sits inside crushing and dwarfing the couch upon which she waits. She looks frail. Her wig is half combed. She's nervous. Her sweaty hands crumple her cigarette package.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Precious covers her nose a moment, lowers her hand, readies herself and then steps into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once inside the room, and for the first time, Precious' soft face looks like stone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary looks up with a brief but quickly fading smile that is pathetic, apologetic and grim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Precious waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The air is thick without a single word between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Mary looks down.

Precious enters, takes Abdul from his crib, holds him closely and sits on her bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moments later, a TAPPING on the window draws her attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Precious rises to find Tom Cruise hurling pebbles up at her window in a leather jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MOTORCYCLE sits a few feet away from him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He beckons her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stares down at him with solemn eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom finally mounts his bike and vanishes into thin air while revving its engine.

Precious walks over the crest of a hill deep in thought with her hands in her pockets. The constant HUM of the city seems lower than usual as Precious' FOOTSTEPS make the most prominent sound.

From this distant view, it appears as if she is almost walking in place.

INT. HOTEL THERESA CLASSROOM - DAY

A FEMALE COUNSELOR WITH SYMPATHETIC EYES carrying a file sits across from her.

Her eyes say everything.

All the girls write in their journals except for Precious, who again looks preoccupied.

Ms. Rain waits for a response.

<MS_RAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Precious, bring your journal to me.

</MS_RAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Precious waits a moment and then shakes her head without looking up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ms. Rain goes to her desk and picks up the journal without resistance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The words "Why me?" sit alone on the page with lines crossed through them. Ms. Rain returns the journal to Precious' desk still opened to the same page.
</DIRECTION>
<MS_RAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Precious, would you come to my office for a moment?

</MS_RAIN>

Still trying to stay composed, Precious wipes her face.

Precious stops herself abruptly as if being overwhelmed by a sense of futility.
</DIRECTION>
<MS_RAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think telling your story will get you over that river Precious ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_RAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Precious erupts hurling her journal sharply across the room. It bounces hard off the blackboard and stops abruptly on the floor facedown.
</DIRECTION>
<PRECIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FUCK YOU! YOU DON'T KNOW NUFFIN WHAT I BEEN THROUGH!!! I NEVER HAD NO BOYFRIEND! MY DADDY SAY HE GONNA MARRY ME BUT HOW HE DO THAT, FUCKING ME ILLEGAL? I NEVER BEEN NO CHILD! NOT EVEN ONE DAY!!!

The class looks shocked. Precious' wet eyes are filled with fury.

A moment later, Ms. Rain walks calmly across the room, retrieves the journal and places it back on top of Precious' desk.
</DIRECTION>
<MS_RAIN>

</PRECIOUS>
<MS_RAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That wasn't love. There are people in this room who love you. Your child loves you too. Is that clear Precious? Now if Rita decided to just give up? Would you let her?

</MS_RAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Precious doesn't answer.

Precious doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<MS_RAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MS_RAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Precious looks to her side and finds Rita smiling reassuringly through her crooked teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<MS_RAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now the rest of the world can judge you, cheat you, beat you, dismiss you and abandon you all it wants but we won't let you give up and that's the only thing that matters. Some people have less than that on their side and still manage to keep going.

Precious thinks a long moment, wipes her face and exhales. She doesn't move for what seems like ages.
</DIRECTION>

The whole class watches her until Ms. Rain motions for them to continue working. Finally, Precious takes hold of her pen, opens her journal, sighs deeply and starts to write again.
