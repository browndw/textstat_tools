INT. STEAK HOUSE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two couples sit at a table, picking at dessert, JOHN and LARA BRENNAN on one side, MICK and ERIT on the other. JOHN is attractive in a worn kind of way, but has the eyes of a kid with a discipline problem. You have to really know him to understand if he is mocking you or agreeing with you. He is a master of irony and has a true enjoyment of the absurd. LARA looks beautiful even in her wrinkled suit. She appears to have had a hard day at the office. She's been drinking at dinner; it hasn't eased her nerves. John's good-looking brother, MICK, boasts his blue collar roots and a gorgeous, if slightly trashy, girlfriend, ERIT, who isn't ashamed of her body or sharing her opinions. JOHN and MICK are laughing. Lara puts cash on the tray beside Mick's credit card.

<LARA>

	You know what? If you were smart you would stop talking right now.

</LARA>
<ERIT>

John laughs and applauds. Mick buries his head.

<LARA>

	Erit, you are so full of shit.

</LARA>
<ERIT>

	So, your boss isn't threatened by you?

</ERIT>
<LARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because she's a bitch! --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as John and Mick laugh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--Not because she's a woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARA>
<ERIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you would describe her as "attractive"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIT>
<LARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That has nothing to do with it!

</LARA>
<ERIT>

Lara shoots John a burning look as Erit builds on her victory.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Women should work under men, men under women. That's it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIT>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(egging her on)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But men under men?

</JOHN>
<ERIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's fine, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(the men burst into laughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're used to it! Why are you laughing?

</ERIT>
<MICK>

(re: Erit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, bro, but I think I'd rather work under you than her.

</MICK>
<ERIT>
<DIRECTION>
(insulted, shoots back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh please, I'd rather work under him, too.

That was a dig at Mick but Lara is primed for a fight.
</DIRECTION>
<LARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd rather "work under" John?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARA>
<ERIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a problem with that, too?

</ERIT>
<LARA>

</LARA>
<ERIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is up your ass tonight??

</ERIT>
<DIRECTION>
Mick throws John a "This is all your fault and now it is going to explode" look. John feigns complete innocence.

<LARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, I shouldn't take offense that you're coming on to my husband right in front of me.

</LARA>

</ERIT>
<LARA>

	How? You couldn't possibly show him more of your tits.

The men are on their feet before blows are exchanged.

<LARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up.

</LARA>
<JOHN>

</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Lara opens the back door of their black Prius and tosses in the raincoat she was carrying. They climb in, under....
</DIRECTION>
<LARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are completely delusional. She wasn't even hitting on you in there; I just don't like her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARA>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand. People who look like that should not be allowed anywhere near oral surgery.

She feels a smile coming to her lips and tries to force it away.

</JOHN>

Her hand goes to his pants. He yanks at the seat lever and it goes crashing back, Lara landing atop him.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Jenna exits. Lara shows him that his sweater is inside out. John reacts: "Oh God." Lara's smile broadens; she kisses him. He pins her to the wall and they start all over again. He feels for the light switch. He finds it; we cut to BLACK.

The door at the far side buzzes, a guard opens it and prisoners in red jump-suits marked VISITING ROOM enter.

Lara enters and looks around. She is pale, thin and her hair has returned to its natural color. Lara hurries to him and gives him a real kiss. She breaks and steps to Luke, who plays with his back to her.

INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The prisoners file out and are patted down. Lara turns and blows Luke and John a kiss. They watch with the other visitors, who all stand on the far side of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COUNTY JAIL - CHANGING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lara and the female inmates pull off their visiting jump- suits and hand them to a female guard, who searches them for contraband. Lara retrieves her regular jump-suit and pulls it on over her underwear. Another small, daily humiliation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOHN'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Start VERY CLOSE ON JOHN'S DIGITAL WATCH. Widen to see Luke standing on a low step at the sink in his pajamas using a complicated-looking electric toothbrush. John sits on the toilet, staring at his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.

Luke puts it down and checks his teeth in the mirror.

	Good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Luke nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE AND ALLEY -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The garage door opens; the Prius has a lot more miles on it. John backs out, Luke in his child seat. He brakes and finds PAULA, the woman who lives behind them, at his window.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's Lara?

She holds up a plastic water bottle.

<PAULA>

	They won't recycle these unless you take off the cap.

	This is trash. This is recyclable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULA>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
John drives off, wondering what kind of world he lives in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARK -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting on the park bench, John allows his feelings to wash over his face. He watches Luke play with a girl his age.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Luke! Let's go, Toad. Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Luke runs to him. John pulls Luke's jacket on. He doesn't notice the young mother on the next bench, NICOLE, watching him admiringly. She calls to the girl Luke was playing with.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time to go, Carrie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<DIRECTION>
John glances in time to see CARRIE plop down in the sand, arms folded. He shares a sympathetic smile with Nicole, who heads to retrieve her daughter. John walks off with Luke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John waits as a courtroom lets out. MEYER FISK steps out with a young associate. He spots John and approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<MEYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John, I said my office at four o'clock. I can't leave, I'm in --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEYER>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(holds up a Subway bag)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I figured you had to eat.

</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Meyer relents, turns and calls to his associate.
</DIRECTION>
<MEYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have the ruling in Brennan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEYER>
<DIRECTION>
She kneels and digs through her rolling briefcase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COURTROOM -- A SHORT TIME LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John sits on a bench, pale and shaken, flipping through the ruling. The courtroom is empty, save a bailiff eating at his desk. During this he gets up and walks out past them.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what if we find the woman who was leaving the parking lot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<MEYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The PCRA was rejected. No new evidence can be submitted. Not anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEYER>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a robbery! Someone stole her purse!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<MEYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if they'd used her credit cards we would have had something to argue. I'm sorry; this really...sucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEYER>
<DIRECTION>
John offers a smile at Meyer's unlawyer-like choice of words.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, that's it. Now we just have the Supreme Court.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<MEYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John, in the last thirty years, the Supreme Court hasn't heard one murder case. No decent lawyer would even file the pleadings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEYER>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, I need to find an indecent one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<MEYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm going to file it. But I need you to do something for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEYER>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything.

(stopped by that)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've seen the evidence, Meyer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<MEYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not saying judge her innocent or guilty, I'm just saying look at it. He co-worker sees her leaving the scene, she has the victim's blood on her clothes, her fingerprints on the murder weapon--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEYER>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(is this a bad joke?)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We went out for dinner! How do you do that after you kill somebody? She would have to be a psychopath!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<MEYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- And the fight in the office.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEYER>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone fights with their boss!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<MEYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this one ended up dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEYER>
<DIRECTION>
John looks at Meyer anew, feeling profoundly betrayed.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you never believed she was innocent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<MEYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you say that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEYER>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what are you saying, Meyer?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<MEYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That it no longer matters what we believe; Lara's not getting out. And you have no idea how much I hate saying that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEYER>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(exiting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll find someone to file the pleadings.

</MEYER>

John is long gone. Meyer hurls his sandwich into the trash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COUNTY JAIL - VISITING BOOTHS -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John waits alone on the visitors' side of the glass. The door opens, and Lara steps up on the other side. John smiles and picks up the phone, but Lara sees something in his face and doesn't pick up her phone, just stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John fights to keep his smile and nods for her to pick up her phone -- but now she can see the verdict chiseled on his face. Lara gasps and cries inconsolably.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John keeps the smile plastered on his face, but now tears run down his cheeks. He taps on the glass and points at her phone, but she doesn't respond. He taps harder and harder -- desperately wanting to comfort her, but she won't allow it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He bangs on the glass with his fist, drawing the attention of the guard on his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lara turns and exits. John stands and yells her name, but she can't hear it, and neither can we.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY

<DIRECTION>
We're in an old working class neighborhood. John sits in his car, trying to pull himself together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICK opens the door. GRACE, their mother, looks up from clearing the lunch dishes. John's face tells them everything they need to know. Mick slams his fist against the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the back yard with Luke, GEORGE, John's father turns to see Grace tearfully embrace John. George looks away, uncomfortable, and distracts Luke's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE - BACK YARD -- LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John, Mick and Grace sit in the worn wicker chairs on the back porch. Erit steps out with beers to replace their empties. She sits and they stare off, watching Luke and George play with the dog. After a moment Erit looks to John:
</DIRECTION>
<ERIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you won't want to hear this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIT>
<MICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Erit, go put somebody to sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICK>

She stares unbelieving, then walks off in a huff.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<MICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had to be done.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
John has to smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT (DUSK)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John drives through a rough part of town on their way home. He stops at a light and notes the dealers on the corner. A flashy car pulls up, hands are slapped; call the driver DAVID. He takes a roll of cash from the dealer, looks around, catches John staring. John looks away quickly and drives off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

John sits at his desk, surrounded by boxes of documents and photographs. As John sifts through the evidence...

<DIRECTION>
Lara and her boss ELIZABETH argue loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING GARAGE - THE PAST -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's RAINING outside. ELIZABETH stands at her car door in a small, partially covered garage -- maybe a dozen spots. She turns toward camera --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FIRE EXTINGUISHER comes right at camera, making a terrible impact and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELIZABETH collapses to the floor.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT - THE PAST -- NIGHT

DR. Becsey opens the door for John. Note a prison guard standing outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_BECSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_BECSEY>
<DIRECTION>
Becsey leaves. A uniformed female prison guard looks up from her magazine and keeps her eyes on John. He looks to his wife, who's attached to an I.V. and monitors, pale and weak, her arm bandaged where she cut it open along the artery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lara opens her heavy eyelids and John glimpses something terrible in her eyes: she's tortured to be alive. He kneels beside her and puts a hand on the bed. She takes his little finger, wraps her fingers around it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

John opens the door to let Jenna out; she looks considerably older.

INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke lies in the crook of his father's arm, his own arms full of penguins, turtles, a black dog and an opossum. John reads him a letter, the yellow envelope open on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>

Luke points at the glass coin dish on night stand.

	Then can I have them all?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<JOHN>

</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
He hands Luke the jar, and hoists up him and his animals.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke sets the coin jar on his nightstand. John tucks him in with his animals, then switches off the lamp. John looks back before closing it and watches Luke lie awake, staring at the jar, lost in confused thoughts of his mother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dirty dishes piled in the sink, John unloads the dishwasher. He finds the handle has cracked off Luke's favorite mug. He places the cup and handle on the counter, opens a drawer crammed with tools and screws and tape and such. He rummages through it. Not finding what he is looking for, he pulls handfuls of junk out of the drawer and slams it all down on the counter. The harder he searches the more he becomes frustrated, until he slams the drawer and leans on the counter, feeling destroyed and needy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then a female hand appears beside him, opens another drawer and reaches in. John stares at the hand, afraid to move, afraid to look up. The hand finds a tube of glue, places it on the counter and moves away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John turns to see LARA walking away. She turns, smiling and shaking her head, and disappears into the dining room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stunned, John looks down at the glue on the counter, then suddenly pushes away and rushes into the dining room. No sign of her. And she isn't in the living room. He bolts into the foyer and finds the front door slightly ajar. He flings it open...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John rushes out into the street, looking up and down for her -- finally realizing she was never there.

He stands in the middle of the street, now searching for some way to survive.

INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - LIBRARY -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John drops an armload of books into a library cart, each having something to do with prison or prison life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits at a table at the back, flipping through them one at a time and discards each in turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the shadows grow longer we find him staring at the computer screen linked to the school system.

</JOHN>
<DAMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A lot of looking. Especially at things that break the daily routine. Guards get comfortable doing the same thing every day. Something happens where they have to think, adapt. That's when they will make mistakes. But when you see it you have to be ready. You have to have the entire plan already in place before you even know how you are going to get out of the jail. Escaping is easy; the hardest part is staying free.

places it atop the X-ray machine. He steps through the metal detector and then grabs the plastic dish before the guard can get to it. He hands the dish to the guard.

John moves down the hall with the fifty or so other visitors. He eases toward the elevator, keeping his eye on the guard ahead. By the time the group stops for the door ahead to open, John's managed to be right beside the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He folds his coat over his arm to block others from seeing and feels for the slot. Finding it, he slips in the bump key. It fits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guard at the lead opens the door to the first visiting room and the crowd starts moving again. John quickly bumps the key and turns it -- but it won't turn. He bumps it again. Visitors keep moving past him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over his shoulder, sees the guard following them is preoccupied at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns it harder. Nothing. He tries to pull it out. It's stuck. John panics.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rear guard closes the entry door and follows the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John tugs at it one last time, and then turns it hard and snaps it off in the lock. A BLACK WOMAN among the visitors sees what he is doing but averts her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John drops the rest of the broken key and kicks it into the slot between the elevator and the shaft. He slips back into the crowd and moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near the rear of the crowd now, John approaches the door to the visiting room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He throws a look back, sees another guard step up and try to insert his key in the elevator.

INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Face chalk white, John heads for the exit, fighting the urge to run. The door opens just before he gets there and Collero steps in, Quinn holding the door for her. John charges past, noticing neither of them -- but Quinn recognizes him. Quinn turns and watches as John doubles over the short wall nearby and vomits.

<DETECTIVE_COLLERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- The worst date you've ever been on? This was worse. And this guy? He really thinks he is doing great. Then he's driving me home and I know he's going to try and kiss me, so I pretend to fall asleep. I mean, I'm actually snoring, right in his car. Does that stop him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_COLLERO>

John turns and notices Quinn, behind the door, watching him. They lock eyes. Collero realizes that Quinn isn't paying attention and wonders what he's looking at.

INT. T-TRAIN -- DAY

INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John sits on the bare wood floor of the living room. His head turns as he hears someone POUNDING on the front door. He throws a look to the garage, thinks about the gun; dismisses the idea. Then he hears the voice: his brother.

John doesn't move. As we pull back we see that the living room and dining room have been stripped of every bit of furniture, save an old TV set sitting on a box. John knows he can't let his brother see this.

The MALE NEIGHBOR in the house to the south opens his door and looks out and scowls.

INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

The camera swirls as John searches the wall and photos of delivery vans arriving at the jail. Not seeing what he wants, he charges the desk & rifles through more photos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finally snatches the photo he's looking for. He turns it over -- on it is written TUESDAY 9:30 AM. And right over the phrase FIND THE KEY he pins the photo of a delivery van from a medical laboratory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

INT. BANK AND MALL PARKING LOT -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A quiet neighborhood bank sits in the corner of an outdoor mall. The Prius pulls into a spot; we dolly over to see the stolen license plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the Prius, John opens the backpack, puts on the hat and sunglasses and places the gun on his lap. And again he looks at the bank, tapping his toe manically. A guard opens the bank door for a departing customer, smiles and heads back inside. John tightens his grip on the gun, tries to work up his courage, but ultimately realizes he can't do this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Furious with himself, he jams the car into reverse and backs up without looking. He hears a scream, brakes hard and looks.

A WOMAN screams. John stomps on the brakes. He leaps out of the car and sees a woman dropping her groceries and scooping her child up in her arms. Call her ELAINE.

<DIRECTION>
Lara lowers her voice a little, but not her intensity. The guard walks away under:
</DIRECTION>
<LARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you come here all long-faced, like you've let me down. What do you want me to do, make you feel better?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARA>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got it. I'm sorry.

</JOHN>
<LARA>

</LARA>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want from me?

</JOHN>
<LARA>

<JOHN>

She leans forward and whispers in his ear.

<LARA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I grabbed the fire extinguisher. I hit her in the face. I heard her neck snap. You know why I did it? Because she pissed me off. I threw her purse in the river. We paid for dinner with the cash from her wallet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARA>
<DIRECTION>
She sits back a bit to look in his face. Only now, looking in his eyes, a crack forms in her tough exterior.

<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I'm actually very sorry.

She stands. The guard opens the door and lets her into the changing room. John watches, unable to breathe.

<DIRECTION>
INT. COUNTY JAIL - CHANGING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

<DIRECTION>
Lara gets one last look at John, through the glass, and then disappears behind the partition. She sits on the bench, leans her head between her knees, and breaks into shards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John exits along with all the other visitors, destroyed by what he has heard, playing out what she said in his head. Then suddenly he just stops. The crowd keeps moving, leaving him behind. The guard following the group sees him standing there. Commands him:
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, you cannot stand there.

Lara takes a seat on her side of the glass partition. She picks up her phone and opens her mouth to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up. I don't care what you say or how you say it. I don't believe you did it and I never will. I know who you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
She opens her mouth to object but John slams the phone into the cradle. She pounds on the window. He just stares at her. Her eyes well up, and she smiles through her tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER

John steps out and sees the MAJOR waiting with his keys. They exchange a look.

EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John's father watches through the window as his son leaves. In his gut, George knows something is wrong.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John sits in his car down the street, watching the corner where he noticed kids selling drugs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car shows up - the same flashy car he saw weeks ago. The street dealer looks around, runs to the window, makes an exchange, and then the car drives off again. John checks his watch and settles in to wait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John watches as other cars drive up and score drugs. And then finally the flashy car cruises up again. John checks his watch: it has been two hours. Again the street dealer runs up and hands the driver an envelope. We recognize the driver -- he is the one from earlier, whom we are going to call DAVID. He drives away. John follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John follows the flashy car at a distance. It stops at another corner and something is exchanged. It drives on; John follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HILL DISTRICT - NEIGHBORHOOD -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not the best part of town. It looks rough even for The Hill. The flashy car parks and David crosses the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Half a block back, John turns left at the corner and then makes a quick right into the alley. He guesses how many houses from the corner David stopped, gets out and checks over the fences.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops a few houses away when he sees the porch light on a house flick on. David waits on the dilapidated back porch. He waves to whoever is watching him through the pinhole and the light goes out again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John inches closer as the back door opens. David exchanges a few words with whoever opened it and then packages are exchanged. The door closes and David walks off the way he came.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John waits a moment, then moves down the alley, hops the fence, and sneaks through the twisted bramble of the back yard. He finds a place to hide, on the ground right beside the back porch. He pulls out his gun and settles in to wait between the trash cans, his heart pounding in his ears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fade to BLACK. Beat, then: BANG! BANG! BANG!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DRUG DEALER'S BACK YARD -- LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John WAKES to HAMMERING on the door. The porch light flicks on and John is bathed in bright light -- he didn't realize he'd fallen asleep. David stands above him on the porch, holding the screen door open -- if he glanced down there is no way he wouldn't see him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John holds his breath and waits. The porch light flicks off, the locks are unbolted, and finally the thick door opens. As before, the two exchange words, but now the POUNDING in John's ears is so loud we can barely hear anything else.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John takes a deep breath and springs to his feet -- knocking over the trash cans -- and onto the porch!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He smacks David with the gun, grabs him by the hair and jams him forward into the doorway, preventing the supplier -- ALEX -- from slamming the door on them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALEX'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex releases his BARKING German shepherd and it immediately attacks David, biting his leg. David screams in agony.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Alex)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back up! Get back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a THUG comes barreling in from the kitchen and aims a sawed-off shotgun at John, who keeps himself right behind David's head. The dialogue is almost drowned out completely by the sound of POUNDING in John's ears and David's SCREAMING.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Shoot them both!

</ALEX>
<JOHN>

</ALEX>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>

John fires two more shots into the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Put the gun down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
The thug obeys, rests it against the wall.

<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Call the dog off!! Put it away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>

The dog stops its attack but goes back to barking.

Alex reluctantly opens a closet door.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In! Get in!

</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
He has to shove the barking dog into the closet.

John fires into the wall!
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
And the thug goes in the closet after the barking dog. John sees the bolt and drives it home, locking the door.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Give me that chair!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Alex doesn't obey, so David grabs it and hands it to him. John props it under the handle of the closet door.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Move!

He pushes them both back into the next room; the dog in the closet never stops barking.

INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

John shoves David to the floor and waves the gun between them.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On your knees! Hands behind your head!
	</DIALOGUE>

John catches Alex's eyes darting to the counter. Following his gaze he finds Alex's revolver on the counter. John grabs it, flips open the cylinder and spills out the cartridges.
</DIRECTION>

David kneels with great difficulty. Alex calmly does as he's told, his eyes on John.

</DAVID>
<ALEX>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
John looks around desperately. He spots an open bottle of tequila in the clutter on the counter. He grabs it and pours it on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're wasting some good shit.

Now he pours it on Alex.

John lights a rag as the thug in the closet continues to yell and pound. Now calmly:
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. That's what I'm going to do.

</JOHN>

</JOHN>
<ALEX>

<DIRECTION>
Without warning, Alex dashes for the front hall. Stunned, John doesn't shoot. He grabs David by the hair, sticks the gun in his temple and shoves him into the front hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me go!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<JOHN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	The house is going to explode!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON BACK DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fire spreads, the thug yells, the dog barks. The shotgun leans against the wall where the thug left it. The closet door rocks as the thug kicks. The chair won't give way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John moves David quickly up the stairs in front of him and down the hall. They peer into one room, nothing. Into the next - what is clearly a CHILD'S ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex kneels on the far side of the room, barely visible behind the small bed, his back to us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until he wheels, gun in hand, and FIRES twice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bullet strikes David in the chest, the second grazes John's side. Both men are knocked back into the hall and onto the floor. John pulls himself out from under David as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Running on adrenaline, Alex stands and strides forward. David looks up at him. Alex shoots him again and steps over him into the hall. He sees John, raises his weapon and....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John fires twice, hits Alex in the chest, knocking him down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John stands. Alex lies dead, sprawled over David. David looks around through the roiling smoke:
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is anyone up here?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
He steps over Alex and into the room. He checks the closet -- empty of clothes; clearly no child lives here. John turns to where Alex was kneeling, sees a bureau pushed aside, a safe crudely installed in the wall lying open, a trash bag on the floor half-filled with cash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John drops to his knees and shovels the remaining cash into the trash bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - BACK HALL -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dog barks; the door SPLINTERS.

INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR -- CONTINUOUS

John steps over the bodies; sees David looking up at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't leave me. I don't want to burn. Don't let me burn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The hall is now thick with smoke. John stares terrified at the two men, one dead, one dying, and agonizes over what he knows is a mistake. Cut to BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - BACK HALL -- MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John carries David past the closet just as the thug's boot kicks a hole in the door. Cut to BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND ALEX'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John, bleeding himself, shoves the badly wounded dealer into the back seat. He throws the trash bag into the passenger seat and slams the door closed behind him. Not even a heartbeat later THE GERMAN SHEPHERD leaps up and snaps at the partially open window. John struggles to get the car turned on and the window up as THE DOG tries to force his way into the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the front windshield he sees THE THUG leap over the back fence, landing sprawled in the alley with the shotgun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John jams the car into reverse and backs away -- the man in the back seat screaming for his life, the dog chasing the car, the thug getting off a shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John swerves wide around the corner, hitting a fire hydrant and shattering a taillight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRIUS - DRIVING -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John slams the transmission into Drive and speeds off down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dog barking disappears. All that's left are the sounds of the dying man. John keeps throwing looks over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to die. I don't want to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Now at a safe distance, John pulls over and looks into the back seat. We don't have to see the body to know he's dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John sits there a moment, listening to the sounds of approaching fire engines. He catches a glimpse of himself in the rearview mirror before pulling out. Cut to BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUS STOP -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John's car idles at the curb, his back door sits open. He steps back into shot from the far side of the Prius, closes the door and gets in. As he drives away we see David's body lying on the bench, waiting to be discovered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FAST FOOD JOINT - TOILET -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing at the sink shirtless, John pours alcohol on the wound in his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He mops up the blood with a wad of paper towels, then applies a bandage, fresh from the box. He pulls a new shirt and jacket from a Target bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later, now dressed, John stuffs the trash bag full of cash into his backpack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FAST FOOD JOINT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

John steps out of the bathroom, zipping his new jacket. He barely draws a look from the few customers as he limps out of the restaurant. Cut to BLACK.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALEX'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Water streams from the house, the front door and windows broken by firemen who now pack up their gear to leave. LIEUTENANT NABULSI strides into shot, drinking a Red Bull, which he crushes and discards on the porch.

John eases open his parents' front door and removes his key from the lock. It's the middle of the night, so he is surprised to see a light on in the kitchen. He enters, carrying his jacket and backpack, and places them on a chair. When he gets to the kitchen he sees his father in his pajamas, reading a biography and sipping a cup of tea.

Lara and John step out into the hall. John's eyes flick to the Nurse's Desk but he keeps walking. As they pass we notice DR. LIFSON standing there with Lara's file in her hand. The Duty Nurse notices as well. It takes a second for Lifson to understand what is going on. She steps out into the hall and stares after them.

The elevator isn't closing. John slams the button repeatedly. He hears Nabulsi's heavy feet on the stairs, angles and aims the weapon -- Lara can't believe what she's witnessing. Suddenly the doors close, just a heartbeat before Nabulsi gets there. Nabulsi spots the discarded lab coats and runs out into THE GARAGE. He heads for the ramp, scanning the parked cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Getting to the bottom of the ramp he looks up and sees a SQUAD CAR racing down toward him. As it brakes, Nabulsi realizes they couldn't have escaped this way; he's been had.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They weave down a corridor, deeper into the hospital, passing another cop at the Emergency Desk who has his back to them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They turn the corner, see a hospital guard running toward them. John recognizes him as the guard he argued with when Lara attempted suicide. John stiffens, but the guard runs past -- looking for a couple in lab coats. They quicken their steps. The guard stops at the end of the hall and turns to stare, recognizing them. He lifts his walkie and speaks.

Nabulsi runs out of the loading dock and into the middle of Grant Street, HARRIS and the two OFFICERS trailing. Very few pedestrians right here. Nabulsi looks to his right: a crowded crosswalk, fans heading through a pedestrian mall to a Penguins game. He looks to his left: more fans moving toward the stadium. Almost all of them are wearing team colors - a sea of black and gold. Nabulsi curses.

John keeps driving, hoping somehow that he won't have to make this choice -- their freedom, or their son.

Lara and John watch a cow in the farmer's field.

There is nothing for either of them to say, they both know how they got here.

He switches on the radio and searches for NEWS.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_COLLERO>
<DIRECTION>
Quinn drops his gum wrapper onto the sidewalk. It hits a stream of water coming out from a rain gutter and washes away. Quinn watches it -- then follows... Collero shakes her head, grabs a newspaper to keep the rain off and follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gum wrapper washes over the curb into the gutter and travels to the storm drain a half a block away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quinn gets there, kneels.

Quinn jerks the grate up. Collero grabs the other side and helps him lift.

INT. COLONIAL HOTEL -- EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room has two single beds. John waits at the bathroom door. Lara steps out, a real awkwardness between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She touches his hand. He offers a smile. She slips past him. He steps into the bathroom and closes the door. Lara lies down on the single bed furthest from the bathroom, face to face with her sleeping son.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without warning, he kisses her on the cheek, for the first time, without being prodded. He turns around and lets her wrap her arms around him. And she almost dies of happiness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John washes, trying not to look in the mirror, not wanting to glimpse the man he has become.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lara and Luke sleep, spooning. John sits on the other bed. He picks up the TV remote and flips through Spanish language stations. And there it is: CNN in English. Sports right now, but John knows there is no place they can hide.
