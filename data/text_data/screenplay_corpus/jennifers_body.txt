INT. LEECH LAKE WOMEN'S CORRECTIONAL HOSPITAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANITA "NEEDY" LESNICKI, 17, sits on her hospital bed in pajamas. She's a plain-faced girl with a haunted expression. As she stares out the window, she winds colored yarn around a pair of Popsicle sticks to create a "god's eye."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out a single window, we see an imposing nine-foot SECURITY FENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next to Needy, we see a pile of unopened mail scattered casually on the floor. There are letters, packages, even creepy little gifts and totems sent by admiring "fans."
</DIRECTION>
<NEEDY_V_O>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every day, I get letters. I think I get more letters than Santa Claus, Zac Efron and Dr. Phil combined. I'm kind of the shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEEDY_V_O>
<DIRECTION>
RAYMUNDO, a counselor raps on the door and sticks his head in cautiously.

<NEEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grassy-ass, Raymundo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Needy stands up and begins changing into an institutional gym uniform. As she slips off her pajamas, we can see a series of puffy, slash-like SCARS on her body.
</DIRECTION>
<NEEDY_V_O>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes the letters are from people who say they're praying for me. They tell me everything will be okay if I just accept Jesus Christ into my heart. I say the words, but nothing ever happens. Nobody comes back. Nobody gets off the cross.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEEDY_V_O>
<DIRECTION>
She glances sadly at a PHOTO OF A BOY on her dresser. She touches the frame wistfully, her eyes full of remorse.
</DIRECTION>
<NEEDY_V_O>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Occasionally I get presents from starfuckers who saw my picture in the paper and want to marry me or something. They think they can take me away from all this. Like I'd really date some perverted Chester with a hard-on for jailbait. I might be insane, but I'm not desperate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEEDY_V_O>
<DIRECTION>
We see a morbid "hall of fame" of creepy photos sent in from guys. They line the mirror, grinning at us. There's even a DICK SHOT tucked in there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Needy pulls on her threadbare uniform T-shirt. It hangs down to her knees, covering her shorts.
</DIRECTION>
<NEEDY_V_O>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A lot of people ask me if I'm sorry I did it.

Needy picks up a paper cup of COLORFUL PILLS on her dresser, dumps the meds into her mouth, and dry-swallows them.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry I didn't do it sooner.

She saunters out of the room in her GYM UNIFORM and BUNNY SLIPPERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LEECH LAKE HOSPITAL GYMNASIUM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several badminton courts are set up in the gym. As an intense OPERATIC ARIA plays over the public address system, the FEMALE PATIENTS enthusiastically--almost violently--whack at the flying shuttlecocks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The patients appear to be varying levels of crazy. A TOOTHLESS WOMAN grins as she dives with her racket, clipping her partner in the leg. In the corner, one forlorn patient nurses her injured arm while another hurls her racket against the wall again and again. Counselors look on approvingly, despite how miserable their charges appear. In the background, a few sulking patients jump rope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Needy enters the gym unnoticed, padding along in her bunny slippers.
</DIRECTION>
<NEEDY_V_O>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to the Mental Olympics. They're big on recreation here. Supposedly it helps us vent our aggressions. We've traded in our hatchets for rackets, our Drain-O bombs for double dutch. Even the cutters get in on the action when they're fully conscious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEEDY_V_O>
<DIRECTION>
We see a GIRL swinging a jump rope who has a ladder of fresh bandages on her arms and legs.

Nelly shuffles over to a tetherball and takes a furious WHACK at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LEECH LAKE CAFETERIA - ONE HOUR LATER The freshly showered PATIENTS assemble for breakfast. They grab trays and settle into noisy cliques. Needy selects a single toaster pastry from the breakfast line and sits down, alone.
</DIRECTION>
<NEEDY_V_O>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Personally, I think they're trying to wear us out. Keep us sluggish so there won't be an uprising. Well, those J.V. tactics won't work against me. I'm a kicker. K-I- C-K-E-R. It even says so on my chart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEEDY_V_O>
<DIRECTION>
We briefly cut to Needy's chart, on some doctor's clipboard. We see her name: ANITA "NEEDY" LESNICKI and a few brief details about FIRST DEGREE MURDER and GRANDIOSE NOTIONS. Beneath that, we see a triple-highlighted warning in bright ink: KICKER. A NUTRITIONIST with a clipboard approaches Needy casually and eyes her breakfast plate.
</DIRECTION>
<NUTRITIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just one Toastem, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NUTRITIONIST>
<NEEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(QUIETLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like Toastems.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEEDY>
<NUTRITIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good. But I'm not sure a Toastem can provide you with sufficient energy for your day. I'd recommend more complex carbohydrates...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NUTRITIONIST>
<DIRECTION>
Needy scrambles to her feet and delivers a sudden, powerful ROUNDHOUSE KICK to the nutritionist's face.
</DIRECTION>
<NEEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'D RECOMMEND THAT YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEEDY>
<DIRECTION>
The nutritionist is KNOCKED OFF HER FEET-- as if she's been kicked by a far mightier creature than Needy-- and collapses, clutching her bleeding nose. We see that the bone has SNAPPED. The patients shriek. Chaos. As Needy is restrained by staff members, she thrashes like a trapped fish. Needy snorts up a killer LOOGIE and hocks it at the prone nutritionist. The glob nails her in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It takes four STAFF MEMBERS to haul Needy away as she hollers in protest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nutritionist curls up on the floor, cupping her bleeding nose as a ring of curious patients surrounds her. She spits out a TOOTH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. "THE HOLE" - SAME Needy is tossed into seclusion. Her hair is wild and her face is wet with tears. The heavy door slams behind her, leaving only a shaft of light.
</DIRECTION>
<NEEDY_V_O>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't always this cracked. I used to be normal-- well, as normal as any girl under the influence of teenage hormones. But after the killings began, I started to feel, I don't know... loose around the edges or something. I was coming undone like those jeans I made in Home Ec. Falling to pieces like Patsy Cline. Shredded like moo-shu pork. Dead inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Needy cringes as she briefly hallucinates abstract SHAPES in the darkness. Grinning skulls. Faces drained of life, half eaten. Grimaces of terror. Suddenly, soft music is piped into "the hole," ostensibly to calm the patients in solitary. Needy shudders and recoils at the sound of it. It's a CHEESY ROCK BALLAD that we'll soon hear again...
</DIRECTION>
<CHEESY_SONG_LYRICS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Through the trees, I will find you. Heal the ruins left inside you. And the stars will remind you, we'll meet again..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEESY_SONG_LYRICS>
<NEEDY_V_O>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, I hate this fucking song.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEEDY_V_O>
<DIRECTION>
Needy plugs her ears as if it physically hurts her to listen to the song. She curls up in the corner and steels herself for solitary confinement. DISSOLVE TO: TITLE: TWO MONTHS EARLIER

<DIRECTION>
EXT. DEVIL'S KETTLE, MN - NIGHT (TO ESTABLISH) Devil's Kettle is a quiet farming community, surrounded by dense woods and mirrored lakes. It's the kind of town that has one high school, one pizza joint, and one stoplight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On an overgrown rural route we see a rustic sign that reads "WELCOME TO DEVIL'S KETTLE- Pop. 7,036. Come See What's Cookin'!"
</DIRECTION>
<NEEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is where it all went down. "Devil's Kettle" sounds twisted, I know, but the place just is named after a dumb waterfall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEEDY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE FALLS - NIGHT (TO ESTABLISH) We see the titular falls, surprisingly powerful, gushing over a rock face.
</DIRECTION>
<NEEDY_V_O>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well technically, it's two waterfalls. One of them is normal-- it empties into a river basin. But the other one goes into a hole. And it doesn't come out. The scientist guys can't explain it. They've dropped all kinds of things down there--bouncy balls, red dye, radioactive slime-- but nothing ever surfaces. Maybe it's another dimension. Or, you know, just really deep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEEDY_V_O>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JENNIFER'S HOUSE (TO ESTABLISH) - MIDNIGHT The sprawling ranch house is dark from the outside except for a single FIRST FLOOR WINDOW-- Jennifer's-- still illuminated. There's a chicken coop and a wire livestock pen in the backyard. We're definitely in deep north country.
</DIRECTION>
<NEEDY_V_O>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've probably spent years of my life in this house. Hundreds of sleepovers, thousands of aimless homework sessions, a million phone calls. I've climbed through Jennifer's window so many times. But tonight, only one of us is going to come out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEEDY_V_O>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM - SAME JENNIFER CHECK lies on her bed, fidgeting as she watches TV. She's a girl of 16 with LONG, MATTED HAIR and a thin, frail body. Her features are gorgeous, but she looks sick and haggard. She picks at her skin with yellowed, Nosferatu-like fingernails and chews idly on a limp lock of hair. Jennifer wears a tight T-shirt that says KETTLE HIGH FLAGS and underwear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An `80s HORROR MOVIE flickers on the TV. Jennifer half- watches, distracted.
</DIRECTION>
<NEEDY_V_O>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jennifer didn't always look this rough. Actually, she was the prettiest girl in Devil's Kettle when she wasn't so...hungry.

Some recent photos on a corkboard reveal that Jennifer was indeed BEAUTIFUL AND CURVY.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She hadn't fed in weeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEEDY_V_O>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer rolls over and glances at the window briefly. We see the OUTSIDE of the house again. It's dark and silent, but for the nearly inaudible snapping of twigs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer turns her attention back to the TV. Suddenly, we see NEEDY'S FACE pop up against the window, white and startling. Before Jennifer notices, the face disappears. Outside the house, the bushes rustle. Needy is crouched below the window. We hear the pulsing of her HEART as if via ultrasound. It's a wet, rhythmic sound: Sploish, sploish, sploish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, Jennifer stretches and shuts off the TV. She turns out the light. A beat of silence. Then, the sound of cracking near the window.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Needy PLUNGES through the window, screaming and brandishing a HAMMER. She takes a SWING at Jennifer's head, but misses and BURIES IT IN THE WALL, specifically in Jennifer's Fall Out Boy poster. Needy throws herself on top of Jennifer. She STRADDLES Jennifer and grips her throat, throttling her.
</DIRECTION>
<NEEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll throw me a bone, huh? Huh? You killed Chip! You goddamned monster! You...ZOMBITCH!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer struggles to fight off Needy in the darkness. Her clawlike fingernails rake Needy's back and arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Needy pulls a BOX CUTTER out of her waistband and flicks it open like a switchblade. Kshink!
</DIRECTION>

	Know what this is for? Cutting boxes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a swipe at Jennifer's CROTCH. Jennifer instinctively CLUTCHES herself and rears up in defense. We see Jennifer's mouth come down on Needy's neck. Needy shrieks as if BITTEN, but continues to strangle Jennifer, straddling her and bearing down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer's T-shirt slides up to her armpits, exposing her breasts. For a moment, her eyes meet Needy's and she grins. It's as if she has control over Needy for a split second, sexual control... Needy recoils and SLASHES Jennifer's body left and right with the box-cutter, marking a gory, oozing "X" on her torso.
</DIRECTION>
<NEEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (HYSTERICAL)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CROSS OUT JENNIFER!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer gasps, staring at her wounds in shock and disbelief. She looks back up at Needy. A beat of silence. Suddenly, THE GIRLS' BODIES LEVITATE RAPIDLY TOWARD THE CEILING. They wrestle in a bloody, screaming airborne heap, their figures entwined. Their bodies FALL, collapsing back onto the bed with a thud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Needy raises the box-cutter and plunges it into Jennifer's HEART. Blood GEYSERS from the wound.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>

(CHOKING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My tit!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the room is flooded with BRIGHT LIGHT, revealing a Needy straddling Jennifer's MUTLIATED BODY. Jennifer's breathing is a raspy death rattle. MRS. CHECK, a middle-aged woman in bad sleepwear and a worse perm rushes into the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CHECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jennifer! What is it, baby? Oh my God! Oh my God!
	</DIALOGUE>

She pulls Needy off her daughter. Jennifer rolls over, gasping and bleeding.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she dead, Mrs. Check? Did I get her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Check cradles her maimed daughter on the floor like a white-trash Pieta. Jennifer takes one last breath, vomits blood, and DIES. Mrs. Check SCREAMS. Needy SMILES.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. JENNIFER CHECK'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER Three police cars squeal up to the curb with sirens and lights engaged. OFFICER ROMAN DUDA, 22, a muscular young COP, jogs authoritatively toward the house. He shakes his head, dumbfounded.

<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE SQUAD CAR - DAWN Needy, innocent-looking in PIGTAILS, is hustled into the back of the squad car. Her clothes and face are smeared with blood. Officer Duda starts the ignition. His partner, a hard- faced FEMALE COP, slides into the front seat. Her cap is pushed back to accommodate a huge round pouf of shellacked MALL BANGS.

	Confessions are for pussies. You've got a declaration, Grace.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She giggles maniacally. Roman turns on the radio, violating protocol. It's a soaring rock anthem-- the SAME SONG we heard being piped into solitary confinement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both cops BRIGHTEN when they hear the song. Roman cranks the volume.
</DIRECTION>
<ROMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, I love this song.

Needy stares out the window at the sun creeping up over the forest on the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<NEEDY_V_O>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I killed her. Whatever. It won't undo anything. Three pulses-- three lives-- all stopped cold by adolescent bloodlust. It's hard to believe that just two months ago, me, Jennifer and my boyfriend Chip were completely normal people. We were our yearbook pictures. Nothing more, nothing less.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEEDY_V_O>
<DIRECTION>
We see a brief montage of black-and-white yearbook stills: JENNIFER executing the splits on a football field, her smile bright. NEEDY inspecting a school newspaper layout, pen in hand, glasses on her nose. And finally, CHIP DOVE, playing a strap-on snare drum at a school pep rally, his head bent in concentration....

INT. KETTLE HIGH - DAY CHIP drums on the sidelines of the Devil's Kettle High basketball court. The stands are packed with BORED STUDENTS for a pep rally. Chip is 16, clean cut, and an awful drummer.
</DIRECTION>
<NEEDY_V_O>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chip couldn't drum for shit. He only knew "Land of a Thousand Dances" and the solo from "Wipeout." Lucky for him, the pep band gig wasn't too demanding.

Sure enough, the band is playing "Land of a Thousand Dances." Nearby, the FLAG TEAM claps with gloved hands, picking up their flags for a choreographed stunt.

	If you can believe it, that's Jennifer. Yeah, the same girl I iced with the box-cutter. Only back then, we were tight. Sisters, practically.

Jennifer finishes her maneuver and WAVES to the stands. Needy waves back at her excitedly from the bleachers, small and owlish with glasses and lank hair.

INT. NEEDY'S HOUSE - 8:45 A.M. Needy is standing in a small, dingy bathroom, trying on different configurations of clothing.
</DIRECTION>
<NEEDY_V_O>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Wear something cool" meant something very specific in Jennifer-speak. It meant I couldn't look like a nerd, but I couldn't upstage her either. I could expose my stomach, but never cleavage. Tits were her trademark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEEDY_V_O>
<DIRECTION>
Needy wiggles her jeans a bit lower, exposing her childishly round tummy. She walks out of the bathroom into her bedroom, a frilly pink hell complete with canopy bed. CHIP DOVE is sitting on the bed, looking lost in all that pink. He raises an eyebrow at Needy's abdomen.

	Thanks a lot!

</DIRECTION>
<NEEDY_V_O>

A group of skinny INDIE ROCK BOYS are setting up their equipment on a pathetically tiny stage-- it's more like a dais. The LEAD SINGER has intense, spooky eyes, nearly obscured by a shock of hair. The locals, mostly good ol' boys, eye the band suspiciously.

<NEEDY>

	They look so-- so cool.

She gazes at the stage, hearing only the whistling rush of ARCTIC AIR. In SLOW MOTION, the GUITARIST unsheathes his Fender Jaguar from its gig bag. He notices her staring and runs the tip of his tongue over his lips. Needy swallows hard.

	Hey, I think they need two groupies. Come on! It'll be like Almost Famous! I'll be Penny Lane and you can be the other girl.

</NEEDY>
<NIKOLAI>

Jennifer hurries off toward the bar.

Needy moves self-consciously into a nearby corner, not wanting to continue the conversation with Nikolai alone. A LOCAL plugs a Loretta Lynn tune into the jukebox, with a challenging stare at the band. A DRUNK COUPLE begins two-stepping in front of the stage. Nikolai walks up to the guitar player, DIRK, and pulls him aside. Needy pricks up her ears and listens.

<DIRECTION>
Nikolai is already ignoring him. Needy, alarmed, emerges from her hiding place and discreetly rushes over to the bar where Jennifer is arguing with a jealous-looking Roman. He shakes his head in disgust and leaves the bar. Jennifer walks over holding an ostentatious PATRIOTIC THEMED DRINK. She laughs when she sees Needy's concerned expression.

<DIRECTION>
He WINKS at Jennifer. The band launch into the same intense, soaring song we heard in the COP CAR and the HOLE. Jennifer's eyes never leave Nikolai's. She's hypnotized, clinging to Needy's arm. Even the locals look charmed. Suddenly, a lick of FLAME appears on the wood paneling next to the stage. Needy is the first to notice. As she watches in horror, the fire is reflected in her glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flames quickly climbs up to the ceiling and begin to blaze uncontrollably. People SCREAM and scatter. Someone ineffectually tries to throw a pitcher of beer on the fire. Nikolai turns and sees the fire spreading. He and Chas exchange glances. The BASS PLAYER pitches his guitar aside and jumps off the stage, and the drummer abandons his kit. Nikolai seems perfectly cool and composed as he watches from the stage...is he smiling? CHAOS. Everyone is trying to get out of the bar at once, causing a stampede. A woman's clothes and hair CATCH FIRE and she falls to her knees. We see a BEAM fall from the roof, nearly killing AHMET FROM INDIA. Jennifer stands still in a dreamlike state.

Needy blinks in disbelief at the coincidence.

She defiantly follows Nikolai toward the WHITE VAN, which is parked a suspiciously safe distance from the bar. Needy staggers after them slowly, watching. Behind Needy, the bar EXPLODES. Screams. Flames. Silence. Needy doesn't even look back as she watches Jennifer get into the van. Ash drifts into her hair like snowflakes.

Nikolai takes off his shirt as he enters the van, revealing his slick, muscled white torso.

BACK ON NEEDY: Needy's face is fixed in the same haunted expression. Nikolai turns to look at her, his teeth bared in a vicious smile. Needy turns and sprints off in the opposite direction, away from the van and the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEEDY'S BEDROOM - 11:00 P.M. Needy stumbles into her bedroom, overwhelmed. Her clothes are smoke damaged and her cheeks are sooty. She grabs her cheap, taped-up cell phone and dials CHIP's number shakily.

Needy hangs up the phone and rushes downstairs. As she passes through the shadowy kitchen, appliances HUM all around her. The silence is menacing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEEDY'S HOUSE (FRONT ENTRY) - CONTINUOUS Needy opens the door. Nobody there. She slams the door, turns around and SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer is standing in the dark hallway, looking ghostly pale and smiling. Her clothes are tattered and stained-- her entire front is soaked in blood. Her makeup is smeared, and her eyes are bruised and sunken like a zombie's. She looks HORRIFYING, especially with that ghastly, clownish grin.
</DIRECTION>
<NEEDY>

<DIRECTION>
Jennifer lets out a horrifying banshee SCREAM, wailing at the top of her lungs. She vomits a torrent of evil- looking black bile all over herself and Needy and staggers wildly down the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bloody black bile hits the wall, splashing a framed school portrait of Needy. Needy screams and watches in horror as it slides down the wall. The bile has hundred of tiny SPINES sticking out of it, like little porcupine needles, and it appears to move by itself, oozing across the linoleum, creeping into the corners. It's truly revolting. Needy grabs Jennifer blindly and claps a hand over her mouth. Jennifer falls to her knees, her screams turning to jagged, insane laughter. Needy tries to run, but Jennifer grabs her and THROWS her against the wall with superhuman force, pinning her. Jennifer slowly, tantalizingly brushes her face against Needy's hair, her earlobe. Needy doesn't move a muscle. Jennifer's hand slides up Needy's ribcage. She presses her lips against Needy's carotid artery. We hear Needy's blood pumping, swishing.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you scared?

Needy nods. Jennifer parts her lips. Then suddenly, she stops and PULLS AWAY, pushing Needy to the floor. Jennifer bolts out the front door and takes off running down the street. Needy is motionless for a moment, then stumbles toward the doorway.

INT. KETTLE HIGH - THE NEXT MORNING Moments before the first morning bell. Needy is sitting at her desk in English class, still visibly bruised from her scuffle with Jennifer the night before. She looks like she hasn't slept a wink. The mood is quiet and somber-- kids whisper about the fire and gather in groups.

INT. NEEDY'S HOUSE (FRONT ENTRY) - DAWN (FLASHBACK) We see Needy on her hands and knees in the eerie blue light of dawn, sobbing as she diligently scrubs blood and bile off the floor with a dirty sponge. The black, spiny vomit repulses her, and she gags.

A single, stifled sob rises from the class. Needy glances around the room and sees students fighting back tears. A huge JOCK weeps openly, tears spattering his swimsuit- model decorated notebook. Jennifer smirks, barely able to contain her laughter.

It's a gray, overcast fall day and the wind whistles eerily through the trees. The football is set back a good a distance from the school, and Jonas is all alone. In the distance, a tiny figure slowly approaches, It starts a dot on the horizon. As it draws closer, we see it's JENNIFER. Her bright, lipsticked grin is eerie and unmistakable. Jonas glances briefly over his right shoulder, indifferent. A few seconds later, he glances again. Strangely, Jennifer ISN'T THERE. Jennifer suddenly appears on Jonas's left side, startling him.

She smiles and shakes her head. Jonas jerks back, creeped out. He tries to pull away from Jennifer, but she's too strong. She PINS him to the tree. We see her jaw begin to UNHINGE, like some horrible snake. Her eyes cloud over with blood...

A horrible SCREAM of agony rises from the woods. Mr. Wroblewski is exiting the school, briefcase in hand. He stops in his tracks when he hears the scream. He shakes his head sadly.

INT. NEEDY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Needy is preparing herself a fried bologna sandwich in the kitchen. Needy's ALBINO FERRET chases a ball across the cracked floor. Needy scrapes the sandwich out of the skillet and takes a bite.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She tuns on the kitchen radio and is surprised to hear a very familiar song: "Through the Trees," by Soft Shoulder. Suddenly, she pauses, a look of UNEASE and even FEAR crossing her face. She stops and braces herself against the counter, her KNEES SHAKING. Something isn't right. She drops the sandwich. Greedo goes straight for it.

<DIRECTION>
She closes her eyes. A brief, near-subliminal FLASH of the carnage in the woods...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The song ends, snapping Needy out of her reverie.
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO_DJ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was Soft Shoulder, the local band who became the unlikely heroes of the tragedy in Devil's Kettle last night. Eyewitnesses say the boys helped numerous people escape the inferno, risking their own lives in the process. That's rock n' roll with a conscience, ladies and gentlemen. Had a lot of requests for that one...

Mr. Wroblewski ventures into the woods, heading toward the clearing. At first, we can only hear mysterious sounds-- scratching and smacking. Birds and animals are closely gathered in a circle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Mr. Wroblewski clutches his arm and gags, realizing the animals are feeding on a huge CARCASS. A BADGER looks up, its snout soaked in blood. Mr. Wroblewski begins to scream. The animals scatter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glimpse of the CORPSE: It's Jonas, of course. His entire torso has been torn open, exposing his ribs and guts. Blood and viscera everywhere, INTESTINES strewn about the forest floor like party streamers.

EXT. KETTLE HIGH CAMPUS - EARLY EVENING A hysterical SCREAM pierces the twilight. The sun has begun to set. An ambulance and four police cars have pulled up near the woods, which are cordoned off with yellow police tape. Near the woods, JONAS'S PARENTS are crying. His MOTHER screams and begins beating the ground with her fists. A stretcher is being loaded into the ambulance. OFFICER WARZAK exits one of the police cruisers. Her signature giant poofy bangs are in full effect. She rushes to comfort Jonas's bereaved mother.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER_WARZAK>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ACROSS THE LAKE - CONTINUOUS The sound of Jonas's parents screaming carries across the lake. The water is eerily calm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a HEAD breaks the surface of the lake. It's Jennifer, gliding through the water. She looks calm and serene. The SCREAMING continues across the lake. The sirens, shouting and chaos contrast sharply with this peaceful scene. Jennifer paddles to the shore and hoists herself onto the pier, naked and dripping wet. She runs her tongue over her teeth briefly and nonchalantly picks something out from between her two front teeth, like she's just finished a delicious rib dinner. Jennifer wrings out her sopping hair and reaches for her clothes, which are neatly folded on the pier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once she's dressed, she walks off into the woods, as if nothing out of the ordinary has happened.

Jennifer's hair is still wet from the lake, but she's changed into shorts and a tank top. Music blasts from her stereo. She admires herself in the mirror, popping her ass.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel sooo scrumptious!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up a Soft Shoulder button and POKES her arm hard with the pin without flinching. Blood spurts from the wound.

<NEEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good for you.

Jennifer gazes at her arm, transfixed. She wipes the blood away-- the wound has magically DISAPPEARED.
</DIRECTION>
<NEEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucky you. See, I'm still kind of depressed about, you know, the giant smoldering funeral pyre in the middle of town?
	</DIALOGUE>

<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Move-on dot org, Needy! It's over. Life's too short to mope over some white-trash pig roast.

She flicks a Zippo lighter and touches the FLAME to her tongue-- first tentatively, then confidently.

<NEEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's really nice.

	Pooh. I'm crossing you out.

<DIRECTION>
She draws a mini-X in the air. Needy clicks over. It's CHIP. We get a nice trifold pie- chart illustrating the intersecting calls. CHIP is panicked and sweaty in his living room. In the background, Chip's little sister CAMILLE bangs on a piano. Red police lights flash outside the picture window.

EXT. MC CULLUM PARK - FOURTEEN MINUTES LATER The park is dark and tree-lined and appears to be a popular clandestine meeting spot for the youth of Devil's Kettle. The abandoned sand volleyball pits are full of couples making out. Needy runs past them skittishly. As she ascends a grassy hill, CHIP is revealed, silhouetted against a backdrop of twirling police lights. Needy squints at the lights, sees CHIP's house in the distance.

<NEEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are the cops at your house?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone ripped Jonas limb from limb in the woods behind the school. Ate parts of him. They found teethmarks on him-- on the body.

His voice cracks. We see a brief, terrifying FLASH of Jonas's mutilated body and pain-stricken face. Needy doesn't want to believe it.

A SERIES OF NEWSPAPER HEADLINES The familiar Soft Shoulder ballad plays as we see a dreamy montage of headlines. The headline of the Devil's Kettle Sun-Post simply reads: "WHY?" The headline of the Minneapolis Star Tribune reads: "'BUTCHERED': Devil's Kettle youth brutally murdered in wake of devastating fire."

EXT. CAMERFORD STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colin Gray drives down the street in a big old boat of a classic car. He's blasting punk music on an iPod that's been rigged to the ancient AM radio. Colin holds up his CELL PHONE to re-read the directions Jennifer texted him. The street is extremely dark and silent, occupied only by a new townhouse development. The identical units still appear to be under construction. There aren't even any streetlights. The plastic sheeting over the windows flaps eerily in the breeze. Colin's brow furrows in confusion-- it doesn't even look like anyone lives here yet. He checks the phone display again. CLOSE ON PHONE: The TEXT MESSAGE reads: "trn lft on camerford and your there. first house on rt. 1004 camerford. C-ya! xoxo jen"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sure enough, the house number is 1004. Colin throws the car into park and walks up to the porch. He looks up and notices a glow coming from an upstairs window,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colin presses the doorbell. Nothing happens-- the house isn't wired for electricity yet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIP'S BEDROOM - SAME Needy and CHIP are kissing on Chip's water bed. Chip fumbles for one of those "fragrance plug-ins" and PLUGS it into the wall. Needy looks over.

INT. 1004 CAMERFORD - SAME Colin enters the house tentatively. It's dark, vacant, and very creepy. There's a very faint glow and soft music coming from upstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<COLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yo?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He stumbles over a stray 2 x 4. There are piles of sawdust and building materials everywhere-- the house is definitely still under construction. Colin looks confused. A MOUSE skitters over his sneakers.
</DIRECTION>
<COLIN>

Colin squares his shoulders and heads slowly up the creaking stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIP'S BEDROOM - SAME Needy has eased off her top to reveal an endearingly plain white bra, complete with center bow. CHIP, also shirtless, cops a feel. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a fluorescent orange CONDOM. Needy looks at the wrapper.

INT. 1004 CAMERFORD - CONTINUOUS Colin follows the music into an empty bedroom. The dark room is filled with blazing candles melting and pooling into bizarre shapes. A single BLANKET is spread out on the floor. Colin shivers. Behind him, in the doorway, Jennifer appears, her smiling face hellishly aglow.

INT. 1004 CAMERFORD - SAME Jennifer grips Colin's face in her hands and forcibly kisses him on the mouth. Colin succumbs, but stiffly. We hear a SCRATCHING noise. Colin pulls away instinctively and sees MICE and ROACHES emerging from the walls, skittering over surfaces.

She slams him to the ground and mounts him. Her jaw unhinges, opening her mouth to a horrifying, inhuman degree. Her teeth are razor-sharp and grotesquely crowded, like they belong to some horribly deformed dog. She descends on him, feeding ravenously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see their shadows against the wall: Jennifer lunging hungrily, blood spraying up from Colin's jugular. We can hear him screaming and gargling on his own blood.
</DIRECTION>

INT. CHIP'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

<DIRECTION>
CHIP is doggedly pumping away on top of Needy, his eyes closed in concentration. Needy's vacant eyes are suddenly brimming with tears.

Tears roll down Needy's cheeks. She begins moaning, then SCREAMING at that top of her lungs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hallucinates liquid seeping through the walls, blood and lymph oozing in at the corners and windows. Then the infamous spiny black bile... Pixelated nightmares emerge from the darkness. Skulls, jesters, demons, death. It's the worst acid trip imaginable. Needy rubs her eyes frantically and continues to scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHIP immediately rolls off Needy, concerned. He grabs her and tries to shake some sense into her.

INT. 1004 CAMERFORD - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colin's thrashing limbs finally go limp. Jennifer is hunched over his remains like a jackal scooping blood into her mouth with cupped hands. We see his eyes, flecked with blood, pupils dilated. A white MOUSE crawls over his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIP'S HOUSE - SAME Needy races toward the door with Chip in pursuit.

She bolts out the room, leaving Chip naked and alone. He pulls his knees up to his chest, vulnerable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHIP'S STREET - SAME Needy runs toward her mom's CAR, a beat-up Kia parked on the curb. She climbs into the car and starts the ignition, trembling and crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls out onto the street and guns it. She swings a hard left. The streets are all almost identical, lined by working-class homes. She turns on the radio. The song is, of course, "Through the Trees" by Soft Shoulder. She pounds the dashboard, hysterical.
</DIRECTION>
<NEEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fudge! Fudge! Maple fudge!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Needy seizes the wheel drives recklessly down a dark, tree-lined street. Then, she sees something bright emerge from the shadows. Her eyes widen... It's JENNIFER, creeping toward the curb like an animal. She's pale in the moonlight. The entire lower half of her face is covered in blood, like a ghoulish beard of gore. She flashes a huge, deranged, toothy SMILE at Needy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Needy screams and SWERVES. The car fishtails out of control and slides into a ditch. Needy slams her foot onto the accelerator, trying to get out of the trench. She glances desperately out the side window. Jennifer is gone. Panting, Needy tries to accelerate again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Jennifer appears from out of nowhere and SLAMS her body against the windshield, her long limbs splayed like an insect's. The windshield SHATTERS. Jennifer grins at Needy through the cracking glass. Needy screams again, puts the pedal to the floor, and manages to rear up out of the ditch. Jennifer's body tumbles off the car as Needy goes roaring down the street.

As the group sings, Nikolai brings the knife down with a grin. We hear Jennifer SCREAMING, sounds of violence and clothes ripping as Nikolai relentlessly beats her and stabs her, his face contorting demonically. The band continues to sing, their voices carrying over the trees.

Nikolai walks over to where the "devil side" of the falls rushes into a black hole. He drops the murder weapon into the churning water, smiling.

Jennifer is wandering down a rural road in a daze. She hears a faint COUGH. Jennifer stops and sees a hunched FIGURE walking down the opposite side of the street. It's AHMET FROM INDIA, the foreign student. He's covered in soot and looks traumatized.

Jennifer takes a step. Ahmet takes a step. Jennifer stops. Ahmet stops.

EXT. OUR LADY OF PERPETUAL BLOOD CEMETERY - DAY We're in a small Catholic cemetery. A small, neat gravel path runs through the stately old monuments into a small valley where a funeral is taking place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faint moaning and sobbing can be heard. Then, a procession of 6 or 7 GOTH/EMO KIDS appears on the crest of the hill. They move forward into the cemetery, flamboyantly dressed in black capes, chains, cloaks, neon hairpieces, fishnets, mesh, 18-hole combat boots, etc. These are Colin Gray's friends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One girl scatters blood-red rose petals dramatically on the path as she stumbles along, weeping. At the bottom of the hill, Colin Gray's very conservative- looking family stands next to the fresh grave, surrounded by sympathetic mourners. NEEDY stands near the back, looking shell-shocked. There are also a few press photographers snapping photos, and of course, a Catholic priest.

	Because Jennifer Check is a social disease. She's not like us. She thinks she's so special just because she's popular and and is what "society" considers "attractive." But she's not sincere. She's about as emo as a breast implant! And she listens to Jessica Simpson and shops at Hollister. And I just know Colin would never go out with someone like that, and I just need confirmation. From you. So did he?

	By the time they found Colin in that godforsaken house, he looked like lasagna with teeth. I'd know-- I had to identify the remains. My boy's not in the realm of the undead.

<NEEDY_V_O>

<DIRECTION>
Chip tiptoes forward tentatively and sinks to his knees. He leans in and kisses Jennifer, who's still clinging to the ladder. The sound of buzzing flies grows louder. Suddenly, Jennifer opens her eyes. She hooks her arm around Chip's neck and lunges backward. They tumble off the ladder, into the pool. Chip SCREAMS.

INT. MC CULLUM PARK - CONTINUOUS Needy runs into the park and scans the dark horizon. Her bare feet are bloody from running and her face is shiny with sweat.

A terrified SCREAM in the distance. Needy whips around, hikes up her skirt and starts running toward Murphy Pool.

She reaches the fence and starts climbing it. She slips and cuts her hand on a broken link. CHIP screams again on the other side of the fence.

She flings herself over the top of the fence, her body slamming against the concrete pool deck. Her ARM snaps. It's a compound fracture, the bone thrusting through the flesh of her arm as she screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MURPHY POOL - CONTINUOUS Needy staggers toward the pool, which is surrounded by an extraterrestrial glow. Chip's moaning is almost unbearable. Needy stares into the abyss and claps her hands over her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer is waist deep in the DIRTY WATER, flinging Chip against the wall like a rag doll. He's still conscious, but his skin on his chest has been RIPPED OFF to expose his ribs. Jennifer is CHEWING happily. Chip looks at Needy, his face a mask of agony.

Jennifer looks up with demonic, bloodshot eyes just as Needy leaps off the diving board. Needy lands on Jennifer's shoulders, taking her out. She wraps her legs around Jennifer's neck and drags her under the water. Jennifer emerges. Needy grabs her by the hair and girly- slaps her furiously across the face. Then she spots the PEPPER SPRAY lying by the side of the pool. She grabs it and sprays it in Jennifer's eyes. Jennifer shrieks and vomits NASTY, SPINY GORE all over Needy and Chip.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck this J.V. shit!

Jennifer floats in midair toward the pool deck and drifts down, landing on her feet. Needy crawls out of the pool and faces her down.

<DIRECTION>
She HURTLES herself toward Needy, roaring, her eyes white- hot, her jaws agape. She's monstrous. Chip suddenly stumbles in front of Needy and holds the HANDLE of the POOL SKIMMER in front of them like a spear. As Jennifer flies forward at demonic speed, she IMPALES HER ENTIRE TORSO on the handle. Needy screams. There's a beat of deafening silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chip collapses on the pool deck. Jennifer rises uncertainly to her feet, "shishkebabbed" on the giant skimmer. With effort, she pulls the handle out of her body in several stages.

<DIRECTION>
She smirks and jumps over the fence, stumbling off into the distance. Needy watches her, her eyes narrowing with hate. Once Jennifer has disappeared, Needy turns her attention to Chip, who is barely alive. She stares in horror at his torn arm and exposed ribs, then falls to her knees over his body.

	No. When you're dying, you can see everything a lot clearer. You can see what's true and what's not.

EXT. C0RVALLIS HIGH CAMPUS- CONTINUOUS Illuminated by lamp light, Needy limps toward the gym entrance. She's completely covered in demon-goo. Her face is bloody, her hair is full of blood and guts, and her BROKEN ARM looks gruesome. In the background, yet another oblivious COUPLE are making out.

Needy stops to stare at them, her gaze calm but obviously insane. They break apart and stare back at her.

INT. GYM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>

Needy enters the gym and slams the door shut behind her. People ignore her as she slowly walks toward the stage. They're too busy slow dancing and laughing in their respective cliques. She looks up at the stage, where Soft Shoulder are playing an insufferably long coda.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai noodles through a guitar solo, then looks up and sees Needy looking directly at him, her eyes full of hate. Nikolai gulps nervously and elbows Dirk.

Needy points to her eyes with two fingers, then points at Nikolai, as if to say, Gotcha. She looks completely possessed.

Dirk takes one look at Needy's face and takes off his guitar. Nikolai motions for the rest of the band to leave the stage. The music stops abruptly. The kids in the gym murmur and complain, confused.

Needy tries to follow them. She limps blindly toward the stage and climbs up. Everyone watches, gasping in horror. By now the band is disappearing out the side door of the gym.

	She left an insanely hot corpse.
	</DIALOGUE>

A small creek emptying into a stream runs parallel to the road. Needy seems something glinting at the mouth of the creek and stoops to pick it up. It's Nikolai's BOWIE KNIFE, the one he threw into Devil's Kettle, never to be seen again. Needy picks it up and tucks it into her waistband. A STATION WAGON comes rattling up the road. Needy sticks her thumb out again. The wagon pulls over to the side of the road. The driver, a grizzled older man, rolls down the window. He eyes Needy lasciviously.
