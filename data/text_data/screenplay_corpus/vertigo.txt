:SC: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK) - CLOSE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a close view of a roof parapet and the curved rail of a fire escape. In the bag, are large skyscrapers with all their windows fully lit in the late winter afternoon. This background is used for the CREDIT TITLES of the picture. After the last card has FADED OUT, we HOLD on to the empty parapet, when suddenly a man's hand reaches and grips the top of the rail. It is followed by another hand and, after a beat, we see the face of a man in his early 30's. He is an Italian type, with rough features. He turns quickly and looks below him and then turning back, springs up over the empty parapet and is lost from view. We STAY on the EMPTY SCENE for a second or two as we HEAR the scraping of boots on the iron ladder. Someone else is coming up. Presently, two more hands and the head of a uniformed policeman with cap and badge starts to climb over the parapet. The CAMERA PULLS BACK so that by the time he has completed his climb, he is in full figure. He dashes out of the picture drawing his gun. Immediately following him over the parapet, a detective in plain clothes climbs over. This is JOHN FERGUSON, known as SCOTTIE. He too pulls a gun and dashes out of the picture.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vast panorama of the San Francisco skyline. Nearer to us are three tiny figures running and jumping over the roof tops. The man on the run, whom we first saw climb over the parapet, is dressed in a white shirt and light tan linen slacks, and wearing sneakers. The uniformed man is shooting at him. Scottie is dressed in medium grey clothes. The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS the group across the roof tops.

:SC: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK) - MED. SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We now see a short gap between rooftops, with a drop below. The pursued man makes the leap successfully followed by the uniformed policeman. Scottie makes the same leap, but almost trips in taking off and is thrown off balance. He tries to recover, lands awkwardly on the opposite roof, and falls forward, prone, with a heavy impact that hurts and drives tile breath from his body. He tries to rise but raises his head with a look of pain -- one leg is doubled up under the other. The tiles give way, and he slides backwards, and his legs go over the edge of the roof, then his body. In his daze he grasps at the loose tiles, and as he goes over the edge he clutches on to the gutter, which gives way, and he swings off into space, looking down.

SCOTTIE'S HEAD. His hands grip the edge of the guttering. The tips of the fingers of policeman straining to reach Scottie, are at the top of screen. Scottie begins to open his grip but stares down, he quickly resumes his grip looking up hopelessly towards the helping hand. He looks down again. FROM SCOTTIE'S VIEWPOINT - the ground below still a long way away.

The body of the policeman sprawled on the ground below. People are running into the alleyway; they stare at the body, look up to where Scottie is hanging. We see the light on their upturned faces. And now we hear a police whistle blown shrilly, again and again. Up to this moment the background music has had an excitement to match the scene, and now it cuts off, abruptly, leaving on the echo of the police whistle as the DISSOLVE begins. Then, in the DISSOLVE, we hear the gentle insistence of Scarlatti played by a chamber orchestra.

:SC: INT. AN APARTMENT ON RUSSIAN HILL - (LATE AFTERNOON)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is fresh, light, and simple, and crowded with books, phonograph records, pictures. The most striking feature of the apartment is the view: The rising hills of San Francisco framed by a large picture window. To one side of the window is the owner of the apartment, MAJORIE WOOD, called MIDGE, at a commercial drawing table concentrating with professional intensity on a drawing of a slim, a elongated woman with few features and fewer clothes. A brassiere sits on a table at Midge's elbow, and she studies it as she draws. Midge Wood is about thirty-seven, attractive, straight-forward, well- but-simply-dressed; she wears glasses but does not whip them an and off as they do in the movies. The music comes from a gramophone. The other occupant of the room is Scottie. He sits in a big chair, with his feet stretched out on an ottoman and his head far back. There is a drink on a table nearby. He rouses himself to reach for it, and in doing so knocks over his walking stick that has been propped against the chair. He reaches out to catch it, and in the quickness of trying to keep it from falling, he wrenches his body around.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well?... what'll you do?

<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never run across one like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<MIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.

:SC: INT. GAVIN ELSTER'S OFFICE - (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A well-appointed office with a large window looking out upon a busy shipyard. There are a couple of models of modern freighters in glass cases, but more important, on the walls are many framed prints and posters and maps relating to early California history; some from the Mexican days, many from the Gold Rush days, many of San Francisco in the Seventies and Eighties. Behind the desk sits Gavin Elster, a man about Scottie's age, huskily built, slightly balding, with cool, watchful eyes. He is beautifully tailored, and gives the sense of a man who relishes money and knows how to use it. He sits quietly watching Scottie, who stands staring out the window at the activity of the shipyard. After a long moment:
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?

</SCOTTIE>
<ELSTER>

<ELSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, to be honest, I find it dull.

	You don't have to do it for a living.

</SCOTTIE>
<ELSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.

Though he does not stress the word, the way be lingers softly on the word "Freedom" makes Scottie look over at him again. Elster looks up and smiles companionably.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A permanent physical disability?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSTER>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --

(Pause)

	Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.

(Pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's on your mind, Gavin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>

A moment, then Elster rises from the desk casually, wanders across the room, looks out the window, gets out a handkerchief and blows his nose prosaically, finally turns and regards Scottie coolly and directly for a long moment.

She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...

	Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.

:SC: INT. ERNIE'S RESTAURANT - (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are in the upstairs room that, in mood and decor, takes us back to Bonanza Days. This is the way San Francisco was. Scottie is at the bar, turned a little so that he faces into the dining room, and as he drinks his eyes search the room slowly, carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA SEARCHES with him, passing over the many well- dressed women, until it comes to rest on a table for two dressed against the far wall. Gavin Elster is seated there, dining with his wife. Scottie cannot get a clear look at her. She is turned slightly away from him, and when she does turn her head in his direction there always seems to be a waiter passing to block the view. And during all of this we hear Elster's voice, continuing from the previous scene.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSTER_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I realize now that the deep change began on the first day I brought her to San Francisco. You know what San Francisco does to people who have never seen it before. All of it happened to Madeleine, but with such an intensity as to be almost frightening. She was like a child came home. Everything about the city excited her: she had to walk all the hills, explore the edge of the ocean, see all the old houses and wander the old streets: and when she came upon something unchanged, something that was as it had been, her delight was so strong so fiercely possessive! These things were hers. And yet she had never been here before. She had been born and raised in the East. I liked it at first, of course. I love this place; I wanted my bride to love it. But then it began to make me uneasy. Her delight was too strong; her excitement was too intense, it never faded; her laugh was too loud, her eyes sparkled too brightly; there was something feverish about the way she embraced the city. She possessed it. And then one day she changed again... and a great sigh settled on her, and the cloud came into her eyes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSTER_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Now Gavin Elster has signed the check, and he and his wife rise and start for the door. Scottie still cannot get an unobstructed view of her face, but we can see in flashes that she is young, in her twenties, with a mobile, attractive face and gentle eyes that have warmth and intelligence and humor. Scottie is intent on her. At the doorway to the bar, only two feet from him, she stops and waits as her husband pauses behind her to speak to the headwaiter and thank him and tip him. She looks about calmly, with sure, distant repose. Her eyes come to rest an Scottie for a moment, then move an with the small smile. During all of the above, Elster's voice has gone on, without pauses, and his narration ends as the girl, Madeleine, comes to a stop near Scottie and waits.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSTER_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what happened that day: where she went, what she saw, what she did. But on that day, the search was ended. She had found what she was looking for, she had come home. And something in the city possessed her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSTER_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
As Scottie stares at her, their eyes meet for a moment, and he turns to reach for his drink. When he turns back, she is gone. He looks about, slightly startled, then catches a glimpse of her as she turns the corner of the upstairs lobby. His eyes grow thoughtful, and glow with the memory of her face.

From Scottie's viewpoint, we see most of the lobby. There is a small reception desk with a key rack to one side, but the strongest and most immediate impact is one of greenery, of foliage. Scattered about the lobby in profusion are tall- standing potted rubber plants and philodendron. Scottie stands and stares. There is no one to be seen, no sign of life. Then we see a leaf of a rubber plant move, and move again, a hand appears, seemingly caressing it, and then we hear a woman's voice.

He places a finger on the reproduction of the portrait to indicate the bun at the back of the neck. Scottie nods.

	Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.

<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?

	Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.

</ELSTER>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did she never tell her daughter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<ELSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.

They go by to reveal Scottie standing by a Rodin sculpture, looking into the room, and far beyond him, at the end of the room, Madeleine seated on the bench before the portrait staring at it. In her hand, resting at her side on the bench, is once again the nosegay. Now she rises and approaches the portrait and stands before it, the nosegay clasped in her two hands before her, and stares up almost as though in votive offering or in prayer. Finally she turns and starts toward the entrance. Scottie slips away out of sight. Madeleine walks slowly toward the CAMERA.

We are in the living room of a comfortable a bachelor apartment. There is a picture window that looks up to Coit Tower on Telegraph Hill. The room is softly lit. A fire is lit in the fireplace; the logs are blazing well, Scottie, in a pair of grey trousers and an old sweater, is wandering about the room, trying to think things out. Through an open door we can see into a small kitchen where Madeleine's clothes - all of them - hang, on a cord over the electric stove, drying. And through another open door we can see into the bedroom where Madeleine lies, in the larger-than-single bed, under the covers, asleep. She sighs and turns restlessly, and Scottie glances at her from the living-room as he wanders, and then she turns again, and the sigh becomes words, spoken in sleep, and he stops, and listens.

(Faintly, distantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please... thank you... please...

Scottie waits, taut, but there is no more. He starts to turn away and suddenly, still distant, but more clearly:
</DIRECTION>
<MADELEINE>
<DIRECTION>
(Appealingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is my child?... have you seen my child...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADELEINE>
<DIRECTION>
Scottie stiffens with the shock of recognition and his eyes go wide with apprehension staring at the lost, eye-closed, troubled woman in the bed. And at that moment the telephone on the bedside table rings sharply. He makes a dash for it. The ringing brings the woman to with a sharp start, and she instinctively clutches the bedclothes to her chin and raises up a little and stares with wide-eyed fright at the man running towards her. Scottie takes the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?... No, it's all right; I'll call you back. Yes. Yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up, and tries to smile down at Madeleine, who has not moved, but has followed his every move with fright and apprehension.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
No answer, only the eyes staring at him. And then he realizes, with some embarrassment, that she cannot move, that she is naked under the bedclothes, and he reaches across to the dressing gown he has laid out for her on the bed, and moves it closer to her.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... you'll want this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
He gives her a reassuring nod and smile, straightens up and goes to the door, and goes into the living room, closing the bedroom door behind him. And she stares after him as he goes. In the living room, he moves to the fireplace, puts another log on, and watches it catch. The bedroom door behind him opens, and he turns to face Madeleine. She has the dressing gown belted tightly around the middle and holds it together with one band at her breast. And she stands there staring at him nervously, frightened, not wanting to admit that she does not know how she came there, but wanting very much to know. And she cannot help herself: knowing her own fears, she has to ask.
</DIRECTION>
<MADELEINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why am I here? What happened?

<SCOTTIE>

<DIRECTION>
(Then, not liking the sound of the truth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...fell into the Bay.

</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
She puts a hand slowly to her hair, understanding now why it is wet.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dried your hair as well as I could. But you'd better come here by the fire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
And now, knowing that he dried her hair, she realizes that he must have taken her clothes off, too, and she looks down at her body with deep awareness of her nakedness, and draws the dressing gown more closely to her, and looks back at him with frightened embarrassment. And her head begins to move quickly, the eyes darting about the apartment as though seeking a way of escape, and she sees the clothes hanging in the kitchen. And she looks back to Scottie appealingly.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're almost at dry. Here. Why don't you come over here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls a low-stool over before the fire. Madeleine crosses slowly, keeping her eyes always on him, and sinks down on the stool. He smiles a at her companionably.

<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like some coffee?

She shakes her head again. He pours a cup of coffee and places it on the floor next to her, along with a bowl of sugar cubes.

<MADELEINE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

He nods. She gives him a small grateful smile.

There is a quick moment of blankness in her eyes that she tries to hide, and then:

<DIRECTION>
(Positively)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Downtown, shopping.
	</DIALOGUE>

And Scottie sighs inwardly, having proved something.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please drink your coffee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<MADELEINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.

</MADELEINE>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<MADELEINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?

<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wandering about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<MADELEINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like it, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADELEINE>
<DIRECTION>
He nods. She smiles at him happily, enjoying the warmth and the coffee, enjoying his presence, seemingly almost to have forgotten her nearness to death. And Scottie is fascinated by this thing curled up before his fire.
</DIRECTION>
<MADELEINE>
<DIRECTION>
(Then with a wicked smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And where had you been?... just before?

</MADELEINE>
<DIRECTION>
At the words, "I've never been inside," Scottie is startled. He stares at her, and she looks at him with naive, happy inquisitiveness, and their looks are joined. Finally she drops her eyes and smiles timidly.
</DIRECTION>
<MADELEINE>
<DIRECTION>
(Softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.

</MADELEINE>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

She reaches up to feel her hair.

(And suddenly conscious

He crosses the room swiftly, picks up an ash tray in which he had deposited her hairpins, takes her handbag from a chair, and brings them to her.
</DIRECTION>
<MADELEINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADELEINE>
<DIRECTION>
She proceeds to do up her hair. He watches her, held by the movement of her body under the dressing gown as she raises her arms and deftly sets about putting her hair in order. At one point, as she works, she looks up and flashes him a direct smile.

Then she looks up with a small smile, and the cloud is gone from her eyes, and she speaks completely matter-of-factly.

<MADELEINE>
<DIRECTION>
(Simply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm married, you know.

</MADELEINE>
<DIRECTION>
Scottie nods almost imperceptibly with his eyes. He looks at her for a long moment. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<MADELEINE>
<DIRECTION>

<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?

</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
She laughs with relief, for it seemed to her, for a quick moment, that he was going to say "falling in love".
</DIRECTION>
<MADELEINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?

	No... this is the first time for me, too.

<DIRECTION>
And they laugh together, with genuine warmth and friendliness in their eyes, and it is obvious they are very much taken with each other. And as they laugh, simultaneously, she reaches for the cup of coffee, to take another sip, and he reaches for it, meaning to take it and refill it.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, let me give you a lit --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
And his hand falls on her outstretched arm and stays there, and with the contact made, the laughter dies suddenly, and he is looking down at her intently, and their eyes have met, and hers are anxious and wondering. And at that moment, the telephone rings sharply. Scottie races into the bedroom, closing the door behind him, and gets to the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.

</SCOTTIE>
<ELSTER_S_VOICE>

	Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.

	No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Did she hurt herself?

</ELSTER_S_VOICE>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.

Another long silence.

	Scottie... Madeleine is twenty-six. Carlotta Valdes committed suicide when she was twenty-six.

And now it is Scottie's turn to be silent. He hangs up slowly and moves across the room to the door.

Scottie enters from the bedroom, and stops, surprised. The room is empty. The clothes are gone from the in the kitchen.

From Midge's point of view; Madeleine, outside Scottie's door, hurries to the green Jaguar.

Midge watches Madeleine almost wistfully, and there is a small look of hurt in her eyes. But even to herself she has to cover, and she smiles ironically.

<DIRECTION>
The Jaguar pulls away and passes out of view.
</DIRECTION>

Midge is still staring across at Scottie's house, and the soft smile on her lips covers the hurt well. But there is still a shadow of it in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<MIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
(Softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, now, Johnny-O... Was it a ghost?... And was it fun?...

</MIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Then she suddenly changes expression.
</DIRECTION>
<MIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oops!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
She takes her foot off the brake, and turning hard on the wheel, straightens the car up and drives on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SCOTTIE'S APARTMENT - (NIGHT)

The door to Scottie's apartment has opened, and Scottie stands in the doorway looking up and down the street for the Jaguar, his tall frame silhouetted in the light streaming from the room.

The CAMERA is SHOOTING through the stone gateway across the small courtyard toward the front door of the apartments. We see Madeleine emerge. She is dressed completely different from the night before. She makes her way down to the Jaguar in the f.g. She gets in, starts up and swings the car round toward the CAMERA. She passes out of the picture.

Scottie now wears a look of great astonishment, as he pulls up hurriedly in the middle of the street.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - (DAY) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

<DIRECTION>
From his viewpoints, we see the reason for his astonishment. Madeleine has alighted and is approaching, of all places, toward his own red front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scottie pulls his car over to the curb and gets out. The CAMERA PANS him down. He stops short just before he reaches Madeleine, to see her take a letter from her handbag and put it into his letter box. He moves up to her.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>

Madeleine turns quickly, startled, and then sees who it is, and smiles.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.

(Then, ruefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He nods. She looks away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(With a gesture)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.

<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all, I enjoyed --

And he stops short, now truly embarrassed, and she looks at him with wide eyes, waiting for him to go on.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</SCOTTIE>
<MADELEINE>
<DIRECTION>
(With small, contained amusement)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I enjoyed talking to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADELEINE>
<DIRECTION>
An awkward pause. Scottie turns abruptly to the door, getting out his key.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get my mail...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the door and bends down to pick up the letter. As he is reaching for it, he turns his head and speaks almost without thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like some coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>

<MADELEINE>
<DIRECTION>
(Quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! No, thank you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADELEINE>
<DIRECTION>
She says it so impulsively, and with such young vehemence, that they both start to laugh. He straightens up and opens the letter.
</DIRECTION>
<MADELEINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADELEINE>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.

He reads the letter as she watches him. He looks up.

<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope we will, too.

They smile at one another, and there is a nice moment of silent rapport. Then:

	Good-bye.

</MADELEINE>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good-bye.

She turns and goes to her car as he stands watching her, and gets in behind the wheel.

<SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
(Suddenly walking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
And he races to the car and leans in the window. She watches him, open-mouthed, as he crosses the sidewalk. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<MADELEINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...

</SCOTTIE>
<MADELEINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.

</MADELEINE>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true.

<DIRECTION>
And now he waits, hopefully.

<MADELEINE>
<DIRECTION>
(With a smiling nod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You left your door open.

He turns his head, startled and annoyed, than makes a dash for the door. As he goes, he turns his head to call back to her.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move!
	</DIALOGUE>

And he hurries on to the door. She watches him go, and we are close on her face to see her genuine amusement, and then the laughter fades a little, and a troubled look comes into her eyes, a touch of concern.

She turns away with gentle, somber, self-contained wonder, and they cross back to the path in silence, and wander on along the path in silence. We watch them move away in the distance, disappear behind a tree, then come into view again, and now there comes into view the cross-section of a redwood tree that is on exhibit, with certain of its rings marked to show what it has lived through, and they approach it.

She raises one gloved hand and almost idly begins to trace a finger up along the white line that is marked: 1776 DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.

She turns her head to him, only now aware of his presence, and stares at him without expression. Then slowly she turns and walks away, and the CAMERA, PANNING HER SLIGHTLY, brings the head and shoulders of Scottie into the foreground, and he watches her, wondering anxiously, trying to put things together in his mind. Madeleine walks on until she disappears behind one of the distant redwoods.

Below the point of land, the sea pounds against the rocks. Madeleine stands alone, silhouetted against the sky. Scottie sits in the car, watching her. She does not move. Then slowly she starts to walk toward the sea, and as he watches he senses, without being sure, that her pace is increasing, and suddenly he opens the car door and jumps out and slams the door and begins to run. But then he sees something, and slows down quickly and walks, for Madeleine has stopped and turned and is waiting for him. There is a gentle, apologetic smile in her eyes. She waits, and he comes to a stop before her.

And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside the terrace darkness is falling, and the lights of the city have come on. In Midge's apartment the lights are on and soft music comes from the radio (possibly "progressive jazz" of the gentle George Shearing kind). Midge is painting at a standing easel; She has a palette; obviously she is painting in oils. We cannot see what she is painting; the canvas on stretchers has its back to us. Its size is about thirty by forty inches. Whatever it is, it seems to please her: she pauses in her work, picks up a highball from a table nearby, drinks and stares at the painting and giggles a little to herself than applies a few more daubs. Now she hears the outside gate slam. She puts down the brush and the drink, moves the easel a bit so that the canvas cannot be seen from the front door, picks up a water tumbler that contains a small nosegay, and hurries out to the kitchen with it. The door to the apartment slams.

Scottie moves toward the easel and Midge backs away, so that as he comes around to face the canvas she in beyond him, in back of him. As he moves toward the easel:

And now he comes around to face the easel and stops to look. Beyond him Midge's face has a great smile of anticipation. And now we see what he sees. The CAMERA RESTS on the lower half of the canvas and we see the folds of the blue and gold gown, and the two hands, one holding the nosegay. The CAMERA PANS UP to reveal that it is a hasty but quite creditable copy of the "Portrait of Carlotta", half size, but there is one difference. The face is Midge's face.

She breaks off as he turns his head to look at her. He's not at all angry, but disturbed inside and sorry it happened.

Scottie awakens sharply, gathers himself together, hurries to the door and opens it. Madeleine stands there, looking shaken and white and frightened.

The music of the Mission theme, mingled with Carlotta's theme, begins to drift in, an evocation of the past; a sighing that grows end seem to have behind it the echo of lost voices calling. The CAMERA MOVES AND EASES AROUND A BIT to look through the arches across the green toward the open side and the valley and the hills beyond. A lone nun is crossing the green to the church. A clock strikes the half hour. The CAMERA PANS to look at the large wooden two-story house on the far side of the green, then the little garden, then the Plaza Livery Stable, and the road alongside. The Jaguar stands there empty. The CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN along the whitewashed stone Castro House, sees the pepper tree, MOVES along the Plaza Hotel, and comes to REST SHOOTING at the saloon that forms the far corner of the hotel.

Scottie looks up at her in desperation, then looks about the stable for help. His look scans the carriages and wagons lined against the wall, goes past the old fire truck on which there is a placard proclaiming the world's championship of 1884, and finally stops at a small buggy -- a Bike Wagon -- To which is hitched a full-sized model of a handsome grey horse.

No answer. The music is more insistent, now, a pulling wind,, and the faint voices call more clearly. Madeleine slowly rises to her feet as though sensing the call.

From his viewpoint we see Madeleine running up the open stairway that spirals up along the walls of the high tower. She is already well on her way. Scottie is immediately stricken by vertigo, and the tall tower seems to slide away from him. He makes an attempt to start up the stairs, flattens himself against the wall and struggles up. He claws his way up, crosses over to the hand- handrailing and uses it to pull his body up the steps, one by one railing struggling for breath, unable to call, though he tries. And Madeleine keeps running. Madeleine reaches the top goes through a small wooden door. We see it slam, hear it locked. Scottie, struggling up, reaches a landing next to a small open arch that looks out on the back garden, and has to stop to tight his nausea. There is a scream from above.

</DIRECTION>
<OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Elster, suspecting that all was not well with his wife's mental state, took the preliminary precaution of having her watched by Mr. Ferguson lest any harm befall her, and you have heard that Mr. Elster was prepared to take his wife to an institution where her mental health would have been in the hand of qualified specialists. And Mr. Ferguson, being an ex-detective, would have seemed the proper choice for the role of watchdog and protector. As you have learned, it was an unfortunate choice.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	However, I think you will agree that no blame can be attached to the husband. His delay in putting his wife under medical care was due only to the need information as to her behavior that he expected to get from Mr. Ferguson. He had taken every precaution to protect his wife. He could not have anticipated that Mr. Ferguson's "weakness" his "fear of heights", called "acrophobia", would make him powerless when he was most needed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As to Mr. Ferguson: you have heard his former superior, Detective Captain Hansen, from that great city to the north, testify as to his character and ability. Captain Hansen was most enthusiastic. The fact that Mr. Ferguson once before, under similar circumstances, allowed a police colleague to tall to his death, Captain Hansen dismissed as an "unfortunate Incident."

<DIRECTION>
Captain Hansen's eyes narrow and his face reddens. Scottie stares at the floor dully, oblivious to what is being said.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course Mr. Ferguson is to be congratulated for having once saved the woman's life when, in a previous fit of aberration, she threw herself into the Bay. It is a pity that knowing her suicidal tendencies he did not make a greater effort the second time. But we are not here to pass judgment on Mr. Ferguson's lack of initiative. He did nothing, and the law has little to say on the subject of things left undone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nor does his strange behavior after he saw the body fall have any bearing on your verdict. He did not remain at the scone of the death. He ran away. He claims he suffered a mental blackout and knew nothing more until he found himself back in his own apartment in San Francisco several hours later. You may accept that or not. Or, you may believe that, having once again allowed someone to die, he could not face the tragic result of his own weakness, and ran away. That has nothing to do with your verdict. It is a matter between him and his conscience.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now. From the evidence of the mind of Madeleine Elster prior to her death, from the manner of her death, and from the Postmortem examination of the body showing the actual cause of her death, you should have no difficulty in reaching your verdict. Gentlemen, you may retire.

Scottie looks at the outstretched hand, then looks up at the man's face, wanting very much to tell him how he felt about the dead woman. But the words won't come. Elster drops his hand with a sympathetic half-smile, and touches Scottie comfortingly on the arm.

Elster and Scottie look at each other for a moment. Then Elster nods somberly and turns away and goes down the stairs with his attorney. The room is empty, now, but for Hansen and Scottie.

<DIRECTION>
Scottie in bed, sleeping restlessly. His head fills the screen, rolls from, side to side. In a SLOW DISSOLVE while his head remains on the screen, there comes into focus and is superimposed as it gets closer the head and shoulders of the portrait of Carlotta. The CAMERA PANS DOWN until it reveals the nosegay. The portrait is cleared from the screen, a new image is superimposed; the final scene at the inquest between Scottie and Gavin Elster. But this time, though it is not distinct, a woman's head can be discerned on Elster's shoulder. Elster turns to the woman and says: "Tell him he's not to blame; tell him." The woman turns her head to smile at Scottie. It is Carlotta Valdes again, dressed as in the portrait, with the necklace at her throats, and she is alive. The picture fades away. Scottie's restless head is alone on the screen again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another scene dissolves to the screen: the graveyard at Mission Dolores. The CAMERA IS APPROACHING the grave of Carlotta Valdes. Now we see Scottie approaching the grave. Now the CAMERA REVERSES, MOVING closer to the grave. It is open; there is a great black abyss, with the headstone to mark it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CLOSEUP OF SCOTTIE coming to a stop as he stares down. The black depths of the grave fill the screen, and now, suddenly we start to fall. A BIG CLOSEUP OF SCOTTIE, his hair windswept, staring down in horror as he falls. REVERSE ANGLE: he is still falling, but now from the tower of the Mission at San Juan onto the roof where Madeleine fell, and at the moment of impact the picture clears, and Scottie is sitting up in bed, staring ahead in horror, awakened by the sound of his own scream. The scream is echoed by a fog horn in the distance.

We see a portable phonograph with a record on, and we hear Mozart at his gayest, most incisive, most sparkling. And then we find Midge standing nearby, smiling across at Scottie, who is seated in a wheelchair wearing a dressing gown over pajamas. His face is gaunt and expressionless. We are in a light and pleasant bed-sitting room. Through the window we can see a lovely garden, and a few patients accompanied by nurses strolling along the paths.

	It's Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus. I had a long talk with the lady in musical therapy, and she said Mozart's the boy for you, Johnny. The broom that sweeps the cobwebs away. That's what the lady said. You know, it's wonderful how they've got it all taped now, John. They've got music for melancholiacs, and music for dipsomaniacs, and music for nymphomaniacs... I wonder what would happen if somebody mixed up their files?

<DIRECTION>
There is no reaction on Scottie's face, and Midge makes a grimace of dissatisfaction at the weakness of her joke. She looks across at him uncertainly.

	But I brought you a lot of other things. You can see what you like. And the thing shuts off automatically.

Scottie does not seem to hear, but Midge turns her head. A nurse is looking in, with a significant look at Midge.

The nurse goes out. Midge rises.

	He won't talk.

</MIDGE>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.

<MIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.

Scottie is seated at the bar, exactly as he was the first time he saw Madeleine. The dinning room is crowded. Scottie's glance wanders about the room as he drinks, but he does not seem to be so much searching as waiting. And then he stiffens. From somewhere across the room a man and a woman are making their way among the tables toward the exit, and their relative positions as they move recall exactly the way Madeleine and Gavin Elster moved toward him on that night. And as the woman moves toward him, difficult to see clearly because of the movements of the waiters crossing her path, he could swear that it is Madeleine, and so could we. Although she does not wear an evening dress. Scottie stares, fearing and hoping as the woman gets closer and closer. And then she is there, and pauses near him to wait for the man, exactly as Madeleine did -- but it is not Madeleine.

Scottie in the foreground, and across the street the apartment building from which Madeleine used to emerge, with the forecourt of cars. A long moment, then a man emerges and crosses the street and walks toward the Fairmont Hotel. Another wait, and then a woman comes out of the apartment house. She has Madeleine's figure and Madeleine's style. Scottie freezes. The woman crosses the forecourt toward a car out of our sight. Scottie moves to follow the course of the woman, and we move with him, and now the car comes into sight, it is the green Jaguar. The woman opens the car door. Scottie races across the street and into the forecourt. By the time he gets to the Jaguar, the woman is in behind the wheel and has the motor started. Scottie races up to her, then stops short. The woman is not like Madeleine in features, and is a good deal older. She looks up startled as Scottie comes to a stop by the open car window.

Scottie wanders to the entrance of the room in which hangs the Portrait of Carlotta, and stops and looks towards the far corner. Some people pass before him, but then as the vista clears he sees walking toward him from Carlotta's corner a woman who must surely be Madeleine. He stares, rigid, as she comes closer, and then she passes out of view as she heads for the exit. Scottie turns to keep her in sight, and as she passes through the doors to go out to the courtyard she turns a just a bit so that she is silhouetted slightly in profile against the cuter light, and once again surely it is Madeleine. Scottie heads for the door fast, pushes through the courtyard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He breaks into a run and catches up with her and puts out his hand to take her arm, and as he does she turns, startled by his sudden appearance at her side -- and they both stop and stare at each other. It is not Madeleine. A moment, as the woman stares at him, frightened.

Scottie stands before the window looking at the floral display. In the foreground is a group of madeup nosegays and one of them is exactly like the nosegay Madeleine carried to the grave, to the portrait, to the moment she threw herself into the Bay. A porter closes the shop door and locks it. A moment, then Scottie turns away to move down Grant Avenue. He stops short. Coming up Grant Avenue, headed for Sutter Street, is a group of shopgirls who have just come out of work, and among them is one who -- again -- must surely be Madeleine. Scottie watches them come closer, trying to get a clear view through the crowd of passersby, catching sight of the girl only in glimpses, and as the girls come abreast of him they stop to make their farewells. The one nearest to Scottie, seen in profile, might have the same features as Madeleine. He cannot be sure. This girl's hair is dark, where Madeleine's was light; her features on closer inspection seem heavier, and she wears much more makeup. And yet there is something about the way she carries herself. The other girls cross the street while the one nearest to Scottie goes on alone. He instinctively turns and follows.

Scottie remains on the opposite side of the street, watching, wondering what to do next.

He waits, and then, in much the same way it happened to him long ago at the McKittrick Hotel, his attention is attracted to a window on the second floor. The girl appears and opens the window about eight inches, then pulls down the blind.

He flashes her a smile and goes, closing the door. She stares after him for a long moment, then moves slowly and sits down on the edge of the bed. She stares straight ahead, thinking, her face an impassive mask. The CAMERA MOVES IN until her head fills the screen, and her eyes are deep with dark memory. We DISSOLVE THROUGH to what she sees: THE MOMENT IN THE TOWER OF THE MISSION. MADELEINE IS RUNNING UP THE STAIRS OF THE TOWER: SCOTTIE STRUGGLING DESPERATELY AFTER HER. SHE REACHES THE TOP, OPENS THE DOOR, DARTS INTO THE BELL TOWER, SLAMS THE DOOR BEHIND HER AND LOCKS IT. SHE TURNS. GAVIN ELSTER STANDS NEAR THE OPEN ARCH, HOLDING HIS WIFE FAST; SHE IS DRESSED IN A GREY SUIT EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE MADELEINE WEARS. HER BODY IS LIMP. SHE IS OBVIOUSLY DEAD ALREADY. ELSTER LOOKS AT MADELEINE, THEN PUSHES HIS WIFE OUT THROUGH THE ARCH. MADELEINE MAKES A FUTILE GESTURE TO STOP HIM, AND SCREAMS. ELSTER COMES TO QUICKLY, PUTS HIS HAND ACROSS HER MOUTH, AND DRAWS HER BACK INTO THE SHADOW BEHIND A MASONRY ABUTMENT. THEY ARE LOST FROM SIGHT...

DISSOLVE THROUGH to Judy, seated on the edge of her bed, staring with the memory of the horror of the moment. She sits very still. Then slowly she rises and moves to the window. She looks out, watching Scottie go down the street. She turns away and goes to the closet and opens the door. She pushes some clothes along the rack. We see the grey suit. She reaches into the closet and brings out a suitcase, lets it lie there, just outside the closet, and stares down at it. Then she turns back, goes to the writing desk sits down, and takes a sheet of paper. She picks up a ball point pen, clicks out the Point, stares ahead for a moment, then begins to write. As she writes, we hear her voice.

<JUDY_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dearest Scottie ... and so you've found me. This is the moment I dreaded and hoped for, -- wondering what I would say and do if ever I saw you again, I wanted so to see you again. Just once. Now I'll go and you can give up your search.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to have peace of mind. You've nothing to blame yourself for. You were the victim. I was the tool, you were the victim of a man's plan to murder his wife. He chose me to play the part because I looked like her; he dressed me up like her. He was quite safe because she lived in the country and rarely came to town. He chose you to be the witness. The Carlotta story was part real, part invented to make you testify that Madeleine wanted to kill herself. He knew of your illness; he knew you would never get up the stairs of the tower. He planned it so well; he made no mistakes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I made the mistake. I fell in love. That wasn't part of the plan. I'm still in love with you, and I want you so to love me. If I had the nerve, I would stay and lie, hoping that I could make you love me again, as I am for myself... and so forget the other and forget the past. But I haven't the nerve to try...

She pauses and looks up and thinks, and wonders, and tries to see into the future, and as she does, the fear in her eyes dissolve into anxious hope, and then resolve.

She puts the pen down, rises slowly, takes up the letter and tears it into small pieces and drops the pieces into the wastebasket. She turns to the closet, pushes the suitcase back in with the toe of her foot, pushes the grey suit far back into darkness, and closes the closet door. She walks to the dresser, and stares at herself in the mirror. She opens a candy box in which we see trinkets and pieces of junk jewelry, and takes out two plain hoop earrings. She puts them on and looks to see how much change they make. She takes up an eyebrow pencil and slightly exaggerates the arch of her brows. She stares at herself impassively for a long time.

The room is filled with diners; waiters come and go. There is a sound of chatter and a slight clatter of dishes at a side table. We are looking from the bar, and at a table against the far wall we see Judy and Scottie, dining. They are talking amiable; Scottie is being genial and companionable, but there is no particular sense of intimacy. Judy looks about quite a bit, obviously admiring the room, and the food and the clothes of the people about her. She is dressed neatly, but more simply and more cheaply than are the other women in the room, and she is conscious of it, and keeps fiddling with the shoulders at her dress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
During this, a party of diners enters, is greeted by the captain, and is led across the room toward an empty table near Judy and Scottie. We go with them winding among the tables. As we get very close to Scottie, he looks up and becomes rigid, and stares. A woman has just gone by him to take seat at the neighboring table. Her hair is blonde and is done exactly as was Madeleine's; from the rear she could easily be Madeleine. But then she turns and sits down, glancing at Scottie as she does, and we see that it is not Madeleine. A moment, then Scottie looks away. Judy is staring at him anxiously. It is her first defeat and her first victory: defeat, in that although he is with her he is still searching; victory, in that she is sure, now, that he does not think she is Madeleine.

The first impact is of SOUND, of the buzz of hair dryers and the shrill cacophony of female voices talking and laughing. Scottie is leaning at the doorway leading into the inner salon. The CAMERA PANS AWAY from him through another door and comes to REST on a big head of Judy, covered with, soap suds, bent over a basin. One of the beauty operators looks out toward Scottie then walks out to him.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
From Scottie's viewpoint. Judy is walking up the street. She wears the grey suit from Ransohoff's the high-heeled black shoes, and her hair is now blonde. But it hangs about her face in the usual way. She does not look up. She turns into the entrance of the hotel.

As Judy comes into the room, Scottie closes the door without taking his eyes from her. She looks at him gravely -- and holds out her hand, as though hoping for praise for the transformation. Her eyebrows have been plucked, her makeup lightened, her lipstick changed and she now bears much more of a resemblance to Madeleine.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well?

Scottie abruptly goes to her, takes her hanging hair with both hands pulls it to the back so that her ears show. Judy looks at him, half-angry, half-scared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scottie, seeing the look in her eyes, takes his hands away. The hair falls forward again.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.

They look at one another for a moment. Then Scottie asks, almost humbly:
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Judy -- please --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
Judy doesn't answer for a moment, then she draws a deep breath, and turns resignedly away. She crosses to the mirror over a chest of drawers. Scottie matches as she picks up a couple of pins from a glass tray, and scoops up a handful of hair. Scottie stands watching in silence. His eyes follow every move. We hear the tinkle of pins of the glass tray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM SCOTTIE'S VIEWPOINT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judy slowly turns from the mirror to face him. She looks exactly like Madeleine -- her hair pulled back and done in a bun at the back of the neck. She stands there looking at him. SCOTTIE looks at her in wonder, his eyes shining. JUDY takes a step towards him, rewarded by his expression. SCOTTIE moves over and takes Judy in his arms.
</DIRECTION>

BIG HEADS

of the two of them, together. The CAMERA MOVES AROUND the big heads. Scottie holds her tighter and tighter. He looks past her shoulder and we see that his eyes are closed, because at last he holds Madeleine in his arms once more. He opens his eyes -- the CAMERA SWIMS AROUND the room.

The window shades are drawn, the lights in the room have been lit. Scottie is sitting, relaxed, thumbing through a magazine idly. The jacket of his suit is hung over the back of a chair. The bathroom door is open. There is a full length mirror on the back of the bathroom door, and we catch occasional glimpses of Judy as she moves about inside. Scottie looks up as she calls to him. Her voice is light and happy.

</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
She has opened the candy box, rummages around in the jewelry, comes up with some earrings, holds one up to her ear to see what it looks like, decides against it, finds some other earrings, small and neat, and puts them on. During this:
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?

<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks. And... let's see... to start...

During this she has taken a necklace out of the box, and is trying to fasten it around her neck. But the clasp won't work.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! Help me with this, will you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
She backs up a step, still holding the necklace in place, and Scottie rises from his chair and comes up in back of her. He takes the ends of the necklace from her.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got it. He bends down and bites the back of her neck.

</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
As he is fastening it he glances into the mirror and sees the necklace clearly for the first time. His eyes are immediately startled with the shock of recognition, and he stares, wondering why. The CAMERA ZOOMS IN to a closeup of the necklace in the mirror; then, with a click, the closeup changes to a closeup of the necklace painted on canvas. The CAMERA DRAWS BACK to show the necklace around the neck of Carlotta in the portrait, the same necklace. Now the CAMERA DRAWS BACK to show the Art Gallery, with the Portrait of Carlotta on the far wall. The scene click-changes to a BIG HEAD of SCOTTIE, staring, and during this we hear Judy chattering away.

She puts her arms around him and presses against him, and lays her head against his chest with a happy sigh.

He raises his arms as though to embrace her, moves his hands to her shoulders, and one senses for a moment that he is going to press her too hard or that he may move his hands to her throat. But then he lays his hands gently on her back, and closes his eyes wearily, and rests his head on the top of hers.

She starts up slowly, unwillingly. Scottie follows behind her, fighting to keep the impending vertigo under control, trying to keep his eyes fixed on her back to avoid looking up into space. They move up in silence, and in shadow, their faces occasionally lit by the shafts of moonlight that stream through the open arches of the tower. Judy's eyes are wide and staring; her face and body are stiff with the struggle to keep from breaking under the strain of remembering the last time she went up these stairs. And Scottie fights his way up behind her.

She stiffens and stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The necklace, Madeleine. That was the slip. I remembered the necklace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
A moment, then suddenly she ducks and tries to run past him, down the stairs. He grabs her wrist and holds on.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Let me go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going up the tower.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't. You're afraid!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to. It's my second chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to drag her up the stairs and she fights it, close to hysteria.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scottie, please...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she was the one who died. Not you. The real wife. You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dead. He'd broken her neck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Took no chances, did he? And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
The blind, frantic nodding of her head as she struggles against him is his affirmation.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your accident...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know... Switzerland?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll find him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
They have reached the door to the tower and he stops, with a grim, almost triumphant smile.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I made it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(Apprehensive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes the door open. She shrinks back.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes her through and follows her in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BELL TOWER - (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black shadows are cut by shafts of moonlight. Heavy beams support the great bell hanging at the center. There are additional temporary support beams. Judy backs up against the stonework as Scottie looks about.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You both hid behind there, mmm?... 'til everything was clear... then sneaked down and drove back to the city.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Glances at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then? You were his girl. What happened to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at him, wide-eyed with apprehension.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he ditch you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
An almost imperceptible nod from her. Scottie almost laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power... he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(Faintly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
A moment, as he stares at her, then he advances on her slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(Apprehensive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I loved you, Madeleine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(Desperately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(She throws herself into his arms)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
And she is in his arms, pressing tightly against him in desperation, and he holds her tight, and they kiss, deeply, passionately. The kiss ends but they remain together, holding together, and Scottie's eyes are tight with pain and the emotion of hating her and hating himself for loving her.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(softly, pleading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love me... keep me safe...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
(Whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Judy's eyes, looking past him, go wide with horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM JUDY'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure of a woman draped in black stands motionless in the shadows by the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUDY, IN SCOTTIE'S ARMS, TRANSFIXED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM JUDY'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black figure moves forward, seems to merge with the shadow and become part of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulls out of Scottie's arms and backs away, terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(Whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
She is backing perilously close to the edge of the drop below. Scottie stares at her for a moment, then swings around to see what she is looking at.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM SCOTTIE'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black figure advances into a shaft of moonlight. It is a nun.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_NUN>
<DIRECTION>
(Simply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard voices...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_NUN>
<DIRECTION>
There is a terrible scream. Scottie swings around again, steps quickly to the edge and looks down. He backs away, his face tight with horror and holds the stonework for support. The nun comes into the SHOT. She steels herself to look below. She crosses herself.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_NUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God have mercy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_NUN>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches out for the bell cord.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. THE BELL TOWER - (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The church bell is tolling. It swings in and out of the picture. Through the archway we can see the Mission garden below. Figures are hurrying across toward the church.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIDGE APARTMENT - (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Midge is huddled in a chair, listening to the radio. Beyond her, San Francisco at night.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_RADIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- was last heard of living, but is now thought to be residing somewhere in the south of France. Captain Hansen states that he anticipated no trouble in having Elster extradited once he is found. Other news on the local front: in Berkeley three university of California sophomores found themselves in a rather embarrassing position tonight when they were discovered by Police Officer William Fogarty leading a cow up the steps of --
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RADIO>
<DIRECTION>
By now Midge has heard the NOISE outside, has uncoiled from the chair and shut the radio. She listens again for a moment, then moves quickly to the table on which are bottles, glasses and ice. She starts to mix a strong highball and does not turn as she hears the front door open. Scottie enters and closes the door behind him. His face is a mask.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves slowly across the room and stands by the window, with the view of San Francisco beyond him, and looks straight ahead, thinking. Midge picks up the highball, glances over at him, picks up the bottle and pours in another slug. Then moves across the room and holds out the drink. Scottie takes it. Midge moves away, picks up her own drink, sits down and looks across the room. Scottie stands quietly, immobile, then raises the glass and takes a long pull at the drink. He stares out at the city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
