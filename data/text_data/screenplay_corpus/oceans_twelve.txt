A MULTI-COLORED SCREEN

After a few introductory credits, we pull back to reveal the source of this kaleidoscopic backdrop: A SINGLE, STRIPED TULIP, planted in a long row of other tulips. A HAND reaches in and pulls the tulip from the ground. We then cut to:

A BASKET of tulips, carried by hand to a truck, where it is loaded with hundreds of other baskets. The door of the truck is SHUT and we cut to:

The door of the truck OPENING to reveal that the tulips are now boxed and crated. A forklift moves the crates onto a wagon, which is driven by a MANNED CART across the biggest warehouse on the planet, the Bloenen Markt (CHECK THIS-- steven) in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The cart and wagons we were following disappear into a maze of synchronized activity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cart arrives in the AUCTION ROOM, which is constructed like an ampitheater: the buyers sit in a steeply raked semi-circle, facing two giant, clock-shaped scoreboards that display the bids on the flowers being viewed. The striped tulips fetch a very high price.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The carts of striped tulips are delivered to an automated sorting apparatus of enormous size and complexity. They end up on a truck heading for the airport.
</DIRECTION>

The tulips are loaded onto a plane. During the transatlantic flight, they sit nestled in the cargo hold.

	Wow. How do they do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUSTOMER>
<OWNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an accident. It means the flower developed a virus early in the bulb stage. The flaws create the unusual coloring.

	No, Felix, no. I paid for pure. And if my workshop were on top of Mount Everest it would be pure. But I'm at sea level, Felix, and at sea level it should liquefy at 736.95. If it's pure, that is. Which this isn't.

Turk moves on, taking us past a sleeping Saul and landing on Danny and Rusty, who watch a movie with fixed expressions.

	Well, I know this may not be the exact right time to bring this up, but I've been thinking about...well, about where I want to be in five years, career-wise, and I've decided I really want to be more than just a role-player. I really see myself as kind of an idea man, like you guys. I mean, I know you do your part and you're in the trenches with us and all, but it's really your show, and like I said, five years from now, I want to be running my own show....

INT. AUDITORIUM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Europol Agent ISABEL LAHIRI gives a presentation to seventy- five of her colleagues. With her on stage are a couple of seated HIGHER-UP TYPES. She's nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's discuss, briefly and to begin, with the category of "thieves", as distinguished from the larger category of what might be termed "hardened" criminals. The highest level, "master thieves," if you will, is a very small world. Between six and ten high-level crews are operating in Europe at any given time. Worldwide, no more than twenty. The most famous, Gaspar LeMarc, is either dead or retired, and the expectation is that no one will replace him. The good news is the trend is toward their extinction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
The secretary enters the auditorium and walks toward the podium.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For example: Anecdotal evidence suggest these people are personally insufferable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
The Higher-Ups look at each other; what did she just say?
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Their egos demand constant praise, and they embellish their exploits to anyone who will listen. They tell their own stories endlessly, provided of course, they are talking to a fellow thief or an intimate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
Many in the audience are now looking to each other, wondering if this is appropriate.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those who interact with them on a personal level are relegated to positions of total servitude, with no chance for growth or freedom. Their lives are treated as secondary. Many of them suffer from depression. It's a crime for which there is no law, and yet causes untold damage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
One of the Higher-Ups convinces the other to say something, but by now Hess the Male Secretary has reached Isabel and interrupts her by whispering into her ear. She balances.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (amplified by the lectern mic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHAT?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EUROPOL HEADQUARTERS -- LONG SHOT -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Isabel and Hess walk briskly through the ultra-modern hallway. He briefs her as they walk in a hushed voice. Then something he says stops her in her tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hess continues to explain something we can't hear. Then he pulls out some PHOTOS. Isabel leafs through them.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's impossible!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VANDERSPEIGLE HOUSE -- CRIME SCENE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Isabel arrives and is greeted by PAUL, a lead detective working the Vanderspeigle theft for the Amsterdam police department.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for coming. We can really use your help on this one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
His partner looks over at Isabel, who is wearing a skirt and pretty damn good shoes. The guy checks out her legs and looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope the scene hasn't been contaminated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
Isabel walks away. Moments later, she enters the house with the lead detective.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VANDERSPEIGLE HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As soon as she's inside she's all business.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No forced entry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not that we can find.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
UPSTAIRS -- VANDERSPEIGLE'S HOME OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Isabel looks around Vanderspeigle's home office. Behind a fake bookcase is a small room which contains the safe. In the other direction is Vanderspeigle's bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't figure out how they disabled the alarm. We thought maybe they tried to short it out somehow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that would have triggered the system.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
Isabel goes to the alarm pad. Pulls the face plate off, examines the inside.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And damaged the circuits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<PAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, then I don't know how they got in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAM>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They had to have known the code.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
She moves on to look in the mark's BEDROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(calls to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We considered that, but the mark swears that nobody in the world knew the code except him. He programmed the last seven steps of the system himself. He set it and never left the house again. When he dies, we'll probably have to physically cut all the power lines to the house to get it off line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Isabel examines the computer brain of the alarm system which was locked inside a titanium case in Vanderspeigle's bedroom closet. She answers the detective almost as an afterthought.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are other ways to get the code.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Closed loop. Redundant servers. Titanium encasement. Not bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
The lead detective enters the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Again, Isabel is inside her own mind. She's really just answering the detective's questions out of courtesy.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh...well, they probably set up in a house across the canal and watched him type the code in through a pair of binoculars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
We GO WITH HIM as he walks back into the office. He stands at the alarm panel and pretends to type in the code. He twists around and looks out the window behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(calling to Isabel in the bedroom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I don't know about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Isabel re-enters the office.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unless he had a habit of typing in the code like this--
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
He stands to the side of the panel and reaches over to type in the numbers. It's an obviously unnatural position. Then he moves in front of the panel and types in the code as one normally would.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--then his body would block the view from across the canal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why they probably set up over there--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
She points out an adjacent window on another wall.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--And used the mirror.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
She points at a small mirror on the opposite wall. The detective bends down so his eye is at the level of the keypad, then he looks in the mirror. He can see directly across the canal into another house.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm guessing they'd need a fifteen hundred millimeter lens to get a clear shot but--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
But Isabel's already moved on. Something has caught her attention just above the alarm panel: a patch of paint that is shinier than the paint that surrounds it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Isabel puts her finger to her tongue to wet it, then touches the shiny area. When she pulls her finger away there is paint on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Isabel cocks her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A black-clad thief (LINUS) uses a paint brush to touch up the wall above the alarm keypad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE -- THE CRIME SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lead detective watches Isabel intently.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Isabel uses the blunt end of a letter opener from Vanderspeigle's desk to gently dig at the wall under the paint. The plaster there is soft and wet. In fact it isn't plaster at all. It's spackle.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Isabel cooks her head again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUNK! A crossbow bolt hits the wall above the alarm panel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE -- THE CRIME SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's where the crossbow bolt hit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A crossbow bolt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever heard of Franz Schuman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Isabel is at the window. The one that Vanderspeigle leaves cracked open every night. Isabel looks across the canal at the apartment where Basher and Saul were playing cards.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They would have fired from that roof. Through this open window.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
Isabel kneels down, checks the line-of-sight to make sure she's correct.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From that roof, through this window? Nobody could make a shot like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a cop, anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that supposed to mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. Your friend downstairs put me in a bad mood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's an idiot. You shouldn't let him bother you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. You're right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
Isabel pulls out a notepad and writes the name: "Eugene `Basher' Tarr." There are two names above Basher's in her little book: "Robert Ryan" and "Danny Ocean."
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But these man are exceptionally good. Even when they make mistakes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bolt flies through Vanderspeigle's open window and hits the wall above the alarm pad. Two thin wires are attached to a tiny wheel, which is attached to the back of the bolt. The wires run back to the window of the apartment across the canal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside that apartment: the wires end in another tiny wheel which is mounted on a large tripod for stability.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In effect the group now has a mini-clothesline running between the alarm pad and the apartment across the canal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Livingston attaches a device designed to fit directly over the number pad of Vanderspeigle's keypad to the "clothesline" that runs across the canal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE -- THE CRIME SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Isabel writes: "Livingston Dell?" Underneath Basher's name in her notebook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Livingston's device is shuttled across the canal, through Vanderspeigle's cracked window and right to the alarm panel. Magnets on the side of the device cause it to snap into place over the top of the keypad. Livingston then types a six- digit code into a remote keypad. His keypunches are mimicked by the remote device. Vanderspeigle's alarm shuts off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Downstairs: From inside we see the front door lock picked. The door swings open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE -- THE CRIME SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Isabel nods her head. There's a slight smile on her face. The smile of admiration, respect in another's skills.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did he get up and notice the certificate was gone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The alarm woke him at 4:2O am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the alarm would have been--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
She stops. And smiles to herself.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... Oh, I know what happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Isabel quickly glances around the room. Her eye lands on the floor near the false bookcase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On some dark lines in the crevices where the floor boards meet. She kneels down for a closer look.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was someone else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny and Rusty come through the front door. They are followed by Linus. All of them are soaking wet from 24 hours in the swamp under the house, and the last few minutes in the pouring rain outside the front door. The group silently slips up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I wish I could've have seen that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VANDERSPEIGLE OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They enter Vanderspeigle's office. You can hear him snoring in the other room. Danny and Rusty quickly, carefully remove the crossbow bolt from the wall and take it to the window. They drop it (and the attached wires) to the Malloys, who are waiting on the street below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile Linus spackles the hole in the wall and paints over the spackle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny and Rusty turn to see that Linus is finished. They hand-signal each other like Special Forces guys do, then move towards the bookcase on the adjacent wall.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That must have really been something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! Wait! Shhhh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone freezes. Danny puts his hand up to his ear to try to listen for the sound he thought he heard. We hear the faint sound of somebody singing to themselves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny and Rusty quickly realize it's coming from behind the bookcase. What the hell?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They yank open the false bookcase to reveal a handsome Frenchman who has just finished cleaning out the contents of Vanderspeigle's safe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny and Rusty stare at him. He turns around and sees them, but if he's bothered in the slightest he sure isn't showing it. Danny approaches him. This exchange is whispered with a great amount of drama at very close range.
</DIRECTION>
<DINNER_JACKET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINNER_JACKET>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. What the hell are you doing?

	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DINNER_JACKET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's thirty seconds. How could I know which exact thirty seconds I had? Unless I knew you plan. Could I have known your plan? Do you have a snitch in your group?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINNER_JACKET>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

</DANNY>
<RUSTY>

	We don't.

</RUSTY>
<DINNER_JACKET>

	Yes, I know you don't. Because I saw, the whole thing from that chair. I knew you were around, but I had my own plan.

Yen says something in Chinese.
</DIRECTION>
<DINNER_JACKET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's really no need for that.

</DINNER_JACKET>
<DIRECTION>
Danny wants to raise his voice, but he can't. Vanderspeigle is snoring twenty feet away.

<DINNER_JACKET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the situation is not reversed. The situation is that I am here first, without any help from you.

Livingston arrives, soaking wet like everyone else.
</DIRECTION>
<DINNER_JACKET>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Basher and Saul arrive.

Dinner Jacket stops. Thinks for a moment. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<DINNER_JACKET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. But: I leave you with something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINNER_JACKET>
<DIRECTION>
He hands Danny a business card.
</DIRECTION>
<DINNER_JACKET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My attorney. In case Evelyn's employer tries anything...well, anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINNER_JACKET>

Dinner Jacket smiles, then pulls a tiny electronic device out of his shirt pocket. He presses a button.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the alarm blares to life.

We LOOK through a one-way mirror into the interrogation room where detectives Onderdonk and Devenpeck are trying the bad cop / bad cop routine on Evelyn.

Isabel walks INTO FRAME and watches: Onderdonk slams his fist on the table. Davenpeck shouts in Evelyn's face. Evelyn just laughs.
</DIRECTION>

Isabel shakes her head.

Frustrated and more exhausted than their detainee, the two detectives leave the interrogation room for the ante-room where Isabel is.

	Here's what I'm going to do. You tell me the name of your mentor. I'll call him up and I'll tell him that you're the greatest thief in the world...that I accept that to be true.... And in return...you leave us alone, let us go about our business. How about that?

Years ago. Isabel's sitting at the very same cafe reading the newspaper when she hears frantic police whistles. She looks up to see a man running down the street at full bore. As he gets closer we realize it's Rusty. Eight cops are chasing him. Rusty rushes past the cafe. As he does he notices Isabel, they make eye contact. Then he's gone. Sprints around the corner. The cops rush past her. She hears sirens converging from all directions.

Rusty, all cleaned up now, dressed in a perfectly-tailored suit, sits down three tables away from her. She stares at him. Can't believe it. The brazenness. The audacity of this guy. Rusty doesn't seem to have a care in the world as he chats easily with the waiter, in Italian. Finally, Isabel just can't help herself. She gets up and walks over to Rusty's table.

Tess, as Julia Roberts, steps out of a Mercedes limo wearing sunglasses and carrying a puppy. Frank and Basher, as Nation of Islam bodyguards, clear a place in front of her. Reuben trails, dressed in the latest hip-hop clothes.

A throng of fans and paparazzi rush toward her. Strobes blind us. Fans scream out her name, thrust paper and pen at her for autographs. It's a frigging madhouse.

INTERCUT -- INT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY

Saul, Frank, and Rusty clench teeth and fists... On pins and needles for a moment. If the museum director agrees they're in big trouble.

The guys relax back into the couches, their plan narrowly having escaped disaster.

PULL BACK to REVEAL Toulour, sitting in a warehouse of his own, watching his own surveillance footage of both our guys' warehouse and the museum's closed circuit system.

INT. RUSTY'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

ON Rusty -- the blue light of an unseen television reflecting off his face. He walks onto the balcony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAVY TRANSITION TO FLASHBACK:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow Rusty down a hallway. He enters a dark apartment. Slips silently through the dining room. Two places are set. A candle on the table is burned down to almost nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights are out here too. But Isabel's still awake. Rusty enters the room. She doesn't look at him

</RUSTY>
<DIRECTION>
Isabel turns to look at Rusty. She can barely see the outline of his face in the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>

	What are you saying? What the hell are you saying? Where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>

</RUSTY>
<DIRECTION>
Isabel stares at his dark face.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When people start talking the way you're talking there are only two possibilities: you're either in intelligence or you're a criminal. And no one I work with has ever worked with you...or even knows your name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>

</RUSTY>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her then leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. APARTMENT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside the front of the apartment, he shuts the door and turns toward us. We see his face in the light for the first time: His left eye is swollen shut. Blood is caked into his hair and on his cheek. Somebody beat the shit out of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK IN THE PRESENT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rusty is still on the balcony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a knock at the door. He opens it to see Isabel.

	Don't do this.

	LeMarc quit because he was 75 years old, Isabel. He was tired. His doctor told him if he didn't start taking it easy he was going to have another heart attack. You're dramatizing it.

</RUSTY>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know why LeMarc retired, any better than I do. You have no idea.

Rusty goes silent, looks out at the lights of the city.

Rusty watches her go. Several seconds, then:

FLASHBACK -- INT. APARTMENT BUILDING -- ROME -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rusty carries a huge bouquet of flowers up the stairs to the front door of his apartment with Isabel. It's a perfect sunny day outside. He unlocks the door quietly and swings it open to see the apartment is bare. The furniture is still there. But nothing else. Nothing on the walls or the shelves. Isabel has clearly moved out. Rusty's whole body reacts.... He slowly looks around him, as if in a dream. His eye goes to the dining room table. Isabel's engagement ring is there.
</DIRECTION>

	You can tell me, I won't tell a soul. Because if you say it's instinctual, I'm quitting right now. Seriously. The way you parted your hair? That was so connected. And that scene with the matches?

INT. GALLERY CONTAINING THE CORONATION EGG -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Julia" enters and walks up to the egg. Her entourage follows.
</DIRECTION>
<TESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's so beautiful. My God.

<DIRECTION>
Topher looks at the egg--
</DIRECTION>
<TOPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kinda small.

INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE MUSEUM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rusty ponders a painting like college student trying to impress his art history professor. Finally he moves on, into another gallery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN to REVEAL nine uniformed cops trailing behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GALLERY CONTAINING THE CORONATION EGG -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yen ENTERS FRAME -- dressed like a pretentious grunge rocker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He whispers Chinese into a bullhorn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theoretically he's speaking to his crew (Danny, Saul, and Livingston in lame disguises) telling them where to set up the camera, lights, and flags.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each "crew member" carries an odd-looking oversized "light meter". Upon closer examination we can see that each device has a small TV screen on it -- which is tapped into the museum's closed circuit system. The guys are carefully placing their flags and lights so as to block the view of the egg from each of the eight cameras on the ceiling of the gallery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Studio Execs," Reuben and Linus go to "Julia."
</DIRECTION>
<REUBEN>

Yen stands on two apple boxes to shoot photos of "Julia" and Topher. "Julia" looks ridiculously stiff and keeps putting her hands up to block her ears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Topher keeps shooting glances at Danny, who is moving around flags and lights, ostensibly in accordance with Yen's Chinese language orders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julia sees Topher's expression -- he recognizes Danny from somewhere...
</DIRECTION>
<JULIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, thanks everybody. Thank you so much.

	Yeah, well, with everything thing you've been going through I can see how you'd need something.

	</DIALOGUE>
</TOPHER>
<DIRECTION>
They are interrupted by the sound of PIERCING SIRENS and CLANGING BELLS -- all manner of alarms coming from the gallery containing the egg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tess rushes back to the gallery just in time to see police officers pin Danny and his entire crew on the floor and against walls and start handcuffing them. She freezes. Can't move.... Her bodyguards (Frank and Basher ) grab her and move her quickly out of the area.

Three massive Ford Excursion SUV's with diplomatic plates double park out front, completely blocking the flow of traffic on the narrow street.

INT. "OBSERVATION "HALLWAY -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly swaggers down a hallway, followed by Isabel and Giordano. She stops at an observation window and looks through it to see Danny, who is handcuffed to a chair, awaiting interrogation. His expression is impassive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She moves on to the next window: Yen. Same impassive expression. She continues down the line, Reuben, Livingston, and Saul. Each has the same impassive expression. Through the final window she sees Linus...
</DIRECTION>

He's nervously tapping his foot. Molly smiles sadistically.

	When people think of Italy they think of food, wine, the Renaissance. They don't realize Italy has the scariest prisons in the civilized world. You know why? They're all leftover from the Middle Ages. They're worse than dirty; they're damp. They're like caves.

	So I think if you really analyze it, you can see that it's inevitable. It's time for us to evolve, en masse. I have to help bring that about whatever way I can, you know. Otherwise, the trajectory is fixed. You know what I'm saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASHER>
<SAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmm. Yes. But I'm through evolving, I think. It's too tiring. I feel pretty evolved. You know, considering.

	<DIALOGUE>
	All in all, it was depressingly familiar. The forced camaraderie, the hollow smiles. Scared to take a moment's reflection. Scared to imagine a different life. We behaved like boys.
