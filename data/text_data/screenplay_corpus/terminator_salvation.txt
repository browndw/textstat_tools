INT. DEATH ROW/CELL - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPER ON BLACK:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONGVIEW STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY, TEXAS, 2003.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
START TIGHT ON MARCUS WRIGHT. He's an intense, powerful man, 20's-30's, his head shaven. Marcus stares INTO CAMERA with a resigned expression. We hear the voice of a PRIEST:
</DIRECTION>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art beside me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK, straight up. MARCUS lies in his cot, staring at the ceiling. He's smoking a CIGARETTE. This OVERHEAD ANGLE reveals a PRIEST with a BIBLE, in a folding chair beside him. A CHESS SET, stacks of BOOKS, WRITING MATERIALS in the cell. TWO GUARDS wait, shackles in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS has no interest in scripture. He blows a cloud of SMOKE which drifts in the direction of the PRIEST, who blinks and shuts his bible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the GUARDS unlocks the cell door for--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DR. SERENA KOGAN. She's in her 30's-50's, brilliant, attractive, but thin and pale, a scarf tied around her head. She carries a CLIPBOARD. The PRIEST backs off to give her some privacy with Marcus.
</DIRECTION>
<SERENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marcus-- I'm Doctor Serena Kogan, I'm with Project Angel. You consented to donate your body to science...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERENA>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm pretty much done with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<SERENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been chosen for our research.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERENA>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chosen? Lucky me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<SERENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We just need a couple of signatures...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERENA>
<DIRECTION>
Marcus sits up, she passes him the clipboard and pen-- he notes that her hands are SHAKING.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't need to be scared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<SERENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not. It's nerve degeneration.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERENA>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS looks up from the form, takes in the scarf covering her sparse hair.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cancer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<SERENA>
<DIRECTION>
(NODS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not the only one with a death sentence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERENA>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS meets her eyes. She studies him a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<SERENA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you're doing is important, Marcus. Our work is still highly experimental... but you may be helping people in ways you can't begin to imagine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERENA>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a regular hero.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
With that sarcastic comment, he SIGNS HIS NAME-- we see the words "PROJECT ANGEL" at the top of DENSE TYPE on the form.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERENA takes the clipboard, starts to rise. She touches his hand for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<SERENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. And... I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERENA>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one lives forever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
THE GUARD sees SERENA out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DEATH ROW/CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE - MARCUS' CHAINED ANKLES clank as the GUARDS lead him down the corridor, past PRISONERS in their cells; some avert their eyes, others give a nod or raise a fist.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marcus, this is your last opportunity to make a confession...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS stares straight ahead, taking deep, steady breaths, struggling not to succumb to fear.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there nothing you would say to Officer Martinez' family?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DEATH ROW/EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - BUCKLES TIGHTEN... AN ALCOHOL SWAB on MARCUS' FOREARM... A NEEDLE punctures his skin.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can I say. I was seventeen, I was angry, I was stupid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
FINGERS turn the VALVE to release the LETHAL CHEMICALS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MARCUS' EYES, looking up toward--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DEADLY I.V., running into his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From this, he looks toward--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS REFLECTION in a one-way mirror, the dim shapes of WITNESSES beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... I'm sorry about it. I'm sorry about everything. The whole goddamn world...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
As the lethal injection takes hold, his POV moves to BRIGHT LIGHTS overhead, losing FOCUS and BLEACHING TO WHITE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the WHITE SCREEN, a FACE emerges, backlit, blurred-- it's SERENA. She's in focus for just a moment, leaning INTO CAMERA-- then moves OUT OF FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPER ON BLACK:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUTH-CENTRAL SECTOR, NORTH AMERICA, 2018
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CORNFIELD - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORNSTALKS as far as the eye can see, rustling in a summer breeze. FIGURES are moving within the FIELD. We only make them out in SILHOUETTE, but all carry HEAVY RIFLES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A-10 COCKPIT - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A COMPUTER TARGETING SCREEN - the FIGURES are HIGHLIGHTED in this tactical display, as is an OCTAGONAL HATCH into the ground beneath the corn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CORNFIELD - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FIGURES in the corn look up-- we hear an AIRCRAFT APPROACH with a JET WHINE--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FWOOM! A MASSIVE CONCUSSION as a BUNKER-BUSTING MISSILE BORES into the earth at high-velocity, burrowing deep--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--then a HUGE BLAST - FLAME and DIRT are thrown high in the air, many of the FIGURES blown sky-high.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FLAMING BODY hits the ground IN FG, FACE TO CAMERA... we now see it was a STEEL TERMINATOR-- its METAL SKULL BLOWN OPEN and SCORCHED, its RED EYES SHATTERED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A-10 WARTHOGS-- stubby attack planes-- SCREAM from the sky, RAKING THE REMAINING FIGURES with CANNON FIRE, BLASTING THEM to bits. These aircraft no longer bear traditional U.S. insignia-- they're painted in WILD COLORS, graffiti lettering says things like: "BOT BLASTER," "KILL FOR CONNOR," "RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINES," etc... Resistance fighters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Motley military and civilian CHOPPERS LAND in the CORNFIELD, disgorging RESISTANCE SOLDIERS. These are human troops in high-tech HELMETS, carrying slightly futuristic conventional ASSAULT WEAPONS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WARTHOGS veer off, laying NAPALM in the distance behind the SOLDIERS. The troops run toward--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--AN OPENING which has been blown into the ground, the remains of the octagonal hatch where the bunker-buster hit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A surviving TERMINATOR rises from the SINGED CORN, FIRES its PLASMA RIFLE--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--DROPPING A SOLDIER. His comrades FIRE EXPLOSIVE BULLETS-- and BLOW THE ROBOT APART. The LEADER of this assault group waves his soldiers to enter the dark hatchway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY/CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLLAPSED CEILINGS, FLAMES, a high-tech installation in ruins; RED LIGHTING, distinctive of Skynet environments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOLDIERS flick on HELMET LAMPS and make their way carefully inside-- pretty deserted. They kick aside rubble to enter--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY/ROBOTIC ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HELMET BEAMS play over BANKS OF ELECTRONICS and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--a dozen fixed, INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS-- not remotely HUMANOID-- engaged in mysterious tasks, mechanical arms at work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SOLDIERS rake the room with GUNFIRE-- MACHINERY collapses, SPARKS from EXPLODING CIRCUITRY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY/CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deeper into the complex, A HEAVY DOOR BLOWS off its hinges.
</DIRECTION>
<TEAM_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clear!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEAM_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
SOLDIERS move from cover and through the blown door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY/STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TUBES and FIBER-OPTIC CABLES run into DOZENS OF GLASS CYLINDERS filled with translucent PINK LIQUID. The SOLDIERS make their way in, alert-- but nothing's moving in here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TEAM LEADER peers into a cylinder, aims his HEADLAMP at--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--A small MASS OF TISSUE floating inside, connected to a dense network of FIBER-OPTIC CABLES... it's a HUMAN BRAIN.
</DIRECTION>
<TEAM_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEAM_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
THE TEAM LEADER recoils-- but before he can say more, the ROOM SHAKES with a DEAFENING ROAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CORNFIELD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge ESCAPE SHIP rises straight up from an open HATCHWAY. Nearby TROOPS crouch and FIRE after it. THE SHIP PIVOTS in mid-air and ROARS OFF, SOLDIERS dodging the ENGINE BLAST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY/STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TEAM LEADER speaks into his headset. The OTHER SOLDIERS inspect the many CYLINDERS, react in horror and shock.
</DIRECTION>
<TEAM_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will not believe the shit we found down here--
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEAM_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
As he speaks, CAMERA FINDS a GREEN LED on the ceiling-- which suddenly FLASHES RED and BLINKS RAPIDLY--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CORNFIELD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE - AN IMMENSE SUBTERRANEAN BLAST causes a few hundred yards square to SWELL and then COLLAPSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JETS of FLAME, SMOKE and DIRT RISE in the aftermath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHOPPER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PANICKED PILOT on the radio:
</DIRECTION>
<PILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--repeat, that was not us! A ship escaped, they musta blown the place themselves! Jesus, a lot of our guys were still down there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CORNFIELD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOLDIERS above ground help the WOUNDED to EVAC CHOPPERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN FG, FIND the STEEL SKULL of the dead TERMINATOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CORNFIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAME ANGLE-- the TERMINATOR now half-sunk in mud. A FIELD MOUSE has nested in its skull cavity, seeking shelter from RAINDROPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Months have passed, the season changed-- CORN long dead, a black stubble. RAIN falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PATCH OF MUD stirs-- something below is moving. The MUD roils, seeming to assume a HUMAN SHAPE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EYES OPEN, looking around in shock, the naked FIGURE is so drenched in mud we can't recognize it at first. The figure rises, looks up at the sky, and FALLING RAIN washes away mud from his face... it's MARCUS WRIGHT. He opens his mouth, makes a few GUTTURAL NOISES... then SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS UP from MARCUS' AGONIZED FACE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLATEAU - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARE FEET trudge through the dirt. MARCUS moves along a slight rise, wrapped in torn and filthy RAGS, mud caked on his body. Eerie silence. Reaching the edge of a rise, he sees in the distance--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DECIMATED CITY, buildings collapsed into rubble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DEAD CITY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOONLIGHT. THE SKELETON of a large DOG lies on the ground, partially covered by a dusting of SNOW. It still bears a rotting COLLAR attached to a CHAIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE to a CHAIN-LINK FENCE, partially collapsed, a singed, faded sign: "BEWARE OF DOG."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER, we're in the low-rent district of this CITY IN RUINS-- rubble, random walls still stand. Hulks of cars, rusted, windowless. It's been over a decade since the bombs fell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS is the only thing alive here. He moves down this block, picks up a handful of SNOW, brings it to his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A COLLAPSED NEWSSTAND. MARCUS walks past the racks, picks up a MAGAZINE which crumbles in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HUMAN SKELETON, clothes in tatters, is half-buried behind the collapsed counter. There's a bulge in its shirt pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS gingerly reaches into the pocket and fishes out a cellophane-wrapped PACK OF CIGARETTES and a butane LIGHTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS sits on a piece of rubble by the skeleton. He tears open the packet and puts a dried-out, stale cigarette to his lips, tries the lighter a few times, finally gets a flame. He lights the cig, inhales deeply-- he waits for a rush, feels nothing. He takes a few more drags, increasingly disappointed, then flicks the cigarette away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rises, looks toward a caved-in STOREFRONT, makes out a clothing store's TATTERED SIGN on the ground, amidst broken glass: "SALE! GOING OUT OF BUSINESS! EVERYTHING MUST GO!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUINED CLOTHING STORE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FALLEN RACKS, CLOTHES and SHOES covered in years of dust and rubble. MARCUS, grateful to be rid of the rags, has pulled on jeans and sneakers, using the CIGARETTE LIGHTER for illumination. He kicks away some FALLEN CEILING TILES from a RACK OF ARMY JACKETS. He holds one up-- looks good.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUINED BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Partially collapsed, a downscale watering hole. Broken stools, booths, a dead pinball machine. MARCUS, dressed now, again using the LIGHTER to find his way, sorts through the broken glass and rubble behind the bar, comes up with--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DUSTY BOTTLE OF WHISKY.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hallelujah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
He unscrews the cap, raises the bottle to a SKELETON on the floor nearby. Marcus takes a long pull-- and CHOKES, instantly dizzy. He sinks to the floor, passing out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEMORY MONTAGE: quick, fragmentary, impressionistic POVs, blurred, altered. SFX of HEARTBEATS, a RESPIRATOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--WEBS of TUBES and FIBER-OPTICS FILLS THE FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--GRIDS OF LASER LIGHT scan rapidly INTO CAMERA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--DIGITAL DISPLAYS blink through murky LIQUID. SERENA moves INTO FRAME, a look of concentration on her face as she peers through the LIQUID, INTO CAMERA. She starts to smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DEAD CITY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLUE SKY. TILT DOWN to find MARCUS, who plods on through the dead city's outskirts. He pauses near a collapsed BUS KIOSK. A SMILING WOMAN stares out at him from a faded ADVERTISEMENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS studies the woman. She's nothing like Serena, but her expression recalls the beckoning vision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs his hand over the image of her face, pulls away a chunk of cracked, graffitied GLASS over the poster. Then he carefully tears the poster to remove the woman's face, folds the paper, slips it in a pocket and continues on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deserted, CAR HULKS about, crumbling SKELETONS at the wheels. MARCUS moves down the center of the freeway on this MOONLIT NIGHT, paying little attention to anything around him. We're in mostly flat, treeless plains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the opposite direction, FIGURES approach, moving through the darkness. Marcus hurries excitedly toward them, the first living creatures he's seen. He waves.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Yo, over here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
The FIGURES pause, turning toward him in unison.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it's good to see you guys, I felt like I was the last man on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
He freezes in his tracks. These aren't humans. They're T- 400s-- PLASTIC-SKINNED TERMINATORS-- armed with PLASMA RIFLES. They wear a motley collection of found CLOTHING, but their male humanoid faces are identical, unnatural and motionless, like masks. Their EYES FLICKER RED as they scan him.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
Marcus backs away, runs. The T-400s stare after him-- but don't fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE THROUGH BINOCULAR MASK - MARCUS running for all he's worth, heading toward the viewer. We hear a muttering VOICE:
</DIRECTION>
<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey mister, where you goin' in such a hurry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON A BOY, scrawny and filthy, in his early to mid teens. He crouches on the supports of a FREEWAY SIGN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wears layers of TATTERED, OVER-SIZED CLOTHING. He scrambles quickly down from the sign.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT AN OFF-RAMP, Marcus' pace slows as he moves to get off the freeway, when--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BOY emerges from behind some RUBBLE, holding a HANDGUN in one hand, a lit OIL LANTERN in the other.
</DIRECTION>
<BOY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoah, whoah-- hang on there. Got any food?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<DIRECTION>
Marcus raises his hands, shakes his head. The boy looks him over dubiously.
</DIRECTION>
<BOY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look like you been eating pretty good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<DIRECTION>
The boy moves closer, puts down the LANTERN, frisks Marcus with one hand while holding the gun on him with the other.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're human... you can see me, you can touch me. This place is real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
THE BOY makes a dubious face, yanks a handful of PAPER SCRAPS from Marcus' pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I was in hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<BOY>
<DIRECTION>
(raises an eyebrow)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This sure ain't heaven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those things with masks, red eyes--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<BOY>
<DIRECTION>
(CASUALLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terminators-- T-400s. What is this stuff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<DIRECTION>
THE BOY unfolds the paper scraps in the LANTERN LIGHT--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON PAPER SCRAPS - the WOMAN'S FACE from the poster, a fragment of a MODEL'S PHOTO from a MAGAZINE AD, a painting of a FEMALE FACE from a PAPERBACK COVER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BOY looks puzzled, intrigued by the pictures. But with sudden speed, MARCUS GRABS THE BOY'S GUN HAND and wrenches it hard-- it FIRES into the air. MARCUS gets control of the gun, wraps one arm around the boy's throat.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I'm not in hell, where am I?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<BOY>
<DIRECTION>
(CHOKING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Texas!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<DIRECTION>
The NOISE of a SHOTGUN PUMPING close behind MARCUS--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS spins to face his attacker, pressing the handgun into the boy's cheek. He's face to face with--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GIRL, a couple of years younger than the BOY, training the shotgun at Marcus' head-- she looks ready to shoot.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First put down the shotgun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
THE GIRL shakes her head angrily. She wears an aged, beloved BASEBALL CAP with a STAR on it.
</DIRECTION>
<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do what he says.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll kill us both!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't wanna kill anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it, Star. Put it down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head slightly, aiming carefully at Marcus' head, just a few feet away, a slight smile on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was only one bullet in that gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS hooks his foot around the oil lantern and deftly--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--BOOTS IT at the GIRL. BURNING OIL spills across her leg, she cries out and fumbles the shotgun. MARCUS tosses the BOY at her, the two of them SPRAWL on the ground, the shotgun falling to one side--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS quickly snatches up the shotgun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using SNOW, the BOY helps the GIRL extinguish the flames from her clothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS stands over the kids with a gun in each hand. He struggles to control anger, speaks quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like it when people point guns at me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't loaded.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS quickly checks the chambers of both the shotgun and handgun-- indeed, both are empty.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You took on a guy like me with one bullet and an empty shotgun?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(studies them admiringly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty stupid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
He shoves the handgun in his belt, puts the shotgun down and kneels to pick up fallen scraps of paper-- a few have caught FIRE and are incinerated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BOY and GIRL get to their feet, stare at Marcus.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I have my gun back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS shrugs, gestures for her to pick it up. He still looks at the PICTURES in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd you get those?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the city.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<BOY>
<DIRECTION>
(steps away from him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The city? Oh man. That place is red hot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
(a small smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seemed kinda dead to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No-- radiation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<DIRECTION>
A SPOTLIGHT appears in the distance-- a ROVING HUNTER-KILLER moving in their direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quickly, automatically, the kids dive for cover behind a WALL OF DEBRIS. MARCUS looks toward the LIGHT, unaware of danger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BOY bolts from behind cover, grabs MARCUS by the arm--
</DIRECTION>
<BOY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get down, they've seen the light!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<DIRECTION>
He drags Marcus back behind the debris wall, just in time--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the H-K nears, the LIGHT FINDS the BURNING OIL. It FIRES BLUE PULSES, which CHEW up the asphalt nearby-- then it moves on, failing to pick out the humans. Marcus is dumbfounded.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That wasn't a helicopter...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an H-K-- hunter-killer. Where the hell have you been?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rads musta fried his brains. Let's go, Kyle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
The H-K has vanished in the distance. The girl rises. The boy-- KYLE-- shakes his head, stays at Marcus' side.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
(after a beat)

A MEXICAN FAST FOOD JOINT, windows broken, sign collapsed, near a two-story MOTEL with a COVERED CARPORT. The pavement is CRACKED, the structures WEATHERED, abandoned for a decade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS, KYLE and STAR suddenly rise from a hiding spot by a DUMPSTER in a parking area. KYLE scans the FAST-FOOD PLACE with the binoculars, while STAR studies a WATCH she carries.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Eyeball. Only one.

</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
They drop down again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE AEROSTAT patrols the area. It's a surveillance drone the size of a softball, shiny steel, an inset camera lens with a RED GLOW. It flies in a geometric pattern, hovering every few seconds before continuing on. It vanishes around the corner of the fast-food joint, moving in the direction of the motel. STAR has been timing its moves.

THROUGH A DIRTY WINDOW, they see the AEROSTAT buzz past, flying its pattern. It moves on without spotting them, then takes off in a new direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KYLE and STAR set to searching the place, something they've done many times. They go through trash cans, check behind the counters and in the kitchen. MARCUS gets up, still looking out the windows.

They both hop out of the Jeep, running toward the GARAGE, each carrying their unloaded GUNS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH ANGLE - from BEHIND THE RUSTING SIGN, an AEROSTAT appears, aimed at the kids, LIGHTS BLINKING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SERVICE STATION - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KYLE and STAR slither under a partially open GARAGE DOOR. The space is dark, SMOKE-FILLED... STRIPS OF DRIED MEAT hang from the hydraulic lift. The two youths look amazed and delighted. Kyle shoves the gun into his waistband, moves to the closest strip and PEELS OFF A PIECE, takes a tentative bite, then gnaws ravenously. Star leans the shotgun against the wall and follows suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS lifts the garage door and enters, DAWN LIGHT streaming in behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(mouth full)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who cares?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Marcus squints at something in the darkness. He takes a step forward, then grabs Star's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spit it out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<STAR>
<DIRECTION>
(CHEWING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's good!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR>
<DIRECTION>
Now KYLE reacts to what Marcus saw, GAGS and SPITS out meat. He's staring at--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--a dried, severed HUMAN HAND, resting on a GRILLE in the sunken SERVICE PIT, where a CHARCOAL FIRE smolders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Star sees it too, turns and RETCHES, just as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--three animal-like CANNIBALS emerge from the back of the garage-- two burly, ugly, unshaven MEN and a wild-eyed, unhealthy-looking WOMAN with matted hair. We'll call them PIG, BULL and COW. PIG grabs the SHOTGUN, BULL grabs KYLE and yanks the HANDGUN from his waistband.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COW grabs STAR, shoves her into the center of the garage, beside Kyle and Bull. Bull tosses the handgun to COW who keeps it trained on the kids, sizing them up.
</DIRECTION>
<COW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not much meat on `em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COW>
<DIRECTION>
PIG eyes Marcus, points the shotgun in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<PIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This one's fi-i-ine--
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIG>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS raises two fingers like a peace sign-- then shoves them into the barrels of the shotgun. PIG snorts and PULLS THE TRIGGER-- CLICK.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oops.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS yanks the gun away and tosses it aside, HEAD-BUTTS Pig, who staggers backward, BLOOD SPRAYING from his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COW points the unloaded HANDGUN at Marcus-- CLICK CLICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KYLE and STAR get free of BULL and dash for the exit, they're out of there in a flash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BULL CHARGES MARCUS, who dodges him, grabs the man and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--HURLS HIM HEAD FIRST into the CHARCOAL PIT-- his BODY SIZZLES against the coals, he SCREAMS and WRITHES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COW picks up an AXE with two hands and SWINGS it at MARCUS who GRABS the HANDLE with one hand and YANKS it away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COW knows she's met her match, turns and flees, heading out the way Kyle and Star went.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS advances on PIG and BULL, brandishing the AXE. Pig squirms back across the floor, wiping BLOOD from his face.
</DIRECTION>
<PIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We didn't kill `em! I swear to God, they was dead already, we wasn't gonna let `em rot--
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIG>
<DIRECTION>
BULL has scrambled out of the coal pit, but is in too much pain to rise.
</DIRECTION>
<BULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go `head, take as much as you want, we're on the same side here--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BULL>
<DIRECTION>
Marcus looks ready to finish them off-- but reacts to CRIES from outside, a loud MECHANICAL RUMBLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HARVESTER-- a GIANT INSECT-LIKE TERMINATOR-- is outside the station. Many times the size of a human being, MULTIPLE ARMS and LEGS sprout from its thorax, it has multiple CAMERA EYES on long, swiveling stalks-- it carries KYLE and STAR, the kids struggle frantically, caught in the harvester's jointed steel appendages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One unblinking EYE SCANS KYLE, another STAR; the harvester produces a NEEDLE from one of its arms, INJECTS the boy-- who instantly goes limp, unconscious. It does the same to STAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As COW emerges--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--THE HARVESTER SPRINGS on her, with startling speed. She SCREAMS as the enormous terminator hoists her into the air with the others, INJECTS her and begins moving toward--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--A TRANSPORT. This consists of CONTAINER resembling a semi- trailer or wheeled dumpster, attached within a FRAMEWORK that features movable ENGINE PODS and a mysterious ARMATURE at the front. A STEEL LID in the top of the container OPENS hydraulically, the Harvester DEPOSITS the HUMAN CAPTIVES inside, and the LID SLAMS SHUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS has emerged from the garage, still carrying the AXE. He stays low, hidden behind the tanker, watching as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--PIG and BULL flee through a back entrance to the garage, immediately attracting the attention of--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--the Harvester, which sets off in pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marcus comes to a decision. He SPRINTS into the open, toward the TRANSPORT, and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--CLAMBERS up the side, hitting the thing at full speed, using an engine pod to boost himself higher. He's still short but swings the AXE and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--hooks the AXE HEAD over the top of the container, like a grappling hook. He pulls himself up and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--crawls across the roof, to the LID. There's a barred, reinforced MESH PANEL here, through which he can see--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE IN TRANSPORT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--about TWENTY HUMAN PRISONERS, unconscious on the steel floor. Among them are KYLE and STAR. Star MOANS, opens her eyes briefly and sees--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--MARCUS' SILHOUETTE above her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes flutter shut again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS struggles to raise the sealed lid, but there's no purchase available, just a smooth seam. Suddenly--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--the TRANSPORT JERKS. MARCUS nearly loses his footing as the TRANSPORT STARTS ROLLING forward. He drops to his belly, seeing that the transport is approaching--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--the HARVESTER, which now carries PIG and BULL, both unconscious. THE LID OPENS and the Harvester DROPS the two men INSIDE-- but its camera eyes fail to register Marcus, who crouches behind the open lid. As the lid BEGINS TO CLOSE, the Harvester attaches to the armature at the front of the transport, making itself an aerodynamic part of the machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS THRUSTS THE HEAD OF THE AXE under the closing LID in order to prevent it from sealing. THE LID grinds against it, but remains ajar. A moment later--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--THE ENGINE PODS ROTATE DOWNWARD, FIRE and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--THE TRANSPORT LIFTS OFF THE GROUND. Within moments, the airborne dumpster has risen hundreds of feet in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AERIAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS moves to the edge, looks down in astonishment at the fallow plains far below. Looking to the side, he sees--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--A PAIR OF HUNTER KILLERS, swooping in quickly to provide an escort for the slower moving transport.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIND buffets Marcus, he hangs on for dear life. Clinging to the top of the transport, he slowly makes his way back toward the LID. As the transport BANKS, he almost loses his grasp, dangling for a moment before the craft rights itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS reaches under the jammed lid and pulls with all his might. This thing is really heavy, plus he's fighting the WIND BLAST. MARCUS hears something behind him--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HARVESTER has spotted him and is now prying itself loose from the armature. Also buffeted by the wind, it starts to move gingerly down the length of the transport toward Marcus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS must let the LID CLOSE. He snatches up the AXE, takes a couple of WHACKS at the thing, DENTING the metal, but doing no serious damage. The Harvester KNOCKS the weapon out of his hand, Marcus has no choice but to keep backing away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS is driven to the back of the transport. Struggling for handholds, he lowers himself out of sight, down the framework along the side, getting out of the wind. Suddenly--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--STEEL CLAWS WRAP around him FROM BELOW, YANK him downward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HARVESTER has crawled around the SIDE of the TRANSPORT, and under the BOTTOM, in order to GRAB HIM. The hideous machine now holds him in its clutches, hundreds of feet in the air, its CAMERA EYES fixed on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HARVESTER produces its needle, it's coming at his face-- but MARCUS frees one hand, grabs the syringe, managing to hold it back, inches from his skin. His strength is weakening, but as the Harvester makes its final thrust--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--he JERKS the NEEDLE to one side and it BENDS against one of the Harvester's own steel limbs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Undaunted, the creature crawls up the side of the transport, Marcus still in its clutches. It moves to the lid, which OPENS. It lets go of Marcus to drop him inside when--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--MARCUS seizes two of its appendages and swings up onto the harvester's back, where he--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--GRABS a couple of EYE STALKS, trying to RIP them from the harvester's thorax, LOOSE WIRES SPARK. The Harvester twists and thrashes, it's like he's a rodeo rider. A LIMB wraps around him, starting to CRUSH him in a vise-like grip, when SUDDENLY--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--CANNON FIRE RIPS through the towering HARVESTER, blowing its thorax to PIECES, barely MISSING MARCUS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PAIR OF A-10 WARTHOGS-- the same colorful ground attack aircraft we saw in the first battle-- ROAR PAST on either side of the transport.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CRIPPLED HARVESTER topples off the side of the transport, still clutching MARCUS and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--CATCHES on an ENGINE POD, the creature and Marcus both suspended in the air. THE HARVESTER ROASTS in the ENGINE BLAST, its CPU finally dies. Marcus is suspended below the engine, the steel limb RELEASES HIM, he has to cling to it now, to keep from falling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The HUNTER-KILLERS peel out in pursuit of the two Resistance planes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DOGFIGHT ensues between the much larger, more heavily armored H-Ks, and the smaller, more maneuverable WARTHOGS. CANNON FIRE CATCHES an H-K but has no effect. The H-Ks' BLUE PLASMA PULSES barely miss the planes, which loop and bank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An AIR-TO-AIR MISSILE STREAKS from a WARTHOG and BLASTS the ENGINE of an H-K. AN EXPLOSION, the thing starts flying erratically, heading downward and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--CRASHING to earth in a glorious FIREBALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AERIAL & RIVER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The planes are nearing a RIVER, bordered by sickly TREES. On the far banks, even from above, we see ominous MILITARY FORTIFICATIONS-- CONCRETE BUNKERS, ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS meanwhile, is trying to climb up the dead Harvester, avoid the ENGINE BLAST and find a handhold on the transport.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE A-10 that shot down the H-K comes around for another pass at the transport, but--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS at the far side of the river let out a VOLLEY of BLUE PLASMA-FIRE. The BURSTS arc toward the A-10, which swerves and climbs, but--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--PLASMA FIRE destroys a wing, the A-10 SPINS out of control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OTHER A-10 breaks off its dogfight with its H-K and speeds away from the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS is tantalizingly close to the upper lip of the transport, he reaches out and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--THE FRIED HARVESTER suddenly dislodges from the ENGINE POD, taking Marcus with it, into FREEFALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH MARCUS, plummeting downward toward earth, a hundred feet below, the transport continuing on its way above, crossing the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS' POV - the ground and treetops getting closer. At the last moment, his continuing forward momentum takes him OVER THE RIVER and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS and the DEAD HARVESTER HIT THE WATER, hard, vanishing below the surface with enormous SPLASHES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The surviving H-K and the TRANSPORT continue across the river into Skynet territory, vanishing in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA MOVES to FIND a PARACHUTE, drifting earthward on the unfortified side of the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVERBANK - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD ON LAPPING WATER for a beat. Then--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--MARCUS breaks the surface, staggering toward shore, he drops to his knees in the shallows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAKES APPEAR behind him. Hearing the water stir, Marcus turns to see numerous DARK SHAPES moving rapidly in on him, from different directions, FLASHES OF METAL visible beneath the surface. These are HYDROBOTS-- AQUATIC TERMINATORS-- but we don't get a good look at them (yet) and Marcus isn't sticking around. He scrambles for the riverbank and makes his way into the leafless trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TREES - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS moves past the trunks of bare trees, pauses, looks over the water in the direction the transport took.
</DIRECTION>
<BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yo! Up here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
BLAIR WILLIAMS, the helmeted pilot who ejected, hangs from the tangled remains of her parachute, caught in the trees about fifteen feet in the air above Marcus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS moves closer. Blair struggles to saw through her lines with a KNIFE.
</DIRECTION>
<BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
The LINES suddenly SNAP, Blair FALLS from the tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marcus' reflexes are fast as ever, he's beneath her in an instant and CATCHES HER. He holds her in his arms:
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Name's Marcus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<BLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can put me down now, Marcus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
He does so. Blair pulls off her helmet, her hair is short. She's in her 20s, pretty, petite but strong, a no-nonsense, battle-hardened member of the Resistance. She pulls a COMPASS from her flight suit, consults it briefly as she orients herself.
</DIRECTION>
<BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got an ELT, but I can't call for a rescue here. There's an outpost a few miles upriver-- not my favorite people in the world, but it's safe. Let's move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
Blair is already moving, Marcus hesitates, then points across the water.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm heading that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<BLAIR>

<BLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>

</BLAIR>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Couple of kids. They were in that flying dumpster--

(off his nod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ, we almost shot it down. There've been rumors about a concentration camp, but...

<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head, gestures toward the river.
</DIRECTION>
<BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't get across-- river's fulla hydrobots--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAIR>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hydrobots?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<BLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They can't see, but they have killer sonar. They'll attack anything that moves or makes a sound. Even if you get past them, you'd be dead before you covered a hundred yards. If the terminators don't get you, the fallout will-- heavy rads all the way to the Gulf coast, nothing can live there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
Marcus absorbs this, starts walking with her.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're with the Resistance.

</MARCUS>
<BLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lt. Blair Williams, I fly for what used to be the Air National Guard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
She puts a hand out, listening. She signals for him to lay low, behind a fallen tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEARBY-- a pair of T-1s on patrol rumble into view. They pause, scanning the area, chain-guns at the ready. They start to move toward BLAIR and MARCUS' hiding place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAIR quickly grabs a STONE and, staying down, hurls it as far away as she can--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE STONE strikes a few BRANCHES--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE T-1s suddenly turn in that direction, GUNS BLAZING--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WOODS in the immediate vicinity are torn to pieces by the GUNFIRE, small FIRES erupt from the incendiary bullets-- it's definitely overkill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE T-1s roll over to inspect the damage, out of view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAIR whispers:

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stupid bastards. Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
She and Marcus move away quickly, away from the trees. When they're a safe distance from the robots--
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know... this has gotta be some kind of, like, dream or hallucination. Like what happens to people right before they die...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
Blair SLUGS him hard, in the arm. He doesn't flinch, but he looks surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<BLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That snap you out of it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS shakes his head. They keep walking.

CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. MUTANT FOREST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MOON over a scrubby forest, trees just a few feet high. BLAIR and MARCUS seem like giants as they move among them. They've been talking a while, Blair's absorbing something.
</DIRECTION>
<BLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So let me get this straight, Marcus. There you are on death row, they stick a needle in your arm... and the next thing you know, you're here.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell for?

</BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
She's looking him over as she says this, it almost sounds flirtatious. Marcus changes the subject.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never seen trees like these.

</MARCUS>
<BLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Levels are tolerable now, but just. We can't spend the night here.

They start moving again. Marcus pauses, listens:
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<BLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't hear anything--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
Now they both hear an eerie HOWL, changing in pitch-- like a coyote on crack. More than one picks up the CHORUS.
</DIRECTION>
<BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Skindogs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls a SIDEARM, holds it at the ready as she starts running, away from the direction of the noise. Marcus keeps up at her side, looking behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH THE DOGS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We don't get a good look at them, but there's a pack of large BEASTS moving quickly through the undergrowth, gaining on the fleeing humans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAIR sees they won't outrun them. She spins, FIRES in the direction of the approaching PACK. Suddenly it's quiet-- the animals fan out, forming a circle around Blair and Marcus.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're surrounding us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK SHOTS of MUTANT EYES, glowing in the dark-- ENLARGED TEETH-- DARK, MASSIVE FORMS moving through the brush.
</DIRECTION>
<BLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're smart. And they don't scare easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
After a few tense beats, from the foliage--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SKINDOG leaps at BLAIR from behind-- it's hideous, the size of a Great Dane, hairless, with veiny, wrinkled skin and long, catlike CLAWS. Before Blair can react, MARCUS leaps between her and the dog, grabs the slavering creature by the throat. It SNAPS its ELONGATED TEETH at him, but he manages to BREAK its neck and hurl it toward--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO MORE SKINDOGS moving in for an attack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAIR FIRES a few SHOTS at the encroaching pack, we hear a few YELPS--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS protects her, effortlessly tosses a few more SKINDOGS aside, ignoring vicious bites and scratches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other SKINDOGS turn on dead and injured pack members, begin TEARING INTO THEM. There's an opening now, the two humans make a run for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAIR catches her breath, looking him over, seriously impressed by his strength and calm.

The TRANSPORT has landed amongst numerous CONTAINERS, CRANES and VEHICLES-- all is dimly lit, enveloped in a vague reddish HAZE. THE FLYING FRAMEWORK and ARMATURE detach from the TRANSPORT, and TAKE OFF into the air again-- leaving the trailer-like wheeled CONTAINER. Something resembling the CAB of a semi-truck backs into position, latching onto attachment points on the container.

INT. TRANSPORT - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
PRISONERS duck, try to dodge these things. But they quickly buzz from captive to captive, latching onto their arms-- we hear SCREAMS, see FLASHES OF LIGHT from the aerostats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KYLE tries to bat away an AEROSTAT, but its PINCERS latch onto his forearm. A SIZZLING SOUND-- Kyle CRIES OUT with the pain, a flash of RED LIGHT-- then the aerostat DETACHES and moves to its next victim.

STAR gets the same treatment from a different AEROSTAT. She moves to Kyle's side, tears in her eyes, sucking on her burned wrist to ease the pain.

MORRISON is bearded, long-haired, bleary-eyed, a middle-aged man in charge here. He sits up in bed, also beside A COUPLE OF WOMEN. This place has become an underground crash pad, communal living for about a dozen people-- Morrison and Barnes the only men, four or five WOMEN and quite a few CHILDREN of varying age.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARNES grunts, yanks the blanket off his bedmates, who CRY OUT in protest. He wraps it around himself, carries the candle as he steps around other SLEEPING FIGURES, makes his way toward a METAL STAIRCASE winding downward. Moments later, we hear a GAS ENGINE start up-- LIGHTS flicker on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is pretty grimy and run-down, but it was once a military environment. There's a BANK OF TV MONITORS against one wall, which COME TO LIFE. A couple of the WOMEN move toward the adjacent NURSERY AREA to tend to the babies-- one of them, LISA, moves to the TV MONITORS. She squints at one.

At one edge of the silo pit, near scaffolding and tool carts, SMALL CHILDREN have gathered to stare. Also there is BARNES-- he leans back, eyes closed, in a folding chair, with an RPG in his lap.

THE ADVISORS nod, pick up their papers and exit. As soon as they're gone, Connor sits wearily in a chair, tosses the X- rays and papers onto the table, his authoritative mask slipping. Kate touches his arm. He leans his head against her pregnant belly.

INT. OUTPOST/CORRIDOR & LAUNCH TUBE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS is marched down the corridor to the launch tube, Frankenstein-like, MORRISON holding the chains, keeping a safe distance from him, while BARNES keeps the RPG trained at Marcus' head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marcus shuffles awkwardly, the bolts hampering his ankles. It's reminiscent of his death walk at film's opening.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feels like I been here before... what are you gonna do to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<MORRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Los Angeles is sending a chopper-- seems you're some kind of VIP.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORRISON>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the edge of the SILO PIT-- a long drop, smooth walls, a long METAL LADDER leading down into darkness. MARCUS pauses by the ladder, holds up his bolted arms questioningly-- "now what?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At a look from Morrison, he and Barnes BODY-CHECK MARCUS at once, sending him flying over the edge--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS FALLS the thirty feet or so, strikes the concrete FLOOR of the launch tube with a sickening THUD, the CHAINS clattering down around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS is stunned, barely conscious as the LADDER is PULLED UPWARD. It's like the bottom of a well, twenty feet in diameter, sheer concrete walls, the floor BLACKENED from a rocket blast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE UP - his captors look down at him for a moment, then move out of view.

INT. TRANSPORT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA MOVES past the PRISONERS, a couple dozen total... An HISPANIC COUPLE huddle against one wall, whispering to each other IN SPANISH... COW rocks in despair, head in her hands, BULL and PIG mutter to each other nearby... an OLDER WOMAN prays, going through rosary beads... FIND STAR and KYLE. She's watching as KYLE uses his pocket knife to CARVE an image in the wall of the transport. He looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're stopping.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
The BACK PANEL rolls upward. CONTROL ROBOTS-- reminiscent of the treaded T-1s but without the heavy weaponry-- flank a path from the rear of the transport towards BRIGHT LIGHT up a RAMP a short distance away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PRISONERS instinctively move away from the robots, moving to the front of the container... until ZZZAP! BLUE ENERGY crackles across the floor. THE PRISONERS CRY OUT in pain at the electrified surface, and dash toward the opening at the rear, leaping out of the container.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE, as the prisoners run by, we hold a moment on Kyle's graffiti-- it's the STICK FIGURE IMAGES of KYLE and STAR we saw before, they both hold hands with a LARGER STICK FIGURE who stands between them, meant to be MARCUS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CONTAINER has stopped in a large subterranean space. There are numerous FUTURISTIC VEHICLES here-- hydrogen CARS, three-wheeled ATVs, electric BUSES. CONTROL `BOTS closest to the container start to close in on the huddling PRISONERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ROBOT BUMPS into BULL, sending another JOLT OF ELECTRICITY through his body, like a cattle prod. Everyone gets the picture, starts hurrying down the line, the ROBOTS closing around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COW looks around nervously, clearly freaking out. Spotting a gap between the robots, she bolts--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--a ROBOT SWIVELS and CUTS HER DOWN with an ENERGY BLAST. She lies still, SMOKE rising from her body.

The other PRISONERS pick up the pace.

The LIGHT emanates from FROSTED WINDOWS at the top of the RAMP, through which we make out the SILHOUETTES of human figures.

GLASS DOORS part ahead of the prisoners-- a stark white, sterile environment beyond. THE ROBOTS stop here. THE PRISONERS disappear inside... and the DOORS CLOSE.

BARNES remains on guard duty with the RPG, propped up on some cushions, a LANTERN by his side-- it's pretty late, the generator's shut down. He's reading an old, yellowed COMIC BOOK, he has a small stack at his side.

<BLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's it going, Barnes? Thought you might like a late-night snack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls a crumpled plastic PACKAGE out of a pocket of her flight suit-- ancient Hostess snack cakes. BARNES' eyes light up as he puts the RPG aside and grabs it.

So saying, he takes the bottle, unscrews the cap and takes a long pull. It's powerful hootch, he gasps for air, passes her the bottle as she sits beside him. She doesn't drink.

He pulls her close to him for a kiss. After a moment, she pulls away and moves to the corridor entrance. There's a large SLIDING STEEL DOOR here.

MARCUS leans against the wall in the dark, rolls out of the way as the LADDER drops. BLAIR descends quickly, the FLASHLIGHT in her belt, a battery BLADE SAW in one hand. She sets the flashlight on the ground and moves to his side--

THE BUZZING SAW BLADE sound-bridges to:

EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WHIR OF CHOPPER BLADES. A SPOTLIGHT shines over the low growth in the minefield as a BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER circles, coming in for a landing. WEAPONS RACKS are jury-rigged beside the spotlight, the chopper bristles with AUTOMATED CANNONS, MISSILES and NAPALM TANKS.
</DIRECTION>

THE SPOTLIGHT picks out the CONCRETE and STEEL CAP of the LAUNCH TUBE.

INT. OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT

THE SAW finishes cutting the BOLT between Marcus' legs; his arms are already free. The BUZZING cuts out, but now they hear the CHOPPER LANDING directly overhead.

BLAIR studies him a moment, no changing his mind. But she admires him. She starts up the ladder, MARCUS following.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARNES is still passed out as BLAIR and MARCUS ascend to the platform around the pit. They move to the sliding door--
</DIRECTION>

BLAIR starts to open it, but sees a LIGHT and hears VOICES and FOOTSTEPS at the far end, SLIDES IT SHUT again.

MARCUS points to a LARGE VENTILATION FAN behind STEEL GRATING, eight feet above them, on the far side of the pit. It's not running, but there's no way to get through it.

<BLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should lead out, but there's no way past the fan--

MARCUS is already picking up the RPG-- but he points it backwards, has no idea how to shoot it--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAIR grins, grabs the RPG from him-- then braces herself, takes aim and FIRES--

KABOOM! The EXPLOSION rips OPEN the GRATE, destroys the FAN.

INT. OUTPOST/CORRIDOR - NIGHT

MORRISON escorts a pair of powerful UNIFORMED SOLDIERS armed with HIGH-TECH RIFLES with explosive shells-- they react to the EXPLOSION beyond the closed door-- and break into a run, the soldiers readying their weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS and BLAIR have moved around the narrow walkway to the far end of the pit, beneath the SMOKING HOLE. Blair thinks of something, pulls a small DEVICE from her flight suit, the size of a pack of cigarettes, holds it toward Marcus.
</DIRECTION>
<BLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. My ELT-- emergency locator transmitter. If you find the camp, activate it like this. It could really help the Resistance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAIR>

She indicates a button. MARCUS takes the device--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

<DIRECTION>
MARCUS grabs the sharp, still smoking STEEL projecting from the hole and pulls himself upward as--

<DIRECTION>
THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN and the SOLDIERS open FIRE at MARCUS--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAIR hits the deck as EXPLOSIVE SHELLS tear HOLES in the CONCRETE--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--SHRAPNEL hits MARCUS in the back, he's thrown into the ventilation shaft--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VENTILATION SHAFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS has a CHUNK OF REBAR lodged in his left SHOULDER, but he doesn't even notice this yet. He picks himself up and moves quickly in the darkness, crouching in this cramped tube. There's a TURN up ahead, he just makes it as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An EXPLOSIVE SHELL rockets through the shaft behind him--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM! THE BLAST TEARS through the metal tube, DIRT POURS IN, blocking the tunnel from his pursuers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near the edge of the clearing, a low STEEL VENT with a peaked CAP. DENTS appear in it from within--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS finally PUNCHES his way out, pulls himself up and rolls onto the dirt-- for a moment he seems safe, laying low in the grass. Then--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--he registers the REBAR in his shoulder. It goes right through him, emerging from his chest. Marcus is stunned. With some effort, he YANKS OUT the REBAR and tosses it aside. TORN METAL of his steel endoskeleton is now exposed, along with a glimpse of circuitry. Marcus reels, puts a hand over the hole in his chest where a heart should be; he really isn't human. He doesn't have much time to deal with this as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--THE CHOPPER emerges from behind the treeline, the SPOTLIGHT picks him out and AUTOMATIC FIRE erupts--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS runs a few yards and throws himself to the ground as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUNFIRE STRAFES around and ahead of him-- setting off several MINES which send up clouds of dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS picks himself up and runs for the trees, leaping over the barbed wire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORE GUNFIRE rips apart the trees around Marcus as he sprints and weaves, making his way toward the river. The SPOTLIGHT picks him up and loses him again-- it's tough for the chopper to get a clear shot at him here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVERBANK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS has reached the edge of the trees, he can see the river just beyond. He starts to move for it, when--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--FWOOM! The forest around him ERUPTS INTO FLAME, the chopper has laid NAPALM along the river's edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS reels from the intense heat, bats out FLAMES on his clothes, but his skin remains undamaged. Realizing he can keep on moving--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--MARCUS DASHES through the dense FIRE to--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVER - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--the RIVER, where the sky is just starting to LIGHTEN. MARCUS SPLASHES into the shallows, extinguishing the FLAMES. He fills his hands with water and sucks it down gratefully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE WATER - A GLIMMER of METAL below the surface, heading for the source of the splashing. Suddenly--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--the BLACKHAWK CHOPPER drops down directly in front of Marcus, hovering a few feet above the water, the GUNNER pointing his weapon directly at Marcus (he's one of the two soldiers we saw before). The BLADE WASH swirls the water in a whirlpool and beats back the FIRE behind Marcus. As the GUNNER OPENS FIRE--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--MARCUS DIVES below the surface, BULLETS ZINGING through the murky water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER - MARCUS is winged by a couple of shots, his thermoplastic flesh getting torn apart--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH THE GUNNER - He pauses a moment, squinting into the WATER for a glimpse of Marcus, but failing to register that--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--BELOW THE CHOPPER, right beneath him, the WATER ROILS as if teeming with piranha. Suddenly--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--HYDROBOTS ERUPT from the RIVER with a hideous BUZZING SOUND. Hydrobots resemble segmented serpents, eyeless, but with razor-sharp heads that DRILL into their victims-- they respond to sound and vibrations. About a dozen of these four- foot long, glistening steel snakes shoot from the water to attack the chopper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE CHOPPER - HYDROBOTS PIERCE the aluminum FLOOR, and shoot into the cabin, the PILOT and the two SOLDIERS CRY OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GUNNER tumbles out of the chopper and FALLS in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PILOT attempts to maintain control, but the hydraulics are damaged and the steel serpents thrash about in the cabin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GUNNER surfaces, trying frantically to swim to shore. But the hydrobots are upon him, he SHRIEKS and disappears beneath the bubbling surface, which now boils with BLOOD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CHOPPER - A WHIRRING HYDROBOT penetrates the other soldier's leg. He SCREAMS and wrenches the thing back out, tossing it from the chopper just before--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--THE CHOPPER CRASHES INTO THE SHALLOWS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PILOT leaps from the cabin and makes it to shore, where he collapses. But the remaining, wounded SOLDIER can't get out of the hip-deep water before the HYDROBOTS are upon him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, HANDS BURST from the water, grabbing the soldier. A second later, MARCUS SURFACES, slinging the man over his shoulder. He strides to shore, as if rescuing the man from enemy fire, hydrobots thrashing and bubbling at his waist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS reaches the amazed pilot, lays the wounded soldier down beside him, then tears a whirring, writhing HYDROBOT from the soldier's belly and WHIPS its head against a ROCK-- it SPARKS, micro-machine parts fly. The pilot and wounded soldier stare at him, astonished.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't mention it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
He tosses the dead robo-snake aside, then turns and moves back into the water, quickly vanishing below the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER - MARCUS moves steadily across the silty river bottom. He doesn't need air. HYDROBOTS come at him, he swats them away as if they were mosquitoes, CRUSHING in his hand those that linger too long. Those which make contact with his artificial skin can't get far, turn and swim off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FAR RIVERBANK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS emerges, the FLAMES still visible on the other side of the river, behind him. He doesn't look back, as he moves into Skynet turf. This side of the river isn't wooded, everything has a concrete, industrial feel. Marcus is a mess, both clothing and skin are shredded and charred.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He nearly bumps into a SKELETAL STEEL TERMINATOR, which emerges from behind a concrete wall. The terminator trains its PLASMA RIFLE on MARCUS, scans him, RED EYES glowing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TERMINATOR'S POV - RED FILTER, MARCUS' FORM is TARGETED. READ-OUTS on the side, the HIGHLIGHTED WORDS "NON-ORGANIC - DO NOT TERMINATE."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TERMINATOR turns from MARCUS, no longer interested, moving off on its preprogrammed patrol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS moves up a sloping, CONCRETE EMBANKMENT. At the top of the rise, he sees, spread out before him--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKYNET TERRITORY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--a hideous industrial sprawl, OPEN GAS FLAMES, SMOKING FACTORIES, rumbling VEHICLES, H-Ks, TERMINATOR TROOPS on patrol. Nothing green, a GREY HAZE hangs over the landscape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, MARCUS shakes his head and gamely soldiers on, moving along the edge of the elevated embankment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKYNET PERIPHERY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS moves past banks of ANTI-AIRCRAFT guns and MISSILE LAUNCHERS, interspersed with slowly rotating RADAR TRACKING DISHES-- the first line of defense. From this fortress-like wall he descends into the nightmarish environment beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS reacts to a CAWING SOUND above, looks up to see--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--A CROW perching on an overhead WIRE. A second later--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZAP! A BLUE PLASMA PULSE blasts the thing to smithereens, a few BLACK FEATHERS drift down as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--a T-400 (same mask-like face we saw earlier) lowers its plasma weapon and strolls on. Target practice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS stays out of the way of the TERMINATOR LEGIONS patrolling near the riverside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DEMOLITION SITE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS heads inland, past the ruins of a CHURCH-- WALLS with the remains of stained glass WINDOWS, STATUES OF SAINTS. Hearing RUMBLING NOISES, Marcus hurries out of the way as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WALL collapses, pushed down by an automated SKYNET BULLDOZER. This gigantic, self-operated construction machine has a swivelling CAMERA HEAD instead of a cab. Its giant TREADS roll over the STONE STATUES, crushing them to dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS keeps moving into Skynet's turf. The demolition gives way to massive CONSTRUCTION, as the robots remake the human world in their own image.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CONSTRUCTION ROBOTS erect a low-slung STEEL FRAME structure, automated CRANES and SUPPLY TRUCKS about. These robots are oversized versions of the steel terminators we know, but with multiple limbs bearing WELDING TOOLS, and TREADS instead of legs. Marcus watches as BEAMS are quickly welded into place by telescoping steel arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKYNET STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS continues into the completed robot city. Skynet's ARCHITECTURE is featureless, bland, purely practical: single- story, windowless CONCRETE or STEEL structures with massive open DOORWAYS to accommodate their largest machines. A RED GLOW emanates from the interiors, the robots' preferred lighting scheme. No sidewalks or signs, just thick GRIDS of POWER LINES and PIPES overhead. Constant NOISE of BUZZING POWER, RATTLING MACHINES, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS steps inside one of these buildings--

<DIRECTION>
INT. TERMINATOR FACTORY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This TERMINATOR ASSEMBLY PLANT is an intricate, multi-leveled clockwork maze of moving CONVEYORS and INDUSTRIAL ROBOTICS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELECTRONICS and HYDRAULICS are ROBOTICALLY SOLDERED in place. STEEL PRESSES stamp out TERMINATOR PARTS-- TORSOS, FACE PLATES, SPINAL COLUMNS, LIMBS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Partially-completed PARTS are moved by CONVEYOR to ASSEMBLY STATIONS, where LIMBS and HEADS are JOINED to TORSOS, elaborate OPERATIONS carried out by INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS, like the ones in present-day factories.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SYNTHETIC SKIN is SPRAYED OVER a METAL ENDOSKELETON in precise amounts, building up to create human features... this is a T-400.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An INDUSTRIAL ROBOT ARM picks up a CPU from a DRY-ICE CONTAINER. The CPU features the distinctive, linked rectangles familiar from the earlier films. The arm lifts this gingerly to a TERMINATOR SKELETON and INSERTS IT into the STEEL SKULL, SCREWING A SEAL over the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RED EYES flicker to life, and THE ARMATURE releases the TERMINATOR, which moves away under its own power. It removes a PLASMA WEAPON from a WALL RACK, moving past--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--the dumbfounded MARCUS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TERMINATOR joins a dozen identical robots, who ride on a treaded SKYNET TANK with a PLASMA CANNON and FLAMETHROWER. There are numerous TANKS here, awaiting deployment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKYNET STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rounding a corner on a straight, narrow street, MARCUS sees all the ROBOTS and SMALL VEHICLES clearing into small NICHES built into the walls on either side, as if clearing a path for him. It takes him a moment to realize it's not him they're responding to-- a RUMBLE BUILDS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A convoy of GIGANTIC SKYNET TRUCKS-- a half-dozen modified SEMIS now driven by CPUS-- bear down on MARCUS at extremely high speed. They carry construction supplies: massive STEEL BEAMS, CONCRETE PIPES, etc. And there's barely inches of clearance on either side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
These things aren't slowing down. There's nowhere for Marcus to duck out of the way. He has no choice but to RUN, as fast as he can, the lead vehicle gaining on him rapidly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS THROWS HIMSELF to the concrete in the middle of the street, pressing his body flat as the LEAD TRUCK passes over him, the wheels missing him by inches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he has only a moment's respite. THE NEXT TRUCK has a lower undercarriage, a steel CROSSMEMBER catches his back--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--and DRAGS MARCUS beneath the vehicle, ripping off chunks of flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marcus CRIES OUT, crawls ahead and clings to a forward portion of the undercarriage, keeping himself just above the pavement. His LEFT LEG, twisted and damaged, still drags on the asphalt, throwing up SPARKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVERHEAD ANGLE ON THE TRUCK - CAMERA PULLS BACK straight above the MOVING VEHICLE, amidst the convoy speeding down this sunken artery. CAMERA KEEPS MOVING UPWARD to reveal an AERIAL VIEW of Skynet's city. Seen from above, the rectilinear STRUCTURES, criss-crossing POWER LINES and SPEEDING VEHICLES strongly resemble a PULSING CIRCUIT BOARD.

INT. COMMAND CENTER/INTERROGATION CELL - DAY

A bare, windowless space with only a cot, a metal chair and a bedpan. BLAIR looks up, bleary-eyed, exhausted and scared. CONNOR gestures for the MP to close the door behind him.

</DIRECTION>
<KYLE_AND_STAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twinkle, twinkle, little star...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE_AND_STAR>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER, their heads, feet and chests are clamped onto SLIDING TRAYS, a long row of these hold OTHER PRISONERS as well. Kyle and Star must reach across a gap between the trays to hold hands. (It's the first time we've seen her hatless.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trays are all poised before panel-covered SEMI-CIRCULAR OPENINGS built into the wall, in a sterile, hospital-like environment. Above each opening is a MONITOR SCREEN. An ominous HUM is building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN AN ADJACENT OPERATING THEATER, visible through GLASS WALLS, MEDICAL LASERS mounted on ROBOTIC ARMS work on anesthetized patients (we needn't see the grisly details).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND STAR and KYLE, the PANELS OPEN, the trays slowly SLIDE into the OPENINGS. SCREAMS and SOBS from other prisoners.

EXT. SKYNET HIGHWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH MARCUS beneath the truck. He's moved to the edge of the chassis, near a WHEEL, moving slowly, carefully. There's a bit more clearance at the sides of the sunken highway now, but they're still moving awfully fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WHEEL TURNS, the vehicle suddenly SLOWS to negotiate a turn, braking downhill. Marcus seizes this opportunity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE as MARCUS LAUNCHES himself from below the vehicle, rolling into the GAP between the convoy and the concrete wall. The remaining vehicles RUMBLE PAST, as MARCUS presses himself against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When they're gone, he gets to his feet, limping down the highway on foot for a short distance, dragging his damaged leg behind him. He hears ANOTHER CONVOY approaching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just in time, he finds a SEAM in the poured concrete, it's enough to give him purchase-- he struggles to climb up the eight feet of freeway wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS makes it over the top, TRUCKS RUMBLING past below. This is desolate, hilly country.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE DOWN - among the vehicles below is a CONTAINER, like the one that held Kyle and Star. We glimpse the anguished FACES and REACHING HANDS of CAPTIVES within.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS reacts, moves as fast as he can alongside the trucks for a short distance until--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE VEHICLES shoot ahead around a curve and out of sight. In the distance is a COMPLEX OF BUILDINGS, clearly the destination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marcus begins moving along the edge of the freeway, heading for the complex. He reaches the edge of a plateau, looks down, his expression changing. This is the last thing he expected to see. CAMERA MOVES to reveal--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COASTAL VALLEY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--a panoramic view of a GORGEOUS COASTAL COMMUNITY. The place is lush, green, with well-maintained, lovely HOMES in the distance, a BLUE SEA beyond. The complex of buildings stands a few miles away, at the far end of the valley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS, amazed, limps down a gentle slope leading to this seeming paradise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS emerges from a small stand of trees and finds himself looking at a groomed FAIRWAY. Marcus hears a NOISE nearby--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--a GOLF BALL bouncing on the ground not far away. MARCUS turns in the direction it came from.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An electric GOLF CART approaches, driven by a handsome, middle-aged golfer-- JEREMY-- who wears casual country club attire, eating from a clear BAG OF TRAIL MIX. Jeremy comes to a stop beside Marcus.
</DIRECTION>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you all right?

Marcus slowly shakes his head, as Jeremy climbs out of the cart, looking him over carefully, taking in the exposed metal at his shoulder and leg.

	The facility, sure. Hop in, I'll take you there.

Jeremy clutches Marcus' hand tightly. Marcus blinks, Jeremy cocks his head, then lets go.

With that, he hits the gas.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JEREMY drives the cart down the road, past well-kept homes with generous lawns-- it's a beautiful, upscale community at MAGIC HOUR. BICYCLISTS and FUTURISTIC CARS pass, Jeremy waves to NEIGHBORS. Marcus takes it all in with disbelief.

He holds the plastic bag out to Marcus, who obligingly takes a handful of trail mix, pops it in his mouth. After a beat, he spits it back out in his hand, stares at it.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't food.

<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, of course not. Seems you got a little memory loss going on.

As he speaks, he notices his BAG is nearly empty. He casually lifts his sport shirt and CLICKS OPEN a PANEL beneath his rib cage. We glimpse CIRCUITS, FIBER-OPTICS.

	Eating-- well, chewing-- it's one of the hardest habits to break... but before long, none of this will be necessary. We won't even need these bodies.

</JEREMY>
<DIRECTION>
From within he removes an identical BAG FILLED with TRAIL MIX (the stuff he just ate), and replaces it with the empty bag. He clicks the panel shut again, pops a NUT in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marcus stares at this, appalled, then blinks and looks away. He reacts to the sound of PIANO MUSIC, a difficult piece being played expertly-- PASSING a PICTURE WINDOW, he sees a PIANIST practicing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front of this home, a GARDENER and WINDOW WASHER are hard at work. They're both T-400s, with the eerie mask-like faces. Marcus reacts.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terminators!

Jeremy winces, as if at a racial epithet. He's starting to regret giving Marcus a lift, his manner is careful, as if he'd picked up some homeless guy.

Nearing the complex, Marcus reacts to BIRDSONG above. He looks up, stops as he sees--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--a TINY SPEAKER, concealed amongst the LEAVES.

MARCUS moves to this tree, touches it-- the bark feels unnatural. He RAPS it with his FIST-- it sounds hollow, made of FIBERGLAS. He fingers a LEAF, tries to bend it-- PLASTIC.

<DIRECTION>
He crouches, studying the GRASS. After a moment, he finds a SEAM in the pristine lawn. He starts to peel it up... it's ASTROTURF. Beneath it is SANDY DIRT.

<DIRECTION>
Marcus KEEPS PEELING the plastic covering back... more dirt-- and BITS OF BONE. As he continues to uncover the ground we see recognizable CHUNKS of SKULLS, LEGBONES, etc.

	Listen to me. Skynet was designed to detect threats, make projections and implement solutions.

The human race was doomed... unless we were transformed.

She touches him once more and moves off, leaving him alone here. We'll hear other far off EXPLOSIONS from time to time during the following. MARCUS stares at--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS FRIENDS' FACES, which slowly FADE TO BLACK, replaced by his own REFLECTION. Seeing his own face, his smile vanishes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS is going through a terrible internal struggle, the interface fighting his own natural emotions. He backs away from the machine, looks around at the brains, all the lives destroyed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hurrying past the wall of brains, he moves a hand to the base of his skull... with an ANGRY CRY--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--his FINGERS dig into the plastic skin at the back of his HEAD--

MARCUS grits his teeth, this is incredibly hard to do, but--

MARCUS hurls the DEVICE to the floor, its elaborate CIRCUITRY SHATTERS. He reels with momentary anguish at what he's just given up-- then he moves out of there with determination.

A FUTURISTIC ATV roars past at high speed. It's followed moments later by a massive SKYNET TANK.

MARCUS scrambles to his feet, continues on his way.

MARCUS tosses the man aside, regards the GLOWING, CRACKLING TIME SPHERE-- it doesn't look too inviting.
</DIRECTION>

THE DOOR bursts open. SKELETAL TERMINATORS storm in, wielding PLASMA RIFLES-- they mean business--

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ENERGY ERUPTS around MARCUS, the CRACKLING BLUE LIGHT of the time sphere surrounds him. We experience this from--
</DIRECTION>

EXT. PARK - DUSK

<DIRECTION>
STAY WITH MARCUS-- FOLIAGE APPEARS around the SPHERE. The BLUE ENERGY fades, leaving him naked, 20 FEET IN THE AIR--

MARCUS PLUNGES to the ground and rolls. He looks up--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PLASTIC TREE has been melted with the heat like a candle, DRIPPING down around him.

Just then he hears SHATTERING GLASS behind him. He spins--

MARCUS trains a ripped-off ROBOTIC LASER ARM at him like a weapon. The arm trails heavy CABLES and CIRCUITS, linking it to the operating theater we saw earlier. (These also artfully conceal Marcus' nakedness.)

THE ENGINEER moves to a RED ALARM BUTTON on a COMMUNICATION PANEL mounted in the wall, extending a hand--

MARCUS connects two wires to FIRE UP the LASER and--

A RED BEAM neatly SEVERS the ENGINEER'S HAND at his WRIST.

<DIRECTION>
MARCUS FIRES OFF THE LASER again--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--THE ENGINEER stares at him-- we see a flaming STRIP in the wall behind his head. He takes a step toward Marcus and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--his HEAD TUMBLES OFF, bounces on the ground, and rolls to MARCUS' FEET. (There's no blood, just laser-severed electronic connections).

THE MAN'S MOUTH twists and grimaces, making ELECTRONIC STATIC from the FRIED VOICEBOX. MARCUS is taken by surprise when--

THE PRISONERS smash the GLASS DOORS off their hinges, and charge past--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CONTROL ROBOTS, which are now coming to life. ELECTRIC BURSTS drop a couple of slow-moving ESCAPEES as they dash into the garage and make for--
</DIRECTION>

KYLE and STAR take cover behind a concrete post just as--

--PLASMA BURSTS explode around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SKELETAL TERMINATORS armed with PLASMA RIFLES are pouring in through the OPENING GARAGE GATE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STOLEN BUS heads for the exit, KNOCKING a couple of TERMINATORS aside and SMASHING through the rising GATE, clearing a path for others to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SKELETAL TERMINATOR sets its sights on a MOVING HYDROGEN CAR, which follows the bus--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TERMINATOR POV - RED FILTER, HIGHLIGHTING BULL, the DRIVER. "TARGET ACQUIRED - TERMINATE."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TERMINATOR SHOOTS HIS RIFLE through the car's windshield-- it EXPLODES, close to KYLE and STAR, the building SHAKES.
</DIRECTION>

KYLE and STAR flee the flames, THE TERMINATOR'S HEAD swivels quickly, taking them in. It starts to pursue, but MARCUS gets in front of it. Before it can fire--

THE TERMINATOR starts to move past Marcus, who LEAPS on it and WRENCHES THE RIFLE from its grasp. As the robot spins on him he BLOWS ITS HEAD OFF, then looks around frantically for the kids. A moment later--

No time to argue, MARCUS leaps into the back beside STAR and KYLE GUNS IT out of there, careening off walls and other vehicles, he's still not much of a driver. MARCUS meanwhile PICKS OFF potential threats with the PLASMA RIFLE.

EXT. OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KYLE has to swerve to avoid the stolen BUS, which is now on its side, IN FLAMES. It was taken out by--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--an automated SKYNET TANK, one of THREE TANKS here. They're positioned to take out escaping vehicles. But the ATV is a small, maneuverable target, swerving and speeding crazily. A TANK FIRES and MISSES, the BLAST taking out a chunk of wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KYLE WHOOPS, heading across the campus--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--ONE TANK pursues, it moves surprisingly fast, capable of flattening anything in its path. MARCUS FIRES at it, but the PLASMA RIFLE BLASTS don't have much effect on the ARMOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TANK FIRES again, but--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--KYLE ROARS around a corner, just in time. However, in so doing, he nearly runs over--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--MARCUS, from earlier, on his way to the time sphere, visible in the HEADLIGHTS for only an instant before he LEAPS OUT OF THE WAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KYLE, focused on the pursuing tank, didn't even see this. But STAR did. She looks wide-eyed at MARCUS beside her.

KYLE OVERSTEERS, putting them up on two wheels, then recovers, narrowly avoiding--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--PLASMA BLASTS, which obliterate the FACADE of a building.

SKELETAL TERMINATORS appear in their HEADLIGHTS, weapons raised.

Kyle steers toward THE WOODS, dodging between the thick TREES. Too many obstacles for the TANK here, it SCREECHES TO A HALT and lets off a JET OF FLAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TREES behind the ATV all IGNITE, turning to acrid pools of MELTING PLASTIC. KYLE barely stays ahead of the FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TANK backs up and takes a new route, around the woods.

IN THE WOODS, KYLE strikes a GLANCING BLOW against a tree trunk, and the ATV TOPPLES on its side, spilling its passengers. After a beat, they rise, shaken.

THE ATV comes rocketing down the main street, MARCUS driving now. Suddenly, directly in front of them--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--THE TANK APPEARS, moving swiftly around a corner, GUN TURRET SWIVELING at them.

AS IT FIRES, MARCUS SWERVES onto a LAWN and--

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LUXURY HOME - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A handsome HYBRID COUPLE, in pajamas in front of a BIG SCREEN TV. They turn and react as the ATV skitters through the room and down a hallway. The ATV is followed a moment later by--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--THE TANK, which TAKES OUT THE ENTIRE WALL, BARRELLING through the living room and BURYING the HYBRIDS in RUBBLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS takes the ATV UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TANK keeps SMASHING through the house, as its TURRET SWIVELS upward and BLASTS AWAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UPSTAIRS - THE PLASMA BLAST COMES THROUGH the FLOOR, just missing the ATV as it rockets through a MASTER BEDROOM, toward a BALCONY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWNSTAIRS - THE TANK tears through an upscale RECREATION ROOM, splintering a POOL TABLE, smashing through PINBALL MACHINES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UPSTAIRS - MARCUS takes the ATV straight out onto the BALCONY, THROUGH THE RAILING and INTO THE AIR.
</DIRECTION>

DOWNSTAIRS - THE TANK BLASTS THROUGH a KITCHEN and BATHROOM on its way out the other side of the house.

EXT. LUXURY HOME/BACK YARD - NIGHT

THE ATV JUST CLEARS an enormous SWIMMING POOL, landing hard on the far deck and moving on, fast.

--TAKES A NOSEDIVE into the pool, out of commission.

MARCUS steers the ATV down a slope toward the shoreline.

EXT. COASTLINE/DOCK - NIGHT/DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS, KYLE and STAR leap off the ATV and sprint for a MOTORBOAT. Kyle carries the rifle now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they near the boat, MARCUS reacts to the sight of--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--RED EYES FLICKERING in the darkness at the END OF THE DOCK, the BLUE GLOW of a RIFLE CHARGING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS leaps in front of KYLE and STAR shielding them with his BODY. The PLASMA BLAST envelops him, MARCUS is blown--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--INTO THE WATER. KYLE and STAR are flattened by the force of the blast, lie motionless on the dock. Their PLASMA RIFLE lies a few feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SKELETAL TERMINATOR who shot Marcus moves swiftly down the dock, its PLASMA RIFLE trained on the water now. It moves past Kyle and Star, who remain motionless on the ground, and goes to the edge of the dock--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--BLAM! STAR snatches up their own PLASMA WEAPON, and BLASTS the thing in the back, knocking it INTO THE WATER, which is only a few feet deep here. As it rises, SHE FIRES again, taking the Terminator's head off. It goes under.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SKY is beginning to LIGHTEN now as, a moment later, MARCUS EMERGES. As he climbs from the shallow water back onto the dock, Kyle and Star stare at him with astonishment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing their expressions, he checks himself for damage-- there's METAL exposed at his shoulder, arm and hand, his FACE partially TORN AWAY, ONE EYE MISSING. He tries to speak, but can only manage an ELECTRONIC CROAK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle and Star back away from him.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>

</STAR>
<DIRECTION>
They hear a WHISTLING SOUND from shore, hit the deck as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--a MISSILE BLAST TAKES OUT THE BOAT and a large chunk of DOCK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laying low, they look up to see--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--a small army of TANKS and TERMINATORS approaching... even a HUNTER-KILLER moving in from the horizon, swinging its SPOTLIGHT in all directions. It looks like the last stand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCUS turns back to KYLE and STAR. His voice is a distorted WHISPER.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
Star puts the rifle aside, with an apologetic expression. She moves to Marcus, gingerly touches his exposed metal-- then hugs him tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle, more stoical, looks out to sea. His expression changes, becomes almost hopeful as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--IN THE DISTANCE, a HUGE, BLACK SHAPE rises to the surface of the water, just visible against the dawn horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIREWORKS! MISSILES blast the H-K... NAPALM erupts around the TANKS and TERMINATOR ARMY as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--A SQUAD OF A-10s SCREAM IN from over the land, FIRING CANNONS, launching AIR-TO GROUND MISSILES to take out the TANKS. ONE A-10 flies low overhead and WAGS ITS WINGS.

KYLE points to the dark shape on the water-- now visible as a huge SUBMARINE with the RISING SUN behind it.

MARCUS addresses a TEAM LEADER, who's taken aback at his frightening appearance and distorted voice:

	<DIALOGUE>
	John Connor. I'm glad you made it.

</CONNOR>
<DIRECTION>
KYLE is amazed to be meeting the man face-to-face. He shakes hands, wide-eyed and speechless. It's a strange moment for Connor, too, for different reasons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CONNOR turns away from his first meeting with his father to be, a bit dizzy at the experience. He addresses Marcus.

Near the ENGINE ROOM, a couple dozen RESCUED PRISONERS are being treated by unarmed MEDICAL PERSONNEL, others huddle under blankets with food and drink. KATE is among those helping the former prisoners.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KYLE and STAR eat ravenously, he finishes one MRE and grabs up another. A few feet away, MARCUS leans against a wall, plasma RIFLE at his side. A DOCTOR examines him warily, prodding his injured face.

The doctor moves on as a couple of HAZ-MAT SUITED FIGURES come down the ladder from the hatch, FACE-MASKS removed. Among them is CONNOR. KATE moves to his side as more dazed HUMANS come down. She speaks quietly, eying KYLE nearby.

MARCUS moves at the same time, to grab his PLASMA RIFLE--

SERENA leaps off the ladder, aiming a small, powerful PLASMA WEAPON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERENA fires first--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM! THE PLASMA BLAST catches MARCUS in the shoulder and BLOWS his GUN ARM clean off. His PLASMA RIFLE discharges, BLOWING a HOLE in the side of the sub, near the floor-- WATER gushes in like a FIREHOSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LEAVE SLO-MO. Spun around by the force of the blast, MARCUS lands on his back, SPARKS and SEVERED CABLES protruding from his damaged shoulder. An ALARM KLAXON SOUNDS.

PRISONERS and DOCTORS SCREAM and scramble for cover--

CONNOR steps in front of KATE to shield her, they back away through the WATER BLAST, CONNOR FIRING at SERENA--

SERENA takes numerous HITS from the EXPLOSIVE BULLETS, which take off PIECES of her, but she keeps coming, FIRES again--
