First, over BLACK, we hear the sound of a light rain.

EXT. WOODS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mural of leafless trees beneath an overcast sky. Rain continues to fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maybe now we begin to notice a strange quality to the light (or is it the sky?). Something vaguely unsettling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still, the sound of rain is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
40s, lies on his side in bed, staring at us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has not been sleeping. In fact, judging from his distant expression, he has not slept in ages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Less like a road and more like a path that you maneuver a vehicle through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Man, dressed in rain gear, walks down the middle. He is accompanied by a medium-sized LABRADOR, and seems in no particular hurry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of tires appear and grow in intensity. The Man, without saying an actual word, instructs the dog to heal. The dog obeys as the Man moves off the road. The vehicle hurtles past him -- its engine quiet, its windows darkened -- spraying muddy debris in its wake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seconds later, the car brakes abruptly and skids to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stops walking and stares at the car, which seems ominously still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car then reverses direction and begins to move toward the Man, who remains motionless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the car is alongside him, a darkened window turns transparent and we see a WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT in the rear seat. His demeanor is pleasant and professional.
</DIRECTION>
<WELL_DRESSED_BUREAUCRAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Kelvin?

The Man he is addressing, who we now understand is CHRIS KELVIN, stares back at him.

INT. CABIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The contrast between the cabin's rustic aesthetic and the aggressively high-tech equipment contained therein isn't as jarring as you might imagine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelvin is seated in front of a desk, scrolling through a text readout on a flat, transparent holographic screen. Behind him is the Well-Dressed Bureaucrat from the car, and two others: A WOMAN in her 50s and a MAN in his 30s. They are also well-groomed. Each of their suits are embroidered with a small but distinctive LOGO of some sort that composes the acronym DBA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelvin scrolls through several menus, hits a few keys, and a digitized VIDEO IMAGE appears on his screen: A MAN, unshaven, looking into the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man, GIBARIAN, looks very tired and somewhat apologetic. The lower part of the screen has a time of day and date display that reads: 0221 HRS 11/14/31.
</DIRECTION>
<GIBARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We take off into the cosmos, ready for anything: solitude, hardship, exhaustion, death. We're proud of ourselves, in a way. But our enthusiasm is a sham. We don't want to conquer the cosmos -- we want to extend the boundaries of Earth to the cosmos. We are only seeking Man. We don't want Other Worlds. We want mirrors.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we don't need to know what it is, or why. Maybe just knowing that it is should be enough.

Gibarian stares at the camera for a long moment before switching it off and ending the transmission.

<DIRECTION>
KELVIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
two months later still. He is looking out his small, rectangular window, and for the fist time we cut around to see the approaching planet: SOLARIS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelvin stares at it, hypnotized. It has a translucent quality, as though it is lit from within, and its undulating, ocean-like surface slowly changes colors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelvin's attention is diverted as an orbiting ship, the PROMETHEUS, edges into frame.

Kelvin, in a space suit, climbs with some difficulty out of the Athena 7, which has come to rest in the DOCKING BAY of the Prometheus. Several exploratory PODS fill the remainder of the area.

Gibarian addressing the camera. He appears to be lucid, but extremely fatigued.

A long moment of silence is broken by a noise on the video, which draws Gibarian's attention offscreen.

Kelvin takes a step forward, and Snow recoils.

Sartorius cracks the door open and slithers through the slit and into the hallway. He is of obvious intelligence and not to be messed with; contentious, intimidating when he wants to be, and probably brilliant. Kelvin eyes him suspiciously.

Sartorius rotates and zips back into his room. As the door closes Kelvin sees a flash of ANOTHER FIGURE in Sartorius' room. The glimpse was too quick to judge who or what the other figure could have been.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Interviews with the surviving members and a perusal of the deceased's personal effects indicate he was suffering from severe depression with psychotic features, along with bouts of hypomania, dementia, delirium, and primary insomnia. All of these symptoms, combined with a profound sense of isolation, are commonly found in studies of low stimulation environments, particularly long range space travel. Snow and Sartorius show indications of depression, including dysthymic and bipolar I; a variety of stress disorders, including acute and posttraumatic; and suggestions of agoraphobia, obsessive/compulsive disorder, and hypersomnia. I emphasize these are preliminary opinions on my part. I will attempt to convince Snow and Sartorius to return to Earth, but as they currently view me as an intruder of sorts, this may take some time.

RHEYA, 30s, staring at us, practically daring us to look away. Her obvious intelligence and confidence make her extremely compelling, along with the fact that it was her parted lips we were looking at a moment ago. Her expression indicates she's in a very raw emotional state.

She is staring at Kelvin and she is ethereal in her stillness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KELVIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Awakens, blinks, and slowly recognizes her.

<DIRECTION>
If he is not entirely surprised it is because he has obviously dreamed of Rheya before. He looks at her, simply.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RHEYA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stands and makes her way to Kelvin.

Without hesitation she kisses him and they begin to explore each other and we see all of it happen and two things are obvious: first, they have done this before, and two: they haven't done it in some time.

<GIBARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A pre-biological colloidal envelope, possibly exceeding terrestrial structures in complexity; a plasmic mechanism. Probably without life as we conceive it, but capable of performing functional activities on an astronomic scale. My view is that Solaris has reached, in a single bound, the "homeostatic ocean" stage without passing through stages of terrestrial evolution. I think it bypassed cellular development altogether. It hasn't taken endless eons to adapt itself to its environment, but in fact dominated its environment immediately. From the moment it existed, it was the most superior element in the Universe. And now it passes the time doing extravagant theoretical thinking about the Universe, with us as the cast.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is ten years ago. Rheya enters, alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She crosses to the kitchen and makes a drink. Almost immediately, the labrador puppy enters from the bedroom and stands beside her, tail wagging. She ignores it and continues mixing her drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Halfway through this activity, the bedroom light comes on. A moment later, Kelvin is in the doorway. Eventually, but not angrily, because he's still not really awake:
</DIRECTION>
<KELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where've you been?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELVIN>
<RHEYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I been thinking about how much I hate you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHEYA>
<DIRECTION>
She finishes making her drink, drinks it, and walks out the door.

Kelvin stands in the doorway for a beat, then pivots and returns to bed. The light goes out.

Kelvin and Rheya, later in the evening when they spoke for the first time. They are absolutely infatuated with each other; they know something is happening between them, will happen between them.
</DIRECTION>
<RHEYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger. Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states. Time would just collapse, I would be inside time. I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped. Freaky stuff.

<DIRECTION>
Kelvin and Rheya sit together in the Prometheus. Rheya continues her story without a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<RHEYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scared. No, not scared. Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up. I was a threat. Now I know why. She was afraid she'd be seen. That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right? I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.

INT. OFFICES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Intercut Kelvin and Rheya at their respective jobs, going through a normal day. There is no sound. As we see these images, it's clear that Kelvin and Rheya are slightly not present in their respective encounters with other people; they are distracted by the idea of each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And they like it.
</DIRECTION>

	Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you. I loved it so much, that feeling.

He nods. It's coming back to her.

Kelvin is yelling at Rheya. We don't hear what he's saying, but judging from her reaction, it's not pleasant. She is crying.

<DIRECTION>
Experiencing this all over again. Kelvin comes and sits in front of her.

Kelvin, still yelling, is packing some things into a suitcase. Rheya, between sobs, pleads with him.

	You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book. We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own. That proves that --

<KELVIN>

	Well. He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.

Then years ago. Kelvin, naked, sitting in a chair, in the dark. Rheya, also naked, is smoking a cigarette in bed.

<KELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything you pursue, you end up becoming disinterested in. The fact that you're good at everything you try makes it worse. You have a degree in animal science, you could be a terrific vet. You drifted into writing and turned out to be a perceptive journalist. Then it was politics, which seemed best of all, you had an actual gift for understanding the best pattern for a group of people to be arranged for you to achieve your goal. And they didn't even know they were being arranged. But you got bored with it, like you do with everything.
	</DIALOGUE>

She just smokes, not really looking at him. Maybe it's a common observation and she's past being defensive about it.

Slowly, carefully, Sartorius grasps Kelvin by the shoulders. Then he leans in and whispers in Kelvin's ear:
</DIRECTION>
<SARTORIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rheya is dead. She's a copy. A facsimile. And she's seducing you all over again. You're sick. You think of fucking her as research for humanity. It's just fucking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARTORIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Kelvin backs away.
</DIRECTION>
<SARTORIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing grandiose about it. You've jumped out of a plane and you're trying to sew a parachute together while you fall.

<SNOW>

	Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right? Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOW>
<KELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything. Presented me with your double, and you with mine.

<SNOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps it did.

	But they are human. They certainly become human with incredible speed. First they're like they were in our memory, but then they fill in on their own. DNA doesn't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain, it's not dense enough. They build up with experience.

	That's what you were saying. I heard what you were saying.

<KELVIN>

	For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me. That's all I know right now.

She realizes she doesn't want to argue. Not right now, anyway.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't explain it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHEYA>
<KELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither can I. Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap. There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELVIN>
<RHEYA>

He kisses her. She wants to believe him, so she says nothing. Then:

Kelvin is asleep. Rheya is next to him.

<DIRECTION>
Offscreen, we hear the door open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone walks quietly (though not surreptitiously) through the frame and sits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a long beat, Kelvin bolts upright, his mind struggling to clear. When it does:
</DIRECTION>
<KELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gibarian.

</KELVIN>
<GIBARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave the light off.

A beat. Kelvin tries to get his bearings.

<GIBARIAN>

	I wish you'd come a little sooner. I might not have had to kill myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIBARIAN>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles, looking at Kelvin.
</DIRECTION>
<GIBARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her. Understand something: I am the real Gibarian. Just a new incarnation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIBARIAN>
<KELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELVIN>
<GIBARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're being tricked. Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors. He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field. Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIBARIAN>
<KELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can it work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELVIN>
<GIBARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It can. Ordinary matter, like ours? Not affected. Everything else, disintegrates.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIBARIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kelvin registers this.
</DIRECTION>
<GIBARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone. Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIBARIAN>
<KELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can trust Rheya.

</KELVIN>
<GIBARIAN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Gibarian. He was here.

</RHEYA>
<KELVIN>

He moves to the chair, looking for some residue of Gibarian, some proof. Finding none:
</DIRECTION>
<KELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

Kelvin leaves the room. After a few beats, Rheya follows.

She nods and takes them.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right.

	Please don't lie. I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.

</RHEYA>
<KELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELVIN>
<RHEYA>

	Don't. I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive.

He goes to her.

<KELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That won't happen again. We're different.

</KELVIN>
<RHEYA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</RHEYA>

She sits, frustrated. Sad.

<RHEYA>

	How could it be so cruel? How could it torture us like this?

Kelvin is asleep. Alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a long period of silence, we hear the faint sound of an instrument of some sort hitting the ground. After another beat, Kelvin awakens. He notices that he is alone, and something tells him that's not a good sign.

Rheya is on the ground, convulsing. Beside her is a SMALL STEEL DRUM, which is spilling a strange-looking LIQUID that solidifies and vaporizes with a smoky hiss.
</DIRECTION>

Kelvin moves to Rheya and is startled to see that half of her face and throat are burned away -- not melted as in a fire, but merely eaten cleanly away. He picks her up.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelvin puts Rheya on the bed. Her face and throat have returned to normal, but she is not breathing. Kelvin goes and puts his head to her chest, but doesn't hear what he hoped to hear. He stands, still looking at her. Snow seems very detached.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An uncomfortably long moment as we realize she is actually not going to wake up.
</DIRECTION>
<KELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Snow says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her finger twitches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barely noticeable at first, but growing in intensity. Kelvin sees it, and goes to her. She is starting to shake a little, as though cold.
</DIRECTION>
<SNOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She'll come back, don't worry. But then what? My theory is she can only live here, that she will die if she leaves this ship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOW>
<DIRECTION>
Kelvin is still looking at Rheya, who is shaking a little harder; it's feeling like a seizure now.
</DIRECTION>
<SNOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you think she hasn't suggested that? It's the most obvious solution: Escape. She knows she can't leave here --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOW>
<KELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELVIN>
<SNOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, this one you love? What about the first one, the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space? You didn't love her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOW>
<DIRECTION>
Rheya is shaking much harder now, Kelvin tries to hold her still, but she's too strong. He stands, reluctantly, and watches her.
</DIRECTION>
<SNOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happens if she comes back? Is that polygamy? And even if you could take her home, how would you get her through? You think they're not going to notice her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOW>
<DIRECTION>
Rheya is shaking violently now, as if a rippling rhythmic force were coursing through her. Snow, as he looks dispassionately on the two of them:
</DIRECTION>
<SNOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never get used to them, these... "Resurrections".
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOW>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rheya continues her process of "waking up" -- it's violent, even sexual. She spasms to a peak of some sort, and then slowly returns to normal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelvin puts his hand on her forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gradually begins to open her eyes. She looks at Kelvin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It takes her a moment to realize she shouldn't be seeing him; she shouldn't be seeing anything. She should be dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She begins to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<RHEYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I? Why can't I die?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, right away. That's why you never saw me with anyone. You should've noticed that. I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOW>
<KELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELVIN>
<SNOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I can't leave with you. I won't make it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOW>
<KELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELVIN>
<SARTORIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want it coming back with us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARTORIUS>
<SNOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You go ahead. Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now. Everything's a blur. I like distinctions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOW>
<DIRECTION>
Snow lies down on his bed. Kelvin looks at Sartorius.
</DIRECTION>
<SARTORIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We do not have time to deal with this. Get the diode sail into position and let me know when the bias drive and the induction ring are at zero point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARTORIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Kelvin nods and obeys. He then takes one last look at the monitor to see Snow lying in bed. Kelvin reaches over and shuts the monitor off.

EXT. SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Prometheus moves away from Solaris.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ON SOLARIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After the ship has gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A soft black spot begins to form in the center of the planet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, inexorably, this black spot begins to expand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Within a minute Solaris has disappeared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelvin, back on Earth. Silent and still. And the rain continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches the activity; the cars, buses, and people moving to and fro.
</DIRECTION>
<KELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Earth.

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did that word mean to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have returned. Finally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Kelvin begins to walk.
</DIRECTION>
<KELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I work in the city now. After work I wander and lose myself. I am silent and attentive. I follow the current. I make a conscious effort to smile, nod, stand, and perform the millions of gestures that constitute life on Earth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelvin taking the train to the suburbs.
</DIRECTION>
<KELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will study these gestures until they become reflexes again. I will find new interests and occupations, but --

EXT. ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelvin makes his way toward his cabin. As he nears, his LABRODOR recognizes him and approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelvin pats the dog's coat.
</DIRECTION>
<KELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not... give myself. I will not give myself to anything or anyone, because I am haunted by the idea that I remembered her wrong. That I shaded my memory of her to suit myself. That I was unfair to her and caused her destruction. What if I was wrong about everything?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've come to believe that memory is a curse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CABIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelvin is near the front door, dog at his heel. He looks in as he brings his key to the lock and his face FREEZES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RHEYA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is in the living room, waiting for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is sitting on the sofa, looking toward the other side of the room. Sensing someone, she turns to see Kelvin, and her face melts into a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KELVIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Opens the door. He cannot speak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RHEYA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rises and moves toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They embrace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He breathes her in. She squeezes him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a long beat:
</DIRECTION>
<KELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you be here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELVIN>
<RHEYA>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhhh. Just stay with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay with me. Everything is forgiven. Everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHEYA>
<DIRECTION>
She sways with him, gently. His body relaxes.
</DIRECTION>
<KELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CABIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tableau of the cabin. The dog is on the front step, seemingly content despite the light rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As fog drifts in, we RISE, and soon the mist has nearly obscured the house. The fog turns into clouds and we get fleeting glimpses of the cabin, as we move farther and farther away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We stay in a translucent white stage for a few moments, until gradually the edges of a circle become apparent in the corners of the frame. Still there is a light rain sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
These dark, rounded edges penetrate further until they are forming the shape of a circle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The misty consistency begins to gain some color and body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we realize we are now looking at the surface of Solaris.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
