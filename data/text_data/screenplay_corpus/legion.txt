THE MOJAVE DESERT - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vast. Barren. No signs of life. A BLOOD RED SUN is sinking behind the distant mountains. The unbearable heat will soon become an unbearable cold. A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE. Solemn. Weary. Determined.

<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was a little girl, my mother would remind me each night before bed to be sure to open my heart to God, for he was kind, merciful and just. Things changed after my father left a few years later, leaving her to raise me and my brothers alone in a little place out on the edge of the Mojave Desert. She never talked about a kind and merciful God again. Instead she spoke of a prophecy. Of a time when all the world would be covered in darkness and the fate of Mankind would be decided. One night I finally got up the courage to ask my mother why God had changed, why was he mad at his children. "I don't know," she said, tucking the covers around me, "I guess he just got tired of all the bullshit."

And with these words the last trace of sunlight is SNUFFED OUT, leaving us in:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DARKNESS... A darkness filled with the sounds of SIRENS, GLASS SHATTERING, SPORADIC GUNFIRE...a CITY FALLING INTO CHAOS. TITLE: "Los Angeles, December 23rd - 1:02 a.m."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLOOD RED MOON reflected in a greasy puddle of water. Might just be the smog that's making it that ominous color. Then we notice something moving in the reflection. A dark shape, growing, coming down at us fast. Beat...then WHAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO BLACK BOOTS land hard in the water...and we're in:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DARK FIGURE in a tattered trench coat tumbles onto the pavement, hands out to slow the impact. A beat then slowly he climbs to his feet, recovering from what seems to have been quite a fall. He has chiseled features, shaved head, deep-set eyes. Looks like he's been through one hell of a fight. His name, we will come to know, is MICHAEL. He quickly checks out his surroundings, nothing but brick walls above him. Where'd this guy jump from? A RUMBLE of thunder...then RAIN starts to hammer down. Seems to motivate him. Michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body and dashes toward the mouth of the alley. He reaches the STREET just in time to see a FLEET OF POLICE CARS tearing around the corner, SIRENS WAILING, heading this way. He reels back into the alley way, ducks down behind a trash dumpster, as the BLUE AND RED LIGHTS of the POLICE CARS whip past. Michael waits for the lights to disappear, then he pulls a MASSIVE ORNATE KNIFE from his jacket. Considers it grimly. Runs his finger along its edge. Blood beads up. Razor sharp. Michael begins to peel off his overcoat, revealing his bare chest underneath...and skin literally covered with DARK TATOOS. Hard to see what they are in this light. As his coat falls to the ground, we DRIFT over to the BRICK WALL behind him where we see MICHAEL'S SHADOW crouch over, and then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...TWO LARGE SHAPES UNFOLD FROM HIS BACK, STRETCHING UP INTO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT ARE UNMISTAKABLY...THE SHADOW OF WINGS. The RAIN POUNDS harder, as if punishment from the heavens. The glint of the KNIFE coming down fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HORRENDOUS SOUND OF FLESH TEARING AWAY FROM BONE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...THE BLOODY KNIFE CLATTERING TO THE PAVEMENT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...FOLLOWED BY MICHAEL'S UNGODLY SCREAM RISING UP FROM THE ALLEY WAY. And then SILENCE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE GUTTER, AS BLOOD BEGINS TO FLOW FREELY, MIXING,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SWIRLING WITH THE RAIN...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREET - A SHORT WHILE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael, face tight with pain, trench coat back on, steps out of the alley, stares with determination at a dark storefront across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"GUN & SPORT WORLD"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - A SHORT WHILE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cavernous. A Costco for survivalists. Quiet except for the sound of RAIN, then... SMASH! Michael drops down through one of the skylights in a shower of glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael bursts in. Tosses a first-aid kit into the sink. His trench coat falls to the floor and here in the fluorescent light, we get a better look at him. His thin but stunningly well muscled body is TATTOOED shoulder to ankle with INTRICATE WRITING. The man's flesh is a living book. But the writing is in no language we recognize. He turns his back to the mirror, revealing two HORRIFICALLY OPEN WOUNDS running down between both shoulder blades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRESH. BLOODY. He threads a needle not with thread, but with FISHING WIRE, and begins to STITCH the wounds closed. BLOOD POOLS on the cement floor around his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trench coat and a shirt back on, Michael races along the ENDLESS RACKS OF GUNS, searching for just the right weapons, his every movement precise, as if he's trained his whole life for this. Weapon after ferocious weapon gets tossed into rifle bags. Whatever this guy's preparing for, it's big. Rifle bags filled, Michael heads for the exit. Stops cold. The place is locked up tight. Metal gate over the front doors, bars over the windows. How the hell's he going to get out of here?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAPD SQUAD CAR - DRIVING - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two COPS, world weary, cruise through downtown. That's BURTON behind the wheel, ESTEVEZ riding shotgun. The POLICE RADIO is ABUZZ WITH ACTIVITY. Busy night. Burton stares out at the city's rain soaked denizens with a deep hatred, the shadows looming in doorways, the streetwalkers.
</DIRECTION>
<BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn' animals. Nights like this I wish I could take a match to this city just so I could watch all these motherfuckers burn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURTON>
<ESTEVEZ>
<DIRECTION>
(LAUGHS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A good ol' boy barbecue, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Burton doesn't even smile. He's dead fucking serious.
</DIRECTION>
<BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A fresh start. That's what this place needs.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He holds his finger up like a pistol. Aims it at the people they pass, picking them off one by one.
</DIRECTION>
<BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pow! Pow! Pow!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Now Burton laughs, a dark, mean laugh. Estevez eyes his partner, wary.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTEVEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus... You know Burton, I'm so happy we get to share beautiful moments like this. They really brighten my da--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
KABOOM! Through the WINDSHIELD, we see a storefront EXPLODE just ahead, raining fiery debris onto the squad car. Burton slams on the breaks and the cops look up just in time to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael, bulging rifle bags in each hand, stepping brazenly out of the GAPING HOLE he's blown in the front of the store.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTEVEZ>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freeze!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Estevez and Burton are already out of the squad car, crouching behind the open doors, GUNS trained on Michael.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTEVEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop the bags! Hands on your head!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, the POP-POP of GUNFIRE. The POLICE RADIO CRACKLES with URGENT CHATTER. MANY VOICES TALKING AT ONCE. "Shots fired...Code Three...Officer down!" The cops shift about nervously, trying to stay focused.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(sensing their unease:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's starting. There isn't much time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The cops shoot a quick, anxious glance at each other -- "what the hell?" -- then they turn back to Michael.
</DIRECTION>
<BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut the fuck up and drop the bags now!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael lets the gun bags hit the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTEVEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hands on your head! On your head!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael slowly places his palms on his skull.
</DIRECTION>
<BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn around! Turn the fuck around!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael slowly turns around. Calm. Estevez rushes in to restrain Michael, grabbing his wrist, FINGERS TIGHTENING. Michael closes his eyes, a terrible decision made. And that's when he moves, a fucking blur! In an instant Michael's broken the cop's arm, spinning him helplessly around, turning him into a human shield. Now it's Michael who's in charge, gun to Estevez's head, facing off with Burton. Burton struggles to find a shot, can't.
</DIRECTION>
<BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let `em go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURTON>
<ESTEVEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take the shot, Burton!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTEVEZ>
<BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said let `em fuckin' g-g-g-g--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Burton starts to SHAKE, the words stuck in his throat like a skipping record.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTEVEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Burton!?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
THE STREET LAMPS BEGIN TO FLICKER AND STROBE, adding to the confusion. Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his WHOLE BODY QUAKING, heels CLICKING the pavement, as if some massive pressure were building inside him. And with the horrific sound of CRACKING BONES, BURTON'S MOUTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEGINS TO TWIST INTO AN IMPOSSIBLY WIDE SMILE LIKE A BIZARRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOWN! His eyes SNAP OPEN, focused, the force inside him now fully in control. Burton looks at Michael with calm recognition, his voice GUTTURAL..INHUMAN. A man possessed.
</DIRECTION>
<BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing, Michael? These weren't your orders.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Estevez looks at his partner with confusion.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTEVEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael, however, seems to know exactly who he's talking to.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm following my own orders now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you will die along with the child.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURTON>
<ESTEVEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Burton, you fuckin' know this guy?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM! Burton shoots his partner in the head. Estevez drops, leaving Michael without cover. Burton re-aims, but Michael's faster, already FIRING back. Bullets rip up the concrete. SMASH! The squad car window SHATTERS, Burton's chest EXPLODING!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And down he GOES, leaving Michael the only one left standing. Smoke rising from his gun. With soldier-like efficiency, Michael picks up the rifle bags and begins to load them into the trunk of the squad car. He gets in the car and FLOORS IT, ROARING AWAY, as the FLICKERING STREET LAMPS FINALLY GO OUT IN RAPID SUCCESSION, a wave chasing him, PLUNGING THE ENTIRE CITY INTO DARKNESS...

SMASH CUT TO:

JEEP HANSON (LATE TEENS) Bolts awake. Breathing hard. Covered with sweat.

<DIRECTION>
INT. JEEP'S ROOM - JUST BEFORE DAWN

Jeep switches on a lamp, illuminating this incredibly cramped bedroom. Not much larger than the bed itself. He's got shaggy hair, a sensitive face, clearly not big on sunlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT - PRE-DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A couple of ancient SILVERSTREAM TRAILERS are bathed in the eerie blue light of night's final moments. It looks like the trailers haven't moved from this patch of barren ground in decades. A single strand of colored Christmas lights dot the trailers roof lines, marking the season. One of the trailer doors CREAKS open and Jeep steps wearily out into the cool western morning. Home. Nothing but desert for miles in all directions, save for a two lane HIGHWAY and a weather beaten TRUCK STOP DINER that Jeep and his father will open for business in a few hours. Jeep gazes up to the diner's slanted roof where a large sign glows like a beacon in the darkness:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB" A beat as Jeep contemplates the sign.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay, Jeep?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jeep turns to see CHARLIE, a very pregnant girl of about twenty, standing in the trailer doorway, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. Even with the trailer-trash veneer, she's strikingly beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<JEEP>

	Sorry to wake you, Charlie.

She approaches Jeep. Sees the strain in his eyes.

He struggles for a moment, nods.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>

(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About me...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A glimmer of a smile crosses Jeep's face.
</DIRECTION>
<JEEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the only thing I like worrying about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEEP>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See what I mean? You're worried about a girl eight months pregnant and it isn't even your baby. Now that's enough to give anybody nightmares.
	</DIALOGUE>

Jeep turns away, dejected.
</DIRECTION>
<JEEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead, make fun of me. Everybody else does.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, I was only kiddin'. You know how much I appreciate everything you and Bob are doing for me, but a month from now, this baby'll have a new family and I'll have to start thinkin' about what the hell I'm doin' with my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
This is not news Jeep wants to hear.
</DIRECTION>
<JEEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're still going through with it...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEEP>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeep, I'm not ready to be a mama. Christ, I can barely take care of myself as it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<JEEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could help you. We could do it together, you know? I want to.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie smiles sadly at him, touched by his sweetness, but this just isn't where she's at.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta stop carryin' the weight of the world on your shoulders.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jeep nods, tries to hide the fact that he's dying inside.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(rubbing her arms)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now can we go back in? I'm freezing my ass off out here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<JEEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on. I'll be right there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie kisses him on the cheek and heads back to the trailer. He watches her, longing in his eyes. With the clank of the door, she's gone. And over Jeep's troubled look, the perennial holiday cheer of FRANK CAPRA'S "IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE" MIXES up.
</DIRECTION>

IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE PLAYING ON A CRUMMY TV Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey has just met Clarence, his guardian angel-in-training. The signal ROLLS and SNOWS in and out. We hear a WHACK, which causes the image to momentarily improve and then slowly roll back the other way.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOB HANSEN (late 40's), owner and proprietor of this fine roadside establishment, attempts to fix the old TV hanging in the corner above the counter by banging the shit out it. The restaurant itself has the kind of grungy diner charm you'd hope to find in a place last renovated in 1963. An old plastic Christmas tree strung with flickering lights and tinsel occupies a lonely corner. Next to that, a faded diorama of the NATIVITY SCENE. The kind you might order off the Shopping Network. Bob considers the TV with a frown. He deftly rolls an ENGRAVED SILVER ZIPPO back and forth over the nicotine stained fingers of his right hand. Must be a nervous habit. You can tell just by looking at the man that he's a beer drinker. Behind the counter, a black man named PERCY WALKER (60's) is cooking up a storm on the grill with spectacular one-handed dexterity. You do get pretty good at this sort of thing when your other hand has long been replaced by a METAL HOOK. The dog tags around his neck tell the story. His white cook's hat has been temporarily replaced by a red Santa hat.
</DIRECTION>
<PERCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lord as my witness, Bob, one of these days that thing's gonna hit you back.
	</DIALOGUE>

<PERCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, they got names for that kind a relationship.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The JUKEBOX on the other side of the diner starts up with the MERLE HAGGARD tune "I'M A LONESOME FUGITIVE". A stunning looking sixteen-year-old GIRL with dyed-black hair and a piercing or three, is leaning seductively over the jukebox, swaying gently to the music. The headband doubling as her mini-skirt reveals her knock-out figure in a way that really doesn't leave much up to the imagination. She's a billboard of rebellion.

	Really, how can she go out in public wearing that?

The stereo in this rig could shake mountains. KYLE WILLIAMS (late 20's) handsome as hell, thug style. A straight up bad boy. He passes a weathered road sign:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"ENTERING PARADISE FALLS, NEXT SERVICES 50 MILES" Kyle's expression says this is not good news. He grabs his cell phone off the passenger seat. No signal.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>

<DIRECTION>
He spots the truck stop diner just up the road ahead...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Escalade pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the lonely row of old gas pumps. Kyle gets out and surveys the scenery with dismay. Now in the daytime we see this is truly a place time forgot. Attached to the diner is a MECHANIC'S BAY. Grease stains and rusty car parts litter the ground. Behind the place is the SILVERSTREAM TRAILER we saw Jeep step out of earlier. The only thing here that looks fairly new is the UHAUL TRUCK parked in front of the garage with its hood up. Kyle grabs a crumpled hand drawn map from the front seat and flattens it out on the roof of the car. He spins it around. Which way is north?
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darren, your fuckin' directions suck, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He checks his cell phone again. No chance of a signal way out here. So he shuffles around to the side of the diner in search of a pay phone. The good news is that he finds one. The bad news is that it's been broken for ten years. Leaning next to the broken phone, however, is Charlie wearing a shabby, faded WAITRESS uniform stretched tight around her very pregnant belly. Adding to her perfect mother-to-be look is that cigarette dangling from her lips. The plastic name tag pinned to her chest says "CHARLIE".
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey...

She eyes him, mildly intrigued, takes a drag.

She lets out a long slow exhale.

She considers him for a moment, then pulls out a cigarette. Lights it off the end of hers then hands it to him. Kyle takes a drag, pulls out his crumpled map.

<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm okay. This guy's just lost.

Jeep nods, uncertain, eyes Kyle another moment, then he shuffles along out of sight. Charlie brings the cigarette back up to her lips. An awkward beat.

The DOOR JINGLES. Charlie and Kyle enter. Audrey's eyes light up when she sees Kyle. He notices her as well. How couldn't he? She's directing every ounce of sex appeal she has in his direction. Her parents, on the other hand, shoot a look of utter fear in Kyle's direction, as if he personified their worst suburban nightmare. Charlie heads to the register. Digs out a fresh pack of smokes from underneath the counter.

Bob walks back into the diner. Jeep is about to turn back to the garage when he notices something off in the distance. Ominous DARK CLOUDS line the horizon to the south like a living wall. He shifts his gaze up the highway to the north. Same thing. DARK CLOUDS are pushing their way over the distant mountains. A storm is coming.

Bob gives the TV one final wallop -- WHACK! And the picture snaps into FOCUS. Only it isn't the picture he was expecting. The STARK GRAPHIC OF THE EMERGENCY BROADCASTING SYSTEM and its accompanying HOLLOW TONE fill the diner. Everybody in the place stops and turns to the TV.

Percy grabs an old battery powered radio off a kitchen shelf. Switches it on. STATIC. He spins the dial until he reaches a clear signal. The same HOLLOW TONE of Emergency Broadcasting.

He pulls himself up. Grease covers his face and hands. The sound of a CAR APPROACHING catches his attention. He watches as a beat up EIGHTIES CUTLASS SUPREME pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the pumps. It's a mystery how anyone could see through the LAYER OF DUST on that windshield. After a moment the car door pops open and the LEGS OF AN ELDERLY WOMAN swing down to the ground, followed by the metal frame and wheels of a walker. The LITTLE OLD LADY gets out of the car, steadies herself on the walker, and then slowly makes her way toward the diner with the rickety frailness of an old turtle. Jeep watches her disappear inside. He then looks toward the horizon again. The WALL OF DARK CLOUDS are growing ever closer.

A FLY begins to buzz around Gladys's head. She doesn't seem to notice it.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>

Sandra nods at the old woman, unsure of what to make of that response. The fly that was circling her head, now lands on GLADYS'S FACE. It crawls across her cheek without her reacting in the least. Howard and Sandra exchange looks. Creepy. The door JINGLES and Jeep walks in. He heads straight for a quiet huddle with Bob. All the while though, he keeps one eye fixed on the old lady sitting at the table near the Andersons. Something about her...

GLADYS LUNGES AT HOWARD AND TAKES A MONSTROUS BITE OUT OF HIS

NECK! SHE PULLS BACK TO REVEAL A MOUTH FILLED WITH TINY

RAZOR SHARP TEETH. EVERYBODY FREAKS as Howard crumbles to the floor. Gladys rockets to her feet, knocking her table over. Blood covers her face and chest.
</DIRECTION>
<GLADYS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're all going to fucking die!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Percy is the first to react. From behind the counter, he whips a heavy metal frying pan at Gladys that knocks her head sideways. THWACK! BONES BREAK AND BURST FROM HER NECK. Impossibly, Gladys is still standing. She lets out an INHUMAN SCREAM and SCRAMBLES ACROSS THE DINER, knocking tables and chairs over in her wake. Bob pulls a shotgun from behind the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>

	Don't move!

But Gladys not only moves, SHE SCURRIES RIGHT UP THE FUCKING

WALL LIKE SOME KIND OF BIZARRE CRAB! Bob can't believe his eyes. But he gets over it real fast, as the crab lady rushes toward him -- ACROSS THE CEILING --
</DIRECTION>

UPSIDE DOWN! BOB PUMPS THE SHOTGUN, trying to take her down, but he can't track her fast enough. Instead he blows ENORMOUS HOLES in the ceiling, a rain of plaster. Gladys drops down right in front of Bob.

Gladys rockets straight at him! But Jeep's too afraid to move. He clamps his eyes shut, bracing himself for the end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! A RAIN OF BULLETS RIP INTO GLADYS, taking her down like an animal. Jeep slowly opens his eyes. His gun's still cocked. Gladys lies dead in a smoldering, bloody heap at his feet. He turns to see Kyle with smoke rising from the barrel of his silver plated WESTERN ARMS 45. If everyone wasn't so shocked, they'd probably be wondering why this guy is packing such serious heat.

Sandra looks fearfully up at Kyle, at the gun still in his hand.

	Don't look at me like that, lady! I'm tryin' to fuckin' help you! Now put your goddamn hands over the hole before your husband bleeds to death!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Obeying, she cups her hands over the hole in his neck, desperately trying to stop the flow of blood leaking out between her fingers. Percy scrambles over with a first-aid kit and together he and Kyle get to work on Howard's neck.

Across the diner, Audrey is pushed back into a booth, her knees pulled tightly to her chest, shivering. Her adult facade giving way to that of a frightened child A DROP OF RED HITS AUDREY'S CHEEK, causing her to look up and see Gladys's TRAIL OF BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THE CEILING. An ungodly horror.

Howard writhes as Percy pours alcohol on the wound. Sandra can't help but stare at Percy's hook. Meanwhile across the diner, Bob and Jeep peel back the tablecloth to examine Gladys' bullet riddled corpse. Kyle stands over them with Bob's shotgun trained on the body -- just in case. Gladys is a real horror show. Bones jut out at obtuse angles from her neck -- a result of the blow to her head from Percy's frying pan.

Michael remains silent. Doesn't seemed shocked in the least by what he's heard.

	So what are you doin' out here? Gotta say you don't exactly look like a police officer. Even one from L.A. Then again, you have to be, right? I mean, who the hell'd be crazy enough to steal a cop car?

Bob chuckles for a moment. When Michael doesn't respond in kind, Bob falls silent. Anxious. He slowly raises the shotgun again. Michael sizes up this raggedy group. His gaze drifts over to the loosely wrapped body in front of the diner. The plastic table cloth flaps wildly in the wind. Turning back to Bob:

In a BLUR OF MOVEMENT, Michael rips the shotgun from Bob's hands. It all happens so fast that Bob is stunned to find himself holding air. He's even more stunned to now have the barrel of the gun pressed to the bridge of his nose. Everyone freezes.

Michael's eyes flit momentarily in Charlie's direction. Considering her. The diner door opens and Percy steps cautiously out with hand and hook held up to show no threat. He's followed by Sandra and Audrey. Michael sees them, but offers no indication that he cares.

	Now that we're locked in here, what the fuck are we supposed to do?

A flicker of LIGHT. And then FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CUT THROUGH THE DARKNESS...coming to rest on Michael's pale face. Michael looks up at the ceiling.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hatch opens and out comes Michael followed by Bob, Percy and Kyle. They quickly take their places behind the "Paradise" sign. Pitch black surrounds them. The RUMBLE OF ENGINES is gone, leaving only the RUSH OF THE WIND coming up off the desert.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where the hell did they go?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Bob turns to Michael sharply.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, Rambo. You got us up here. Now you mind explaining what the fuck we're fighting?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael is about to answer, when:
</DIRECTION>
<PERCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Over the wind, another sound becomes audible. The delicate chime of a CALLIOPE.
</DIRECTION>
<PERCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hear what I'm hearing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PERCY>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...The hell is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The CALLIOPE MUSIC grows louder, the melody more distinct. Now we recognize the song: SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN. But instead of filling them with cheer, it fills them with dread.
</DIRECTION>
<PERCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It sounds almost like...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PERCY>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ice cream.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
TWO HEADLIGHTS appear in the darkness. And sure enough, an ICE CREAM TRUCK rolls slowly toward the diner. The EERIE CALLIOPE MUSIC emanates from a speaker on its roof. It's too dark to see who's behind the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got to be fuckin' kidding me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright. There's a safety switch on the side of your gun. Push it all the way down. Two clicks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The men quickly do as they're told.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now when this starts, you hold on tight, you hear me? If you don't, you're going to blow your hand off. Understand?
	</DIALOGUE>

Kyle, Bob shoot quick anxious looks at Percy.

<DIRECTION>
Jeep faces the boarded up front door, awkwardly holding the MP5, trying to assume a tough guy posture. If only he could stop shaking, it might be believable. Charlie and Audrey peer between the slats covering the windows. The ICE CREAM TRUCK'S HEADLIGHTS fan across the diner. Audrey and Charlie back away from the windows. Charlie stops next to Jeep. Senses him shaking. Rests a hand on his arm. And that seems to help...a little. Howard smiles weakly at the familiar sound of the CALLIOPE.

	Oh, honey, listen. It's the Ice Cream Man.

<DIRECTION>
The Ice Cream Truck pulls to a stop with its headlights facing the diner. Everyone aims their guns at the truck. Tense. From the Ice Cream Truck...a DARK BLOODY SHOE STEPS to the ground. MOVING up the long grey pant leg spotted with blood stains to reveal a skeletally thin man in tattered coveralls. Say hello to THE ICE CREAM MAN. He looks like he's been through hell -- literally. As he steps into the beams of the headlights we can see him even more clearly. He's tall. Too tall. His clothes don't seem to fit him. And he's unnaturally thin as if he's been stretched like taffy. If he got down on all fours, you might mistake him for some kind of spider. He surveys the diner, the garage, the roof -- assessing the situation. On the roof, the men wait for something to happen.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(WHISPERS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, he don't look that bad.

The Ice Cream Man's gaze snaps up to the roof. He heard.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
That's when the Ice Cream Man's JAW UNHINGES, STRETCHING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TORTUROUSLY DOWN TO NEARLY THE MIDDLE OF HIS CHEST! ROW AFTER ROW OF A RAZOR SHARP TEETH FORM with the sickening sound of CRACKING OF BONES. From his new mouth, the Ice Cream Man lets out an earth shattering HOWL. Everyone except Michael is practically hyperventilating with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get ready!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And the ICE CREAM MAN BOLTS for the diner with STARTLING SPEED! His movements aren't at all like those of a normal man, but rather like some kind of HUMAN INSECT. Michael aims.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Bullets rip into the creature's body, knocking him flat on his back. Still. Arms and legs in a twisted, twitching mess. Michael keeps his aim. Waits. The CALLIOPE music continues to play.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Not even close. A RUMBLING OF ENGINES. HEADLIGHTS. A freeway full of VEHICLES of every variety punch through the wall of dust, racing toward the diner. They are THE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COMMUTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now! Shoot now!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The men let loose with FEROCIOUS FIREPOWER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WINDSHIELDS SHATTER! TIRES BLOW OUT! ENGINES EXPLODE! Vehicles swerve and COLLIDE! DARK SHAPES bolt from the burning vehicles, scattering. In the FLASH OF BATTLE we catch glimpses of them: BUSINESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PEOPLE. CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. EVEN AN ENTIRE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM. All deformed by some demonic force. Many mere BALLS OF FLAME drifting through the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spread out! Don't let them get close to the windows!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The DARK SHAPES converge on the diner from all directions. They move so strangely fast it seems that their feet don't actually touch the ground. From the roof it's a full-on turkey shoot as the men follow Michael's instructions and cut down everything in sight. Their faces lighting up with each FLASH. SHELL CASINGS spray from their weapons like water drops from a sprinkler. BODIES BURST and crumble to the dirt. The creatures don't seem to be afraid of dying. Their strategy appears to be in their sheer numbers. With each wave, the dark figures get ever closer to the diner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BOB firing madly. Then... CLICK! CLICK! Oh, no. He's out of ammo.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shells!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Percy tosses him a box of shells. But Bob fumbles the catch and the box slides halfway down the sloped roof.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
With the gun still in one hand, Bob reaches frantically down for the ammo. Stretching... Further...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HIDEOUSLY WOUNDED MIDDLE-AGED HOUSEWIFE CATAPULTS UP FROM BELOW THE ROOFLINE! Her hair must have been in curlers before most of it BURNED AWAY. Her nightdress hangs in tatters off her body. Her jaw CLICKS RAPIDLY, as she clatters up at Bob like a GIANT INSECT. Bob tries to pull back, but he has no traction and he starts to slip down toward her. She's coming fast! Percy sees his friend in trouble.
</DIRECTION>
<PERCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bob!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Bob swings the shotgun like a club -- CRACK! -- knocking the bitch clear off the roof. But the move has made his slide even faster. He drops the shotgun, trying to hold on, but he can't stop!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOB IS ABOUT TO HIT THE EDGE WHEN THE HORRID WOMAN POPS UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM! She doesn't even have a chance to react as Bob does something akin to a swimmer's push right off her body! WHAM! The creature goes flying back off the roof and the opposing force halts Bob's slide.
</DIRECTION>
<PERCY>
<DIRECTION>
(extending his hook)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grab my hand!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Bob reaches up and clasps Percy's hook, praying that it stays on. But this chick ain't finished yet. Up she comes once more. Her razor sharp fingernails claw up the metal roof. SCREECH!
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gun!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<DIRECTION>
Percy tosses Bob a Glock. Fortunately this time Bob deftly catches it with his free hand just as the deranged woman pounces on him.

<DIRECTION>
MOUTH)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck off!

BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The back of her head EXPLODES. Her body goes limp. Bob struggles to push the corpse off of him.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>

Percy extends his hook hand, helping Bob ascend to safety.

Hiding in the shadows... listening to sounds of WAR just outside. Sandra squeezes her hands over her ears. A few feet away, Audrey clutches a butcher's knife. Jeep's eyes darting from one window to another. Trying to keep it together. Charlie is crouched down behind the counter, holding the handgun close to her pregnant belly. Distant EXPLOSIONS rattle the plates on the shelves. Charlie peers out from behind the counter to look at the front windows. Momentary FLASHES of intense light outline the closed blinds. Another FLASH lights up Charlie's face. Staring.

<DIRECTION>
ON CHARLIE staring at the window. CLOSER. Charlie's eyes go wide as -- SMASH! A DARK SHAPE crashes through the window. Glass, sand and dust swirl in. Audrey and Sandra SCREAM. Charlie springs up from her hiding place, gun ready. Jeep spins around, pointing his gun, searching frantically for the intruder. It's so dark!
</DIRECTION>
<JEEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is it?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Audrey shakes her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. She looks over at her mother. Sandra's eyes are closed. It's too much.

Suddenly Howard's body is TORN AWAY from Sandra. Something's got hold of his legs! That gets Sandra's eyes open!

<DIRECTION>
HUSBAND)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Howard!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Howard screams deliriously as he's dragged rapidly through the diner toward the broken front window. He flails about, desperately trying to grab a hold of something. Sandra scrambles after her husband. Reaching for him.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The creature reaches the window. Sandra dives for Howard's outstretched hands. She has him! The creature's progress is abruptly halted at the shattered window. It turns back toward Sandra -- a shaft of light falling across its face, reveals: A TEENAGE GIRL of about Audrey's age. Her skin is a deathly blue. Her pupils a GHASTLY WHITE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deep human fingernail scratches have torn open the bloated flesh on her arms, neck and face. The self-inflicted wounds of a drug addict. Her voice is not QUITE HUMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<TEENAGE_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See what you made me do, mother!?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sandra screams, holds on.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie and Audrey rush to Sandra's side, grabbing Howard's arms. Jeep is right behind them ready to fire at the creature, but with the women in the way, he can't get a clear shot. So he discards the gun and grabs Howard's arms. Howard screams as his body is torturously stretched. A human tug-of-war.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HOWARD'S FEET -- TWO MORE SETS OF SINEWY MUSCLE AND BONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAWS REACH THROUGH THE WINDOW AND GRAB HIS LEGS. Howard's body lurches further out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Howard!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Howard's torso is almost entirely out the window. Charlie daringly reaches for Howard's belt, desperate to gain leverage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER DISFIGURED HAND PUNCHES THROUGH THE BLINDS AND LOCKS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONTO CHARLIE'S ARM! Charlie screams as she's yanked painfully toward the window, losing her grip on Howard's belt. Through the broken window, she sees the face of a RAGGEDY LOOKING MAN. He smiles at her like a father coming home to his baby girl.
</DIRECTION>
<RAGGEDY_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(SWEETLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you are!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And he starts to pull her arm even harder...Other creatures suddenly notice her as well, focusing their attack as if she alone was their target. Jeep immediately let's go of Howard and dives for Charlie, grabbing her free arm just before she's pulled through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without the help, Audrey and Sandra can't hold on any longer. Howard is ripped from of his family's hands and out the window.

Only a few more inches separate Charlie and certain death through the window. Jeep's losing her!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FLASH OF STEEL. SCHING! Charlie and Jeep fall back into the diner, the claw like hands still grasping Charlie's arm no longer attached to their owners. Michael leaps over her, a butcher's knife in one hand, a machine gun in the other. He lights up everything in his path. The window blinds become a WALL OF FIRE. Creatures SCREECH and flee into the night, having successfully taken their first victim. Charlie flings the severed appendages off her and she and Jeep scoot away from the window. Hysterical, Sandra tries to push past Michael. She's going after Howard. He intercepts her before she can make it out.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me go! He's alive!
	</DIALOGUE>

Sandra slaps at him frantically as he carries her away from the window and thrusts her down into a back booth.

As Charlie climbs slowly to her feet -- a sudden pain. She clutches her belly. Winces. Jeep catches her arm to steady her.

</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Then Kyle notices the broken window, takes in the room, his excitement falling.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>

	Where's Howard?

No one responds. Sandra and Audrey are huddled together. Crying. Bob and Percy follow Kyle in, still shaking from the adrenaline.

Bob stares at Michael, uncertain how to respond to that.

In response to that, Charlie does the only thing someone can do when told such a thing. She LAUGHS.

Percy just stares at him, penetrating. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<PERCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was a kid my father would sit by my bed every night before I'd go to sleep and he'd say to me, Percy, if you don't wake up tomorrow, if it turns out that today was your last day on earth, would you be proud of what you've done in this life? Cuz if you ain't, then you better start gettin' square.

Kyle looks at Percy, fear in his eyes, then he turns back to the darkness...and the evil that surrounds them.

Bob plays with his trusty zippo with one hand and grills up some steaks with the other. He pauses in his cooking every few moments to take a slug from a can of beer. Can't get it down fast enough. Sandra sits at the counter across from him, staring at a prescription bottle tipped in front of her, pills spread around. Bob glances over, sees the devastation in her eyes. He pulls another can of beer from underneath the counter, pops it and places it in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>

She looks up at him. Smiles weakly. Takes a sip.

	Well I figure just cuz the world's coming to an end, it doesn't mean a man's gotta starve. All I can say is thank heavens they left the gas on.

Sandra takes another sip of beer. Considers it.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never much cared for beer. Howard's the beer drinker in the family.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The moment the words leave her mouth, the grief hits her again. She gathers up some pills from the counter, tosses them back and downs her beer like there's no tomorrow. This is a battle she's losing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile in a booth across the diner, Audrey is fiddling with Percy's old radio. Back and forth on the dial. Listening for anything. Nothing but STATIC. Up at the front of the diner, Jeep silently helps Michael nail broken table planks across the shattered window. He eyes the strange tatoos running down Michael's arms, the two jagged wounds visible above his shirt line.
</DIRECTION>
<JEEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you do...you know, before you came here...?
	</DIALOGUE>

Michael considers the question a beat, then:

<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was a soldier, a general, in His army.

</MICHAEL>
<JEEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what changed? What made you leave?

	<DIALOGUE>
	He lost faith. I hadn't.

Michael drives the last nail into place, securing the window.
</DIRECTION>
<JEEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what happens to you...after this is over?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael pauses a beat, as if unsure how much to say, then:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes we have to face the thing we fear the most in order to be free of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael picks up his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>

<DIRECTION>
Sandra spins around. Searching.

<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
It sure sounded like Howard.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me... Please...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
This time, it's clear where the voice is coming from. Sandra turns to face the BACK DOOR. A desk blocks it. Sandra ever so slowly approaches the door.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(from behind the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me. Sandra...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sandra is stricken. What the hell is she going to do? That's when Sandra notices the TRANSOM WINDOW above the door. She climbs onto the desk and stretches up until she can see out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SANDRA'S POV: Howard. Her husband. Ten feet away from the door. NAILED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TO AN UPSIDE-DOWN CROSS. But wait. It gets worse. His skin is covered with horrible black boils. And even worse than that. Howard's boils are breathing. Sandra goes slack with horror.
</DIRECTION>
<HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me, please!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Howard's torn open shirt reveals the BREATHING PUSTULES covering his body. He writhes in slow, excruciating agony.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Howard!

Sandra scrambles down off the desk and frantically pushes it away from the door. She's reaching for the dead bolt when Audrey and Kyle appear in the doorway.

<AUDREY>

Kyle races to restrain Sandra.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>

She struggles against him, throwing a wild elbow that tags Kyle in the face. Down he goes. Sandra is about to open the door when Audrey pounces on her.

Sandra and Audrey are locked in battle. Sandra slaps Audrey hard. Audrey stumbles over Kyle and hits the floor. Percy appears in the doorway. Now is her last chance. Sandra whips open the back door and that's when the world hits SLOW MOTION. Howard is there. A few feet away. Alive. Sandra races toward him. Just behind her comes Percy.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Howard!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And that's when the speed ACCELERATES TO NORMAL -- -- and the boils covering Howard's body explode -- spraying streams of dark fluid toward Sandra -- -- just at the moment Percy spins around her, shielding her from the spray, which hits him in the back. But he's not stopping. Percy pushes Sandra back into the diner, the door SLAMMING closed behind them. Percy releases Sandra, letting her stumble hysterically into the room. Kyle and Jeep grab her, forcing her to the ground. But she's not fighting anymore. Charlie turns to look at Percy who is still standing with his back to the door, breathing heavily.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Percy?

He takes a step forward, then falls to ground. The entire back side of his body is gone. Burned away.

Michael and Bob are tying Sandra to a chair. Not like it looks like she's capable of going anywhere, but you never know. Across the diner, Charlie eyes Michael cautiously. Michael never goes for more than a few moments without looking up at her. It's not lecherous. More like a protective father making sure his child hasn't strayed too far. In a booth, Audrey watches, red-eyed, as Michael restrains her mother. Then she returns her attention to Percy's radio. Tuning. Trying to find something, anything in the STATIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She brings her ear up close. Wait. Is that a VOICE? She adjusts the antenna, trying to bring the signal into focus. CLEARER.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY>

CLEARER. Yes. It's a VOICE!

Everyone drops what they're doing and quickly gathers around the radio.

THROUGH THE HAZE OF STATIC, A GRAVELY, TIRED VOICE. STRAINED

BEYOND BELIEF. BUT STILL BROADCASTING.

	If you're just joining us, we're getting some of the first bits of good news, if you can call it that, since this apocalypse began just twenty-four ago. A human militia has formed on the outskirts of Las Vegas and has begun to engage the enemy. Also down in the Four Corners area, we've been receiving unconfirmed reports of another resistance force gathering in Red Rock National in the northern Mojave Desert area.

Charlie stands at the sink, cigarette to her lips, water running, stealing a private moment. She takes a deep drag, feels the smoke filling her lungs, defiant. Then she catches a look at herself in the mirror, runs her hand along the curvature of her belly. Tears well up in her eyes, fear and anger overtaking her. She stamps out the cigarette in a fit of frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

It's quiet. DRIFTING past sleeping figures to find Charlie, wide-awake, sitting at a booth, lost in thought.

<DIRECTION>
(off Jeep's reaction:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember sitting there in the waiting room, absolutely sure I was doin' the right thing...And that's when the feeling started. Like I was falling into the deepest, darkest hole imaginable. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't speak. I kept thinking this must be what death is like. And when finally they called my name, I ran.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>

(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For a while after that I tried pretending that it was just cold feet, that I could go back if I wanted to, that I could decide to end it like I'd planned. Then I'd start to have that feeling again and I knew I didn't have a choice. Somehow this had already been decided. And it made me hate this thing that's been growing inside me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat, as Jeep considers her, then:
</DIRECTION>
<JEEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shouldn't say things like that, Charlie. It isn't right. You'll get through this. I know you will.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to him, the bitterness overtaking her:
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come you have so much faith in me, Jeep? God knows I've never given you or anybody else a reason to. Or is it that you just can't find any other hard-luck case to follow around?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jeep's face hardens. He gets up. Hurt. Frustrated.
</DIRECTION>
<JEEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, you're not the only who's suffered, okay? Let me know when you stop feeling sorry for yourself.

And with that, Jeep walks away, leaving Charlie to stare after him, disturbed and surprised by his response.

Audrey flips the safety.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I got it. All the way down. Two clicks.

She points the gun out into the haze like she's been holding one all her life. Off Kyle's surprised look:

Kyle considers her thoughtfully.

She smiles at this confession. Can obviously relate. He wipes a tear from her cheek. She leans in. Kisses him. Passionately. Desperately. His hands trace over her body. She claws at him. Her passion growing out of control. She's practically devouring him. Kyle can barely keep up. It's like something else beyond sensual need has taken over. She moves down his chest. Further. Kyle leans his head back. Further. Just then the SPOT LIGHTS that illuminate the roof sign come to life. The young couple stops to look up at the brilliant red word "Paradise" illuminated above them. Down below, the gas pumps LIGHT UP. The station's FLUORESCENTS flicker on.

A distant SCREECH from behind. Kyle and Audrey spin to look out over the back side of the diner. AN ARMY OF DARK SHAPES are swarming in fast. Kyle looks urgently back at the family. The father lifts the pump. Flips the lever.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a trap. They saw them coming and turned on the lights. It's a fucking trap!

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Get back in your car! It's a trap!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
But down below, the man can only hear the sound of RAGING WIND as he pumps the gas. Kyle fires his gun in the air. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! At the sound of gunfire, the man looks quickly up to the roof. His family heard it too and they start to SCREAM TO HIM. The man can only see silhouettes in this light, but he's not waiting around to see if it's friend or foe. Audrey watches in horror as the dark shapes reach the diner.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're not gonna make it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The father dashes to the driver's side. He throws open the door. But he's too late. He looks over his shoulder just in time to see a BLUR OF MOVEMENT RUSHING AT HIM. His BLOOD PAINTS the car windows. Kyle raises his MP5 to fire upon the dark shapes that surround the vehicle like swarming insects. The wife and boy scream hysterically as they are torn from the vehicle by skeletal hands.

<AUDREY>
<DIRECTION>
(pushing his barrel down)
</DIRECTION>

So Kyle makes a desperately courageous play. He leaps onto the roof's sloped overhang -- sliding fast -- he drops to the ground in front of the diner.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>

The Possessed move in from all sides, but Kyle is remarkably agile, dropping one after another in a stunning display. He closes in on the family, blasting back the creatures huddled around them.

The boy moves toward Audrey, stepping over Kyle's body. Audrey backs away. She looks toward the entrance to the diner. Blocked by advancing creatures. They're everywhere. She's trapped. She notices the open door to the MINIVAN. And so she BOLTS. Audrey dives into the car as the throng of creatures rapidly closes in. She hammers the auto door lock. CLUNK! She moves to the center of the car as gruesome faces press against the windows. A nightmare come to life.

With stunning calm, Michael marches straight for the pumps. IN THE MINIVAN, Audrey screams as the windows begin to CRACK. She's running out of time. Michael grabs a gas pump, flips the lever and points it at the minivan. What's he up to? The creatures covering the car turn to look at Michael as if they've just now noticed him. And that's when he starts spraying gas at them. But wait, there's more to this trick. Up comes Michael's Glock in his other hand and BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The spray of gas EXPLODES into a SPRAY OF FIRE! The MINIVAN is engulfed in flames. Creatures tear away from the car like fiery comets through the night. The windows EXPLODE, showering Audrey with tiny shards of glass. Michael drops the gas pump. He reaches through a fire rimmed broken car window and unlocks the door. Audrey looks up to see Michael's expressionless face CIRCLED

Charlie dashes behind the counter to the sink. She fills up a pitcher of water. She turns away from the sink with the filled pitcher... And SCREAMS! The YOUNG BOY with the lifeless white eyes stands before her wielding an ENORMOUS BUTCHER'S KNIFE. The pitcher shatters LOUDLY on the floor. The boy swings the knife at her, slicing open the waitress outfit covering her pregnant belly. Charlie tumbles back to the ground behind the counter. She frantically pushes herself away from the approaching boy.

But she doesn't have far to go before she'll run out of room to maneuver.

	C'mon, don't be scared. I just wanna play with your baby.

That's it. She's backed against the end of the counter! The boy raises the knife to strike. Charlie grabs a baking pan off a shelf. Swings it out in front of her body like a shield, as the KNIFE IS DRIVEN DOWN. CLANG! The knife hits the pan hard and stops. But the boy's hands don't. They slip off the handle and run right down the blade. The knife CLATTERS to the ground. The boy instinctively raises his hands to strike again, but there's no knife. Charlie watches in horror as the boy calmly realizes that his THUMBS ARE MISSING. Blood sprays from the stumps. Charlie pulls her legs in close then rockets them out at the boy's chest. He's catapulted away from her. Michael leaps over the counter, landing in front of Charlie, guns ready for action. But the boy is gone.

CRASH! THE DOOR IS TORN OFF ITS HINGES. A brilliant SPECTRAL LIGHT pours into the diner. Sandra is blinded. She raises a hand to block the light. And that's when Michael fires. BLAM! Sandra staggers back, blood dripping from the hole in her forehead, and...

...THE BABY GOES FLYING OUT OF HER HANDS! Charlie screams and the WORLD MOVES INTO SLOW MOTION... And everything suddenly goes very QUIET.

Michael fires again. Blowing Sandra's body back through the doorway. Jeep watches the baby sail SLOWLY through the air. The time for Jeep to act is now! Jeep DIVES for the baby...catching the bundle of rags mere inches from the ground! And then he looks up to see... The dark SILHOUETTE OF A MAN approaching from out of the spectral light. A MAN WITH WINGS. Jeep's eyes grow wide as the FIERCE ANGEL steps into the diner. But this looks like no angel we've seen before. This is a creature built for war. Rough hewn, battle scarred. His body armor making him appear disturbingly insect like. His wings are not feathery or gentle. Rather they are hard, mechanical, an organic machine. The angel's wings retract with clockwork-like precision. And now that we see the his face clearly, we notice his striking resemblance to Michael. We might even mistake them for brothers. His name is GABRIEL. Gabriel raises a massive, ferocious, strangely mechanical looking MACE in his powerful hands. And the world returns to NORMAL SPEED as Gabriel brings the mace arcing down at Jeep. Jeep rolls! CLANG! The weapon just misses him, hitting the floor in a spray of sparks, literally CRACKING THE GROUND. Gabriel brings the mace up again. Jeep won't be so lucky twice.

But Bob's heroic move has given Jeep time to get up and run with the baby for the back of the diner. He thrusts the child into Charlie's hands. And without even thinking, she pulls the child protectively to her chest.

Gabriel drops down in front of Bob, whipping his wings around like a deadly, RAZOR SHARP FAN! Bob stops firing, a look of surprise stretches over his face. His gun falling from his hands. Blood begins to pour out of the slice across his belly.

He pulls Charlie past the counter toward the back office. Jeep stops when he sees his father's broken body lying on the ground by the stove in a pool of his own blood. Bob's half open eyes focus on his son. In his outstretched hand is that goddamn ZIPPO LIGHTER... and next to that, a BROKEN GAS PIPE leading to the stove. Jeep is terrified.

He pulls back from Michael, raising the mace -- SCHING! -- LONG DEADLY SHARP SPIKES BURSTS FROM ALL ITS SIDES...as if it wasn't bad-ass enough. And the fight begins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's mace against machine gun and strangely enough, it seems under Gabriel's deft control, the mace is the vastly superior weapon. With the aid of his wings, Gabriel moves with staggering speed, defying gravity to avoid the rain of bullets. The place is getting absolutely shot to hell. Michael leaps from table top to table top as Gabriel brings the mace brutally down -- splintering everything it touches. Michael leaps onto the last unbroken table top -- spins to fire. Gabriel pushes into the air, jabbing a spike straight into the barrel of Michael's MP5. The gun explodes in Michael's hands, sending him rocketing backwards where he lands on the counter. Gabriel swoops in fast. Michael kicks him in the chest, sending him fluttering back. Michael thrusts himself to his feet. Gabriel recovers, jabs again. Michael grabs a hold of Bob's ceiling mounted TV for support and lifts his body just above the deadly spike. Michael kicks Gabriel in the head, momentarily stunning him. Michael dives at Gabriel, landing an awesome flurry of punches. Gabriel is rattled back by the assault. He clumsily lifts his mace and thrusts with it. Michael narrowly evades the razor point, which drives into a wall. Michael smashes down on Gabriel's wrist, CRACKING the bones. A swift kick to the chest and Gabriel is thrust crashing back, losing his grip on the weapon. Michael takes a running leap onto Gabriel's back. Gabriel launches wildly into the air, trying to throw Michael off. They hit the ceiling, but Michael hangs on. Choking the life out of Gabriel.

Gabriel flies into a wall in an attempt to crush Michael. He fails that but succeeds in leaving a massive dent. Gabriel runs/flies for the opposite wall. This one doesn't hold and the two enemies crash through it into the bathroom. Unbelievably Michael is still holding on. Gabriel is up. He thrusts himself back into the bathroom mirror. It shatters painfully behind Michael. Gabriel rages out of the bathroom and into the diner. Michael continues to ride him like a wild bull. Gabriel slams Michael into a wall once more. It's a brutal struggle. Gabriel spots his mace sticking out of the wall within arms reach. He grabs it, holding it futilely in front of him. From this angle he'd never be able to hit Michael with it. Gabriel's strength is giving way. Michael is winning. Gabriel lets out a tremendous ROAR and plunges one of the mace's long spikes into his own stomach. Michael's eyes go wide with surprise, his grip loosens. Gabriel has run them both through. Gabriel rips the mace from his body and stumbles forward. Blood pours from a huge hole in Michael's chest. Right through his heart. Gabriel looks down at the hole in his own belly. Not nearly as bad as Michael's. Apparently there's not a lot of blood left in this guy. Michael falls to his knees. Weakening. Gabriel looms over Michael. Michael looks up at him, blood leaking from his mouth.

Chunks of his armor and flesh are missing as well, including a large part of his head, revealing that under his human visage is a NIGHTMARISH CREATURE. Gabriel charges at Jeep fast. Jeep whips up his Glock, BLAM! Gabriel takes the bullet, then slaps the gun out of Jeep's hand. Jeep throws a wild punch, connects with Gabriel's chin, rocking him back. More annoyed than surprised, Gabriel knocks Jeep savagely to the ground. Jeep struggles quickly to his feet, comes right back at Gabriel swinging. But Gabriel simply knocks him to the dirt again.
