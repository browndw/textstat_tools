SLOWLY TRACKING down a long line of couples. Some with kids, some old, some young, all waiting to pay their $55 and pick up their marriage license.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HOLD on a young couple, late 20's, KEITH FISHER and his fiancee, LIZ GARRETY. Fisher has a blondish quality to him, unassuming, pleasant, attentive, a bit more reactive than he could be. Liz is quite attractive, but somewhat tense, and not at all happy about having to stand in this very slow moving line.

A reasonable question. Boyd thinks. BEAT.

	The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it. I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me... I can take care of this.

RALPH, in shock, staring, back-peddles...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAJOR ARTERIAL SPRAY as Ralph's jugular is severed. Ralph struggles. Boyd wrestles him back toward the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me! Don't let him bleed on the carpet!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOYD>
<DIRECTION>
And MOORE is there. Helping Boyd wrestle the SCREAMING thrashing Ralph into the bathroom. Ralph fights like a gilled Marlin. They shove him into the bathroom. Boyd slams the door shut. Holds it tight as Ralph tries to force it back open.
</DIRECTION>
<BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll bleed out! He'll bleed dry. Help me hold the door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOYD>
<DIRECTION>
And help they do. Michael, Moore and Adam all hold the door shut as Ralph continues to fight for his life. Slowly the force of his POUNDING eases. We hear Ralph slowing down... The thrashing slows... softer... The MOANS quiet... softer... Just a slight GURGLE... Ralph is going... going... Ralph is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE DOOR

Eight hands slowly peel off the bathroom door. Devastating SILENCE as the guys attempt to process this, the latest of developments... with Fisher staring, blotto.

The door slowly opens. Boyd first -- then the rest of the guy's heads slowly appear in the doorway.

</MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
And Moore is out the door, racing for a garbage can to relieve himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GUYS' POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An absolute blood bath. The walls are covered with Ralph's arterial spray. Tina lies, still dead on her side. Ralph has somehow "assumed the position" dead, head in the bathtub. A bizarre and gruesome sight. Boyd surveys the carnage, takes charge.
</DIRECTION>
<BOYD>

Fisher's response is to join Moore, as he searches for a garbage can to puke in. Michael just stares.
</DIRECTION>
<BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self- exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?

Adam sits in shock on the floor.

Fisher and Moore try to fix a broken chair.

Boyd starts to dismember Ralph with the pruning shears, like cutting the joints of a roasted chicken.

Adam stares at the wall.

Michael wraps one of Ralph's feet in plastic, puts it in a suitcase.

	So that's what we're doing.

	Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And... well... I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.

</ADAM>
<BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wrong. That is flat out wrong. hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strength of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.

<FISHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got to agree with that.

	That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this... Well that's just more than the man deserves.

Let us go from this day forward with new purpose and spirit. You have given us a second chance and let us take that second chance and use it as fuel to feed our fires of productivity so that the spirits of the two we now bury live on forever in the good deeds and positive achievements we from this moment on shall make our life's work...

TIGHT ON BARRY MORRIS, mid-40's, attorney.

<BARRY_MORRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see how this could have been kept from you. The facts are quite simple; last month Adam and Lois changed their will. They requested that you two, as a married couple, be the Custodians of Record for their estate including all properties, cash holdings, security holdings and... children. You are legal custodians of the Brenn Trust.

</MOORE>
<FISHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all out money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.

Fisher and Moore search for the graves of Tina and Ralph with flashlights and shovels.

<FISHER>

	I think it was over here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FISHER>
<DIRECTION>
They move into a new area and start poking around. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was over by those rocks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
Again they search, prodding into earth with their shovels. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fisher stops digging, tired, he pauses, shines his light around until...
</DIRECTION>
<FISHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FISHER>

Fisher moves to a new spot.
</DIRECTION>
<FISHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There. This rock is where I stood when I said the prayer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FISHER>
<DIRECTION>
He starts digging in front of the rock. The earth is soft.
</DIRECTION>
<FISHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bingo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FISHER>
<DIRECTION>
Moore and Fisher quickly start to dig, until, finally, Moore's shovel makes contact.

<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got it.

</MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
And they dig some more.

EXT. NEW BURIAL SITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The suitcases are unloaded. Fisher and Moore dig a new grave. Moore's back is to Fisher as he digs.
</DIRECTION>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been thinking about what you said that day. The prayer. About using this whole mess to bring out the good in me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
Fisher is directly above Moore, holding the shovel, looking down at the back of Moore's head.
</DIRECTION>
<FISHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FISHER>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.

(slowly raises the shovel over his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a good one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FISHER>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
Moore looks up to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FISHER, tears running down his face, the shovel high above his head, ready to bring it down hard onto Moore's skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOORE confused and then realization... CUT between Fisher above, poised to strike, Moore below, still and vulnerable. Their eyes locked for several beats. Finally...
</DIRECTION>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, Fisher lowers his shovel.
</DIRECTION>
<FISHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.

INT. FISHER'S CAR - HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Fisher drives, Moore rides shotgun, both mean are dirty, sweaty and tired.

	Well that ought to be about the end of that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<FISHER>

FISHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lost in his reverie, wakes up in a hair pin turn. The speedometer reads 80. They run out of road. The car skids on the shoulder, Fisher cranks the wheel, jumps the divider, into oncoming headlights. Fisher and Moore lit up bright...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGHWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fisher's car SMASHES head-on into another car. IN SLOW MOTION Fisher and Moore are launched through the windshield in an IMPLOSION of glass and steel, flesh and blood.

CUT TO BLACK:

We hear the sounds of SCRUBBING.

INT. FISHER HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON Liz, on her hands and knees, scrubbing around the toilet of what is clearly a filthy kids bathroom; soiled jockey shorts, Tonka trucks, mess everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O.S. we hear voices outside. Liz gets up off her knees, brushes a piece of hair from her sweaty face and peers out the bathroom window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON FISHER

EXT. BACK YARD

	</DIALOGUE>
</FISHER>
<DIRECTION>
Adam Jr. and Timmy, in ill-fitted Cub Scout uniforms, recite the "Scout Laws."

</ADAM_JR>
<FISHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see the salutes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FISHER>
<DIRECTION>
Timmy snaps out a fine salute. Adam balances on one crutch to salute but looses balance and falls flat on his face. He starts SCREAMING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVEAL Fisher, in a wheelchair, both legs amputated above the knee. He leans over, trying to help Adam Jr. up and his wheel chair tips over. Fisher falls on top of Adam Jr. who SCREAMS even louder, flailing arms and legs like a turtle on its back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVEAL Moore, in an electric wheel chair he operated with a mouthpiece. As he is paralyzed from the neck down, he's no help at all. Timmy suddenly snaps.
</DIRECTION>
<TIMMY>

OUT THE WINDOW - DOWN IN THE BACK YARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam Jr. gets back on his feet, with the begrudging help of Timmy. As Fisher struggles to hoist himself up, back in his wheelchair...
</DIRECTION>
<FISHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember a scout is helpful! A scout doesn't scream in the face of adversity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FISHER>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, O.S. from the bathroom, Liz WAILS. Fisher looks up at the window... LONG BEAT...

The boys recite the "Scout's Oath" as Liz's deep, heaving, wailing SOBS grow in intensity O.C.

<ADAM_JR_TIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM_JR_TIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
CRANE UP, past Liz at the window, out of the yard, over the house, WIDER to reveal the surrounding track-like homes, housing track-like families, with track-like nightmares as Liz's plaintiff wails echo the communal despair of the human village.

THE END
