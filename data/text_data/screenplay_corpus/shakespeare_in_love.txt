INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SKY. Over which a title "LONDON--SUMMER 1593" appears. Title card: In the glory days of the Elizabethan theatre two playhouses were fighting it out for writers and audiences. North of the city was the Curtain Theatre, home to England's most famous actor, Richard Burbage. Across the river was the competition, built by Philip Henslowe, a business with a cash flow problem...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...The Rose...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gradually a building is revealed, The Rose Theatre, three- tiered, open to the elements and empty. On the floor, roughly printed, a poster--torn, soiled, out of date. It says:

The theatre owner, PHILLIP HENSLOWE, is the man screaming. HENSLOWE'S boots are on fire. He is pinioned in a chair, with his feet stuck out over the hot colas of a fire burning in a brazier. He is being held in that position by LAMBERT, who is a thug employed by FENNYMAN, who is the owner of the VOICE. The fourth man, FREES, is FENNYMAN'S bookkeeper.

INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small cramped space in the eaves of a building. A cluttered shelf containing various objects, wedged between crumpled pieces of paper. Among those we have time to observe: a skull, a mug that says A PRESENT FROM STRATFORD-UPON-AVON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At infrequent intervals further pieces of crumpled paper are tossed towards the shelf. The man who is throwing them, WILL SHAKESPEARE, is bent over a table, writing studiously with a quill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see what he is writing: Will is practising his signature, over and over again. "Will Shagsbeard…W Shakspur…William Shasper…" Each time he is dissatisfied, and each time he crumples, and tosses it away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly WILL becomes impatient. He jumps up and goes to the loft area in the rafters, where he sleeps, and starts to pull on his boots. At this point the door opens and HENSLOWE walks in. He is out of breath and his feet hurt.
</DIRECTION>
<HENSLOWE>

</DIRECTION>
<MAKEPEACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and the Lord shall smite them! Yea, harken to me. The theatres are handmaidens of the devil! Under the name of the Curtain, the players breed lewdness in your wives, rebellion in your servants, idleness in your apprentices and wickedness in your children! And the Rose smells thusly rank by any name! I say a plague on both their houses!

As HENSLOWE arrives the door closes in his face. A sign identifies the place as the premises of Dr. MOTH, apothecary, alchemist, astrologer, seer, interpreter of dreams, and priest of psyche. HENSLOWE looks puzzled.

DR. MOTH sits by the couch, listening to WILL and occasionally making a note on a pad he holds on his knee. What we have here is nothing less than the false dawn of analysis. The session is being timed by an hourglass.

WHITEHALL means nothing yet. We are behind closed curtains on a stage busy with preparations for the imminent performance of Two Gentlemen of Verona. This is not a theatre but a banqueting hall, as we will see.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RICHARD BURBAGE is to play "PROTEUS." A BOY PLAYER will play "SILVIA," and last minute improvements to his makeup etc. are being applied by BURBAGE'S mistress ROSALINE. "LAUNCE," one of the clowns, is the famous comedian WILL KEMPE. "LAUNCE'S" dog, CRAB is in KEMPE'S charge and is not helping much. There is no set. A helpful placard reading VERONA--AN OPEN PLACE, is ready to hand. MUSICIANS can be heard tuning their instruments. From the other side of the curtain there is an expectant bubbub. KEMPE leads the dog into the wings and rummages in a box of proops. He finds a skull. He has one foot on the box, his elbow on his knee, he looks at the skull…in other words he reminds us of Hamlet. We see this from the POV of WILL, who is just entering through a door backstage.

The hill is crowded with lords and ladies, bowing ELIZABETH to her seat, which is raised high on a pedestal, affording the QUEEN an uninterrupted view of the play, and the audience an uninterrupted view of the QUEEN. Trumpets sound.

Close on a small piece of paper: a quill is writing "W. Shakespeare." WILL rolls the paper up carefully and slips it into the mouth of the snake bangle.

With BURBAGES'S presence accounted for on stage, ROSALINE curls an arm around WILL'S neck. They kiss hungrily. After a moment, WILL pulls back.

	When will you write me a sonnet, Will?

WILL takes the snake bracelet and slips it onto her arm. ROSALINE looks at it, then at WILL. Then they kiss again, but WILL is distracted by the sound of coughing from the auditorium.

QUEEN ELIZABETH'S idiosyncratic laugh rises above the others.

<QUEEN>

She throws a sweetheart on the stage and the dog wolfs it down. Everyone applauds.

Now we meet VIOLA. VIOLA DE LESSEPS is twenty-five and beautiful, and she is laughing with great natural enjoyment. She sits slightly apart from her small family group--her parents, SIR ROBERT DE LESSEPS and LADY MARGARET DE LESSEPS. Part of the group but seated behind as befits her lower status is VIOLA'S NURSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elsewhere is LORD WESSEX, our villain. WESSEX is in his forties, dark cruel, self-important. He has noticed VIOLA. The nurse notices him.

Now we see that VIOLA knows the speech by heart, and is silently mouthing it with the actor.

INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILL comes into his room, goes straight to his table in the window, and arranges pen, ink, and paper. Now he has his ritual: he spins round once in a circle, rubs his hands together and spits on the floor. Then he sits down, picks up his pen, and stares in front of him. PAUSE. Then he begins to write.

The NURSE is undressing her, though VIOLA tries intermittently to push her away. She is still bright with excitement.

<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I liked the dog, for laughs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?

<VIOLA>

	All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.

</VIOLA>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like Valentine and Silvia?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.

<DIRECTION>
It does not take four lines of "VALENTINE'S" speech to confirm for us, if confirmation be needed, that THOMAS is VIOLA. For WILL, amazement at hearing his own words soon gives away to something else. He is captivated. He has found his "ROMEO".

EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BANKSIDE. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILL emerges from the theatre into a street throbbing with nefarious life. Whores, cutpurses, hawkers, urchins, tract-sellers, riffraff of all kinds in an area of stews (lowdown pubs), brothels and slums. It is some time before WILL spots THOMAS, way ahead of him in the crowded street. The chase is taking them to the riverbank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE RIVER. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When WILL gets to the riverbank he sees that THOMAS is in a smallish boat being rowed upriver and in midstream. The river is quite busy, and among the boats there are a number of waiting "taxis." WILL jumps into the nearest one and shouts at the "Taxi Driver" BOATMAN.

<MUSICIAN>

</MUSICIAN>

The sound of hooves gives hardly any warning as a GALLOPING HORSEMAN thunders through the MUSICIANS who have to leap out of the way. It is WESSEX arriving at the house, with his usual good manners. Will watches WESSEX skid to a halt and enter the house.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. BANQUETING ROOM. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILL has got in with the MUSICIANS. Competently enough he strums along with them on the bandstand. Two dozen guests are enough to crowd the space for dancing. WILL glances around, looking for THOMAS KENT. He stops a passing SERVANT, helping himself to a snack off the man's tray.

<WESSEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WESSEX>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on WILL--watching the dancing. Then he sees VIOLA in the crowd. He turns to blood. Love at first sight, no doubt about it. VIOLA has not seen him. She is doing a daughter's duty among her parents' friends. The guests form up to begin a changing- partners dance (the very same one you get in every ROMEO and JULIET).

WILL leaves the bandstand and is moving trancelike to keep her in view between the dancers and onlookers. VIOLA moves through patterns of the dance until…as night follows day, she finds WILL opposite her. He has insinuated himself into the dance. VIOLA gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master Shakespeare

WILL reacts, surprised by her reaction. The dance separates them. VIOLA finds herself opposite WESSEX.

EXT. DE LESSEPS' GARDEN/VIOLA'S BALCONY. NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
There is a lighted window on the balcony. VIOLA, dressed for bed, and the NURSE pass across the lighted space. WILL is in the garden. He sees her. The light in the room is extinguished. WILL sighs. Then VIOLA comes out onto the balcony in the moonlight. WILL gasps. He watches her. VIOLA sighs dreamily.
</DIRECTION>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Romeo, Romeo . . . a young man of Verona. A comedy. By William Shakespeare.

WILL reckons that's a good enough cue. He comes out of hiding, and approaches the balcony.

But she goes inside. WILL looks around and sees that there is, as ever a convenient tree. He starts to climb up toward the balcony. When his head is nearly level, a soft figure comes once more onto the balcony. WILL pops his head over the parapet and is face to face with the NURSE. The NURSE gives a yell. WILL falls out of the tree.

EXT. DE LEESEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT.

Male voice shout to each other inside the house, candle flames appear in different windows, the garden door is flung open, revealing SIR ROBERT with candelabra in one hand and sword in the other.

VIOLA opens the door. She has changed hurriedly--too hurriedly: the effect of her glorious hair falling to her bare shoulders is spoiled by her mustache. Fortunately, the NURSE spots her before WESSEX does and by coming forward to greet her, the NURSE manages to shield Viola from view, communicate the problem, and announce WESSEX'S presence, so that by the time the NURSE has passed by VIOLA and let herself out of the room, the moustache has disappeared.

	I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?

	Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!

The boat scrapes on the jetty of the DE LESSEPSES' house. The bump throws THOMAS into WILL'S arms. He holds her round the shoulders. His words have almost unmasked her. The closeness does the rest. She kisses him on the mouth and jumps out of the boat.

WILL is half-naked. VIOLA is down to her petticoat, and chemise. The petticoat comes away. WILL flings it aside. He takes off her chemise. He is startled to find that she is tightly bandaged round the bosom. WILL finds the loose end and spins her naked.

The NURSE, drags a chair--a rocker--outside the bedroom door, and takes up her position. She sits down, keeping guard. Pretty soon there comes the regular creak of VIOLA'S bed. The NURSE fans herself furiously with her little lacy fan. She crosses herself. A CHAMBERMAID comes along the gallery outside the bedroom door. She is dusting her way along. The CHAMBERMAID becomes aware of the regular creaking. She pauses. The NURSE begins to rock in her chair, keeping time with the creaking from within. The CHAMBERMAID stares at the NURSE.

The way these royal routs work is that guest mill about, chatting, bowing and generally behaving gallantly, while QUEEN ELIZABETH creates a vortex around her as she passes through the throng, occasionally honouring somebody with a couple of words, until she arrives thankfully at the best chair…where she establishes a headquarters. Her current LORD IN WAITING ferries the lucky few forward to a brief audience with the QUEEN, each giving way to the next. VIOLA and WESSEX are, respectively, dipping and bowing as they are greeted by people who know them…Will, in close attendance, joins in gratuitously, bowing until VIOLA nudges him and reminds him to curtsey instead. The QUEEN'S LORD IN WAITING plucks WESSEX'S sleeve.

We are in Act III Scene I. NED ALLEYN as "MERCUTIO" and NOL as "BENVOLIO", and two "MONTAGUE" sidekicks are in occupation of the stage, when the "CAPULETS" swagger in, four of them headed by JAMES HEMMINGS as "TYBALT."

<DIRECTION>
But suddenly six more men and a dog invade the stage, ready to fight. BURBAGE and the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN have arrived to avenge BURBAGE'S honour with swords, clubs, and a bucket (containing pig swill).
</DIRECTION>
<BURBAGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is that thieving hack who can't keep his pen in his own ink pot!?

WILL has already leapt up onto the stage.

<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this rabble?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
BURBAGE aims a blow at WILL, who ducks and grabs a stave from the nearest actor, and parries the blow. He swings at BURBAGE, a CHAMBERLAIN'S MAN swings at WILL, THOMAS cries out, someone else slashes the stage hangings bringing down the drapes, and in a moment the ADMIRAL'S MEN and the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN, using their much rehearsed skills, are brawling with weapons and fist, using everything short of unbuttoned rapiers. CRAB, the dog, is yapping and snapping at any legs he can reach. HENSLOWE, a little slow to catch up on the situation, checks the page in his hand. FENNYMAN, much slower to catch up, watches enthralled.

But now HENSLOWE has worked out that these actors don't belong, nor does the scene. he enters the fray, but his interest is protecting his property. Big burly RALPH is using a couple of unlit torches as weapons; he breaks one of them over an enemy's back and HENSLOWE turns on RALPH

<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
He gets back onto the stage, where the goings on are worthy of the Four Musketeers and Robin Hood combined, with SAM GOSSE, dressed as "JULIET," fighting with the best of them. There is a stack of cushions, stored for the expensive seats, and as the stack s knocked over, NED ALLEYN and others grab cushions to use as shields. Soon cushions are being ripped, and the air is full of flying feathers. The trap door in the stage opens, VIOLA'S head pops up. She looks around and, surrounded by milling legs and floating feathers, a boot catches her sideways and half knocks her wig off. In danger of having her cover blown, she ducks down again, leaving the trap open just nicely for Will to plummet down it.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. UNDER THE STAGE. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The battle rages. FENNYMAN, alone now in the auditorium, continues to watch entranced. It's the greatest show he's ever seen. HENSLOWE is desperately trying to rescue odd props that have been seconded to the fight. Someone picks up a tree that is to be used in Romeo. HENSLOWE yells.
</DIRECTION>
<HENSLOWE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need that for the balcony scene!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENSLOWE>

FENNYMAN notices this, and it rings a distant bell. He looks around the realises that some of these faces are unfamiliar. The tree comes crashing down on RALPH'S head. FENNYMAN looks at HENSLOWE.

He collapses on to a broken bench. FENNYMAN comes over to him, grabs the script pages from his pocket, and consults them to confirm what he has now begun to suspect: that this scene is not in them.

	Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
	</DIALOGUE>
</FENNYMAN>
<DIRECTION>
And he delivers a telling blow to a passing CHAMBERLAIN'S MAN, who wheels off the stage. LAMBERT meanwhile is making short work of the rest of the opposition, receiving help with the thorny business of identification from SAM. Stray members of the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN are running from the theatre, as BURBAGE, fighting a heroic last stand, is tipped backwards by FENNYMAN off the stage and into a bucket of swill. A PAUSE. Then NED starts applauding. The others, weary from fighting, start applauding too, from all levels of the theatre. FENNYMAN looks around, starting to beam, as a din of encores and bravos engulf him. A star!

That goes down every well with the entire COMPANY…except for VIOLA and WILL. He looks at her, helplessly, then makes as if to say something. VIOLA ducks away from him and blunders blindly out of the street door, in tears. VIOLA passes PETER who is coming in from the street. WILL, attempting to follow VIOLA, is grabbed round the shoulders by PETER…who, we now see, is in a highly emotional state.

This is where WILL has come. The church is empty, but for the demented, grieving figure of SHAKESPEARE, kneeling, praying, weeping, banging his head, in his private purgatory, dimly lit by tallow candles, gazed upon by effigies of the dead and images of his Redeemer. He is wet, bedraggled, weeds and leaves in his hair.

EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY.

A lovely sunny morning. The church bells are ringing. VIOLA and the NURSE, mounted, approach. VIOLA rides sidesaddle on a beautiful horse, and is followed, rather like Quixote by Sancho, by the NURSE on a less impressive animal.

Riding in the opposite direction, is WESSEX. And what a happy day it is. He sings and hums to himself merrily. Here is a man who has heard wonderful news. He sees VIOLA and greets her merrily.

The NURSE is holding VIOLA up as they enter the church. VIOLA seems catatonic. The NURSE lowers her onto a seat and sits down next to her.
</DIRECTION>

As they sit, the CHOIR enters singing. WESSEX, who is sitting in the next pew, looks about him with interest. He hasn't been in a church for years. What he sees turns him to jelly. He sees WILL SHAKESPEARE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on WILL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILL is a spectral, bedraggled figure, backlit by a great shaft of light, he would look like a ghost at the best of times, and this is the worst. Bleeding from where he has banged his head, bedraggled and ravaged by the night, he stands in a side chapel staring at WESSEX.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WESSEX gasps and sweats, and sees WILL raise a quivering accusatory finger at him. WESSEX cracks. He starts to mumble.
</DIRECTION>
<WESSEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, spare me, dear ghost, spare me for the love of Christ!

Now VIOLA sees WILL. She is still paralysed, and seems at first unable to take him in. She watches with detachment as WESSEX starts to back out of the church, finally running in terror.

But the scene is continuing with VIOLA dressed as "THOMAS." Somewhere behind and up above the stage, in a deserted corner among rigging, bits of scenery, etc., they speak the lines and we hardly know ourselves whether it is rehearsal or lovemaking.

And into this heaving composition comes a little white mouse, unseen my them, climbing through a knot hole in the planking behind VIOLA'S head.

An adjacent knot hole reveals a human eye and we do not need to be told it is JOHN WEBSTER'S.

VIOLA reacts. She almost gives herself away. But the fight has started.

WESSEX slashes at WILL. WILL knows how to fight. He parries and thrusts. WESSEX is surprised. The fight goes fast and furious around the stage, until WILL thrusts accurately at WESSEX'S chest…and would have killed him but for the button on his sword-point.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WESSEX grapples with him, and now it becomes a parody of the Hamlet duel; WESSEX'S unbuttoned sword falls to the ground, WILL puts his foot on it, tosses WESSEX his own safe sword, picks up Wessex's sword and continues the fight until he has WESSEX at his mercy.

TILNEY is unstoppable. He jumps on the stage…and seizes SAM GOSSE. Before WEBSTER or anyone can intervene, TILNEY pulls up his skirt, ignoring SAM'S rather gutteral yell of protest and pulls down SAM'S drawers.

TILNEY'S face is a study. So is everybody else's. WEBSTER rolls his eyes (oh, these stupid grown-ups!) and deftly throws one of his mice onto "ROMEO'S" hair. VIOLA gives a shrill scream, the startled mouse descends her neck via VIOLA'S ear, and seeks an entry into her collar. By which time VIOLA has gone berserk and torn off her wig. Her hair is pinned up but there is no question her gender. WILL is paralysed. VIOLA gives him a look of terrible despair and apology.

	I'll see you all in the clink! In the same of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth
	</DIALOGUE>
</TILNEY>
<DIRECTION>
And an authoritative voice from the audience interrupts him.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Tilney…!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
It is QUEEN ELIZABETH herself, descending now, her hood and cloak thrown back. She is an awesome sight. A shaft of sunlight hits her.
</DIRECTION>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a care with my name, you will wear it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
There is a general parting of the waves, soldiers and actors, a general backing off and bowing as QUEEN ELIZABETH takes the limelight.
</DIRECTION>
<QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Queen of England does not attend exhibitions of public lewdness so something is out of joint. Come here, Master Kent. Let me look at you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
VIOLA comes forward, and is about to curtsey when she catches the QUEEN'S eye, an arresting eye, which arrests the curtsey and turns it into a sweeping bow.
</DIRECTION>
<QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, the illusion is remarkable and your error, Mr. Tilney, easily forgiven, but I know something of a woman in a man's profession, yes, by God, I do know about that. That is enough from you, Maser Kent. If only Lord Wessex were here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is, Ma'am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The voice belongs to JOHN WEBSTER. He points firmly at a figure in the audience, WESSEX, trying to look inconspicuous.
</DIRECTION>
<WESSEX>
<DIRECTION>
(weakly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Majesty
	</DIALOGUE>
</WESSEX>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was a wager, I remember…as to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to WEBSTER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?

</QUEEN>
<WEBSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>

</WEBSTER>
<DIRECTION>
The QUEEN fixes WILL with a beady eye.
</DIRECTION>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master Shakespeare. Next time to you come to Greenwich, Come as yourself and we will speak some more. WILL bows deeply. The QUEEN turns to leave. The waves part for her.

A gaggle of the QUEEN'S favoured courtiers wait by her carriage. WESSEX is hurrying down the exterior staircase as the QUEEN emerges from the theatre.

	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</WESSEX>
<DIRECTION>
VIOLA has come out of the theatre, amongst some of the other players. The QUEEN catches her eye.
</DIRECTION>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (she turns to VIOLA)

(to WESSEX)

	<DIALOGUE>
	How much was the wager?
	</DIALOGUE>

</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
VIOLA nods, heartbroken too. For a long moment they cannot say anything to each other. The she holds up Wessex's purse.
</DIRECTION>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.

<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
