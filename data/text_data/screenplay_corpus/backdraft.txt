INT. FIRE STATION 17 - STORAGE ROOM - 20 YRS. EARLIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darkness. Then the GLINT of a flashlight. Its beam rocks crazily to and fro across the inside of a small storage room as we hear two children arguing.
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're doing it wrong.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You're doing it wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_KID>
<DIRECTION>
It's hard, but we get a sense of the room in the whipping beam of light. Huge, dark coats lined up like sides of beef on steel batons. Bent, stained helmets hung like African masks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beneath them BRIAN, 7, and STEPHEN, 12, are trying to struggle into a pair of the ludicrously massive coats over their pajamas.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't go like that.

<BRIAN>

	If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
The door suddenly opens, morning sunlight roaring in. It's a fire station storage room full of fire gear. A fireman stands in the doorway, tall, athletic, their father; DENNIS McCAFFREY.
</DIRECTION>
<DENNIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's going to die?

INT. FIRE STATION 17 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two boys tromp out of the closet. The rubber turn-out boots are as high as their thighs. The ends of the coats drag on the floor. They salute, Brian's arm just an empty sleeve. Dennis kneels down and re-fastens Brian's coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DENNIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENNIS>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And DIE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

Dennis scoops Brian up and loads him into the fire engine cab. The other three firemen climb aboard and take their places.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a cough of diesel, a crunch of gears, and the engine is pulling out of the station.
</DIRECTION>
<DENNIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hit the button, Brian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENNIS>
<DIRECTION>
Brian stamps his foot on the siren button. The red light snaps on, the siren growls and blares, and they're off down the street. Brian turns around in his seat and, at the last instant before the corner, makes eye contact with his older brother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stick their tongues out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The engine howls its way through the city. Brian, sandwiched between his father and Adcox, looks out in wonderment at intersections zipping past like picket fences, at people on sidewalks holding hands over their ears, at the red emergency lights bouncing crazily off shop windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUILDING - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lazy smoke curls out the second story of a commercial block. Medium deal. The engine pulls up and the firemen are jumping off like ship rats. Dennis opens his door, hops down, and pauses just long enough to point a serious finger at his son.
</DIRECTION>
<DENNIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay near the truck.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(winks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And keep an eye out for us, huh? We're short handed today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENNIS>
<DIRECTION>
Brian nods vigorously, taking the command seriously. Dennis smiles and is off, dragging a hoseline with his crew toward a doorway they disappear into. Brian climbs down from the cab.
</DIRECTION>
<ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't stray too far, little man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
Brian smiles to the pumper operator. He just wants a better look. And he gets it: Smoke turned evil and dark now, taking on purpose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUILDING - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a level of apartments above the storefronts. As Brian watches, a window opens and out steps his father and Adcox onto a small fire escape. Their attention's on the next window over, out of reach, wrapped in leaky smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Dennis climbs up onto the fire escape railing, armed with only an axe, and JUMPS across to the next metal balcony. A ballsy, dangerous move. He kicks in the window, breaks out the frame with his axe, and dives in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat later he reemerges on the balcony with a terrified, smudged little girl. He hands the little girl over the railing to a fireman now coming up the more traditional way -- a ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dennis's face lifts and grins at Brian; dirty, bigger than life, invincible. He winks a wink only possible between fathers and sons and he's gone again, back into the swirling darkness. As Brian stands there, full of love, full of pride, he sees a piece of awning along the roofline crack; releasing a sickly yellow tongue of flame that slinks over the roof. The flame seems to pause, to stare at Brian a beat. Shhh, don't tell anyone. Brian is transfixed, his little head staring up in astonishment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nobody else has noticed it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian can see his father and Adcox through the window; probing, looking for the flame lurking just above. Brian starts to call out in a small, hesitant voice,
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to call louder... But suddenly everything is happening very fast in slow motion:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Brian can see Adcox testing the ceiling with a pike pole as Brian steps forward, under the power of a flame that beckons him as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dennis suddenly THROWS his body against Adcox, knocking him clear just as a flame EXPLODES DOWNWARD from the ceiling fully against him as -- All the building's windows BLOW OUT and it's like the sky's erupted for Brian, a burning hailstorm that falls and pelts the ground around him. Plaster, wood, and something metal that cracks against the pavement and spins slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fire helmet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Adcox is coming out the door now, blackened and torn, hopeless tears streaming down his face.
</DIRECTION>
<AXE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get us some backup! We need some goddamn backup!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AXE>
<DIRECTION>
And, spotting Brian, he runs towards him. And the helmet spins and spins and Adcox keeps running, and the sky is raining fire, and the flame on the roof has risen up now to its full, horrifying size and it's laughing now, laughing at the little boy as the helmet finally stops spinning, and we read the printing on the neck guard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MCCAFFREY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Adcox is sobbing and has his arms around the boy, protecting him from the fire, the world, but it's like Brian doesn't see him. He pulls away from Adcox, walks up to his father's helmet, And puts it on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scene EXPLODES with a flash as a photographer captures the instant.

Sequence omitted from original script.

<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIAN'S CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hold on the freeze-frame. Let it become an aged cover of LIFE. The magazine jiggles and rocks and we see now it's sitting atop a box of knick-knacks jostling in the back seat of an aging BMW. There's plenty of other boxes here, a live on the move, and in the driver's seat, BRIAN McCAFFREY, now 27. There's piles of empty burger wrappers, Coke cans, and Florida knick-knacks on the dash board; a little blow-up palm tree, a cheesy hula girl emblazoned with "McCaffrey High-End Stereo Sales".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY - MONTAGE - DAY

Brian and his battered BMW shoot past prairie, cow country, nervous suburbs and finally a sign: WELCOME TO CHICAGO.

Wind tugging at his bangs, Brian stares down at the graves of Dennis and Mary Elizabeth McCaffrey.

Brian walks through its sculpted columns, straightening his tie. He comes to a door, FIRE ACADEMY CHIEF. He takes a deep breath, steadies his gaze, and enters.

INT. FIRE ACADEMY CHIEF'S OFFICE - DAY

The ACADEMY CHIEF sits at his desk going over a file. Out the window can be heard a FIRE TRAINING CLASS in action.

Candidates and their relatives CHEER and leap to their feet. Something struggles inside of Brian. He doesn't stand at first. Another Candidate, TIM, 20, looks at him strangely. So does the Academy Chief, his eyes finding Brian's. And Brian's standing slowly now, joining them...

INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tonight the place is firmly in the hands of an army of recently graduated candidates. A few on the back patio have hooked up a charged hoseline and are taking potshots at balloon targets, each other, the neighbor's cat. Brian and Tim, still in their uniforms, enter from the street. Survey the scene.

A Porsche knifes through darkened streets. The DRIVER, 50, is dressed for success. Pulling up to the brownstone we saw earlier, he gets out and rubs his eyes. Another day in the salt mines.

Climbing the short stairs, he sticks his key into the lock and opens the door. It is the last thing he will ever do.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian watches the fire with uneasy fascination. Embers whipping into the night, drifting to the ground around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the engine companies is entering the doorway now. He watches as they willingly crawl into a place any sane person would run for their life from. Jesus Christ. FLASH -- Brian turns at the blinding snap of a camera. Several locals are gathered around a parked car, some taking pictures. Brian notices that right away. It takes a beat longer to notice the CHARRED CORPSE stuffed head-first through the windshield. It's the Porsche driver, his legs sticking out at crazy angles. A dog barks furiously at it.
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
<DIRECTION>
(also looking at body)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Backdraft.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
The brownstone fire quickly transforms itself into noisy clouds of dirty white steam. And one of the firemen is coming back out now, walking toward Brian.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he's just a few yards away he pulls off his air mask and helmet and we shudder with Brian, because the man is a dead ringer for HIS FATHER.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
He pats Brian's cheeks, leaving behind large charcoal smears.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>

</BRIAN>
<STEPHEN>

(turns)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...

<DIRECTION>
And Stephen turns for his own men, Tim staring at Brian as clouds of smoke drift past like ghosts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BROWNSTONE - ACROSS THE STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A flame LEAPS up into the foreground. Touches a cigarette. The cigarette glows, lingers, then lowers slowly from the mouth of RIMGALE, fifty-five years old and six and a half feet of solid granite. Wearing a windbreaker and grey slacks tucked into fire department rubber boots, he takes another slow drag. Looks at the body stuffed into the windshield. It's twenty yards away from the brownstone. Stephen looks up as Rimgale drops the cigarette, crushes it with his boot, and crosses the street to the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Charred walls hiss and snap in the steamy darkness. Rimgale is there, gloomy in the beam of his flashlight. He crouches down, plays his flashlight along the ruined baseboard.
</DIRECTION>
<SHADOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you stare any longer Stevie, I'll start charging you admission.

</SHADOW>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.

Rimgale's flashlight finds a wall socket that he pries loose and holds up to the light. He lowers it, takes in the walls, the room.

EXT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim's talking to his cousin. Brian hangs back, watches the body-bag people load the Porsche driver into a meat wagon. There's a still an audience for this, still stray dogs circling and barking. Brian walks up, looks inside the car, and sees on a seat the ragged remains of a FINGER.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>

EXT. HOUSE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
A modest one. South-side Irish old fashioned. Brian walks up. There's a little kid, about five, playing with a toy fire truck on the drive.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>

The kid stares at him without a glimmer of recognition.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.

EXT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - MARINA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small one on the river. Several boats bob peacefully. Except one. Raised high in dry-dock, it's an ancient fishing trawler. Bachman-Turner-Overdrive drifts up from the galley on badly fuzzed speakers as Brian climbs the ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Stripped to the waist, Stephen's bent-over cleaning out the guts of the inboard motor. He looks confused to see Brian.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I talked to Helen...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Wrong thing to say. Stephen turns back to his work.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Man, I thought dad's boat was finally retired to the family graveyard. Don't you worry about falling out of this thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen straightens up, his forearms smudged with grease. Brian admires the unwashed cereal bowls and peeling deck paint.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like what you've done with the place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's comin' along... want a beer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen tosses him a beer from the fridge. As Brian pops it, he sees the small pile of city-issue gallon size cans in the corner. Armorall, solvent, extinguisher foam.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Been ripping off fire stations?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.

Brian winces at the music coming out of shot speakers.

<DIRECTION>
Brian lifts one of the tapes -- an 8-track -- and holds it carefully in his palm as if it were a rare and fragile relic.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God, an actual operating 8-track.

</BRIAN>
<STEPHEN>

Brian's gutted the speakers and is re-wiring them.

<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why'd you come here, Brian?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! You don't know me --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?

<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.

Brian staples the last of the audio cord in place and switches on the tape player. The cabin fills with sharp, crystal clear -- Stephen Bishop.

	There's only so much technology can do.

Brian climbs down off the boat. Looks up at Stephen.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...

<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.

INT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A simple one-room walk-up. A stereo blares Chicago blues as Brian buttons up his uniform in the mirror. He steps back, looks at himself, -- and oh man what the hell am I doing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - STREET - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian climbs into his car, turns the key -- nothing. He gets out, looks under the hood, then SLAMS it down in frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATED TRAIN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pissed-off Chicago, hauling itself off to work in the morning snap, passes by Brian's window. Tough Midwestern brick. Tough Midwesterners. Heads-down in their 150 year war with a wind committed to pushing the whole damn thing into Lake Michigan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EL STATION - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train clacking away above him, Brian walks down the sidewalk carrying his fire equipment. He turns a corner and comes on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian stands there. It's his dad's station. Turn of the century abused. Sooty with stone gargoyles and a pair of faded red doors that suddenly CRANK OPEN as Brian comes up the drive. Fire engine 17 and ladder truck 46, lights flashing, pull out onto the apron.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fireman sticking his head out of the passenger window is Stephen. One look at the silver trumpet on his collar and we know this isn't Fireman McCaffrey but Fire LT. McCaffrey.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're too late, probie.

Smoke pours with confused indecision from every window of a five story factory as the pumper and ladder company pull up.

	Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.

Everyone begins strapping on air tanks and masks. Adcox drags the rig's suction line to the hydrant. A beautiful illegally parked Mercedes is blocking the way.

Whistling to himself, Adcox SMASHES the brass coupling through the passenger window, runs the line through and SMASHES it out the other window before connecting up to the hydrant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen and Grindle pull hose off the bed and move out. Brian's so jacked up he can't get his air tank on right. Schmidt calmly helps him into his gear.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHMIDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's only rock 'n roll, kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHMIDT>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen, Adcox and Grindle are crouched at the door, ready to go. Brian takes a hose roll and runs to catch up when he's cut-off by dazed Latin workers shouting incoherently at him in SPANISH.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, probie! How 'bout it, huh?

Brian pushes past the workers and takes his position on the hose line. Stephen reaches over and re-adjusts Brian's air tank strap.

Inside the smoke is like liquid lead. Going by feel, they hump the hose up one staircase after another, crawling on their hands and knees toward a dull red glow. Turning a corner, they enter
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BURNING FACTORY - A VAST ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Totally ablaze. Brian looks up in wonder at the buffeting waves of flame in the ceiling, at the SCREECHING timbers crumbling to the white-hot floor. At the walls HOWLING in bestial agony. It is the most horrifying, and wonderful thing he has ever seen.
</DIRECTION>
<AXE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wash it to the windows?

	Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Adcox and Grindle shrug and pull their helmets down tight, expecting the worst. Adcox opens up the nozzle, turning loose a high pressure BLAST OF WATER into the ceiling. The fire SCREAMS in manic anger and HEAVES a cloud of HOWLING steam that WHIRLS back and BAKES them like lobsters. Brian gasps for air as swirling ash batters his facemask. A window somewhere EXPLODES. Somebody shouts. Christ, you can't see anything. Stephen HOOPS in victory.
</DIRECTION>

</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
The chase is on! Going for the throat while the fire's confused and defensive, the firemen SCRAMBLE through the boiling cloud. They hit it in the ceiling, in the walls, forcing it back and back. It HOWLS and CLAWS in anger, furiously throwing cinders and broken timbers in their faces. The walls ECHO with its SCREAMS as it retreats to a corner.

Brian runs back to the wall to hook up his hose roll to the building water system. He goes to unscrew the cap with his hydrant wrench but it keeps slipping off the nut.

	Dig in, goddamn it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
The crews immediately gather in the center of the floor. They turn over tables, chairs, anything to form a barrier. A circling of the wagons. -- BOOM! rush-rush-rush -- BOOM! Each louder than the last. Stephen and Brian are ducked behind an overturned desk. Adcox and Krizminski clutch hoselines like frontiersmen's Winchesters.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gonna love this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
-- rush-rush-rush -- CRAAAASH!! On an instant the world comes apart as all four walls of factory windows EXPLODE in a hail of glass. A wave of HOWLING FLAME POURS IN after it, SHRIEKING and HISSING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the same moment, part of the floor beside a heavy sewing machine GIVES WAY and a ladderman, SANTOS, FALLS THROUGH, grabbing the edges at the last minute as flames BELLOW UP from underneath. He SCREAMS as his grip loosens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grindle leaps to the ladderman's side, grabbing his arms and coat. Brian hesitates just an instant and Stephen SHOVES him out of the way to back up Grindle.
</DIRECTION>
<SANTOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help... Oh God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTOS>
<DIRECTION>
Adcox's taken the hoseline and is opening fire. Water and flame crash and snarl across the floor in a blood curdling ROAR. It's a thrashing, murderous standoff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen and Grindle have got Santos but the angle's bad. Blow it now and all three could take a header. Santos is panicking, losing his grip. Grindle bores his eyes into the man's with the calm and conviction of Moses.
</DIRECTION>
<GRINDLE>

	You go, we go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRINDLE>
<DIRECTION>
They may all die, but they won't leave him. He calms a little, hangs on till they PULL him out of harm's way. Adcox continues with the hose as suddenly, everyone HITS the deck as the fire EXPLODES over them, BURSTING their coats into flame. Tim's company opens up their line, WASHING everybody down before CHARGING after the fire. A ladderman, NIGHTENGALE, steps on Brian's back.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!

</BRIAN>
<NIGHTENGALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry man, I thought you were dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIGHTENGALE>
<DIRECTION>
Brian, stunned, sits up, his coat and helmet smoking. Stephen seems totally unaffected and is already on his feet and over the top of the barricade, the others backing him as he mercilessly drives the fire back, trapping it finally into a corner. The fire hisses, spits, shakes the walls with its furious anger. But it's all bluster now, the fire's dying.

Brian's walking over to clear the hoseline when he hears it. small voice. Faint. "Help me..."

INT. BURNING FACTORY - DOWNSTAIRS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's only the fire's ghost here, lazy and slow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Off the corridor are rooms full of commercial sewing machines. Brian enters one and drops to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks under a table, flashes his light behind a work stand. Nothing. He turns to backtrack his way out when A TONGUE OF FLAME suddenly LEAPS up through the floor in front of him, cutting off the door. Brian lands on his ass as it hisses and giggles and dances unreally in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I never forget a face, kid. -- That fire from childhood. He could maybe force his way through but Jesus, the way it looks at him --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Brian ROLLS away from it. Looks for another doorway -- And ends up in thick smoke. He drops to a crawl, stays on his belly where the air's clear. When he sees it. Behind some furniture. Something flesh-colored. Shit. It's a body. He crawls up closer. It's a woman. Adrenalin pounding the top of his skull off, he grabs her and stumbles back down the hall, makes a turn --

	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
A sea of media flashbulbs ERUPTS in his face. The press have arrived in force, crowding the street. Brian pushes through them to a clear spot on the far side of the engine. Two fire paramedics rush over as he lowers the figure.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she... Is she alive?

The paramedics suddenly stop their efforts. Turn to Brian.

	I'm afraid you're a little too late with this one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARAMEDIC>
<DIRECTION>
They step aside. Brian looks down. The woman looks strange. Mostly because she's a heavy store DRESSING DUMMY. The paramedics burst into laughter. Brian, looking pale and shaken, turns and walks away. He passes Grindle and Tim, sitting on the pumper's tailboard helping the REAL woman that was found inside.
</DIRECTION>
<GRINDLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry to hear about the mannequin. I heard you two were close.

</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Someone else does too. Jennifer. Dressed now in a long expensive coat, she's standing at the end of the alley with a clipboard. Brian, ashes smeared across an ashen face, spittle on his chin, doesn't notice her.

	Yeah. Fine. I'm a little busy right now.

</BRIAN>

Stephen leans against the wall. Folds his arms.

As Stephen leaves, we see that Jennifer's been standing at the end of the alley, listening to them. She's turns and walks as Brian looks up. We register his surprise. He watches her head toward a dynamic-looking guy in his 40s, ALDERMAN SWAYZAK, surrounded by reporters.

<DIRECTION>
Brian and the rest of the company rip open the walls and beat the last weak flames in a final flurry of dingy sparks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The moment the smoke clears just a fraction, cigarettes appear in everyone's mouth. Was it good for you? The talk is easy and obscene, the intense camaraderie of shared danger. Ash clods are thrown playfully back and forth in the afterglow of having taken on the worst there is and walking away one more time.

	Alderman, I have a remarkably uncomplicated job. To decide if a fire's arson, and if so catch the pain in the ass doing it.

	If anybody's light's gonna blink, it's yours.

Swayzak holds his ground. It's a tense, out of control moment between them. Rimgale turns from his work, watches Stephen with concern. Adcox suddenly inserts himself face-to-face with Swayzak and we see the raw hatred.

	You're in firemanland now, Swayzak. Do yourself a favor and just walk away.

Adcox watches Brian and Tim exchange looks. Tim shrugs. Brian sighs and pulls out the pike poles, starts across the floor before freezing suddenly at a murderous GROWL. Brian turns and sees a DOG.

Stephen sits alone at his bunk, slowly stretching a strained and ruined back. He blows out a long, tired breath, and begins working ointment into an anciently scarred and battered knee.

<DIRECTION>
On the wall is a small glass case full of station memorabilia through the years. There's a two battered fire helmets there, set reverently on velvet. Beside it is a photograph of his father. Grinning. Top of the world. He's wearing a T-shirt proudly stenciled FIGHTING 17th.

Father and son exchange a long, awkward greeting.

In the doorway, Brian stands watching his brother, who not even 40, suddenly seems an old and broken man.

	I think it appropriate that we recognize the two asswipes -- I mean probationary firemen -- among us who today were baptized officially into the world of Old Man Fire. First to Tim, who despite being handicapped at birth with a rather dull expression and a really hideous pair of ears, not only took on the beast but pulled from its clutches -- assisted by a more famous and brilliant firefighter -- me -- a kicking and screaming civilian that will probably end up suing us for breaking her fingernail.

Bleary-eyed, the nine firemen line up raggedly in front of their rigs, dressed like shit but for peaked uniform caps they wear only at this moment. Stephen stands before them, does a quick glance up and down the line.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, company dismissed. -- See ya guys tonight at Fitzgerald's retirement party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
They shuffle for the door. As Brian passes,

	You want a ride?

EXT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen pulls up. Brian opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brian --

(a beat that hangs there)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- See ya tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RESTAURANT - RETIREMENT PARTY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That's been cleared out for a huge PARTY in full swing. An Irish folk band cuts loose a merciless bagpipe beat. City brass--including Alderman Swayzak -- a few reporters, firemen and their families all mix together for this is a RETIREMENT PARTY for the Captain Fitzgerald. Brian enters, seeks out a beer at the bar. Stephen's there, swaying with what is clearly not his first drink of the evening.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
CHEERS as a one joke gift after another is laid on the Chief. Stephen sees his ex-wife, Helen, dancing with another man. He turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta change the view...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Santos and Grindle walk up.
</DIRECTION>
<GRINDLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heard you didn't make the list for captain, man. I'm sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRINDLE>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen just shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian sees Jennifer across the room. She looks great. Refined as she expertly works the room, schmoozing and hugging and calling various politicos by their first name.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she speaks to one, a waiter offers a drink. As she accepts, a bottle appears over her shoulder and splashes it with red syrup.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(holding bottle, interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With grenadine, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was twenty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Her attention broken, the politico has slipped away. Annoyed, Jennifer leads Brian aside and speaks low, but angrily at him.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer instantly cuts off as a well-dressed COUPLE passes and switches stunningly into schmmoze-mode.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
(to man)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Tom, how nice to see you. I know Marty'll be very happy you came. Thanks so much for the donation.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to woman)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marie... how's little Kevin? Really? Seen the polls? This is the year...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
They move away. Jennifer turns to Brian and switches just as fast back to their argument.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- The thing that really makes me angry is the way your union has --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
Brian can't help it. He cracks up.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Brian turns and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS THE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adcox is talking with another knot of firemen. He's brought a date, SALLY, a hot little number that has a habit of standing on her tip-toes when she talks.
</DIRECTION>
<SALLY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at Swayzak across room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yuck, what a scumbag.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<AXE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Santos)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuckin' city transferred Sally three months ago out of parking violations into Swayzak's office. Now I gotta pay my own goddamn tickets and she's stuck with an asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AXE>
<SANTOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pay more?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTOS>
<SALLY>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, but there's more exercise -- being chased around a desk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<DIRECTION>
There's a commotion at the other end of the bar. A group of firemen have gathered around a weekly magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<GRINDLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, I don't believe this shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRINDLE>
<SCHMIDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody get a shovel! You seen this, Stephen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHMIDT>
<DIRECTION>
As they hold it up to Stephen we see a photo spread titled DARING FIRE RESCUE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first photo shows Brian rushing out of the burning building with seemingly a woman in his arms. The second photo shows the backs of Adcox and Tim's helmets as they administered aid to the real woman they saved. The implication is it's the same woman.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<TIM>
<DIRECTION>
(reads)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
The old photo is there too. Brian and his dad's helmet.
</DIRECTION>
<GRINDLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whadda we gonna do about this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRINDLE>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen glances over the headlines.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y'know, I think it's a union bylaw that if a guy gets in the paper -- especially if it's bullshit -- he owes the company a drink. In fact...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(motions to waiter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'll have a double. On the hero.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
The other firemen jump in with drink orders. Dozens of them.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Tim shows him the magazine. Brian reads with horror as Alderman Swayzak appears beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<SWAYZAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brian McCaffrey, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWAYZAK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brian, this is my boss, Alderman Swayzak.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Swayzak)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brian's a big fan of yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Big fan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<SWAYZAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWAYZAK>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<SWAYZAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No need to be modest, Brian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWAYZAK>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<SWAYZAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWAYZAK>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every little boy's fantasy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<SWAYZAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWAYZAK>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<SWAYZAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWAYZAK>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<SWAYZAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWAYZAK>
<DIRECTION>
Brian looks at Jennifer, then smiles at Swayzak.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks anyway, Mr. Swayzak, but fire engines sorta run in my family. Politics don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
-- A man suddenly steps between them to pump Swayzak's hand. Brian shakes his head and walks away. Swayzak shoots a concerned glance at Jennifer. She catches up with him at the buffet table.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So now you suddenly care about my future?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Across the room, Stephen's at the buffet, watching Helen dance with her fireman date, the drinks hammering him hard.
</DIRECTION>
<PENGELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw man, how can she dance with that guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENGELLY>
<SCHMIDT>
	<DIALOGUE>

Stephen gives Pengelly an icy, sideways look.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHMIDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Stevie, he's an asshole...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHMIDT>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen smiles and pushes off the bar -- right for Helen as she dances.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...

Stephen suddenly PUNCHES Jackson.

<HELEN>

(sighs)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we go...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
And Stephen PLOWS into Jackson. Another fireman JUMPS to Jackson's aid. And Brian's there, defending his brother, PUNCHING OUT a fireman. The crowd finally pulls the two apart.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're crazy, man!

Stephen takes a step for the bar -- then suddenly turns and JUMPS Jackson again. Brian pulls him off and drags him for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't need a drink, man. You need to get outta here...

Stephen pushes Brian away and promptly stumbles to the sidewalk.

<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?

</BRIAN>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?

Brian stands there and folds his arms.

Dark and still. Brian, carrying a roll of hose, scales the chain link.

EXT. FIRE ACADEMY - EXERCISE GROUND - NIGHT

A truck has JACKKNIFED across the avenue and SPILLED its contents -- several THOUSAND baby chicks. They're scurrying everywhere as Brian's company tries to round them up. It's hopeless as the exhausted firemen stuff handfuls of the cheeping cargo into their turn-out coats. There's ghetto kids all around, grabbing at the chicks, grabbing at the fire engine.

Everybody clasps Pengelly on the shoulder. "Way to go". "All right, man". Brian turns and sees Stephen out on the apparatus floor, watching. Watches. Pengelly's younger than him.

EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - TRAINING BUILDING/HOSE TOWER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An expanse of concrete lying out back of the station. Built in one corner is the concrete shell of a five story training building, just wide enough for a stairway and room on each level. Twenty yards away, Brian, Tim and Adcox stand ready beside a pile of coiled hose rolls.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright... Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Tim picks up a roll of hose, 50 pounds, throws it over his shoulder and runs with Adcox to the foot of the building. There's a fixed standpipe that Adcox ties into as Tim drags the other end inside and up a flight of stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Brian lifts another hose roll under his arm and runs for the building.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That isn't a football, probie. Get it on your shoulder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Brian runs up two flights to meet Tim and connect his end. Tim heads down for another roll as Brian drags his up another two flights. It's a bitch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sweating, he barrels back down the stairs, passing Tim coming up with another roll.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Having fun, fireman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Tim flips him off. Brian laughs and sprints for another roll.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not breaking any records, Brian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Brian holds it under his arm and takes off. Stephen grabs a roll himself, hoists it to his shoulder and runs alongside.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your shoulder. Like this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Brian lifts it to his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on! Pick it up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
They come to the doorway. Instead of stopping, Stephen follows Brian in and runs alongside up the stairs. Without a word spoken it's become a race between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian's face explodes in sweat. His heart pounds as they go up flight after flight. The hose rolls weigh a 100 pounds. A thousand. Neck 'n neck all the way; grunting, their throats burning, only one flight from the roof Stephen STUMBLES and SCRAPES his leg. Brian pauses. Stephen's already back on his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run, damn you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Brian does, Stephen already gaining on him -- getting ready to pass him -- when they burst gasping out onto the roof, Brian the "winner" by a nose. Stephen drops his hose roll, sticks his face into Brian's, -- And laughs. Unsure, Brian starts to join in. Stephen stops suddenly.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roll the hose.

We see now what Stephen apparently doesn't. He was scraped badly, his pant leg torn and leaking dark circles of blood.

</BRIAN>
<STEPHEN>

Stephen turns and walks away. Brian stands there watching him in blind fury, finally exploding.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn you Stephen, I'm not gonna quit. You hear me!

An awkward beat between them that's interrupted suddenly by the station alarm klaxon. Stephen smiles.

INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - DAY

Where they bomb up a staircase just as a WALL OF FIRE LASHES DOWN, KNOCKING them on their ass. Stephen jumps to his feet with an axe as Brian struggles to get up.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't take that kind of shit from it! Don't let it know you're scared! Come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen, with just his axe, CHASES up the stairs at the fire, HAMMERING at the flaming boards. The fire retreats into another room, SLAMMING the door shut behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian struggles up the stairs. The two of them slide up on either side of the closed door, Stephen cradling his axe like a SWAT team shotgun. The door breathes in and out and something animal scratches and snarls on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian can feel the panic rising in his throat. That thing behind the door, that slobbering, evil thing. It wants out. It wants... him.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>

Stephen HAMMERS the lock with his axe and KICKS the door open. A WALL OF FLAME ROARS out past their cheeks, then BACKWASHES in.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen picks up the door, and using it as a shield CHARGES into the flames. Brian tries to follow but the fire WELLS UP, cutting him off. He hesitates. It's that goddamn flame again, leering at him. Daring him. It BUCKS suddenly, DROPPING Brian to his knee. He GROANS in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- And now Adcox and Grindle are coming up the stairs with a hoseline WASHING DOWN the room. Clouds of furious steam bellow out and across the ceiling. Nobody could be alive in there.
</DIRECTION>

Except Stephen. His entire outfit smoldering, he emerges from the clouds like a fucking god, carrying in one arm a gasping child.

You've been told by your Battalion Chief, your Captain, by me, not to do anything up there until ordered. But now the itch starts, and all of a sudden comes the Glory Boy Flash: Hey, I'm a hero. Heroes don't just stand around. So on your own you decided to punch out a window for ventilation. Was that before or after you noticed you were standing in a lake of gasoline?

The kid is dying a thousand deaths of humiliation.

</SHADOW>
<DIRECTION>
Brian does. The corpse's keys are still in the lock. So's Benton. Blown with such force he seems fused with the door. On the door's edge Rimgale notices a small patch of melted, sticky goo. With his penknife he scrapes a sample and seals it in a glass vial, stands, and walks into the office.

	It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...

Brian chops it out from the wall. Rimgale crouches down, peels back the melted faceplate and examines the wires. The copper tip is severely melted. Rimgale sniffs the plug.

<SHADOW>
<DIRECTION>
(into recorder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.

<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No it couldn't.

</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Rimgale shuts off the recorder. Stares down Brian.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean you'd be right -- with normal wire. But that's gauge ten in that plug -- industrial stuff. Who knows why they put it in here -- but it won't melt at less than 12,000 degrees. And no natural spark short of lightning gets that hot.

<DIRECTION>
There's a pike pole leaning against the wall. Brian pulls it aside. SPLASH -- The pole had been supporting a small, sagging piece of ceiling that instantly collapses, dumping twenty gallons of murky, putrid black water all over Brian's civvys. Nobody laughs.

If you say so. Brian's stomach does a half-gainer as he's confronted by two hideously charred bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<RICCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Both deaths due to close encounters with stationary objects; office door for Mr. Cosgrove, '89 Porsche for Mr. Seagrave. No non-relevant traumas. No significant blood toxicology. Attitude of both trajectories consistent with explosions.

<DIRECTION>
Brian is discreetly avoiding his gaze, whistling quietly to himself as he looks over specimen jars on a shelf.
</DIRECTION>
<RICCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.

A credit card has been fried right into Cosgrove's skin about where his back pocket should have been.

	See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICCO>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.

	I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts.

</SHADOW>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he killed these guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<SHADOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.

</SHADOW>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What reason?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<SHADOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.

	That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?

EXT. PARTY BOAT - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Brian's leaning on the boat railing watching the passing parade of rich and beautiful. Across the sea of champagne and brie, he spots Jennifer talking with her boss, Swayzak. He has his hand on her back.

Jennifer spots Brian. She smile, detaches herself and walks over.

Swayzak swings around and puts his arm cheesily around Brian's shoulder. Another staffer slaps a SWAYZAK FOR MAYOR sticker to Brian's lapel. Jennifer rolls her eyes to Brian. I'm sorry... Snap.

<DIRECTION>
Swayzak leads her off in pursuit. Left alone, Brian turns to the railing, stares off at the passing city. You can hear the wind-up of a siren.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And there it is now, an engine company zooming along Wacker Drive. Something digs and kicks inside of Brian as he watches it disappear.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's the job going?

She's appeared again beside him.

<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.

</JENNIFER>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
BAMM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both of them look up sharply. A woman drunk out of her mind has tipped over in her chair. She laughs, her fellow tablemates laugh, everybody laughs. Jennifer takes Brian by the arm in the opposite direction and smiles.

EXT. PARTY BOAT - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The band's completely cut loose now. A wild percussion rhythm that has everyone on their feet dancing like madmen. Brian and Jennifer stomp and sweat and shake and giggle through hair crazily askew. The lakeshore is twinkling and wonderful as it slips past. The drums beat faster and harder and the only thing that isn't moving now is their eyes -- eyes locked on each other.

The regular engine company's gone to bed and the arson squad's packed in for the night, leaving the apparatus floor quiet and dim as Brian and Jennifer enter.

Brian leads her back past the engine and arson sedan to the rear where Rimgale has his offices. As they walk Jennifer's eyes drift up to the old sculpted parapets, the press-tin ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>

	This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?

INT. ARSON HQ - BACK OFFICES

They walk into the back arson offices. Brian pokes through a few drawers, one or two shelves. Finally he lifts a squat, specialized fire extinguisher. The bottom has been hollowed out, leaving room for a fifth of bourbon.

Brian escorts Jennifer along the side of the behemoth.

Beat. The air cracks between them. And is brushed aside. In an instant they're all over each other. Tangled lips and gulping breaths. Jennifer abruptly breaks it off
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- And looks mischievously up at the hose bed, with its long curling rolls of soft cotton.
</DIRECTION>

Brian doesn't remember this precise scenario being discussed at the academy, but he improvises admirably, popping up onto the hose bed and offering a gentlemanly hand to Jennifer. As they tumble into the soft folds

The elevator stops. DING. The door opens. No howling blaze, not even any noise, but enough hanging smoke that you can't see your hand in front of your face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They fan out gingerly onto the floor, looking for the fire. Hide and seek in a white fog bank. Everybody stops and listens. Slowly, carefully, they feel their way through the haze.

	It's here.

On cue something snakes past behind the walls, whispers and whines and shivers up and over them and then is silent. Grindle attaches a hoseline to the building standpipe.

Engine 17 pulls up into the parking lot of the high-rise fire. Firemen leap out of the cab and rush around behind to pull off lengths of hose from the bed. As the folds curl away the fireman is stunned to see a woman's stocking come out with it.

With equal shock he looks up and watches as a disheveled and grinning Brian and Jennifer climb calmly down out of the bed.

Stephen BANGS down another door. Sticks his head in to check. A little woodpecker toy dips up and down in a glass of water.

Tim readies his axe before his door, gathers his courage as Stephen comes out of the room he was checking. Sees Tim lifting his axe.

Tim's committed now, coming hard at the door. And Stephen sees it for just an instant -- Small tendrils of smoke edging lazily around the door -- then being sucked back in.

	Tim!

He rushes for Tim as Tim's axe SMACKS the door and a whine behind it builds and roars and howls and Tim's all follow- through now, hitting the door with his shoulder as

The door EXPLODES OUTWARD, HURLING TIM against the opposite wall and for an instant he's okay but he freezes in terror as A SHRIEKING TONGUE OF FLAME SHOOTS OUT THE DOORWAY and Grindle shouts in horror and opens his hose line as the flames wrap Tim like a jealous lover as Adcox hears it and screams,

	Oh God! Oh God no!

And Tim's screaming now too, because his helmet, his mask, his face, it's all melting and Grindle dives suicidally at the monster, BLASTING it with his hose as Stephen ignores the flames and puts his arms around Tim as Grindle DOUSES them both, killing the flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The monster rolls wounded back into the room, into the air shafts as Tim whimpers incoherently, sliding down the wall as Stephen tries to help but oh God you can't tell what's face and what's mask and helmet anymore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grindle looks back where the fire came from. There's a corpse in there, burned and lying between two doors.

Adcox rushes to Tim's side sobbing and it's the end, the end of the goddamn world...

Brian and Jennifer are having the time of their lives, when suddenly a group of firemen pass by rushing someone on a stretcher to an ambulance and Brian sees -- sweet Jesus -- it's Tim. Jennifer turns away in horror. They load Tim into the van as Adcox and Grindle jump in to ride along. To hold his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen watches the ambulance disappear out into the street. Frustration and fury tear at him as he takes off his coat and slams it to the ground. He kicks it, kicks it till his strength's gone. He turns, his wounded eyes finding Brian.

Rimgale walks down the smokey corridor. The charred civilian is there, sitting in the short stretch of hall between two blown doors. Through the haze Rimgale sees Stephen crouched in the interior room, picking at the debris. Lost in himself.

Everyone but Brian.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian looks through a door window into the room. There, surrounded by doctors and physicians, lies Tim. He's been cut out of his uniform. Gauze bandages everywhere. As a pair of forceps peel some away Brian glimpses what used to be a face, now only reds and browns and leaky whites. He turns away.

Voices rise down the hall. Turn to shouts. It's Adcox and Stephen, tearing heartbreakingly into one another. Brian can't make out the words but it's ugly, emotional. Abruptly it ends and Stephen emerges from the alcove, walking toward them upset.

Brian sits staring blankly. A newspaper drops in front of him. FIRE DEPT. SAYS IT'S MURDER. Rimgale stands above him.
</DIRECTION>
<SHADOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goes on about how the break was made through the discovery of "chemical traces" and a "behavioral link". Oh, and Swayzak's quoted saying the chief investigator is closing in on the torch and expects an arrest "any time".

Brian's eyes wince closed.

	Brian. What's wrong?

</JENNIFER>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --

<BRIAN>

<JENNIFER>

	Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
	</DIALOGUE>

</BRIAN>
<JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes it off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --

<BRIAN>

<BRIAN>

	-- I work for the city.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
Swayzak appears in the doorway. He looks haggard, as if he hasn't slept. There's something haunted in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SWAYZAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWAYZAK>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<JENNIFER>

Brian shoulders his way past Swayzak and walks out.

INT. HOSPITAL - TIM'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian walks up to Tim's room. Stephen's sitting there, ragged looking. Inside the young probie lies wrapped in tubes and gauze and years of wasted promise. An EKG beeps, a respirator hisses, and Brian gulps down something heavy in his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>

<DIRECTION>
Cruising through traffic. Swayzak is disheveled, unshaven, fidgety. A man who hasn't slept and had a few drinks before the one he's pouring now. He offers one to Rimgale.
</DIRECTION>
<SHADOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I usually have breakfast first.
	</DIALOGUE>

Swayzak apparently doesn't.

Rimgale walks back into his offices. He's surprised to see Brian there working at his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<SHADOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHADOW>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Rimgale stares at Brian, appraises him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIGH-RISE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CLOSE UP of Rimgale POPPING the molding around the door frame of Holcomb's burned office. Underneath can be seen traces of the same white residue from the other fires.
</DIRECTION>
<SHADOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought 'ol Marty was acting a little strange... And he's right.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Rimgale rubs the white powder between his fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Backdraft?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Rimgale stands at the spot in the short hall where the body lied between two doors.
</DIRECTION>
<SHADOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The backdraft was set somewhere in there. It fried Holcomb when he opened the inner door. But the outer door held... and waited for Tim...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHADOW>
<DIRECTION>
Brian steps into the inner office.
</DIRECTION>
<SHADOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So find me the fire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHADOW>
<DIRECTION>
Brian begins searching, probing. He finally stands. Defeated.
</DIRECTION>
<SHADOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're thinking too much of the building and not enough of the ghost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHADOW>
<DIRECTION>
Brian's eyes don't understand. From Rimgale's coat comes a plastic flask. He pours out of it a liquid onto the floor and lights a match.
</DIRECTION>
<SHADOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHADOW>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Rimgale drops the match.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WUMP. A small flame explodes to life.
</DIRECTION>
<SHADOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a living thing, Brian. It breathes, it eats, and it hates.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHADOW>
<DIRECTION>
The fire's climbing a wall, chewing a corner.
</DIRECTION>
<SHADOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only way to beat it is to think like it. To know that this flame will spread this way across the floor not because of the physics of flammable liquids or heat convection, but because it wants to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHADOW>
<DIRECTION>
FWUMP. It darts west. Licks the ceiling. The fire purrs and hisses. Stretches luxuriously and attacks savagely.
</DIRECTION>
<SHADOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some guys on this job, fire owns them. It makes them fight on its level. But the only way to truly kill it is to love it a little, just like Ronald.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHADOW>
<DIRECTION>
Brian stares at the flame. A goblin reaching out for him... -- Woosh! Rimgale hits it with a fire extinguisher. In an instant the goblin is gone, the genie in the bottle.

INT. FIRE DEPARTMENT REPAIR DEPOT

A cavernous hall full of dozens of fire trucks loaded on jacks. Rimgale's sedan's there, the repairman shaking his head in amazement at the undercarriage.
</DIRECTION>
<REPAIRMAN>

	What the hell do you do with this thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPAIRMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Rimgale's looking through the report Brian's handed him.
</DIRECTION>
<SHADOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
	</DIALOGUE>

<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? Airtight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
He dumps three more reports on Rimgale.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<SHADOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHADOW>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then who wrote the report?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<SHADOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?

Brian hands him something else. A photograph. Swayzak and the other three, posing on a fishing boat, 1970. Time of their lives.

The red arson sedan pulls up to wealthy home. Rimgale and Brian walk up and knock on the door -- it creaks open ajar. They push the door open slowly.

It's dark as they enter.
</DIRECTION>
<SHADOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Swayzak?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHADOW>
<DIRECTION>
Brian and Rimgale split up down different halls. It's the HISS Brian hears first. Then the FLASH of an electrical socket FLARING ice-cold cobalt blue. Suddenly the room's dimensions are there in frantic, strobing shadows. Chairs, a couch --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- And a figure that JUMPS Brian. the light from the burning plug is a fierce strobe as the figure, a confused shadow, crashes Brian to the floor. They STRUGGLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure GRABS Brian's throat. Brian PUSHES him back
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Against the burning wall plug. The figure SHRIEKS in pain, gets his hand on a crowbar and SLAMS Brian -- who crumples, dazed. The figure stands -- just as Rimgale TACKLES him. The figure CRASHES across a gas space heater, SNAPPING the connection off. The figure SLAMS Rimgale HARD with the crowbar, squirms free, and stumbles out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hissss... Rimgale climbs to his feet as fire eats at the wall. A baby backdraft wagging its tail. He goes to a dazed Brian's side, lifting him by his armpits and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
helping him outside. Hissss... The ruptured space heater pumps gas furiously. Rimgale sees that. He also sees a bedroom door ajar on the far side of the house. And through the door a couch. And on the couch, A body. Hissss...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SWAYZAK HOUSE - NIGHT

Rimgale rushes back inside. It's Swayzak, unconscious.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. SWAYZAK HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rimgale drags him out on the stoop beside Brian just as the gas WHUMPS and the doors and windows EXPLODE in a HOWLING FIREBALL, the shrapnel BLOWING Rimgale off his feet. Brian slowly shakes his head clear. He looks around, tries to orient himself.
</DIRECTION>
<SHADOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... I sorta got a problem here...

Brian climbs up to his feet and walks over to where Rimgale lies at a weird angle, a piece of wrought iron fence punched through his shoulder.

Rimgale suddenly kicks the bed frame in anger. He kicks it over and over with frustration till something finally SNAPS off. Brian waits, let's him vent his frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what do you want me to do?

Ronald drops on the table a dog-eared copy of that 1972 LIFE magazine with Brian on the cover.

</BRIAN>
<RONALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.

	The outlets.

INT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's cereal bowls in the sink, beer bottles on the table, And a stack of fire department supplies in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His whole body aching with reluctance, Brian begins looking through them. Solvents, Armorall, a small specialty can of fire dept. chemicals. There's a label of ingredients on it. Way down at the bottom, Is trychticholorate. Nausea wracks its way through Brian.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian PRIES the lock off Stephen's locker. Starts looking through it. Adcox comes out of the shower with a towel on, starts shaving in a mirror. He doesn't notice Brian. Adcox turns to head for his own locker and the towel slips a little. And Brian's universe caves in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An icy claw tears out his stomach. Gulping breaths, he forces himself to look at Adcox's back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On it is a small, rectangular burn. It's fresh and it's the size of a wall socket. At that moment Adcox turns. The two of them stare at one another just a beat, then Adcox walks past him. Just then the alarm bells RING. Brian hesitates a beat, confused, then turns and runs down to

Stephen turns and walks toward the station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian's eyes go to a window just above it. There, watching him, watching the whole exchange between brothers, is Adcox.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adcox stares at Brian a beat, then finally disappears as Brian hears the cough of diesel engines.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>

<DIRECTION>
He starts running for the station.

INT./EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- It's too late. Adcox climbs aboard just as the engine company pulls out and whistles down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ladder company is just easing onto the drive. Brian hesitates only an instant, then runs to the equipment racks, PULLS off the hooks his helmet, coat, boots -- and jumps onto the truck as it takes off in pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. ENGINE COMPANY 17 - NIGHT

As it howls down the avenue, Stephen turns around and stares at Adcox sitting behind. The glimmer of an understanding...

<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. TRUCK COMPANY 46 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The laddermen look confused seeing Brian sitting among them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CAR Suddenly CUTS the truck company off. The driver SLAMS the brakes, PUSHING the truck company into a HORRIBLE SKID. The back fishtails, the wheels JUMP the curb, BASH a mailbox, and then the whole rig ROLLS onto its side and DRAGS to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's tangled confusion in the rear cab. Firemen, unhurt, piled atop one another. Brian slides his way out from under them and looks down the street where plumes of smoke rise six blocks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WAREHOUSE FIRE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flames and smoke curl from a huge industrial warehouse along the river as Brian, panting, runs up. He searches frantically through the maze of arriving engine companies, looking for number 17. There it is but nobody's home. Brian stops a passing captain.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>

Brian, now fully suited up, climbs the endless rungs of an extended aerial ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WAREHOUSE ROOF - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tongues of flame ROCKET skyward through ragged holes. Black clouds drift murderously, roofing tars bubble and hiss as the roof itself GROANS like a comatose dinosaur, reminding you the whole thing could go any minute -- and you with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trudging alone across this alien, spongy surface, Brian looks for his company. It's almost impossible to tell anyone apart, faces hidden behind helmets and masks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a cloud of smoke clears and there's two firemen near the edge, "17" on their helmets.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stephen --

The helmets look up. Stephen and Adcox. Facing each other. Adcox cradles an axe.

</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Brian starts to move beside Stephen but Adcox turns, tightens his grip on the axe, and now all the cards are on the table. A hissing black cloud drifts through. They're the only three people on earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adcox's eyes are clouded with tears.
</DIRECTION>
<AXE>

	Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...

	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WAREHOUSE - ACROSS THE ROOF - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rest of the crews are totally oblivious to what's happening through the smoke on the other side. Grindle and Santos feel the roof go suddenly spongy beneath them.
</DIRECTION>
<GRINDLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit... It's going! Clear the roof! Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRINDLE>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody drops their equipment and runs for the edges as
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WAREHOUSE ROOF - BRIAN ET. AL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian, Stephen and Adcox react as the roof HOWLS and GROANS and huge SPLITS begin racing along it. And then it goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The center section DROPS, and in rolling waves of SCREECHING steel, the hole spreads outward; DEVOURING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adcox shoves them aside and runs for his life as the hole races for them, SWALLOWING roof.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ Brian, run! Run goddamn it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
And Brian balls-out dashes for the edge. Stephen's made one corner, Brian desperately heads for another. At the last instant -- as the HOWLING FLAME BELLOWS UP to his ankles -- Brian LEAPS OFF the roof --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WAREHOUSE - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- And falls half a story before CRASHING onto an exterior fire escape. Flames have cut off the fire escape two floors below, so Brian climbs down as far as possible, crawls onto a ledge, KICKS out a window, steps through,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackness and emptiness, two stories of it, before he CRASHES into a pool of water at the bottom. He's in a freight elevator shaft, thrashing madly, drowning. Great SHEETS of WATER are POURING through an upper doorway and CASCADING down like monsoon rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WAREHOUSE - FIREBOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see it's coming from the fireboat's rushing stream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE - ELEVATOR SHAFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The weight of his equipment is pulling Brian underwater. Struggling against the insane swirls and the sheets of water still POURING DOWN, Brian unhooks his air tank. He leans back, tries to float on the rising column of water. -- His coat catches on something -- YANKS him underwater. He struggles feverishly -- finally tears the coat off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The building GROANS in earnest. Flaming chunks of plaster CRASH down around Brian, forcing him to duck underwater. The place is coming apart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ten feet above, one of the falling chunks SMACKS a gas main, SPLITTING then IGNITING it. A white-hot JET OF FLAME SHOOTS from one side of the shaft to the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian's floating okay, he's floating right up into the flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian tries to flatten himself out, to keep everything but his nose below water, but he's still moving up -- the heat becoming so intense his face flares and he's ducking under water now, trying to stay alive, trying to decide whether to drown or burn --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- When there's a CRASH. And suddenly another door on the shaft is tearing open. There's a glint of an axe. A flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Stephen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian has about two seconds left. In that time Stephen sees the shut-off for the gas line mounted on the wall opposite. It's unreachable, a good twelve feet across a horizontal curtain of flame. Before we can even assimilate that, Stephen's already jumped. A crazy leap over the fire. He SMACKS the opposite wall, HITS the shut-off, and FALLS CRASHING into the pool beside Brian.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BRIAN>

<DIRECTION>
(grimaces)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I broke my goddamn arm...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Brian helps him stay above water. The level continues to rise, bringing them finally even with an open doorway they scramble through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It leads to a stairwell that's become a RAGING TORRENT of water spilling down it. No way. They push through to the next doorway and out onto
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is full of hundreds of chemical drums. The fire has cracked its way into the room as WUMP -- drums begin EXPLODING, SHOOTING UPWARD Roman candle fountains of glittering FLAME. Brian helps Stephen as they snake their way past sweating drums -- pressure valves hissing madly with desperation. They duck low, round a corner,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE - CATWALK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- And walk right into an axe handle that SMACKS Brian's throat KNOCKING him gasping flat on his back. It's Adcox.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen JUMPS Adcox and TACKLES him on the edge of a metal platform that extends out from the raised flooring.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<AXE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stevie... I...
	</DIALOGUE>

Adcox struggles against him, heaving and sobbing.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let it go! Goddamn it let it go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
And Adcox releases the axe.
</DIRECTION>
<AXE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AXE>
<DIRECTION>
Brian's on his feet now, coming toward them, when a chemical drum below EXPLODES, the shock wave BUCKLING the platform and DROPPING it several feet before it HOLDS. Brian, cut- off, is HIT with a wall of debris.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adcox and Stephen are FLUNG across the platform and THROUGH the shattered railing. Stephen grabs a piece of broken, dangling strut and hangs on with one hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In his other hand is Adcox. Hanging below him, his grip loosening.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stephen!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Brian's struggling to get out from under the debris. The railing Stephen's hanging onto is slick, his hand SLIPPING along it. But he won't let go of Adcox. His eyes bore into his best friend's with absolute conviction.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You go, we go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
The towering shots of FLAME from below have begun to IGNITE Adcox's pant leg. He's starting to burn. But Stephen won't let go. Won't let go even as the flames crawl up Adcox's back. And Stephen's hand is slipping and slipping and then it isn't slipping anymore because it's come off.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Adcox and Stephen FALL. There's a narrow catwalk half-way down. Stephen HITS with a sickening CRUNCH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adcox falls past it, down into the flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's an exposed I-beam running from the ruined platform out over the catwalk. Brian climbs up onto it, balances across over the fire below and jumps down to the catwalk where his brother lies, battered but still alive.

<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Over here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
They start for him when another drum EXPLODES, FLATTENING them and launching their hoseline into a crazy, thrashing arc. The flame has cut them off from the hose. Stephen sees what Brian's thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait for another hose team...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
But Brian's already moving for the catwalk ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait for the goddamn hose team!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Brian puts his feet on the outside rungs of the ladder and SLIDES down to the factory floor. He's heading for the hoseline when WHAM! -- The fire cuts him off. Not just any fire. That same one from so many years ago.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Don't fuck with me, kid. I'm not in the mood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nightengale's lost his helmet and it's lying near the flames spinning slowly upside down -- just like his father's. Brian stands there, paralyzed, as the fire laughs at him. Same old little kid with his finger up his ass. Then something different comes into Brian's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... No more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
There's a pathetic little wall extinguisher mounted on the pole. Brian lifts it, approaches the fire. You can practically hear the flames laugh at him. Brian suddenly turns and SLAMS the neck of the extinguisher against the pole, BREAKING it off before HEAVING the cannister HISSING into the flames where it EXPLODES -- a cloud of extinguisher powder that STUNS the flames just long enough for Brian to dash through and TACKLE the hose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fire shakes off the powder, rises up to kill -- Just as Brian spins and HITS it with the STREAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- And it's like a howling train wreck as the two grapple with each other -- Pengelly and Nightengale have an opening, and they're dashing for the catwalk ladder up to Stephen because the fire doesn't care -- it only has eyes for Brian now --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- And Stephen sees Brian tackle the monster, and his eyes fill with tears --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- And the fire's pushing Brian -- pushing him with the fury of a frightened street bully -- but Brian won't give -- and now the fire's back's broken -- it's whimpering, dying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Pengelly and Nightengale have climbed up to Stephen now, pulling him away.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my brother! That's my brother goddamn it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
And the fire's just a little gremlin now, sighing sadly as Brian steps up with the hoseline.
