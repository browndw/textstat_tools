Grainy, Kodak color, nineteen sixties documentary footage of a beautiful Polynesian island. We SEE quick shots of Kimono Dragons, Gila Monsters and Chameleons all in their natural tropical environment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Super: Moruro Atoll Islands, French Polynesia - June 1968
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Incongruously over this jungle environment we HEAR a static ridden radio filtered VOICE, slowly counting down in French. It is almost as through the reptiles of the island are reacting to the countdown as they anxiously move about.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly with a brilliant FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT, a nuclear EXPLOSION mushrooms into the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE a SERIES of REAL shots of footage of some of the over one hundred and sixty official nuclear tests the French government held in this tropical region.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Explosion after explosion devastates the locale. One building after the next, accelerating in momentum, culminating in one final EXPLOSION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clould-filled sky begins to drizzle. The ash-like fallout drifts downward onto what's left of the islands below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We FOLLOW this ash as it settles next to a dead reptile, unrecognizable now, and down onto what's left of the lizard's eggs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the image clears from the grainy footage to clean, modern high resolution. We ZOOM IN on one of the eggs as it slowly gets buried in the falling ash. WE continue to push in, getting closer...closer...

Super: Pacific Ocean, present day

INT. CORI AKIDO - BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We TRACK across the complicated computerized navigational console that is actually steering the immense ship. In the b.g. we HEAR a Japanese t.v. program playing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the end of the console is the ship's SKIPPER, an overweight Japanese seaman sleepily watches a snowy satellite broadcast of a Sumo wrestling match.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the SONAR blares out a warning ALARM. Startled, the Skipper awakes and stumbles out of his chair over to the console.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SONAR displays an enormous MASS heading quickly toward the ship. The Skipper's eyes go wide. He hits a KLAXON alarm, awaking the entire ship. He presses the radio/intercom.

Again, the ship is HIT. An enormous CRASHING SOUND is HEARD as the ship ROCKS to one side, tossing the Captain and Skipper to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly we HEAR the tell-tale, famous SCREAMING WAIL of our creature from somewhere outside. Terror shines in the Captain's eyes at the sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crew, getting back on their feet, reacts to the horrible WAILING SOUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the ship is HIT AGAIN. This time something enormous RIPS THROUGH THE HULL, crushing one of the crew members as it TEARS THROUGH THE WALLS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Water RUSHES THROUGH the large gaping hole, quickly filling the hallway. The Cook and what's left of the crew scurry for the stairs, as the water level chases them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ship's computers are WHIRLING with warning lights and alarms. As the Skipper tries to adjust the controls in vain, the Captain grabs the ship's p.a. system.

	Abandon ship! Abandon ship! Man the lifeboats...

But before he can say anything more, something WHIPS across the bridge's enormous windshield, SHATTERING THE GLASS. Was it a tail? No way, far too big.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHIP'S DECK - SAME - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors BURST open as the crew and the Cook rush out onto the deck. Again, the ship is HIT, ROCKING it violently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TARP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is ripped away, revealing a life boat. Two more life boats are revealed behind it as the crew desperately tries to hoist them up and over the side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - WATER BESIDE THE TANKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something ENORMOUS jolts out of the water towards the ship. Through the rainstorm it is hard to make out what it is, but it SLAMS into the side of the ship, RIPPING INTO IT, pulling down the starboard side as it does. Could that have been a CLAW?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Are thrown backwards. The lifeboats swing WILDLY, several of them SMASHING INTO BITS as they slam against the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CLAW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Or whatever it is, RIPS INTO THE SIDE AGAIN. This time the entire ship begins to FLIP OVER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LIFEBOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bounces off the deck and slides off the side. Following it is the Cook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Desperately, the Cook grabs onto the ship's side railing to keep from falling off. He looks back and SEES something so horrible that he SCREAMS IN TERROR and lets go of the railing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The old Cook slides over the side as the enormous tanker FLIPS OVER.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the infamously crippled nuclear power plant in the distance, the utility van slides to a muddy stop by this field of dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick hops out quickly and rushes to the back of the van. He opens the back of the van and grabs several metallic cases.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walking a few yards away from the van, he dumps the cases on the ground, opening them to REVEAL an assortment of sophisticated scientific equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taped to the inside are several photos of a girl we'll meet later. Some of the photos are of her looking young and beautiful. Others are of the two of them happily together.

INT. WNEW T.V. STATION - DAY

ANGLE - SECRETARY DESK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing in front of the desk is AUDREY TIMMONDS, early thirties, attractive, small town girl who still hasn't toughened in the big city and talking with her co-worker, LUCY, sitting.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Speak of the devil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>

Just then Caiman passes behind them.

<AUDREY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Think I should ask him? I'm going to ask him. You think I should? I will.

Audrey makes the decision and bolts after Caiman. Lucy rolls her eyes.

ANGLE - CAIMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he walks towards his office Audrey races up to him. Seeing her, he walks faster hoping to avoid her. He can't.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you talk with Humphries?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<CAIMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is not the place...

</CAIMAN>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just tell me, did you talk with him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<CAIMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAIMAN>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<DIRECTION>
They arrive at his office. An enormous standee of himself with the ACTION NEWS CREW is there.
</DIRECTION>
<CAIMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't I tell you over dinner tonight? Your place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAIMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He stops at his door. Audrey is startled.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Caiman, you're married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<CAIMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you're beautiful...

</CAIMAN>
<AUDREY>

<CAIMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call me Charlie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAIMAN>
<AUDREY>
<DIRECTION>
(stubbornly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<CAIMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So have dinner with me tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAIMAN>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<CAIMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your choice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAIMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Caiman shuts the door on her. She turns and is face to face with the standee of Caiman. She takes out her chewing gum and plasters it on his nose.

JAMAICAN BEACH WITH A BEACHED CARGO SHIP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taking up nearly the entire beach, an enormous cargo ship lays on its side in the sand. Two gigantic holes, ripped into its hull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILITARY JEEPS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick hops out and joins Major Hicks et al as they push past the gathered crowd of onlookers. The group gives a collective gasp as they see the ship for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three men (who we'll recognize from the Tahiti hospital) take measurements of the holes in the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<MAJOR_HICKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.

Everyone in the group turns to find Mr. Phillip Raymond.
</DIRECTION>
<MAJOR_HICKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAJOR_HICKS>
<DIRECTION>
Raymond hands him, as well as anyone who wants one, his business card.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.

The Major walks away. Raymond studies him as he does.

ANGLE - SHIP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick can't take his eyes off the enormous holes in the hull. He steps closer and turns to Peters, who's taking radiation counts of the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mind if I borrow this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Peter hands him his Geiger counter and walks into the cracked hull of the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARGO HULL - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside is eerily dark and creepy. The guts of the ship are tangled inside. Holding a Geiger counter, he gets readings from all over the area. One particular spot, above him, seems slightly stronger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick SEES something there. He opens his knapsack and puts on some rubber gloves, removing a glass jar (like the ones from Chernobyl)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carefully he climbs the debris until he reaches a sharp shard of metal. Clinging to it he finds a MEATY CHUNK OF REPTILE FLESH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries remove it but he only gets half. He places it into his jar. Just as he reaches for the other half, SOMETHING GIVES WAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a JOLT, the section above him collapses. A rush of water falls and a HUMAN BODY swings down, just in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick tumbles backwards, his heart pounding. The body swings lifelessly as it hangs from above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The others rush to his side, checking to see if he's all right.
</DIRECTION>
<PETERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay, Nick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETERS>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm...wait...I lost...

Nick looks around frantically when the glass sample jar is suddenly handed to him.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYMOND>

	Are you looking for this?

We are moving very quickly underwater. Ahead of us are some large FISHING NETS with a catch of fish carried in the bunt. Quickly we are heading for a collision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - OFF NEW ENGLAND COAST - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A great day for fishing. Slicing through the water we SEE three New England Fishing TRAWLERS, the HARPO, the CHICO, and the GROUCHO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE HARPO - SAME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARTHUR is at the wheel. Suddenly the engines WHINE as the ship begins to slow down. Surprised, Arthur checks his throttle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE CHICO - SAME - DAY

<DIRECTION>
LEONARD and his 1st MATE are puzzled by the engine WHINE of their own ship.

EXT. THE GROUCHO - SAME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The captain, JULES, hasn't noticed a thing as he lays on his deck tanning himself, a boom-abox blaring next to him. Suddenly THUD. The ship JOLTS for a second. Jules slides and BANGS his head into the boom-box. He yelps.
</DIRECTION>

ALL THREE BOATS SLOW TO A CRAWL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Arthur tries to GUN his engine but it only WHINES. Soon all three boats STOP DEAD. Nothing but quiet for a long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
Then with another JOLT all three boats begin to move BACKWARDS, DRAGGED BY THEIR OWN NETS!

<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's going sternway!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<FIRST_MATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell did we catch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_MATE>
<DIRECTION>
The three boats begin to PICK UP SPEED, moving BACKWARDS in the water. Water SPLASHES up into the boats, winches begin to CRACK under the building pressure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boats begin to move incredibly FAST backwards. Things on the boat begin to BREAK and CRASH DOWN onto the decks of the ships.
</DIRECTION>
<JULES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut us free! Cut the nets!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULES>
<DIRECTION>
The same cry is heard on all three boats. Leonard grabs an AXE and starts HACKING AWAY at the tow lines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jules and his deck hands do the same. WIRE SHEERS are brought out for the larger CABLES connected to the nets. Desperately they try and free themselves as their boats are dragged helplessly backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming at his men)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut the damned cables!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
A CABLE SNAPS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jules falls backward as the cables and ropes are either cut or snapped from the pressure. Their boat stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER CABLE SNAPS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard and his crew TUMBLE to the deck as their boat is freed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HARPO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is not so fortunate. The lone boat dragged backwards, faster now without the weight of the other boats. Then suddenly the aft of the boat begins to get PULLED DOWN, dipping into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With an unstoppable force the Harpo gets PULLED UNDER WATER. Deck hands LEAP off the boat as the top cabin is CRUSHED as the entire ship slowly DISAPPEARS BENEATH THE SEA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment all is quiet. No one can believe what just happened. Hearts pounding, catching their breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then with a WHOOSH of air pressure, the Harpo BURSTS out of the water. With a gigantic SPLASH, the boat FLOPS on its side and capsizes. The waters calm, but the nerves of Jules and Leonard don't.

Quickly stepping over him a young SOLDIER rushes over to Major Hicks, seated with the rest of the team on the plane's opposing benches. The Solider interrupts their discussion.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>

People SCRAMBLE to get out of the way as DEBRIS from the falling BUILDING litters the area. The Mayor is pulled inside by his security men.

Bursting out of the crumbling corner of the building we SEE the enormous LEG of the reptile as it KICKS debris out of its way.
</DIRECTION>

SIDE ANGLE - WALL STREET - FAST TRAVELING SHOT

Several cars are SQUASHED quickly as the enormous FEET of the beast STOMPS through the street. Cars FLATTEN and SCATTER, flipping toward us, from the weight of the beast. We try to keep up with it, but it's too fast.

Just then his Secretary notices a desk lamp, the shade SHAKING and the light FLICKERING. She hears the THUMPING approaching. She turns and SEES...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GIGANTIC TEETH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The enormous head of GODZILLA growls as it passes by Caiman's office window.

<SECRETARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Caiman. I think your story just walked by the window.

<ANIMAL>

</ANIMAL>
<DIRECTION>
Before anyone can speak the entire building is SHAKING. Through the front window we SEE...

<DIRECTION>
GODZILLA'S FOOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smashing down directly outside the window. Cars are SMASHED. One car SAILS directly INTO THE WINDOW, shattering it.

Animal uses his size to COVER the girls from the falling debris. As the danger passes, Animal charges for the door.

Animal comes rushing out. Water sprays from displaced fire hydrants, debris still falls, cars burn. Animal goes over to his NEWS VAN that has been partially crushed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pries open the rear door and takes out his video camera and takes off running. Audrey and Lucy arrive too late to stop him.

ANIMAL RUNNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turning the corner Animal runs full speed through the debris, trying to jam a video cassette into his camera. It won't fit. He SEES up ahead...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. THE TAIL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as it disappears around the corner a few blocks ahead. Thinking quickly, Animal bolts down a small alleyway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OTHER STREET - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His camera damaged, Animal struggles to get the tape inside as he exits the other side of the alley. He darts out into the street to get his shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The THUMPING is OVERPOWERINGLY LOUD. He looks up to see, CARS FLIPPING, PEOPLE SCATTERING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, for the first time, we can clearly see the entire massive creature that is...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GODZILLA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he comes barreling towards us. The titanic lizard is ferocious and agile. Swiftly he moves closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Animal's hands fumble with the tape. He JAMS it in, sweating. He fingers the POWER BUTTON, the red light goes on. Quickly he shoulders the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. THROUGH CAMERA - GODZILLA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nearly on top of him, Godzilla's own image is suddenly covered by his own immense foot as it's lifted and about to come down directly on us.
</DIRECTION>
<ANIMAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANIMAL>
<DIRECTION>
Before he can do anything about it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GODZILLA'S FOOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Towering above him. He has no time to flinch as the gargantuan foot SMASHES DOWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In terrifying amazement, Animal remains standing IN BETWEEN THE BEAST'S TOES. Abruptly the foot LIFTS again. Animal is unscathed and frozen with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - ANIMAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on Animal as the endless TAIL of the creature DRAGS just past him. It seems to go on forever. Finally it disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE ANGLE - TABLEAU OF A DEMOLISHED STREET

Deserted and demolished. Cars burn, debris falls. Animal, the lone figure, just stands there, his chest heaving, hyper ventilating.

Over Manhattan we see several dark plumes of smoke from the destruction. Military helicopters scan the city. Staring out at the skyline, Nick is mesmerized.

Raymond moves up to Nick and points ahead. Nick nods in nervous agreement. Just as they move towards the sounds the ENTIRE WALL OF THE TUNNEL COLLAPSES next to them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bursting through the tunnel wall GODZILLA appears. His enormous claws burrowing, he makes his way through and into the tunnel. Quickly he moves past the team.

The team races into the corridor. Animal reaches down and hits the POWER button near the moving stairs. The escalator comes to life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The team runs down the "down" escalators as the Babyzillas flood into the corridor. Some try to go down the "up" escalator and fall all over themselves. Others are spooked by the moving down escalator. Finally, the brave ones begin to LEAP down the "down" escalator.
</DIRECTION>

INT. MAIN LOBBY HALLWAY - SAME

<DIRECTION>
Racing out of the escalator corridor the team moves into the main lobby and FREEZES. They are surrounded on all sides by Babyzillas!

EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT

Raymond exits and Animal shuts the door behind him. The Babyzillas SLAM against the doors. It takes all of Animal's and Raymond's strength to hold the doors closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raymond slides his rifle barrel between the handles as a temporary lock. He pulls Animal away and they take off running.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
BOMB AND BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Collide and an ENORMOUS EXPLOSION ERUPTS, engulfing the entire building in a mountain of flame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raymond, Animal, Audrey and Nick are THROWN several feet forwards, toppling to the ground from the incredible impact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the building CRUMBLES in FLAMES we HEAR several of the Babyzillas SCREAMING. Soon they are silenced.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly Nick sits up and turns to Audrey. They're both shaken up. Nick touches her cheek gently.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THAT FAMOUS WAIL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is heard! Then, violently BURSTING up through the ashes, a very angry GODZILLA emerges!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bleeding from his injuries, Godzilla leans down and nuzzles the burned out remains of his young. For the first time in the film we can SEE a partial expression of Godzilla's face; pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But quickly that pain turns to burning anger as he focuses his hatred downwards, staring directly, and accusingly, at our heroes.
</DIRECTION>

As our heroes come rushing around a corner, Godzilla BURSTS THROUGH the building in front of them, sealing off their exit. Raymond notices a very narrow alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - ALLEY WAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raymond leads them through this slim alley between to large brick buildings. They run for their lives as Godzilla appears behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His claws are too big to reach into the alley so he BULLDOZES his way into it, the building ripping apart as he marches forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bricks go FLYING as debris showers down on our team just they make their way to the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowed down by the the position of the alley, Godzilla SWINGS his arms violently to clear a path.

In one deft move, Raymond draws a screwdriver out of his belt, pops the ignition device off the steering column and hot wires the car in under 15 seconds. It's amazing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he does this the others pile into the car. Not even completely all in, Raymond takes off as soon as the engine turns over. Animal nearly falls out.
</DIRECTION>

Landing, hard, onto the pavement, the cab PEELS OUT, burning rubber as it enters the George Washington Bridge.

The cab races towards us when Godzilla STEPS ONTO THE BRIDGE. His enormous weight makes the entire bridge WOBBLE.

The missiles CONNECT, SLAMMING INTO HIS CHEST, EXPLODING. His torso, rips apart. He SCREAMS OUT. His WAIL a painful death cry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His foot STOMPS DOWN as he tries to retain balance. The impact of the stomp acts like a shockwave that KNOCKS the Cab into a SPIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLAMMING into the guard rail, the cab bounces back into the road and keeps going.

The injured Godzilla bites the bullet and continues pursuing, his gait slowing. The cab is able to make some distance.

Oddly, Nick stares sympathetically at Godzilla's sad and lifeless face.

Off Audrey's confused expressions we PULL BACK, farther and farther. We see the mob, the military, the command tents and finally we pull back far enough to reveal Godzilla's mighty head laying on the end of the bridge.

INT. PENN STATION - SAME - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We FLOAT through the demolished station almost as though we were a moving point of view. We travel thorough the debris of the station into one of the tunnels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We travel deeper and deeper into the distance. A shaft of light up ahead. We move closer to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we get nearer we realize it's one of Godzilla's gigantic EGGS. WE move closer and closer to the solitary egg. Just as we are about to collide with it. CRACK. IT OPENS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:

THE END
