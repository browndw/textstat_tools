CATALEYA RESTREPO, CAT for short, a contained, very centered 10 year old, pretty, but with a toughness, sitting at the dining room table, in a well kept, but modest home, with windows that look out over the steep hillside favela, attends to her notebook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the window there are half a dozen beautiful orchid plants. The rare Cataleya orchid. All around there are packed cartons, suitcases. Moving day is at hand.

Two men, holding automatics in their laps sit in the back, the driver in the front. They see Fabio very contained, calm, walking towards them. The driver turns the engine on. Fabio slips into the passenger seat. The car takes off.

Fabio explodes. Smashes the dashboard. Over and over.

EXT. CAT'S HOME - DAY

Fabio's car comes to a screeching halt. Fabio exits to three other gunmen, nervous, on edge. The gunmen from the car take defensive positions. Fabio runs up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat is still at the table drawing, when she hears the screeching of tires, the fast footsteps outside. She senses a storm coming. Fabio bursts in. His wife sees his tension filled face.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CAT>
<DIRECTION>
Cat is strangely calm, just sits at the table. Watches as Fabio takes the family picture off the wall, pries the frame back, extracts a small chip hidden inside the frame, comes over to Cat.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me my darling. Just in case of anything. This...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIO>
<DIRECTION>
He holds the chip up.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is your passport. Do you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIO>
<DIRECTION>
She nods. He places the chip in her hand, takes a card out of his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You find yourself alone? You go to the address on this card. Show it to the man at the front gate.
	</DIALOGUE>

As Cat looks at the chip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAT'S HOME - DAY

As Fabio's men keep a sharp lookout, two SUV's come rolling down the street. Their fingers work the triggers of their weapons. The two SUV's roll up. The blacked out windows roll down.
</DIRECTION>

Fabio writes on top of Cat's drawing, rips the page off, folds it, puts it in her pocket, removes a medal from around his neck, drapes it over hers.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this will keep you safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIO>
<DIRECTION>
Cat looks down at the medal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE MEDAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An imprint of a flower.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Cataleya orchid. It comes from one place on Earth. Our place. My mother, your grandmother, used to grow them. Every morning I would wake up to the sight of them. The smell of them. That's why I named you after them. It reminds us of who we are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIO>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her on the forehead. His wife appears at the doorway with two suitcases.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>

He listens.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>

	OK. OK.

</MAN>

He hangs up. Puts his phone back in his pocket. Walks up to Fabio's men.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Change of plans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls out his gun, shoots them point blank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they are exiting the house through a rear door, the shots ring out. They see another black SUV rushing up the street.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIO>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes his family back inside. Fabio runs to the window. Sees his men on the losing end of a gun battle. As the men fall, and others run up the stairs firing as they retreat toward the front door...
</DIRECTION>
<FABIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too late. Get ready!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIO>
<DIRECTION>
The Mother drops the suitcases and runs to the rear room. Fabio comes over to the unnaturally calm Cat.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you very much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIO>
<CAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you too Papa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAT>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON FABIO'S HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaches under the table where Cat is sitting, takes a gun strapped there. Next to the gun is a big knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then footsteps, coming fast outside, draw his attention.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alicia!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIO>
<DIRECTION>
His wife runs into the room toting two big assed assault rifles. She tosses one to Fabio. Both of them take up shooter's positions facing the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON CAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting at the table, very still. Watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON HER MOTHER AND FATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Facing the front door, hands gripping their assault rifles, sweat dripping down their faces, chests heaving, waiting, waiting, to blow anyone who comes through the door to kingdom come.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But they never get the chance because...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BBBBRRRRAAAAKKKKKK!!!!!!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine gun fire shatters the windows on both sides of the room, tearing into their bodies before they even get one shot off. Tearing the orchid plants there to shred.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat watches in mute disbelief, shocked, as her parents bodies are riddled with heavy caliber rounds making them twitch and dance like marionettes on wires. Their blood splattering across the room, across her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Silence so complete it is deafening in it's absence of any sound. Cat just sits in her chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then the door bursts open and four gunmen storm into the room, their assault weapons trained on the only living thing in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat. Marco enters.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You in the kitchen. You, the bedroom. You, the back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
The gunmen scatter. Marco has his inquisitive eye on Cat, who does not drop her eyes, impossible to read.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the GUNMAN strides over to Cat, jams a gun to her head. Cat does not move a muscle. Does not blink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MARCO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Examines the frame Fabio dug the chip out of.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE GUNMAN WITH THE GUN TO CAT'S HEAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He chambers a round, is about to pull the trigger...
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
As the other gunmen begin to tear the house apart, looking for something, Marco strides over to Cat. The frame in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<GUNMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don Luis said kill everyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUNMAN>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He also said no names.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<GUNMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She won't remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUNMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He is about to pull the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HEY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
The gunman stops.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<GUNMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUNMAN>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean so what? You take a kid, teach them, they have value.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
The gunman takes his gun, lifts Cat's lip, looks at her teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<GUNMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't even get ten bucks for her in the street.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUNMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The gunman is about to pull the trigger again.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you stupid or what? Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
Marco hands him some cash.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's twenty asshole. Go do your job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
Scowling, the gunman joins the others in ripping the house apart, looking for something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marco calmly goes to the fridge, takes out two bottles of water, cracks the caps, sets one down on front of Cat as he sits opposite her. Her hands are in her lap.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
(SOFTLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember me Cataleya?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
Cat shakes her head no.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was at your confirmation. My name is Marco, and I was a very good friend of your father. I see he gave you his medal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
Alluding to the medal around her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Cataleya orchid. His symbol. Your name. That's good. This way you will always remember him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know this is a terrible thing for you to have seen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
All the while his men are searching, frisking the bodies of the dead, even tearing the heels off their shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some things are too complicated for a kid to understand. This is one of them. But I am going to try explain it and make it very simple for you. So you understand. Now, you know who Don Luis is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
Cat responds, shakes her head yes. Her hand slips imperceptibly under the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON HER HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Touches the handle of the knife taped there.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course you do. He was your father's best friend since they're kids. He's like an Uncle to you. You know he has always been good to your family, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
Again Cat shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This house, the food you eat, the clothes you wear. Even your school fees. All this comes from Don Luis. You know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
Again Cat shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But when someone is good to you and you are not good to them back, then bad things happen. Things like...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
He alludes to the riddled bodies of her dead parents.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
Cat looks from the bodies and back to Marco, no emotion in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you are a smart girl. You do well in school. So I know this is not too complicated for you to understand. Am I right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
Cat nods.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Now, your father had something that belonged to Don Luis. A little thing. No bigger than...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
He holds up his thumbnail.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This. Maybe it was in this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
He holds up the frame, shows where the chip was dug out of the wood.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know what I am talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
Cat nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON CAT'S HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gripping the knife handle.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellent. Do you know where it is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
Cat nods.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you give it to me, Don Luis will be very grateful. And very generous. He will make sure that you are clothed, fed, and sent to the very best school. You will have everything you want. But if you don't give it to him, he will be very unhappy. And you see what happens when he is not happy, yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
Cat nods yes.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So why don't you just give that little thing which belongs to him. Will you do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
Cat hesitates for a moment, and then removes one hand from underneath the table, her fist closed tight. Marco smiles, kindly. He holds out his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are a smart girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
Marco opens his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And in this life, smart girls get everything they want. What do you want Cat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
And just as she is about to open her hand...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON HER OTHER HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under the table, gripping the handle of the knife taped there.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just tell me sweetheart...what do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
In a flash, the knife is whipped out and buried into Marco's unsuspecting, open palm. Driven with such force, the knife pierces through the back of his hand, and sticks into the table beneath; pinning his hand. Marco wants to scream but there is so much pain, nothing escapes his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<CAT>
<DIRECTION>
(in his ear)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To kill Don Luis!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAT>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	AAARRRGGGHHHH!!!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
The men searching look up, and before they can react, Cat races past them.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCO>
<DIRECTION>
TRACK WITH CAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she runs through the rooms of the house, sprints to the bathroom where one foot hits the toilet, springing her onto the ledge of a very small window. As she looks back, she sees the gunmen in hot pursuit. And she jumps, head first. Barely squeezing her small frame through the tiny window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And she drops...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Six feet down, onto a ledge, that is just beneath the window. She flattens against the wall, holding onto the medal of her father.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the gunman comes to the window, cannot fit through, looks out, does not see anybody across, then hears something beneath him, looks down, sees the tip of a shoe below. Puts his gun out the window, points it down, and....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BBBBRRRRAAAAKKKKKKK!!!!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lets loose with a barrage from his weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON CAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She watches as the bullets split the cement all around her feet. Coming inches from ripping into them. And then the barrage stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE GUNMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His clip runs out. And as he fumbles to slam another one in...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON CAT

She hears the pause. Looks out over the sprawl of houses that stretch up and down the steep hillsides of the favela. She looks down at her open palm at the small chip her father gave her. Pops the chip in her mouth, swallows, leaps over the small divide between her house and the next roof, and takes off running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE GUNMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gets the clip to fit, sees Cat heading off across the roof, out in the open, exposed, vulnerable. He lifts his gun to shoot, when the gun muzzle is slammed up, peppers the ceiling with bullets. The gunman turns to Marco, holding his bloody rag wrapped hand.

Jumping down from the window of Cat's home, start to sprint across the roof in hot pursuit.

She drops down to another roof, this one filled with a vegetable patch, where an old man is gardening.

He orders four more gunmen who have just zoomed up on motorcycles. The souped up rice rockets take off in four different directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON CAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she comes off the last rooftop, down into a small alley. She sprints across to a small door. She kicks at the door, which gives way and enters...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN OPEN COURTYARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where a half dozen women are doing laundry by an open tap. They look up to the sight of this little girl in the blood splattered school uniform, do not say a word. And neither does Cat. She just runs through to a small gate on the far side of the courtyard, opens it, and disappears. One of the women casually hangs one of her wet sheets over the gate, hiding it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE GUNMEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They crash through the vegetable garden. The old man deftly kicks a rake leaning against the wall. It falls in between the rows of tomato vines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the gunmen sprint through, the first one trips over the rake, goes crashing through the vines, which causes the two men behind him to also trip and fall. The fourth man hurdles his fallen cohorts, bounds over the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the fifth man, looks at the old man. Knows what he has done. Shoots him dead before jumping off the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON CAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She races down a steep hill in the crowded favela streets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE GUNMEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They enter the laundry yard. The women don't even look up. The gunmen look around, just see laundry hanging from the fence, do not see the hidden door. Race back out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON CAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs down a steep alley, filled with people sitting outside their homes, chatting, playing dominoes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the end of the alley, two motorcycles appear. The riders see Cat, as she sees them. They turn their bikes into the alley...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VRROOOM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And bear down on Cat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat sprints back up the hill. She goes to escape into one of the open doors, but she finds that one after another the doors have closed shut, the people fled inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bikes eat up the hill. Cat's legs are no match for them. It seems she will be caught any second. She ducks down a street where laundry is hung on a concealed metal pipe running the length of the alley. As Cat ducks through the sheets the gunmen gun their bikes right towards her, tear through the sheets...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND THE CONCEALED METAL PIPE CATCHES THEM ACROSS THEIR THROATS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON CAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks back, to the dead gunmen, disappears over the hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND JUST AS SHE DOES...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat comes over the top of a hill, the soot of the chimney, mingled with the blood of her parents, staining her dress. The doors and windows all along the street are shuttered tight. Her eyes search the curb as she makes her way down the street. When she hears the sound of a vehicle. She looks up to a jeep turning the corner.

In total disbelief, watching her disappear down the narrow slit in the curb.

Both jeeps pull up. The men jump out. Marco flattens to the street, peers into the grate, sees Cat staring up at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marco takes his gun out. Jams it in the grate...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAMBAMBAMBAMBAM!!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Empties his clip into the dark. When he runs out of ammo, he peers down again.

She stands at the edge of the busy thoroughfare, and looks around. She is in the heart of the city. Where tall office buildings, compete with graceful, classical mansions. In the distance, she sees the hillsides, covered with the twinkling lights of the favelas, two miles, and a world away.

MONTAGE DAY/NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The landscape of America passes by through the window of a bus. Clutching a new Lara Croft comic, nibbling on a big Mac and fries out of a bag, Cat sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sugar cane harvests in the Florida wetlands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two big fat black women sitting on the porch of a shack shelling peas in the deep South.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Steel Mills of Pittsburgh fire up.
</DIRECTION>

The endless expanse of corn and wheat stretching from horizon to horizon across Ohio.
</DIRECTION>

The giant milk barns of Indiana with their hundreds of cows.

<DIRECTION>
And finally, sees the great city of Chicago looming in the distance as the bus hurls down the highway towards it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHICAGO BUS TERMINAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As seedy as any bus terminal. People bustling, people hustling. A veritable cauldron of humanity bubbling with the good, the bad, the ugly. The predators and the prey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat exits into this stew of life, looks around, checks things out. As she is checked out in turn by some pretty sleazy types.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat ignores the eyes following her, walks up to a dwarf hawking newspapers. Hands him her slip of paper. He points her in a direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat walks across the neighborhoods of Chicago.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sees the signs in Polish change into signs in Italian, in Spanish, Chinese, Ethiopian.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hands her paper to an Ethiopian cabbie. He points her onward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks past bars where black gangbangers watch her pass. She hands one her paper, he points her on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks past massive churches, synagogues, mosques.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks past the stately houses of the Gold Coast, along the deserted stretches of the glam shops on Michigan Avenue, over the bridges...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until she comes to...

EXT. ROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

ANGLE ON CAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat, walking down the block as the eyes of everyone she passes follow her. She stops on a street corner. Seems lost. Opposite her a group of men, hanging outside a bar see her. The leader of the group calls her over.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey kid. You know what time it is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Cat shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's late, and this is not the kind of place a kid should be hanging out. What are you doing here?

<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
He disappears up a small alley into the darkness beyond. Cat, not knowing what to do, sits down on the curb, watches street life. She sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hookers soliciting men in passing cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cops sitting in a patrol car, bored, blase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Men playing craps against a wall.

Some very discreet dope deals, more sleight of hand than anything else.

Again, Emilio stops. The man hands her Cat's paper.

He turns abruptly, heads back up the alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat follows the man through a darkened alley. At intervals, on either side, dangerous looking men, armed to the teeth, stand in the shadows. The man opens a door, beckons Cat to enter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat follows the man as he moves down a long hallway. Cat looks into the rooms on either side of the hall as she walks along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In one room, opening out to a trucking bay, TV sets are being unloaded into a big warehouse full of stolen merchandise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In another room, guns are being serviced. Lots of guns, hand guns, assault rifles. Big artillery.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!

<DIRECTION>
Cat's attention is drawn away from the room with the guns, to the Man holding a door open for her at the very end of the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat enters an office with three women working on computers. Looks like any other business office. At the sight of Cat, the women get up and exit, closing the door behind them. Cat is left alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around the office, when the sound of a door opening behind her. She turns to Emilio. Who approaches her cautiously, scrutinizing her.
</DIRECTION>
<EMILIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cataleya?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIO>
<DIRECTION>
Now it is Cat who hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<CAT>

Emilio covers his mouth, seems rocked.

</EMILIO>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses himself.
</DIRECTION>
<EMILIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you were all...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIO>
<DIRECTION>
Cat stands stock still. Emilio takes her up in his arms, lifts her, crushes her to his chest. Cat remains suspended, emotionless for a moment. And then, for the first time emotion, real emotion, washes across her face. Her lower lip begins to tremble. Tears well up in her eyes. She bursts into tears.
</DIRECTION>
<EMILIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're safe now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIO>
<DIRECTION>
All the emotion, the fear, the anger that she has kept locked away deep inside, rushes to the surface in one massive wave.
</DIRECTION>
<EMILIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're safe.
	</DIALOGUE>

EXT. CHICAGO - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun peeks over the horizon, spreading the fog infused light coming off Lake Michigan across the sleeping city as it ascends in the sky.

<DIRECTION>
One beam of sunlight slips through the narrow crack between a window and the shade covering it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Cat looks around the clean, orderly bedroom as she gathers her thoughts. Her eyes move around the room. It is a boy's room.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

</EMILIO>
<CAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. A long time ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAT>
<EMILIO>

	Well good. A growing body needs sleep. When I was your age I would sleep half the day. I don't know if it helped with the growing, but I was well rested for whatever came after.

Emilio draws a .357 magnum pistol from his shoulder holster, and empties the entire clip into the front of a car coming down the street. The car careens off the road, smashes a fire hydrant, crashes through a plate glass window of a shop across the street. The water from the hydrant shoot twenty feet in the air. Emilio holsters his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<EMILIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to teach you to be a killer? No problema. I'll teach you. But you'll be dead in five years. If you want to be a killer, and survive, you have to be a smart one. You have to know things besides how to pull a trigger. You have to know how the world works. How people think. You got to learn to be psychological. That I cannot teach you, unless you learn the basics at school. Got it?

<DIRECTION>
Cat glares at him.

<EMILIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what's it going to be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIO>
<DIRECTION>
He holds out the gun in one hand, and the schoolbag in the other. Cat hesitates for a moment. Takes the schoolbag from Emilio. Then takes his hand, and they walk off together as police sirens announce the arrival of cruisers, and people pour out of the school and the surrounding stores. As they put distance between the chaos and themselves.

The front end of the cop car gets sheared right off by the impact. Glass shatters, metal crunches, airbags explode!

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other car. The drivers door opens. A vodka bottle falls out, clinks to the sidewalk. And a moment later, two legs emerge from the car. Two very long, very shapely legs. Legs that never end. In very high heels, and a very short mini skirt. And the face on top of it, framed by a mane of wild hair, is drop dead think-you-have-died- and-gone-to-heaven gorgeous. The whole package reads SUPERMODEL. And by the way she is weaving when she stands, and the bottle at her feet, the read is; very drunk supermodel. Who looks at the crumpled police cruiser, looks into the windshield of the cruiser at the stunned cops, and says in the most sweetly drunk voice...
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERMODEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oops...
	</DIALOGUE>

The cops can't believe this. They regain their wits and bolt out of the car.

<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all you have to say? Oops?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_1>
<DIRECTION>
And, ever so sensually, she starts to laugh. The cops look at each other, perplexed. And she keeps laughing.

<DIRECTION>
The cops get pissed.
</DIRECTION>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Funny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_1>

<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wanna laugh you crazy bitch? I'll give you something to laugh about!

INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lone cop passes Cat's cell, doing the nightly rounds. As soon as he is gone...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON CAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat's eyes snap open. She sits up, moves with the efficiency and determination of someone who has not has a drop of alcohol. She takes a spoon from the coffee cup left for her, reaches into her mane of hair and extracts a small pin. She inserts the pin into the keyhole of the door, jiggles it. The door pops open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat exits the cell, takes a broom leaning in the corner, and keeping her eye on the camera above the door, she slides along the wall, until she is just under the camera. She uses the broom handle to tilt the camera up just a bit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECURITY MONITORING ROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
One lone cop sits in front of the various monitors. He does not notice that one tilts slightly up, points toward a blank wall.

INT. HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat comes into the hall where several vending machines lean against the wall. On the far side is a door marked: ELECTRICAL. She is about to head for it, when she hears a door open at the far end of the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the far end of the hall. A cop comes in, looks down the hall. Where Cat was standing he sees only the vending machines. He heads right for the machines. Puts coins in the machine, waits for his food.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE SIDE OF THE MACHINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where Cat is pressed hard against the flat surface, inches from the cop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sandwich falls, the cop retrieves it, moves off, exits down the hall. Cat waits until she hears the door shut on the far end of the wall. She crosses quickly to the door across the way, enters.

INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat stands on a narrow shelf, undoes the last screws on a vent in the ceiling with a screwdriver from the tool board on one wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat drops down, opens the electrical control panel on the wall, studies it for a moment, finds the switch she is looking for, then turns to the wall of tools, plucks some wire, a cutter, a spring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat sets to work on a jury rigged mechanism with the items at hand. When she is finished, she tugs at the waist band of her mini skirt, and little by little she stretches a thin dun colored leotard suit over her whole body. She takes a small plastic vial, fills it with some water from the tap, and sets it, just so, above the device she has constructed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The device is hooked to the switch she selected, a small weight hangs from the bottom of it by a wire. She sets the water container just so over the spoon from her cell. The water begins to drip a drop at a time. She closes the panel door, sets her digital watch. Hoists herself up to the vent in the ceiling, and is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE JURY RIGGED DEVICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Water dripping into the spoon a drop at a time.

<DIRECTION>
INT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once inside the grate, Cat takes one of the buttons off her blouse and presses the top of it. The button becomes a pin light, which she clasps between her teeth, starts to crawl on her stomach, pulling herself along by her elbows and her wriggling hips and knees, the light still between her teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACK WITH CAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she moves through the maze of ducts. On the way, she peers through the grates in each ceiling, down into one cell after another, catching various views of inmates asleep as she passes over them. Until she comes to a ventilation fan blocking the way. The fan blades go round and round. Cat looks at her watch, looks at the fan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE ELECTRICAL PANEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Cat's jury rigged device. The water has almost filled the spoon, one more drop, one more drop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON CAT LOOKING AT HER WATCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The digital counter goes from 4 to 3 to 2 to 1...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last drop of water drips into the spoon, the spoon tips, tugging on the wire, the wire trips the switch it is connected to, the whole device comes apart, the separate pieces fall to the floor.

Cat enters a completely bare bones dwelling, there is nothing that identifies the person who lives here. White bare walls, a table with one chair, a single bed. Along one wall, a cabinet. On the window sill a single Cataleya orchid. Cat waters the orchid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat opens the cabinet to three computer screens. Two of them are divided into quarters and show various views of the building entrance, the lobby, the stairway, the elevator, the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The third screen is dark, until Cat hits a button and music fills the apartment. Music with a heavy sensual back beat. French Rap. Ooh la la. And the screen pulses and glows in time to the beat. Cat's body responds to the music, moving sexy, her shoulders rolling, her hips swaying.

Cat sashays across the open space, a stripper strutting her stuff; shedding, first her blouse, then her jeans, her lingerie, until, by the time she reaches a free standing opaque cylinder of a shower with an opaque shower curtain, she is completely nude. She enters the shower. Turns on the water.

</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Giggling, the girls scamper toward the villa, where a sumptuous table is set on the veranda, attended by more servants. William is handed a drink, as he sips it, watches their perfect, barely covered butts, his eyes pools of desire, the servant holds out an envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<SERVANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For you sir.

Perplexed, William takes his eyes off the girls and regards the envelope. No return address, no stamps. He opens it, and his perplexed look goes to one of concern.

INT. VILLA - NIGHT

William is at the double doors to his massive bedroom suite, the girls are on the bed in the BG jumping around, in the skimpiest bra and panty sets, having a pillow fight.

As they all enter the villa, the CAMERA lingers on the van. A figure dressed in black rolls out from under the carriage as it pulls away and disappears into the bushes.
</DIRECTION>

Two guards stand outside the bedroom door. Two guards are on the stairs. Three guards in the salon. Three more in the garden outside.

INT. VILLA - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The Head of Security goes around the villa checking that all the doors and windows are secure. His men are posted outside the door to the bedroom, on the stairs, in the salon. He closes lights as he goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks across the aquarium floor in the foyer to the front door, closes the lights, so that only the glow from the aquarium lights illuminate the dark. And he exits, closing the door behind him, turning the lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE AQUARIUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sharks gliding back and forth. And then, a figure in a black wet suit, fins and a mask, with a small back back, comes gliding into through the sharks. Who just go about their business. The figure stops at the edge of the glass floor, takes something out of the back pack and very skillfully cuts a small hole in one of the glass panels that makes up the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The diver lifts out of the aquarium, pulls back the wet suit. It is Cat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat opens the backpack, removes a silencer fitted pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE BEDROOM DOORS OPENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat enters, silent, closes the door, approaches the bed where William is asleep sandwiched between the three passed out girls. Empty champagne bottles and glasses are strewn about.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat stares down at the scene, points her gun at William. One of the girls rolls over onto William, ruining her shot. She hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON WILLIAM'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As sits up suddenly, startled from sleep. No one is in the room. He looks around, and notices the bedroom door ajar. He is more awake now, sees the Nymphettes sleeping soundly. He rises, dressed in a silk sleeping robe. He feels something on his chest, goes over to the mirror, opens his gown and sees, painted on his chest: In red lipstick, the word THIEF, and a drawing of a Cataleya orchid. Panic starts to set in.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
No answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William tip toes to the ajar door. He peeks out and sees two guards with bullets through their foreheads, blood leaked out across the white marble floor. Really panicked, he flattens himself against the inside of the door, his breath coming in gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VILLA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William, holding the two guns of the dead guards in front of him, makes his way down stairs, past two more dead guards. Growing more and more nervous by the moment, he tries a light switch on the wall, nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The only light comes from the ambient glow of the aquarium below. He reaches the bottom of the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anybody?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. He crosses the aquarium floor, and when he is right in the middle...
</DIRECTION>
<CAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop right there.

Cat comes out of the dark. In her hand, a silencer fitted pistol.

<CAT>
	<DIALOGUE>

</WILLIAM>
<CAT>
	<DIALOGUE>

And then, without warning, she puts a bullet in both his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ARRRGGGHHHH!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
He falls to the floor. The blood starts to seep out onto the glass. The sharks swim back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever they paid you, I'll double it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<CAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know the thing about sharks. You can swim with them all day and they will just ignore you, but put one drop of blood in the water and they become your biggest admirers.

She fires three shots into the glass square he is kneeling on. The glass shatters. William falls into the water. Grabs onto the squares on either side and props himself up. His blood runs down into the clear water. Cat turns and walks toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please! Please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
He struggles frantically to pull himself out. Cat exits. And then the sharks hit. WHAM! And hit. And hit. And hit.

Marco looks at Eduardo, who glares at him. Eduardo goes to line up his shot. The tension in the room is thicker by the moment. As Eduardo is about to hit the ball, Marco grabs his hair and slams his forehead into the cue ball. At the same moment, Marco's two thugs whip out their guns and blast away. The shotgun wielding man, raises his gun, and as he is killed by Marco, his blast takes out one of Marco's thugs.

</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
And for the first time, she lets him touch her first. Let's him kiss her lips, her neck, and as he goes south, kissing as he goes, the CAMERA holds on her face, and for the first time she allows herself to receive, to give herself over to being the seduced rather than the seducer. And she likes it.

<DIRECTION>
And she is gone. Ross watches the timer on the microwave. When it beeps, he sits a moment longer. Hesitates to get up. Little by little, he moves himself off the chair, tentative. Afraid that any moment, BOOM! Until he makes the final move, stands just enough to clear the seat, waiting for the worst to happen. And when it doesn't, he breathes a sigh of relief.
