FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We descend upon Carpathian Ridge, a crescent-shaped cliff that extrudes from the dense Virginia evergreens above a deep rock canyon. The cliff marks the end of a dirt road that winds down from above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donnie Darko (sixteen) is asleep at the edge of the cliff. With his bike collapsed next to him, he is shivering, curled up on the foetal position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slowly opens his eyes and looks around, disoriented by the morning light. He then stands up, looking down into the expansive rock canyon. After a moment of hesitation, he takes his bike back up the hill.
</DIRECTION>

Donnie turns the corner and heads towards the garage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pan over to the Darko house... moving through the front yard where Eddie Darko (forty-four) pulls the cord and his gas-powered leaf-blower roars to life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elizabeth Darko (nineteen) comes out the front door. She approaches her dad from behind. Eddie turns and aims the leaf-blower at her face... blasting her with air.

A crane lifts a gigantic jet engine over from the house towards a large flatbed truck. Firemen kick pieces of wood and shingle from the roof.

	<DIALOGUE>
	"There would be headlines in the papers. Even the grown-up gangs who ran the betting at the all-in wrestling and the barrow-boys would hear with respect how Old Misery's house had been destroyed. It was as though this plan had been with him all his life, pondered through the seasons, now in his fifteenth year crystallised with the pain of puberty."

	Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean soap?

Donnie gets up and walks over to the board and writes the phrase.

He then sits down again without hesitation.
</DIRECTION>

The Police Officer hesitates for a moment, lingering over Donnie's penmanship. He then places a '?' next to Donnie's name on the roster. Ms. Pomeroy makes eye-contact with him.

EXT. OLD GUN RUINS - AFTERNOON (FRIDAY MAGIC HOUR, 4:30 P.M.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ruins of a brick chimney sit in the middle of a field. Donnie, Sean and Ronald have lined up several empty beer bottles, cans and stuffed animals on the hearth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They take turns blasting these targets with a BB gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blam! A can falls over. Ronald hands the gun to Donnie. Sean pulls out a bottle of Raspberry Night Train and takes a sip. He hands the bottle to Ronald.
</DIRECTION>

<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then she fucks 'em all while Vanity watches. And Papa Smurf films it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ronald takes another sip of Night Train... followed by another dry heave. Blam! A bottle breaks.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First of all... Papa Smurf didn't create Smurfette. Gargamel did. She was sent in as Gargemel's evil spy, with the intention of destroying the smurf village. But the overwhelming Goodness of the Smurf Way of Life transformed her into the Smurfette we all know and love. And as for the whole gang-bang scenario... it just couldn't happen. Smurfs are asexual. They probably don't even have reproductive organs down there under those little white pants. The only reason they exist is because of magic spells and witchcraft... which is all a bunch of bullshit if you ask me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what's so illogical about the smurfs... what's the point of living if you don't have a dick?

Donnie aims the gun... pulls the trigger. Blam! A bottle breaks.
</DIRECTION>
<RONALD>

Grandma Death doesn't hear her. She wanders around in circles. Furious, Ms. Farmer gets out of the car and walks over to the old woman, walking her by the shoulders back to her driveway.

Opens it... closes it. Walks away.

They continue to watch her, sipping liquor into the sunset, as Grandma Death repeats this act like an ancient wind-up doll.

INT. FAMILY ROOM - EVENING (FRIDAY, 7 P.M.)

INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER (7:15 P.M.)

Looking nauseous, Donnie opens the medicine cabinet and retrieves his pills. He takes four of them. Donnie takes a drink of water, closing his eyes. He puts the pills back and closes the cabinet.
</DIRECTION>

In the mirror's reflection is Frank. Donnie jumps.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got away with it. Don't worry.

Donnie reaches his hand out towards Frank and it presses against an invisible wall, as if he were pressing his hand against liquid glass.

</MS_FARMER>
<PRINCIPAL_COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kitty...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCIPAL_COLE>
<MS_FARMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.

</MS_FARMER>
<DIRECTION>
She stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<MS_FARMER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have in my hand Graham Greene's "The Destructors". This short story is part of my daughter's English assignment. In this story, several children destroy an elderly man's house from inside out. They destroy his house without motive, without moral consequence. They destroy private property ...and they get away with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_FARMER>
<DIRECTION>
Ms. Pomeroy shakes her head bitterly.
</DIRECTION>
<MS_FARMER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)

</MS_FARMER>

<DIRECTION>
A heated debate among the parents is under way. Frustrated, Rose stands up. Karen Pomeroy is furious.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<MS_FARMER>

	So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?

	<DIALOGUE>
	So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?

	And so, let us begin Lifeline Exercise No. 1.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM_CUNNINGHAM>
<DIRECTION>
"PLEASE PRESS STOP NOW" appears on the screen.

<DIRECTION>
Ms. Farmer stops the tape and moves to the blackboard. On it, she has drawn a horizontal line book-ended by the words "Love" and "Fear".
</DIRECTION>
<MS_FARMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you can see, the Lifeline is controlled by two polar extremes: "Fear" and "Love". Fear is in the negative energy spectrum. Love is in the positive energy spectrum.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.

</MS_FARMER>
<DONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNIE>
<MS_FARMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Lifeline is divided that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_FARMER>
<DONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNIE>
<MS_FARMER>
<DIRECTION>
(impatient)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_FARMER>
<DONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else.

Dr. Monnitoff has drawn a diagram on the blackboard. In his hand he holds a copy of Stephen Hawking's "A Brief History of Time".
</DIRECTION>
<DR_MONNITOFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a shot cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MONNITOFF>
<DONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --

<DR_MONNITOFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Theoretically.

	A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.

	You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.

	I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head.

INT. FAMILY ROOM - NEXT

<DIRECTION>
Donnie sits back in the La-Z Boy, dozing off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John Madden's CBS chalkboard unfolds on the TV screen. Madden traces his electronic lines across the screen, tracing the movement of the players... as their images are frozen in time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donnie's eyes close... and then re-open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donnie turns his head and sees that the room is momentarily bathed in artificial white light, as if God hit the slow-motion button during a flash of lightning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donnie turns his head and sees that protruding from his father's stomach... is a thick spear made of silvery plastic gel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Eddie gets up from the couch to walk over to the refrigerator ...his spear precedes him... morphing into an extruded arrow that reaches the refrigerator several seconds before him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The spear traces the exact geography of his movement through time... using his centre of gravity as its axis point.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donnie turns and sees Samantha skipping from the kitchen... as her spear bounces several feet in front of her like a caterpillar. Her spear... smaller than her father's... is proportional to her mass.

He does not follow it. It then retreats back in and beckons him to follow.

Like a child transfixed by a firefly... Donnie follows the path of his spear into the foyer.

His spear leads him to the closet. He opens the closet door... and the spear leads him down to a box hidden beneath his father's shoe rack.

Donnie removes the box from the closet and unlatches it. Inside is a gun. Donnie removes the pistol from the box... staring at it with the same childlike expression.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly... Donnie's universe snaps back to normal. The white light strobes... the spear has vanished.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donnie still holds the gun. His expression changes to nervous shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes linger over the gun for a moment, he then quickly puts it back in the box... and carefully places the box back under the shoe rack.

<DONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
She thinks for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<GRETCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRETCHEN>
<DONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not just buy your baby a night light?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNIE>
<GRETCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRETCHEN>
<DONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With, like, images?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNIE>
<GRETCHEN>

Donnie stops and takes Gretchen's hand.

Donnie goes in for an awkward kiss... but Gretchen turns and denies him.

	No... Donnie, wait. I've never...

	I always wanted it to be at a time when ...when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.

</DONNIE>
<GRETCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.

Donnie rides along the sidewalk... and skids to a stop, seeing a wallet lying there.

Donnie opens the wallet, looking at the ID. It reads:

	Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNIE>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just being honest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNIE>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.

	What I think is going on with your son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_THURMAN>
<ROSE>

	Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression ...He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She deserved it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DR_THURMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rose... let me just lay out what I believe is happening here. Donnie's aggressive behaviour seems to stem from his increased detachment from reality. His inability to cope with the forces in the world that he perceives to be threatening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_THURMAN>

Rose smiles nervously.

<DR_THURMAN>

<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DR_THURMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has described lengthy conversations... physical encounters with what I believe to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind.

Rose looks over at Eddie with an expression of panic.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... What can we do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DR_THURMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_THURMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie looks at Rose... who nods in approval.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If that's what you think is necessary.

</ROSE>
<DR_THURMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.

Donnie stands in front of the bathroom mirror... catatonic... looking at his reflection.

Frank stands behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Donnie turns around with the butcher's knife and lunges at Frank with all of his weight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The knife collides with Frank's invisible force field as if it were liquid steel. Donnie lunges repeatedly at Frank with psychotic rage... but the knife bounces off.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that's what I like to hear!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly serious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals ...and disease-spreading behaviour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM_CUNNINGHAM>
<DIRECTION>
A large screen lowers behind him.

<JIM_CUNNINGHAM>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head tragically)

	<DIALOGUE>
	His name was Frank.

</JIM_CUNNINGHAM>
<DIRECTION>
On the giant screen, an image slide appears of a young cartoon teenager whose eyes are whacked out on drugs. The title appears: HIS NAME WAS FRANK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Upon hearing the name Frank, Donnie falls into a paranoid trance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gretchen, who looks extremely bored, leans over to Donnie.
</DIRECTION>
<GRETCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRETCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Donnie ignores her. His eyes are locked on Jim Cunningham, who begins his rousing re-enactment of the sad, unfortunate downfall of Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Within minutes, Jim Cunningham has the crowd laughing... enamoured of him with his cartoon slide show.

Several students get up and go to the mikes.

	I'm just trying to help you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORKY_GIRL>
<JIM_CUNNINGHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no need to be embarrassed. Many times we eat because we are afraid to face the reality of our ego reflections. We shouldn't just look INTO the mirror. We should look THROUGH the mirror.

	Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNIE>
<GRETCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MONNITOFF>
<DONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.

Donnie's eyes widen.

Underneath the headpiece is the human face of a handsome young man. His left eye does not exist, because it has imploded into the socket. There is blood oozing from the wound.

	Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNIE>
<DR_MONNITOFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MONNITOFF>
<DONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could these wormholes appear in nature?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNIE>
<DR_MONNITOFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MONNITOFF>
<DONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.

<DR_MONNITOFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not following you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MONNITOFF>

	If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNIE>
<DR_MONNITOFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
exists... would mean that all pre-formed
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	destiny would end.

</PRINCIPAL_COLE>
<MS_POMEROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You call this... clarity? I don't think you have a clue what it's really like to communicate with these kids. You don't think that they can smell your bullshit from a mile away? Every day that goes by ...that we fail to... inspire them... is another moment that we all lose. And we are losing them to apathy, and this... prescribed nonsense. They are slipping away...

	Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_POMEROY>
<DONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.

He looks over at Gretchen, who looks angry at this.

	You're wrong about these rabbits. These rabbits can talk. They are the product of the authors imagination. And he cares for them. So we care for them too. We care that their home has been destroyed... and that their lives are in danger. Otherwise ...we've missed the point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRETCHEN>

	Please! Don't say those words.

<DIRECTION>
(shaking her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.

</MS_FARMER>
<ROSE>

	Beg pardon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<MS_FARMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.

<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But now you can't go.

</ROSE>
<MS_FARMER>

<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.

Rose turns... wanting to say goodbye to Donnie, but not knowing how. She smiles and waves goodbye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donnie waves back.

Rose turns and goes to the van... handing the driver her last bag.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you please talk to me?

INT. ENGLISH CLASS - MOMENTS LATER (3:15 P.M.)

Donnie walks alone through the hallways... lost.
</DIRECTION>

He stumbles upon Ms. Pomeroy's room. She sits behind her desk... which has been packed up into a cardboard box.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(knocking on the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNIE>
<MS_POMEROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_POMEROY>
<DONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNIE>
<MS_POMEROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_POMEROY>
<DONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNIE>
<MS_POMEROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_POMEROY>
<DONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?

	It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents ...they don't have a clue.

Donnie looks at the blackboard. On it she has written in perfect penmanship: "Cellar Door".
</DIRECTION>
<DONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's "Cellar Door"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNIE>
<MS_POMEROY>
<DIRECTION>
(spaced out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.

</MS_POMEROY>
<DIRECTION>
She is silent for a moment.

<DONNIE>

	Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.

She takes the box and crosses the room towards Donnie.

<MS_POMEROY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?

<DONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I already have.

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But now she won't even talk to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNIE>
<MS_POMEROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stopping at the door)

	<DIALOGUE>
	She was right about the rabbits. Go.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN HALLWAY - NEXT (3:15. P.M.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And with that... Ms. Pomeroy turns and walks down the hallway with her career in a cardboard box... heading towards the bright Friday afternoon sunlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donnie walks back down the hallway... lost in his own introspection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the way... at her locker... as Cherita Chen. Donnie approaches her slowly like a cat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns from her locker... and they make eye contact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him warily, frightened. A book falls from her arms onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Written in large letters on the brown book cover is his name.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNIE_DARKO>
<DIRECTION>
He comes face to face with her, grabs her earmuffs with both hands, and touches his forehead to hers as if he were going to kiss her.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(long beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I promise that one day things will get better for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Cherita holds still for a moment, trembling, and then jerks back from him. Her earmuffs come off in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She backs away from him slowly. A single tear rolls down her cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chut... up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERITA>
<DIRECTION>
She then turns and runs down the hall... disappearing from sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OLD GUN ROAD - AFTERNOON (4 P.M.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donnie walks by himself... thinking... wearing Cherita's earmuffs.

	But it was an accident. The house was under construction.

<DONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.

<DR_THURMAN>

	Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_THURMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He does not respond.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNIE>

	I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...

	If God exists?

</DONNIE>
<DR_THURMAN>

	God exists because you're horny.

	Then how is time travel possible?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.

</DONNIE>
<DR_THURMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.

<DIRECTION>
Donnie and Gretchen walk downstairs. They kiss, and she goes towards the family room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donnie walks towards the kitchen, but then doubles over against the wall in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly... the room blows out with a strobe of white light... as costumed teenagers and their vector spears intersect in a shimmering maze of chaos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donnie slowly follows his spear as it leads him through the crowd... directly towards the refrigerator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donnie stares blankly at what he sees... scrawled in magic marker on the memo board.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It reads: FRANK WAS HERE... WENT TO GET BEER!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donnie stares at the board for several moment... he then turns his head and sees a teenager with a Ronald Reagan mask walk by. He then sees another spear come towards him. Gretchen rounds the corner, coming in from the family room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donnie falls to his knees and puts his face inside the end of Gretchen's spear. We see his P.O.V. - an abyssal tunnel of light.

Then... there is a clanking noise from somewhere around the side of the house. Everyone hears it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donnie looks towards the lower front of the house where there is a cellar door.
</DIRECTION>
<GRETCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. GRANDMA DEATH'S CELLAR - NEXT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donnie and Gretchen open the door to the cellar... and descend down into a murky pit with a stone floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside... the room is quite large... filled with row after row of boxes, paintings, antique furniture and chandeliers. There is even an ancient piano in the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gretchen slowly reaches her hand out and places her finger on the deepest piano key.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a figure emerges from the shadows and slams Donnie into the wall. He then grabs Gretchen by placing an arm around her neck with a butcher's knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is Ricky Danforth. Seth comes out from another corner... also brandishing a butcher's knife. Both have pantyhose pulled over their heads.
</DIRECTION>
<RICKY>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth holds Donnie's arms down with his knees and places the butcher's knife against his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ricky throws Gretchen down hard onto the shoulder of Old Gun Road. She lets out a gasp of pain as her head hits the gravel.
</DIRECTION>
<RICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>

</RICKY>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>

Sean and Ronald watch... dumbfounded, backing away.
</DIRECTION>

Seth just stares down at Donnie with his dead eyes... pushing the knife down harder, cutting off Donnie's air supply.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey... there's someone coming! Look, there's a car coming!

<RICKY>

Gretchen struggles to breathe on the shoulder of the road... the wind knocked out of her, semi-conscious.

	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
Seth gets up and runs off with Ricky into the forest... just as the approaching car crests the top of Old Gun Road at breakneck speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, in the bright glow of the car's headlights... is the silhouette of Grandma Death... standing in the middle of the road. In her right hand she is clutching a letter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donnie's letter.
</DIRECTION>
<GRETCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Donnie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRETCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
The car swerves left, barely missing Grandma Death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Pontiac tries to brake hard... but the wheels lock... and it goes skidding onto the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gretchen raises her head from the gravel... into bright headlight beams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Trans-Am goes barrelling over her like a speed-bump... and her limp body rolls off into the grassy ditch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Trans-Am skids off into the grass and collides head-on with the crumbling stone chimney... which explodes into the crumpled hood of the car... as it eventually comes to a stop in a fury of smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donnie staggers to his feet... regaining his breath. He runs over to Gretchen and kneels down next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gretchen... wake up. Wake up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Her neck is broken. She has no pulse.

<DIRECTION>
The passenger door to the Trans-Am opens, and a passenger in a clown costume gets out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver's side door opens and the driver gets out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is wearing a rabbit suit. A Halloween costume.

It is Frank.

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>

Donnie raises the gun from his father's closet with his right hand, and to his own surprise, he pulls the trigger.
</DIRECTION>

Frank's left eye implodes as the bullet passes through his head. His body falls limply to the ground.

After contemplation of the recent events... Sean and Ronald turn and run off in the opposite direction.
