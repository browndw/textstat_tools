EXT. SOMEWHAT SEEDY TWO-STORY HOTEL IN ATLANTA -- PRE-DAWN CHYRON -- ATLANTA 6:12 AM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's still more night than day as we look down on the HOTEL ATLANTA. The lit sign for the HOTEL ATLANTA may be the only source of light as we hear a metallic rattle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOTEL ATLANTA -- SECOND FLOOR -- PRE-DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow the metallic rattle to a door. The rattling stops and we watch the knob slowly turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tight on a feminine arm with a tattoo that announces "hope." We pull back to find that both arms are employed in the pulling of what looks like a large suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICOLE MAGGEN, a beautiful but tired woman, finishes pulling the suitcase that we now surmise to be a folded-up massage table out of the motel room. With her bra in one hand and the rickety table resting against the wall of the exterior 2nd floor hallway of the motel, she assesses her situation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She digs in her purse, lights a cigarette and continues digging in her purse. She finds a beat-up candy tin. She opens it and quickly sorts through a collection of burnt foils, heroin foils, looking for residue. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She now finds and holds up the 100 bucks she just made. She flips open her cheap phone and makes a call...she thinks better of it and hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOTEL ATLANTA -- PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICOLE forces the clumsy table into the hatchback of a 1988 Toyota Tercel and slams it shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 1988 TOYOTA TERCEL -- PARKING LOT -- SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the electronic ring of her cheap cell phone on "speaker phone" mode. The phone rests on the passenger seat. We pull up to find NICOLE slumped with her head resting on the steering wheel. She is exhausted and irritated...
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLE>
<DIRECTION>
(as the phone rings)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't pick up...don't pick up... don't pick up...

CHYRON -- ORLANDO 7:14 AM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AMERICAN VALUE SUITES - HOTEL -- ORLANDO -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun would be rising if the sky wasn't swirling with grey clouds. We see the American Suites Hotel and recognize it as a decent commuters' hotel near the airport in Orlando. The sound of a clock radio breaks the calm of our picture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AMERICAN VALUE SUITES - HOTEL -- ORLANDO -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the clock radio we loudly hear two morning drive-time radio personalities spewing nonsensical patter...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An attractive YOUNG WOMAN wrestles free of the covers and gets out of bed. She crosses naked through the room as a cell phone starts ringing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back to the bed as WHIP WHITAKER rises into frame and inhabits the room like a lazy ape at the zoo. WHIP wears his 40 some years of life experience like a medal. Smoke hangs in the air and empty beers, a pint of vodka and two empty carafes of cheap hotel wine clutter the table as WHIP snatches up his phone and answers...
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the love of Christ! Look...just hold...HOLD ON.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
He aggressively drains the last four inches of beer from a clear bottle and cracks the last fresh one that bobs in the hotel ice bucket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The naked, YOUNG WOMAN bends over to pick up her clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We witness her ass as a tanned glass vase with a perfect crack down the middle. Whip smiles, taking it all in...
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
(into the phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been up since the crack 'a dawn. What check? Tuition? How much does it cost to go there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
The YOUNG WOMAN has re-lit the last half of a joint and is puffing it to life as WHIP is beckoning with his large hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The YOUNG WOMAN, looking more like a stripper by the second, hands the joint to WHIP who takes a masterful drag. WHIP shakes his head in violent disapproval to what he hears on the phone. He exhales in anger as he shouts into the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO! NO! NO! You decided he needed private school...lemme talk to Knuckles. He's not? Tell'em the phone works both ways. Oh he's my son because you need a tuition check...that's great Deana. I'm glad you tracked me down in Orlando at 7 in the fucking morning to shake me down for money. Does he even like the fucking school? No I've never seen it. Yeah I wonder why not too. I gotta 9 o'clock flight, sit tight 'till I get back to Atlanta. How am I a liar? What? No, I'll call you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP hangs up and continues to make quick work of the last beer as he stares through his thoughts and out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was that your wife?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was my ex-wife. But you Trina, you could be my second or third wife if you'd just C'mere.

The YOUNG WOMAN we now know as TRINA smiles seductively...

<TRINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whip, don't even joke about that. Our flight's at 9, let's hit it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINA>
<DIRECTION>
TRINA is still naked but she holds a navy blue skirt and a white blouse as she hands WHIP his pants. WHIP can't help but pat that perfect ass as TRINA tries to skip away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE RADIO We hear the opening bars of a familiar rock anthem...JOE COCKER's "I'm Feeling Alright"
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm feelin' a little light- headed. I shoulda ate somethin'.

WHIP leans over the motel table, picks up a soda straw that's been cut in half. He efficiently sniffs up a line of coke.

WHIP wears his pilot Blues and carries his hat as he strides confidently down the hallway. JOE COCKER continues to wail, perfectly narrating the hero's swagger that WHIP maintains while passing bad light fixtures and ornate wall paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIRPORT SOUTHJET TARMAC - AIRPLANE - MORNING RAINING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP leans against the landing gear of the JACKSON-RIDGEFIELD 88 PASSENGER JET -- He takes a swig from a small bottle of mouthwash -- gargles, then spits the green foam on the tarmac. WHIP wipes fatigue from his face as he stashes the mouthwash in his pocket, then quickly completes his visual walk around. He looks at the sky again as he steps on to the jet way ladder. His foot slips, sending his shoe SPLASHING in to a puddle.
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son of a bitch!

Whip shakes the rain out of his shoe as he continues up the stairs.

NICOLE gets out of her Tercel and slams the door twice before it closes. She checks the address on her phone and looks up at the enormous mansion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATLANTA -- STONE - MANSION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICOLE pushes through the overly tall front door of the house. At first glance, it's completely empty, unfurnished. A GUY in cargo pants and a baseball hat sleeps sitting up against the huge dual staircase that leads to the second floor. Random boxes of video equipment are now evident as are thick cables that lead to a staircase going down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the staircase she immediately encounters another YOUNG CREW GUY holding a tiny lap dog while standing next to a NAKED GIRL wearing a Shakespearean Military Helmet. The YOUNG CREW GUY holds up the "be quiet" finger to his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICOLE quietly makes her way down a few steps, stopping at the odd duo. We now hear activity downstairs, music. SUDDENLY the YOUNG CREW GUY frantically points at the NAKED GIRL.
</DIRECTION>

A GIRL WITH DYED-BLONDE HAIR stands naked next to the throne smoking a joint as she shaves her crotch with a man's electric razor.

NICOLE approaches a YOUNG TATTOOED MAN who only wears board shorts. He's talking with an OLDER ASIAN MAN as they groom a pile of coke for snorting.

A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE is placed in front of that picture. Next to the photos is a small CD station that NICOLE taps to life and turns up. The opening bars of Michael Fitzpatrick's "Medication" begin to play.

We pull wide to see NICOLE pull the bra from her arm that she used to tie off with. Her face is pure happiness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clothes and a peach crate filled with camera equipment join a suitcase on its side that acts as a coffee table. NICOLE picks up her camera and admires it before putting it down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up the cigarette she had staged pre dope fix and reaches for the lighter. She laughs and hums, pulls out gum, a brush...She's holding the brush when the first heavy wave of narcotic death washes over her. She leans back and uses the wall for support. "Medication" is hitting its chorus...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's no way to stem the tide of the oncoming overdose. NICOLE's arms stretch out in a frozen reach as her body sinks to the floor. On her back like a girl making angels in the snow as her eyelids flutter, she slips away.

CHARLIE moves close to deliver the news.

A NURSE enters the room. CHARLIE nods to her.

	Listen, protocol is the NTSB has to make the first contact with you and the agent is here. Let me go get him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE ducks out of the room. WHIP is alone and still getting his bearings. He goes to scratch his head and catches sight of his left hand. It's swollen and sore --his wrist is bandaged with a splint-brace. He now looks at both of his hands in wonder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP hears a muffled conversation that gets clearer as do the images of MANY PEOPLE entering the room. A POLICE OFFICER accompanies a DOCTOR and TWO NTSB AGENTS.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a doctor here who can explain your medical situation.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP offers a "thumbs up" gesture. The DOCTOR steps in.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Doctor Kenan and the good news is that you are in good condition. You did suffer a concussion which is the reason you have a bit of blurred vision and a headache. You have numerous lacerations around your left eye. We're going to leave the patch on for a few days as a precaution. But it seems your eye is OK. MRI's show strained tendons in your left knee and ankle but you didn't break any bones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have some deep bruising in your left thigh and you have a few torn ligaments in your left wrist. Nothing serious. So as soon as we clear you from the concussion, and you feel well enough -- you can go home. That could be a day, could be 3 days. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP quietly nods. The DOCTOR leaves and WHIP begins to study his body. His left leg is wrapped, his left wrist has a splint-brace --
</DIRECTION>
<NTSB_OFFICER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't ask too much of you tonight, but as I said, the NTSB is required to make initial contact. How much do you remember about the flight?

WHIP looks at the NTSB OFFICER and slowly speaks.

<WHIP>

WHIP's voice is failing him as his throat is sore and dry.

	Okay Mr. Whitaker, that's fine. I am required to inform you that this incident did result in the loss of life.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- 11 PM -- SAME EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP wakes up in a cold sweat. He is breathing heavy as he scans the room. LIGHTENING FLASHES from outside the window. Thunder RUMBLES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP looks to the night stand where we see a pack of nicotine gum has been chewed through. WHIP uses his hands to get to the edge of the bed. He roots through the duffle bag that HARLING left and finds a pack of smokes and a Bic lighter still in its package.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Determined to smoke, WHIP eyes a WHEEL CHAIR that has been placed next to his bed. Leaning against the wheelchair is a medical cane.

INT. HOSPITAL -- QUIET HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

Wearing his Happi Coat (or robe), WHIP limps in to the empty hallway with the use of his cane. He checks the quiet corridor as he begins his quest...

INT. HOSPITAL -- FIRE DOOR -- 11:38 PM
</DIRECTION>

The door swings open, and no one appears to be on the other side. Now WHIP fights to push the heavy door open again to slip through. A hand grabs the door and holds it. WHIP walks into the sanctity of the stairwell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL STAIRWELL -- SAME TIME

We find the owner of the helping hand was NICOLE who returns to a quiet spot along the wall of the stairwell as she demurely smokes a cigarette.

It's funny because people see me as being close to the other side -- they feel like I have power or wisdom. They think I have the answers. Who knows? Maybe I do. Death gives you perspective. I lived my life so indecisive, in a haze. But now that I'm dying everything is so clear. It all makes sense somehow. I'm sorry but I can't get over how beautiful you are?

A cigarette dangles from WHIP's mouth as he ferrets around the room, showing the focus and determination of a serial killer cleaning his kill site. He finds rolling papers, roaches, more liquor and weed -- he reaches into the Shell Bag that's hanging next to the shotgun rack and finds another "pint."

Whip opens the freezer to put in his frozen dinner and his "packet of veal" and finds another fifth of vodka.

A WALL OF PHOTOS -- WHIP WITH HIS FATHER NEXT TO A PLANE. HIS GRANDFATHER, FATHER and WHIP pose next to the barn.

A CROP DUSTER acts as the background for a picture with a 15 year old WHIP and his father next to a small plane.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was done incompetently. The last time the toxicology equipment they used was calibrated was in June of 2009, which is 18 months past code. Their log that should clearly state who labeled the blood vials and when, is very incomplete. And they aren't sure who stored them. They used a preservative in the vials that has in some cases caused blood to ferment and register higher in an alcohol test. That's what I've done so far. I can handle this.

	We pull away from the screen to find WHIP who sits on the couch. A large bottle of vodka appears empty amidst many dead beers and an ashtray that overflows.
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHIP moves in drunken slow motion as he attempts to free a cigarette from the pack and light it. He freezes at one point and places his hands straight out in front of himself, a strange, involuntary, drunken reset. His stare is a 1000 miles offshore; he is anywhere but on this planet. Oblivion.

</WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NICOLE backs away as she watches the blacked-out ballet play itself out in slow, tragic fashion. WHIP motions to his lips as if he is smoking. He freezes and then steps forward and trips in to the coffee table. Whip falls to the ground.
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NICOLE checks WHIP's face to see his eyes partially opened but passed out. NICOLE goes to the bedroom and returns with a blanket that she covers WHIP with. She also places a pillow under his head making sure that his head is titled to the side so he doesn't choke.

She has all her possessions in a crate and a duffel bag at her feet. She finishes a handwritten note and places it down. NICOLE picks up the note and begins to reread it.

WHIP returns his look inside the house and he sees the big book of AA on the table near where the letter was left. WHIP picks it up and throws it across the room. He then grabs the back of a chair and tosses it against the wall.
</DIRECTION>

After wiping photos off of the wall he picks up an empty beer bottle and fires the bottle at a shelf on the opposite wall. The bottle explodes and WHIP stops as he realizes he came within an inch of shattering a framed photo of he and his son.

We hear the antiquated ring of the OLD HOUSE PHONE. WHIP relaxes his shoulders as the ringing phone distracts him.

There was no physical evidence found on the bottles, no DNA, no finger prints. But both the bottles were uncapped and empty. The only people who had access to those bottles and could have drank them were the flight crew. Margaret, Evans and Camelia Satou all had clean tox reports. That leaves you and Trina Marquez.

A GROWING GALLERY OF NEWS RATS START JOSTLING FOR PICS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP is completely caught off guard. They step right onto the tiny landing with him.

Through the fracas we hear a variety of questions lobbed at WHIP.

The GALLERY quiets to listen and record his words. WHIP again is incredibly smooth and intuitive while drunk and under pressure. We can hear the squawking of POLICE SIRENS approaching.

INT. ST. JEROME HOTEL -- GUEST HALLWAY -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

We watch a can of Coca Cola swing in WHIP's hand. We pull out to find WHIP walking with CHARLIE down a hallway of THE ST. JEROME HOTEL. Time has passed as WHIP looks the best we've ever seen him look. He is well rested, well dressed and carrying a suit in a wardrobe bag.

As we approach the open door to a guest room, HUGH pops out. A plain clothes SECURITY GUARD follows HUGH out of the room and stands behind him.

CHARLIE leaves and HUGH joins WHIP at the window. HUGH hands WHIP a thick folder.
</DIRECTION>
<HUGH_LANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I made you a copy of my entire file on you and the investigation. I also tried to anticipate what you might be asked under oath and I wrote out some non-damaging responses. It's all in there; photos, testimony, interviews...I called Ellen Block let her know that you're here and all tucked in.
	</DIALOGUE>

<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So does she have the knife out for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<HUGH_LANG>

	Remember she's limited in what she can ask you. You're not on trial but you are under oath. She's probably not happy that I killed the tox report, but you'll be fine.

The two respectfully nod. HUGH leaves and the door shuts behind him. WHIP puts the folder on the table and steps to the mini-bar. He bends down and opens the fridge...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP sees the fridge is overly stocked with soda and juices. Every soft drink you can imagine. No booze, anywhere. WHIP chuckles about the alcohol removal as he grabs a coke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP unbuttons his shirt and pulls it out of his waist line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whip sits on the edge of the bed eating a room service steak. The File Folder sits on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP'S ROOM -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now in his undershirt and shorts, Whip lies propped up on the bed watching television. The File Folder now rests on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP'S BATHROOM -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whip is meticulously shaving. He stares a long while at the disposable razor as the water runs over its blade. After a moment he goes back to shaving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP'S ROOM -- MUCH LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whip sits at the small table looking through the file. He leafs through photos, with no recognizable emotion. He looks to the clock radio -- 12:37.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP'S ROOM -- BATHROOM -- LATER AGAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the shower running and steam fogs the mirrors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP'S ROOM -- LATER THAN THAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP wears boxers and a tee shirt with a towel around his neck. He looks to the clock -- 2:07
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE WATCH HIS SUIT BE PULLED FROM THE WARDROBE BAG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP lays the suit out neatly on the couch, separating the shirt which he hangs from a light fixture to relax any creases.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP'S ROOM -- LATER YET AGAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is dark. A soft wind RATTLES the window sash. WHIP lies on the bed. He sighs, sleep is alluding him and the anxiety of tomorrow's events on no sleep has his head spinning. He hears a metallic click. He stays quiet to listen for it...there it is again. An annoying click.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clock reads "3:43"--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits up and switches on the LIGHT. He rubs his eyes and goes to the table and sees the file folder laying there. As he is about to pick it up he hears the metallic click again. He goes to investigate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOTEL ROOM CONNECTING DOOR -- SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The connecting door is unlocked. WHIP arrives and waits. He now watches as the connecting lock-bolt CLICKS against the frame -- the door swinging in a draft. He looks up to see the culprit -- a heating vent. WHIP flips the vent closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whip now pushes the door with his finger, opening it a few inches. Nothing. Darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Anyone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
Whip enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONNECTING HOTEL ROOM -- SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is vacant. The bed is made. The drapes are pulled open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP walks quietly on the carpet towards the window. The night is clear. Quiet. Whip takes in the city lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP'S POV --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Among the glass and steel office buildings, Whip spots a church spire. A simple cross is perched on top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whip looks at the church, deep in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR A HUM. THE GENTLE HUM OF AN ELECTRIC MOTOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP turns from the window and scans the room...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the MINI-BAR refrigerator -- HUMMING to life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whip stares at the gleaming black box. The WHIR of the motor seems to get LOUDER. Calling Whip. Beckoning him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whip looks at the fridge. His face is blank, His eyes tell us nothing. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whip steps toward the box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE MINI-BAR. Whip swings open the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOSH -- OUR DARK SCREEN LIGHTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLORS SPARKLE as a cadre of tiny liquor bottles GLOW like jewels in a chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP stares at the "glimmering gems" for a long, long time -- vodka, gin, wine, bourbon. The bottles SHIMMER -- AMBER, CRYSTAL, EMERALD, RUBY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP reaches for a frosted vodka mini bottle -- he gently pinches the neck of the bottle and lifts it out of the fridge. He holds up the mini vodka and considers it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Whip slowly removes the stopper and smells the White Whiskey. He looks at the bottle once more, then slowly twists the tiny cap back on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a look of solemn resignation, Whip places the frosted mini bottle on top of the fridge and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE STAY CLOSE ON THE BOTTLE. The CAMERA FOCUSES on the small bottle as a small droplet of condensation runs down its side -- ever so slowly, slowly. Then suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAP!!! In a flash, WHIP SCOOPS THE VODKA OUT OF FRAME!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL - ELEVATOR DOORS - MORNING

The ELEVATOR DOORS open and HUGH and CHARLIE step out and head down the hallway.

We follow our guys as they approach WHIP's room, finding OFFICER EDMONDS exactly where we left him -- in front of WHIP's door.

INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE carefully enters WHIP's room. He is spooked by the silence. HUGH joins him as they take in the room. The bed looks slept in and the room service dinner tray rests politely on the dining table but WHIP is nowhere to be found.
</DIRECTION>
<HUGH_LANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he disappear?

CHARLIE tentatively walks around the empty room, the bathroom, the closet, until he finally sees the adjoining room door. He turns to HUGH with a surprised look.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>

CHARLIE knocks on the slightly opened adjoining door. No response, so CHARLIE lightly tosses the door open.

CHARLIE looks in to find the scene of the crime. Smoke still hangs in the air and empty bottles and cans cover every surface in the room. HUGH joins him...

Sunglasses on, WHIP is backed by HUGH and CHARLIE who flank him from a few steps behind.

On TWO LARGE SCREENS we watch the grainy cell phone footage shot by a witness of SOUTHJET FLIGHT 227's final moments in the sky. ACCOMPANYING the Video is the REAL AUDIO of the cockpit voice recording...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room has a dais where the NTSB board members sit. A large blue curtain is the backing for the round NTSB shield that hangs above the proceedings. A large drop down screen will show images, graph and text as needed by the NTSB.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A confident woman, ELLEN BLOCK, approaches carrying a file which she lays on the podium.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN_BLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those are difficult images to watch. For the record, I'm Ellen Block, Hearing Officer for this hearing. Captain Whitaker, good morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN_BLOCK>
<DIRECTION>
We see WHIP who looks rough but stable in his witness chair.
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<ELLEN_BLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was captured on that video is that the aircraft was in a relatively stable glide just prior to the moment of impact. However, according to the data we retrieved from the cockpit data recorders, at exactly 9:34, after flying 27 minutes without incident, the transponder recorded a loss in altitude in excess of 4800 feet per minute in what is considered a "full pitch nose down" attitude. Then at 9:42, according to the data recorders, a decision was made to invert the aircraft. The NTSB has created animated simulation that I would like to play at this point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN_BLOCK>
<DIRECTION>
ELLEN points to the screen...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An NTSB animation shows the plane pitching down and we follow it through the inversion of the plane while listening to the real audio of the flight crew.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The animation has a split screen that also shows the instruments and printed text of what's being said.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear..."What's your son's name?" "Why?" "The black box" "I love you, Trevor. Be a good boy, Mommy loves you." "What are we doing?! Why would I trim down?!" "We're gonna roll it. Ready? Here we go. I've got control."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That last statement seems to echo as the presentation stops and the lights come back up. We return to the hearing in progress.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ELLEN BLOCK
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That audio is tragic and compelling. I chose to play that part of the cockpit recording to highlight a key moment aboard flight 227, wherein you say "We're gonna roll it, here we go, I've got control." You made a very conscious decision to invert the airplane, to roll the plane upside down. Is that correct?
	</DIALOGUE>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure it was conscious. It was more of an instinct.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<ELLEN_BLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What led to that decision?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN_BLOCK>

WHIP is clearly struggling in his chair. The coke got him there but it may start to fail him soon.
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>

</WHIP>
<ELLEN_BLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me quote from an investigative summary..."From 9:34 until 9:42 the events on the aircraft are"...again I quote, "bold and remarkable"... "By inverting the plane, Captain Whitaker arrested the descent and allowed the aircraft to level off enabling him to glide the aircraft away from any populated areas and allowing him to execute a forced landing in an open field.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN_BLOCK>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a smattering of applause as the facts of his actions are remarkable.
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard a metallic bang. We pitched nose down. No control.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP looks ashen as the booze and chemicals are still coursing through his exhausted frame.

</WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP glances towards HUGH and CHARLIE who are poker-faced.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN_BLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As I said before you can add any details you like to any comments I make. Do you remember any thing else that was out of the ordinary? Did you feel the flight crew was in their best shape?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN_BLOCK>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP takes a minute to digest this question.
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</WHIP>
<ELLEN_BLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was raining very hard the morning you took off, wasn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN_BLOCK>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was some convective activity in the area. However, my first officer and I discussed the conditions on the field and determined that we were safely within our visibility and crosswind minimums.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<ELLEN_BLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, first officer Evans' testimony confirms the same.

	Our investigators have concluded that the jackscrew snapped and the elevator was frozen in a fixed position, locking the elevator in a down position which forced the plane into a dive. The loss of the elevator was, and I quote our report, a "catastrophic event, from which recovery was improbable and stable flight impossible."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone goes quiet as those words resonate. ELLEN's tone changes as she understands how hard this is for some people to hear as they think of their loved ones spending their last living minutes on this earth in sheer terror.

	</DIALOGUE>

A genuine applause spreads from the hearing room. ELLEN BLOCK allows this moment to happen.

	On the morning of the accident, Friday, October 14th, did you consume any alcohol or ingest any chemicals or drugs that may have impaired your ability to perform your job?

ELLEN wraps up this line of questions...
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN_BLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Whitaker, do you now or have you ever had a problem with alcohol dependency, alcoholism or drug addiction?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN_BLOCK>

WHIP waits for her to look at him...this takes a while...
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

<DIRECTION>
HUGH maintains a poker face; CHARLIE appears relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELLEN sorts through her notes one last time.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN_BLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Mr. Whitaker, we're about done.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(She refers to her notes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Due to the severe turbulence during the early part of the flight, you asked the flight crew to suspend the beverage service on the plane. Is that correct?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN_BLOCK>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I suspended the drink service.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<ELLEN_BLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you aware that our investigators found two single- service Vodka bottles in the galley trash bin?

<WHIP>

<ELLEN_BLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There were 5 crew members on board the flight who would have had access to the beverage trolley. Less than an hour after the accident, blood was taken from each of the crew members. Yourself...

A SOUTHJET CORPORATE PHOTO OF WHIP pops on to the large monitors. After ELLEN references a member of the flight crew, their photo pops on to the monitors...

<ELLEN_BLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Marquez was not only a colleague, but you knew her outside of work? Correct?

</ELLEN_BLOCK>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Outside of work? Not really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<ELLEN_BLOCK>

<ELLEN_BLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank the vodka on the plane?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN_BLOCK>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP smiles at the photo of TRINA as if she can see him. He then shakes his head to snap from the memory of her great spirit. He gets serious as he bears his look down on ELLEN.
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you repeat the question?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<ELLEN_BLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your opinion Captain. Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank on that flight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN_BLOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Whip shakes. He runs his trembling hand through his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. My what...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<ELLEN_BLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since her toxicology report is the only toxicology report that is admissable in this hearing, and she in fact tested positive for alcohol, is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank those 2 bottles of vodka on the flight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN_BLOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Whip drops his head and MUTTERS SOMETHING INAUDIBLE.

	</DIALOGUE>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I SAID...God help me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
A confused MUMBLE rises in the room. Whip's response flusters ELLEN for a moment, but she recovers quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN_BLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, well. However, is it your opinion...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN_BLOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Whip cuts her off...

<WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
(EXCESSIVELY LOUD)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	IT'S MY OPINION...

Whip stops. His whole body trembles, his face tightens. He looks right at ELLEN...
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...because I did. I drank the vodka.

Now CHARLIE returns to his chair to find that HUGH is gone. CHARLIE looks around for HUGH, no sign. He's vanished.

WHIP leans close to the microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I drank the vodka bottles on the plane.

<ELLEN_BLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Whitaker, in light of that remark, would you like to readdress...

	On October 11th, 12th and 13th and 14th I was intoxicated. I drank alcohol on all of those days. I drank to excess.

<DIRECTION>
Chaos erupts further as REPORTERS outnumber SECURITY. Flash bulbs pop repeatedly and large lights are aimed at the fracas on stage as video is taken of the bizarre melee.

<ELLEN_BLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Whitaker, on the morning of OCTOBER-
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN_BLOCK>
<WHIP>

	I was drunk. I'm drunk right now, Miss Block...I'm drunk right...
	</DIALOGUE>

(Whip finally breaks down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm drunk now, because... Because I'm an alcoholic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
We have pushed into a tight shot on WHIP's face as the sound in the room fades away. We stay tight on WHIP's face as he lets the moments unfold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the noise cuts to silence. WHIP is looking at the assembly. WHIP wipes tears from his eyes. We hear WHIP's voice as the dialogue pre-laps the image of his face.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHIP
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was it...I was done. It's as if I'd hit my life long limit for lies.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A new angle shows WHIP speaking these words...
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could not tell one more lie. And maybe I'm a sucker. Because if I had just told one more lie? I could have walked away from that whole mess and kept my wings and my false sense of pride and most importantly I would have avoided being locked up here with all of you nice folks for the last 13 months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
We hear laughter as we pull out from WHIP to realize that he is in fact wearing a white penal jumpsuit and leading an AA meeting in a Federal Prison.
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It looks like I will serve every day of the remaining 4 plus years of my sentence. And that's fair. I betrayed the public trust. I did. That's what the judge explained to me. I had betrayed the public trust. The FAA took my license. And that's fair. The chances of me flying again are slim to none. And I accept that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MCRAE FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- GEORGIA -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large room houses an AA meeting for about 50 inmates wearing white jumpsuits. WHIP continues his story.
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've had time to think about all of it. Doing a lot of writing. I've written letters to each of the families that lost loved ones on my flight. Some were able to hear my apology, some never will. I've also apologized to all the people who tried to help me along the way, but I couldn't or wouldn't listen, like my wife, I mean my ex wife...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he gets emotional)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and my son. Again, some were able to forgive me...some never will.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(COLLECTS HIMSELF)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But at least I'm sober, and I'm grateful for that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
Whip gives it to us straight...
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this is gonna sound really stupid coming from a man who's in prison...but for the first time in my life...I'm free.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
We hold close on WHIP's face as we hear the metallic clang of prison doors shutting. On the sound we cut to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- CELL -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pan across the concrete cell wall, looking at a small, personal photo collage. We see a photo of NICOLE and SHEILA and a few other AA FOLKS surrounding WHIP who sits in front of a birthday cake in the common room of the prison. We see a photo of WHIP's DAD as an airman. We ultimately land on a photo of NICOLE. We recognize it as the photo WHIP took on the porch of the Whitaker Farm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pan down to find WHIP writing in a journal. A GUARD comes to the front of his cell.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whitaker, you got a visitor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP looks at the GUARD and nods before taking a last glance at the photo of NICOLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- GUEST YARD -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP sits at a lone picnic table in a fence-enclosed courtyard. He checks his watch and looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP stands and walks towards us, towards his visitor. As he gets closer we see a smile break across his face. A smile we haven't seen since he first saw NICOLE. We reverse to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILL -- WHIP's 17 year old son stands next to a GUARD.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have 40 minutes.

<WHIP>

	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Another beat as they can't find a way in to a conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a real surprise; a great surprise. I haven't seen you-
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP chokes up. WILL nods. It's intense. WHIP motions to the table and they both sit. WILL pulls out a notebook.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	College counselor thought I should come and interview you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. An interview. Okay.

</WHIP>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm writing essays for college applications.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP studies him and laughs...WILL nods and tries to smile.
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen Will, it means everything to me that you came here. You are an amazing kid and you deserve great things...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
Again WHIP has to tamp down his emotions.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So can you help me with this essay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
WILL pulls out a small voice recorder and clicks it on...
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This essay. I have to do an essay called, "the most fascinating person I've never met."
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
The two men just look at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
WILL nods, both men are struggling to keep it together.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we pick up where we left off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP nods, unsure as to where this is going.
</DIRECTION>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<WHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHIP>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP smiles...a great, familiar question. He begins to alternately laugh and sob as there is great relief in the promise of a connection with his son.
</DIRECTION>
