	Alright buddy, we're here. Right where you paid me to bring you. Question is, why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABBY>
<DIRECTION>
A metallic blue sports car, circa the `60s, emerges from the

<FINN>

	Well I got news for you, buddy. There's nobody out here but us.
	</DIALOGUE>

Suddenly, a HORN -- a COMBAT SHIP, the size of most cruise ships. FINN quickly backs into the shadows, out of sight.

ON CRABBY'S DECK: Finn is gone. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FINN - He HANGS off the side of COMBAT SHIP, clandestine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're with Finn as the ship continues on, cuts through the darkness with purpose. Suddenly small flames appear, perhaps a knot or so away. Then WHOOSH!!! A flame rises above Finn, the ship. It illuminates an OIL DERRICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THWAP! Finn fires a GRAPPLING HOOK to the derrick and SWINGS toward it. He's going to SLAM into the side with brute force WHEN ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--- HIS TIRES sprout a magnetic exoskeleton. He STICKS to the derrick and now DRIVES VERTICALLY UP UP UP...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From this vantage point, hundreds of derricks appear.

AN ACCESS DOOR OPENS LOUDLY below. A boxy, monacle-wearing German car enters. This is PROFESSOR OTTO ZUNDAPP.

</PROFESSOR_ZUNDAPP>

A forklift opens the crate -- inside is a TV CAMERA, packed carefully in foam. Finn SNAPS PHOTOS FURIOUSLY.
</DIRECTION>
<NOSY_PACER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. A TV camera. What does it actually do?

Finn, angling for a better view, FIRES SUSPENSION WIRES ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--- which sail clear to the other side of the derrick ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--- THOK! They hook tightly onto a steel girder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finn slides out ONTO THE WIRE like an acrobat, then expels another cross-wire for support.
</DIRECTION>
<PROFESSOR_ZUNDAPP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is valuable equipment. Make sure it is properly secured for the voyage.

<DIRECTION>
Zundapp turns as a CRANE LOWERS A CAR-SIZED CRATE. GREM and ACER, an orange Gremlin and a green Pacer, flank it.
</DIRECTION>
<GREM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is one of those British spies we told you about.

Finn PRODUCES SEMI-AUTOMATIC GUNS from his side, readies himself for a tag-team spy fight with his buddy Leland.
</DIRECTION>
<PROFESSOR_ZUNDAPP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Agent Leland Turbo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROFESSOR_ZUNDAPP>
<DIRECTION>
The crate is lifted, revealing a CRUSHED, CUBED Leland Turbo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finn's eyes go wide. Suddenly --- WHOOOSHHH! Another derrick flame rises behind him, casts a Finn-shaped SHADOW over the Professor. He looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<PROFESSOR_ZUNDAPP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Finn McMissile! He's seen the camera! Kill him!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROFESSOR_ZUNDAPP>
<DIRECTION>
Finn UNLOADS with bullets as he starts to retreat --- He STOPS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAD GUY CARS are waiting for him on the catwalk where he just came from - BLOWTORCHES ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finn, stuck in midair, notices an angry CRANE. Finn GRINS, having just found his escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THWAPTHWAPTHWAP!!! Finn releases three of his four cables, swinging, Indiana Jones-style on the last one TOWARD THE CRANE ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--- where he lands on its BOOM, drives UP and LAUNCHES OFF IT where he LANDS - MOVING - onto another deck!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finn now DRIVES, spraying oil and screeching around corners. A GREMLIN in pursuit hits the oil patch, loses control ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--- and PLUMMETS OFF the side of the rig!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Gremlin FALLS... it's like an eternity...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He smashes into the water and breaks into a million pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON FINN - Now set upon by 20 or 30 MORE pursuing cars. He has nowhere to go but UP UP UP a ramp toward the helipad. He spies some GASOLINE BARRELS, fires a SINGLE BULLET which cuts through its leather straps, sending barrels DOWN the ramp, PAST FINN ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--- PAST the pursuing CARS ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--- to the bottom where they EXPLODE in a CHAIN REACTION back UP THE RAMP, taking out at least 15 CARS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE HELIPAD - Finn blasts into view, pulls to a stop. No more road. Nowhere else to go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The 20 BAD GUY CARS that are still in pursuit surround him, fire up their blowtorches. About to pounce.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finn GRINS. The second time we've seen this grin. It means he's got something cooking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finn's REVERSE LIGHTS appear. He DRIVES BACKWARD off the edge of the helipad to the SHOCK of the other cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finn falls. He turns himself so he's grill first, cleanly cutting into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He EMERGES, now sprouting HYDROFOIL and speeds away.
</DIRECTION>
<GREM>
<DIRECTION>
(NONPLUSSED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get to the boats.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREM>
<DIRECTION>
THE BOATS - an army of combat ships quickly DROP into the sea and CHURN WATER with unprecedented fury as they quickly make up the distance between them and Finn, FIRING BULLETS as they do so.
</DIRECTION>
<ACER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's getting away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACER>
<COMBAT_SHIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not for long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMBAT_SHIP>
<DIRECTION>
The LEAD COMBAT SHIP quietly drops a TORPEDO into the water. It skips along, connecting with Finn in his rear and EXPLODING with such force that water skyrockets into the night clouds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER - McMissile SINKS. Then, he blinks. He GRINS. We're starting to like this grin and what follows it. He now CONVERTS into a submarine. From his trunk he releases four DECOY tires which float to the surface like body parts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE DERRICK - Professor Zundapp watches it all from far away.
</DIRECTION>
<GREM>

	Feared dead, he emerged 36 days later, running on a fuel he'd distilled himself from the natural elements! Since then he's sold his oil fortune, converted himself from a gas-guzzler into an electric car, and has devoted his life to finding a renewable, clean-burning fuel!

	Thank you, Mel. It is very good to be here. Now listen to me: Big Oil. It costs a fortune. Pollution is getting worse. I mean, come on. It's a fossil fuel. Fossil. As in dead dinosaurs.

When Sally says his name, she enunciates each part, as if Italian were her mother's tongue.

<MCQUEEN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I would love to. The only thing is my crew's off for the season so ---

</MCQUEEN>

A sound O.S. McQueen turns to see Fillmore, Sarge and Luigi flank a tablecloth which is hanging off the bar. Ramone backs away, having spray painted "TEAM LIGHTNING MCQUEEN" on it. Guido quickly uncorks three wine bottles.

McQueen turns to the bar where Mater privately tries their drinks, hates it, spits it back in the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<SALLY>

BEGIN MONTAGE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- McQueen is given a new paint job and headlights by Ramone. Mater, now sporting a "Team McQueen" emblem, seems psyched as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- An airport DEPARTURES SIGN advertises the next flight: Tokyo, Japan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- Mater waves goodbye with his hook alongside McQueen, Guido, Luigi, Fillmore and Sarge as ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--- the rest of Radiator Springs watches them board a plane. Red bawls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- IN THE JET, LATER. McQueen and Mater are the only ones awake, watch an insane Japanese game show.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- JAPAN AT NIGHT. A stylish Tokyo cityscape of neon, glamour, scrolling billboards, vending machines and high-tech skyscrapers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- INSIDE A SOUVENIR SHOP loaded with McQueen toys: Mater and McQueen enter. A tourist sees McQueen and faints.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- A KABUKI THEATER. Team McQueen watches a methodical dance. Mater, dressed in Kabuki makeup, arrives. He looks insane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- A SUMO MATCH - Two SUZUKI SAMURAI CARS wrestle over a parking space. Mater, now in his element, cheers.

EXT. MUSEUM - TOKYO - NIGHT

<FRANCESCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, she has good taste.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCO>
<MCQUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mater's prone to exaggeration. I wouldn't say she's a "big" fan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCQUEEN>
<MATER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. She's a huge fan. She goes on and on about your open wheels here.

</MATER>
<MCQUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mentioning it once doesn't qualify as going "on and on."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCQUEEN>
<FRANCESCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Francesco is familiar with this reaction to Francesco. Women respect a car that has nothing to hide.

	Oh, sorry. I already dedicated MY win tomorrow to her. So if we both do it, it's really not so special. Besides, I don't have a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCQUEEN>

McQueen starts to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, you will see Francesco. But not like this.

Francesco does a 180, so his rear end now faces McQueen.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will see him like this, as he drives away from you.

</FRANCESCO>

Francesco wears a bumper sticker that says "Ciao, McQueen!"

Finn's ONBOARD COMPUTER ANALYZES each one, compares to the photos we saw him snap on the oil platform. Each one is "NOT A MATCH." His view is suddenly disrupted by A BEAUTIFUL SPORTS CAR. She approaches Finn. Meet HOLLEY SHIFTWELL.

	This was London's message?

	How did we miss that?

<HOLLEY>

	They'd been scrambling everyone's satellites. The Americans actually discovered it just before you did. They placed an agent on that platform, under deep cover. He was able to get a photo of the car who's running the entire operation.

The stall is a complicated apparatus with buttons and lights. High-tech Japanese. It suddenly GRABS MATER, hoists him up as if he's going to get an oil change.

The caricature starts talking in Japanese. Suddenly WATER FIRES UP underneath Mater's undercarriage, goosing him. He freaks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE STALL - With Mater's yells audible we see a GREMLIN enter, furtive. Suddenly, inexplicably, his frame BREAKS APART like an egg, revealing an AMERICAN MUSCLE CAR underneath. The pieces of the Gremlin disappear under him, clearly his disguise. This is ROD REDLINE - American Agent.

Rod Redline, careful, slides a gun out of his tire. He is suddenly CHARGED by the AMCs --- Rod SPINS AROUND and gets a shot off but is SLAMMED HEAD FIRST. A TIGHT, CLOSE-QUARTERS FIGHT begins ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE STALL - Mater, still TRAPPED, is now being SCRUBBED as if in a car wash. He is helpless.

OUTSIDE THE STALL - Rod is being pulverized. Just when he scrambles away from one car, the other one takes over.

</DARRELL_CARTRIP>
<FRANCESCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strategia? Francesco needs no strategy, it's very simple. You start the race, wait for Lightning McQueen to choke, pass him, then win. Francesco always wins. It's boring.

McQueen, waiting in the wings, rolls his eyes. He suddenly notices something O.S.

Mater, why were you yelling things at me while I was racing?

Yelling? Oh, you thought... that's funny right there. Nah, see that's `cause I seen these two fellers doing some sort of karate street performance. It was nutso. One of them even had a flamethrower ---

Wait a minute -- I didn't screw you up, did I?

Acer CAREENS out of control, drives up and THROUGH A JET ---

INT. ENCLOSED MARKETPLACE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Mater, now out of sight of Finn and Holley, passes a darkened stall. He STOPS, peers in. There's someone in there.
</DIRECTION>
<MATER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. What are you selling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATER>
<DIRECTION>
It suddenly OPENS its headlights revealing... EYES!! In French, the mutant car pitches his wares to Mater. Mater FREAKS OUT, speeds off, TERRIFIED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AROUND THE CORNER - FINN AND HOLLEY

A few car lengths ahead of Mater. They roll along, looking for... Aha! Finn and Holley recede into the shadows.

Too late. Tomber sees Mater, then notices FINN, reflected in a hubcap. He BOLTS. Finn and Holley give chase.
</DIRECTION>
<MATER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, wait for me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATER>
<DIRECTION>
Tomber, skidding away, kicks a tent in Finn's way. Holley quickly pivots RIGHT and disappears. Where did she go?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finn, hot in pursuit, leaps another obstacle and loses ground TO ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--- Tomber who turns a corner and finds himself grill to grill with HOLLEY. He whips to the left but TURNS OVER, rolling sideways and CRASHING to a stop.

Holley ZAPS him with ELECTROSHOCKERS. Finn suddenly arrives, stops her.

Holley FUMES with anger.

<FINN>

	Tomber was doing 20 to life in a Moroccan impound the first time I saved him, if I recall correctly.

	Speaking of recalls, you're getting up there in mileage aren't you, Finn?

	Alright, we get it. You both know each other, you're both old. So.

</HOLLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Holley shoots a HOLOGRAPHIC PHOTO of the engine in front of Tomber.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLEY>

	There you go, informant. Inform us.

Tomber eyes the photo. He recoils, unimpressed.

<TOMBER>

	That is the worst motor ever made.

Suddenly, Tomber narrows his gaze.

</TOMBER>
<HOLLEY>

	To whom?

</HOLLEY>
<TOMBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No idea. He's my best customer, but he always does his business over the phone. I was always wondering why he needs so many parts. Now I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMBER>
<MATER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, a lemon needs parts. Ain't nothing truer than that.

	"Lemon?"

</FINN>
<MATER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you know. Cars that don't ever work right. Lemons is a tow truck's bread and butter. Like them Gremlins and Pacers we run into at the party and the race and the airport.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATER>
<FINN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holley, pull up the pictures from the oil platform. I want to know what other type of cars were out there.

Holley complies and suddenly PHOTOS OF CARS FROM THE OIL PLATFORM hang suspended in the air in front of them.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Let's see. There were Hugos. And Trunkovs.

<HOLLEY>

Holley refers to the ENGINE PHOTO, which now rises forward as the prominent picture, perhaps the only one in view.

<FINN>

Mater does the requisite "silly faces" in an attempt to break the composure of a Buckingham Palace Guard. It isn't working. McQueen approaches.

</DIRECTION>
<MATER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So there I was: rocket jets going full blast, McQueen hanging on for dear life when suddenly them two nasty lemons come out of nowhere, guns drawed. We was goners. But then out of nowhere, this beautiful spy car swoops in from the sky to save us!

	That's a very entertaining story, young man.

</VAN>
<HOLLEY>

	No, you're quite right. It does sound a bit far-fetched.

</DIRECTION>
<VAN>

<FINN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We couldn't figure that one out either.

</FINN>
<HOLLEY>

	Wait a second. Fillmore, you said my fuel was safe.
