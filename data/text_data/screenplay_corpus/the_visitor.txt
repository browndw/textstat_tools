<DIRECTION>
WALTER VALE, sixty-two, is standing by the window of his modestly furnished Colonial house. He is holding a glass of wine and peering out through the drapes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a few moments an OLD CAR pulls up. A slightly overweight WOMAN gets out of the car. She starts to walk up to the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter steps back from the window and waits. The doorbell rings. Walter takes a last sip of wine and sets the glass down on the end table. And then he goes to the door and opens it.
</DIRECTION>

She steps into the house and Walter shuts the door. They both stand there awkwardly. Barbara is tightly wound and overcompensates with a forced pleasantness.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I take your coat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<BARBARA>

<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The same thing?

</WALTER>

</BARBARA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>

</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said "make room for the train." It's something that I tell my kids. If you curve your fingers like this...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(She demonstrates)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then the train can pass through the tunnel.

</WALTER>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no. Are you giving up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>

</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. OK. Goodbye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>

<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Vale? If I may ask, how many teachers have you had before me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, for what it's worth, it's difficult to learn an instrument at your age. Especially if you don't possess a natural gift for it. I'm not saying this to be mean. But if you do decide to give up then I would really like to buy your piano. It's a beautiful instrument.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Walter nods, not quite sure how to receive the comment.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>

<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's OK.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter, Shelley can't make it down to the NYU conference to present your paper. I'm going to need you to cover for her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why can't she go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's been put on bed rest until she has the baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
Walter is caught off guard.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next week. We'll cover your class and make the arrangements.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish I could, but now is not a very good time, Charles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand but you co-authored the paper and the Dean wants it presented. He wants to keep Shelley on track for tenure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just don't think I can with the start of classes and my book.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're only teaching one class, Walter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I can stay focused on my writing. I'd really rather not go right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry but there really isn't another option at this point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
Walter is trapped. He comes clean.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charles, the truth is this is really Shelley's paper. I just agreed to co-author it because she asked me to. I'm not really prepared to present it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That may be the case but you are the co-author and she can't go. Look Walter, you can take it up with the Dean if you want, but, as your friend, I wouldn't advise it. Not with that argument.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
Walter just stares him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

	<DIALOGUE>

<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why wouldn't they appeal it?

</WALTER>
<MR_SHAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fear of being deported. It used to be that when your asylum case was denied, they let you go until your appeal. A lot of people didn't bother with it. Getting denied once was enough to spook them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SHAH>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what happens if that's the case?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>

	You don't have to leave. You can stay here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<ZAINAB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's best if I leave. When Tarek calls me then I will tell him. You know how to reach me if you need to. Is it OK if I leave Tarek's things here for now? My cousin's place is not very big.

<DIRECTION>
Walter is waiting for Tarek. The visiting room is empty. Suddenly the door opens on the detainee side of the glass and a VERY YOUNG LATIN WOMAN walks out tentatively. She almost looks absurd in the oversized blue jumpsuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at Walter, unsure if she is supposed to approach the glass and talk to him. Walter just stares back, also unsure of what to do. They are caught in awkward moment. Finally Walter manages a nod. She nods back and smiles. It is the innocent smile of a child.

<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you should call your mother. She might have...

<WALTER>

</WALTER>
<TAREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Three years ago I was working for some guy who said he was going to sponsor me for my green card but then he turned out to be jerk. But the lawyer said that might allow us to reopen the case. I don't even understand it.

<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK.

Walter looks around and then cradles the phone in his shoulder and starts to bang a simple beat on his counter top. Tarek watches and listens for a moment.

	So if they didn't get the letter then does this help us?

<MOUNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you can help him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOUNA>
<MR_SHAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's still a long shot. Like I said, the Government's approach has changed radically. It's very black and white now. Either you belong or you don't. Which means a lot of people who have been living here for years are suddenly being swept up and thrown into detention.

	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
The Guard just stares back blankly. The other visitors watch in disbelief. They are unaccustomed to this type of outburst as is Walter who now stands trembling in the middle of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's as if something inside him snapped. Something that he has been holding on to for a long time. He is suddenly adrift. Unsure of what to do next.

	We were here for three years by the time the letter arrived. I had found a job. Tarek was in school. Everyone told me not to worry. That the government did not care. And it appeared to be true. And then, after time, you forget. You think that you really belong.
