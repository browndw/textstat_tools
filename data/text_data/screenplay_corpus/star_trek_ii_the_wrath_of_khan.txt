SEVERAL ANGLES The difficult search, the men leaning into the wind - TERRELL is ahead of Chekov on a slight rise -
</DIRECTION>
<CHEKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing here! The Tricorder must be broken.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE Terrell waves him frantically forward. As Chekov moves up, we rise with him to the top of the ridge and look down.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chekhov! Over here!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - THEIR POV A RUINED SERIES OF MAN-MADE STRUCTURES, half-buried in sand. They look at each other in consternation. Chekov is worried; something about all this is familiar. They descend towards the structures, now seen to be the wreckage of some sort of space craft. They pass but do not notice the FEDERATION LOGO, half buried next to their feet.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those look like cargo carriers... Hey, give me a hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARGO HOLD Terrell and Chekov enter, dumbfounded. THEIR POV. Someone lives here - there are beds, food, all jury- rigged, but no people. Terrell checks a monitor.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell happened? If they crashed, where's the rest of the ship?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They wander as they talk, picking up objects that bespeak a fairly sophisticated ad hoc environment: a laboratory in one hold, a kitchen; a LARGE SAND TANK filled with disgusting CETI EELS.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRELL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They enter a new chamber - KHAN'S QUARTERS on its side in the sand: the walls are not the floor, etc. All in crookedness - like its owner. On the floor, smiling at them (i.e., the wall) is a BABY. Tentatively they come over to it, looking around - ANGLE - CHEKOV'S POV Lethal-looking odd swords on one wall, a bookshelf; CAMERA PANS by 20th Century volumes; MOBY DICK, KING LEAR, THE HOLY BIBLE - and a seat belt dangling with the name on it - BOTANY BAY. Chekov mouths the words, softly at first, then aloud -
</DIRECTION>
<CHEKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Botany Bay... Botany Bay!! - Oh, no! We've got to get out of here -- now! Damn! Hurry!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Terrell catches his urgency -

EXT. CARGO HOLD AIRBAY Terrell and Chekov emerge, helmeted, then stop dead. ANGLE - THEIR POV A RING OF SUITED FIGURES has them surrounded. INT. RELIANT - THE BRIDGE Mr. Beach, the duty officer, stands looking at Ceti Alpha V on the forward screen.

	Let's give it a little more time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARGO HOLD - CETI ALPHA V Terrell and Chekov are held by FOUR STRONG MEN. They seem to be waiting. One of the men is JOACHIM. Out of the airlock steps a tall masked figure. A moment of suspense as Terrell and Chekov watch, terrified. The mask is peeled back.

<CHEKOV>

<KHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(mild)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and crew of the Botany Bay, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TERRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me - you men and women - you haven't...
	</DIALOGUE>
<KHAN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	... never told you the take?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Chekhov)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To amuse your Captain? No? Never told you how the Enterprise picked up the Botany Bay, lost in space from the year nineteen- ninety-six, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
	</DIALOGUE>
<TERRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never even met Admiral Kirk -

<KHAN>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	He never told you how Admiral Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHEKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lie! On Ceti Alpha Five there was life, a fair chance -
	</DIALOGUE>
<KHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THIS is Ceti Alpha Five. Ceti Alpha Six exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of this planet and everything was laid waste. Admiral Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions!
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHEKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<KHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't expect to find me. You thought this was Ceti Alpha Six. Why are you here?

They don't answer. Khan goes over to Terrell and, WITH ONE HAND, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR -

<KHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?!

Terrell gasps, stays silent. Khan goes over to the tank and dips a kind of strainer in, pulling out TWO CETI EELS - wriggling items -
</DIRECTION>
<KHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Allow me introduce you to Ceti Alpha Five's only remaining indigenous life form; what do you think? They've killed twenty of my people, including my beloved wife. Oh, not all at once, and not instantly, to be sure. You see, their young enter through the ears and wrap themselves around the cerebral cortex. this has the effect of rendering the victim extremely susceptible to suggestion. Later, as they grow, follows madness - and death.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHEKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Khan! Listen to me!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As he speaks Khan dumps an eel into each of their helmets; he swirls the helmets around as though he were mixing martinis -
</DIRECTION>
<KHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are pets, of course. Not quite domesticated.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No! No!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
At a sign, the helmets are slammed down. As the muffled shrieks are heard from within, the eels crawl across the faces of Chekov and Terrell; with unerring instincts they head for the ears of the two hapless men. There is some atrocious pain as they enter - then dazed calm.
</DIRECTION>
<KHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's better! Now: tell me why you are here - and tell me where I may find James Kirk.

	Lieutenant, have you ever piloted a Starship out of space dock?

<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do not grieve, Admiral - it is logical: the needs of the many outweigh -
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He almost keels over. Kirk has tears steaming down his face.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... the needs of the few...
	</DIALOGUE>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or the one.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He props a hand on the glass to support himself. Kirk's hand reflexively goes to match Spock's on the other side of the glass -

	I never took the Kobayashi Maru test - until now. What do you think of my solution?

	Spock...!

<SPOCK>

	I have been - and always will be - your friend...Live. Long. And. Prosper.

Spock falls. Bones and Scotty react.

INT. ENTERPRISE CAMERA PANS DOWN with Spock's burial capsule covered with the Starfleet Logo/flag, being lowered down to Torp. Bay 2. We SEE the Ship's Company in full dress uniforms assembled for ship's burial service. Over the PULLBACK, we HEAR:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are assembled here today to pay final respects to our honored dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Carol and David are PROMINENTLY FEATURED. David watching Kirk attentively. So are Sulu, Uhura, Chekov, and Saavik. Bones stands next to Kirk. Scotty carries his bagpipes. Saavik wears her hair down.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And yet, it should be noted, that in the midst of our sorrow, this death takes place in the shadow of new life, the sunrise of a new world, a world that our beloved comrade gave his life to protect and nourish. He did not feel this sacrifice a vain or an empty one - and we will not debate his profound wisdom at these proceedings. Of my friend, I can only say this... of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, his was the most -
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he falters)

	- human.

<SULU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honors - hup!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
All Starfleet personnel salute. Scotty begins to PIPE, an odd blare which mellows into Amazing Grace. Kirk nods a signal. THE CAPSULE A gleaming black projectile is carried by pallbearers into the launching chamber, which locks behind it. At a hand signal from a TORPEDOMAN, the projectile is fired. NOISE. EXT. SPACE Spock's remains seen on their way to the new world. The capsule grows too small to SEE. The bagpipes STOP. INT. KIRK'S QUARTERS After a long moment, the CAMERA DISCOVERS Kirk. He pours a drink, then decides not to have it. He sits wearily, not knowing how to shake the ghosts. Then he sees the book. Kirk picks up the battered volume, the gift from his friend, and closes his eyes a moment. Almost idly he starts turning pages, looking for a clue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he can't see the writing - He rummages through his pockets and pulls out the half-glasses - One of the lenses is broken. It has a deep impact on Kirk. He puts down the book and glasses and covers his eyes. A SOFT BONG. Kirk clears his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The door whooshes open and closes to admit David. The last person Kirk expected to see.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mean to intrude.
	</DIALOGUE>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not at all. I should be on the bridge.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, can I talk to you for a minute?
	</DIALOGUE>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I poured myself a drink. Would you like it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced a death.
	</DIALOGUE>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(hoarse)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Not like this. I haven't faced death, I've cheated death. I've tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life -
	</DIALOGUE>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just words -
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them. I was wrong about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what you came here to say?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mainly.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he starts out, then turns - )
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And also that I'm proud - very proud - to be your son.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A stunned moment, then Kirk lets it all hang out: for David, for Carol and for Spock. He hugs his son, holding onto him as to life itself. EXT. SPACE The Enterprise passes the new planet in all its beauty. INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door whooshes. Kirk strides on the bridge, David with him. Carol is there with Bones; they are glad at what they see. EXT. SPACE & ENTERPRISE Enterprise moving as the sun goes behind the Genesis planet.

<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Starship Enterprise departed for Ceti Alpha Five to pick up the crew of the USS Reliant. All is well. And yet, I can't help wondering about the friend I leave behind. there are always possibilities, Spock said. And if Genesis is indeed "life from death," I must return to this place again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's really not dead. As long as we remember him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that a poem?

<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday.

Kirk shakes his head, remembering -
