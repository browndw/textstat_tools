The train.. A PRETTY SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL (LYNN) , who is holding a stuffed animal almost as large as she is, climbs down the steps. She reaches the platform, looks around. From within the train:

MR. SMITH and MS. JONES continue trolling the PASSENGERS as they come through the gate.
</DIRECTION>
<MS_JONES>

</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta make a phone call, Lynn. Do you see a phone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
LYNN has seen the YOUNG COUPLE. She secretly points to them, covers her mouth, and does a "tee, hee, hee" number. GENE laughs.

LYNN suddenly gets very sad. She looks at the ground, slows down. GENE notices. He stops, crouches down to her level. MR. SMITH and MS. JONES, nearing them, split apart, move around them, and keep going.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
<DIRECTION>
(to LYNN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, it's OK to talk about her. You can talk about her all you want. You know that, don't you?

</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it? That little peck of a kiss? Oh, brother, you missed some kisses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>

MR. SMITH and MS. JONES are making a beeline for their target: the YOUNG KISSING COUPLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOSH! The-ROLLERBLADING TEENS almost collide with them. MS. JONES wants to do something about it, but MR. SMITH pulls her along. They have a mission to complete. They close in on the couple.

</MR_SMITH>
<MS_JONES>

The couple are murmuring sweet talk between kisses. The words themselves are unclear until MR. SMITH and MS. JONES are only a few feet away. French. They are speaking French. MR. SMITH makes an instant one-eighty turn. MS. JONES follows.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, is Mr. Conners there? I have an interview with him at twelve- thirty. Hi, Mr. Conners, this is Gene Watson. Sorry to call you at the last minute like this but... Hey, hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
He reacts to the ROLLERBLADING TEENS who swoop past LYNN, one on each side, too close for a father's comfort.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch that! Lynn, come here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
She does. He keeps an eye on the TEENS, who, having found a victim, are circling around, passing MR. SMITH and .MS. JONES. MR. SMITH has noticed GENE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE at the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. There's some crazy kids on skates. Listen, the train just got in, I'm afraid I'm going to be a few minutes late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
The TEENS make their pass, flip him the bird, engage in other objectionable behavior, begin to circle again. MR. SMITH watches GENE watch the TEENS, then notice a sturdy, sand- filled ashtray next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. OK, I'll get there as soon as I can. Bye, now.

</LYNN>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let' s do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up a suit-case and accidently-on-purpose uses it to knock over the ashtray, just as the TEENS approach. The ashtray spills its Load of sand into their path. When they hit it, their skates stop, they don't. They sprawl, doing nasty things to knees and wrists.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoops.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
He stands over them with LYNN.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?

He pulls open his coat, putting his hands on his hips, not- so coincidentally revealing the butt of a holstered gun.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>

	That's right. The policeman is your friend. Isn't that right, Daddy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>

GENE looks down. MR.. SMITH has pulled his gun. He points it casually so it's aiming through the seat in the general direction of the little girl.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy?

</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
He makes a move. MR. SMITH whacks his knee again, harder.

<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Watson, you're not paying attention. Your daughter's life depends on you. Do you understand that?
	</DIALOGUE>

	When you leave this van you will get yourself a cab and take it to the Bonaventure Hotel. Then you will take this.

MR. SMITH holds up his hand, snaps his fingers. From the back, MS. JONES hands him a cloth-wrapped bundle. He puts it in GENE's hand, shows him what it is: a gun.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and you will kill the woman whose picture is in there. Not just shoot her, mind,! kill her. I'd recommend you empty the gun into her. Close up. Got all that?

It takes a moment for it all to sink into GENE'S brain.

</GENE>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>

MR. SMITH still has GENE'S wallet. He opens it, pulls out some cash, puts it in GENE's breast pocket.

</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get moving, Mr. Watson. Time's a wastin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
GENE just stands there, transfixed by the bullets in his hand. MR. SMITH reaches out, turns him around and gives him a shove away from the van and into the midst of...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. UNION STATION - PARKING LOT - BUS STOP - DAY - 12:19PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...a LARGE CROWD OF TOURISTS, that have just exited an arriving mini-bus. GENE is caught up in the crowd and carried along like a leaf in a stream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amid the chattering CROWD, GENE is pushed along as if in a trance. He touches the pocket with the gun. He looks at the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bullets in his hand, then at the people around him. It's like a splash of cold water. He quickly pockets the bullets, turns and pushes against the tide of tourists. They resist him, pushing him along until he breaks free and can see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The van is gone!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON GENE -- 12:19PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands there, a lost man. Fear sweeps over him. He looks desperately around. He is within himself, oblivious to his surroundings, his mind racing, his face a tangle of emotions. He is a man alone in a crowd. He takes a step.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LITTLE LATINO GIRL, chased by HER BROTHER, runs into GENE'S legs. He instinctively grabs her before she can fall, finds himself, crouched down, holding her by the arms. His heart plunges - she isn't Lynn. His intensity scares her.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mama!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls away, flees to HER MOTHER, who hoists her up, reprimanding her in Spanish. GENE stays crouched, watching the LITTLE GIRL staring at him over HER MOTHER'S shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until a COP crosses his line of sight. A LOS ANGELES TRANSIT POLICEMAN, foot-patrolling the station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's like a gift from above. Relief floods GENE's face. He is saved. He stands, hurries toward the COP, each step more confident.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, just beyond the COP, MR. SMITH casually slides into view, pointedly holding the walkie-talkie. GENE walks right past the COP heading towards a cab stand. MR. SMITH falls in behind him speaking in his ear.

The cab pulls into the drive front of the Bonaventure Hotel and stops.

	I'd love to hear about your problem, but the ride's over. Three-fifty.
	</DIALOGUE>

GENE looks out the back window, watches the van pulls up to the curb on the other side of the street.
</DIRECTION>
<CABBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three-fifty. I hope your problem doesn't have anything to do with my three-fifty.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
GENE looks back at the CABBIE, waiting for his fare.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
GENE digs through his pockets and comes up with one of his business cards. He hurriedly writes on it: "HELP. VAN KIDNAP CHILD." He wraps a five around it, pushes it into the CABBIE'S hand, gives him a meaningful look and gets out of the cab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - DAY - 12:23PM

<DIRECTION>
GENE stops a few yards from the cab, watching the CABBIE.
</DIRECTION>

The DOORMAN plants a PASSENGER in the cab. As he pulls away, the CABBIE again glances at the business card, crumples it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - DAY - 12:23PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE watches the cab leave. As it exits, the CABBIE's arm snakes out and tosses the card in the trash. GENE knows what it is. He looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALETS, BELLMEN, ARRIVALS and DEPARTEES, cars coming and going. No one pays particular attention to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE looks at the van across the street. MR. SMITH gets out and walks across the street towards him. The van drives away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE watches the van disappear around the corner, desperately hanging onto the last glimpse of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. SMITH takes the walkie-talkie out of his pocket. GENE goes into the hotel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE enters. It's like another world. A busy, humming, air- conditioned planet. PEOPLE hustle around the restaurants, waterfalls - a definite ant farm ambiance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH DOWN ANGLE ON GENE - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM

<DIRECTION>
Suddenly we have cut to a VIDEO IMAGE of Gene looking around this Hotel, complete with scrolling TIME AND DATE. Shot by someone high above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON GENE - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE is bumped and buffeted about by the bustling crowd. He breaks free to a clear spot, looks up and freezes. Then he starts tracking all around him, seeing...something.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God. Oh, no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
He desperately fumbles in his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Facing and above him, some WORKMEN ON LADDERS are securing a huge, rolled up banner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE finds what he's looking for - the manila envelope. He rips it open. As he pulls out the photograph that is inside, the WORKMEN let their banner unfurl. We do a simultaneous reveal. The woman in the photograph in the envelope is the same as depicted on the banner. Written across the bottom of it in your best red, white, and blue:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"RE-ELECT ELEANOR SAMARA GRANT GOVERNOR"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And an addendum:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"HERE TODAY!"
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
It dawns on him. He looks around him again. This time we see what he sees. Campaign posters and banners everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On some of them she is posed with a handsome man, several years her junior. These have the caption, "Governor Grant and husband Brendan".
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, sweet Jesus...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes fall on MR. SMITH, standing inside the entrance, walkie-talkie in hand, watching him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE looks at a poster, at MR. SMITH, who smiles, nods and gives GENE a move of the head - "Get to it."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE shoves the photograph away as if it could incriminate him, then slides out the itinerary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The itinerary says "California Educators' Association - 12:00 noon - Emerald Bay Room - Opening Address - Governor Eleanor Samara Grant".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE checks his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
12:26.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around him at the confusion and spots a Bellboy, GUSTINO, who's cleaning out ashtrays.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you tell me where the Emerald Bay Room is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
GUSTINO points up.
</DIRECTION>
<GUSTINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Third floor. Yellow stairwell. Follow the signs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUSTINO>
<DIRECTION>
GENE turns away without a word, starts to walk, then turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
GUSTINO smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<GUSTINO>

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - "YELLOW STAIRWELL" - DAY - 12:26PM

GENE mounts a set of stairs that will take him to the third floor. MR. SMITH follows him as he climbs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. "YELLOW STAIRWELL" - DAY - 12:2 6PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The whole lobby and entrance of the hotel are seen as Gene ascends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE forces himself not to look at MR. SMITH behind him. His nerves are rising in anticipation of his destination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 12:26PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE sees the arrow and sign for the Emerald Bay Room. He walks that way. MR. SMITH follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. THIRD FLOOR - SHOP ARCADE AREA - DAY - 12:27PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE and MR. SMITH pass gift shops, snack bars. The walkway is crowded and GENE is going against the tide of REPORTERS, POLITICIANS, SUPPORTERS, and just a lot of PEOPLE WITH NAME TAGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE plows on through...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and runs smack into BRENDAN GRANT.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoops!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
The two men reel back from each other. A SECURITY MAN, earphones and gray suit, steps immediately between them. BRENDAN GRANT is a charmingly smooth man.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice body check.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
He continues on, talking to an ATTRACTIVE WCMAN COMPANION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRENDAN GRANT What the Governor really admires, Mrs. Wentzel, and Eleanor has said this to me on more than one occasion, are pecple like you who take a personal tragedy and turn it into a positive force.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slides a familiar hand around her waist.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know my wife has a deeply personal reason for going after repeat drunk drivers. They are felons and they should be treated as such. A drivers license is a privilege, not a right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
And he is hustled away. Right past an election poster featuring him and Governor Grant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still stunned by the encounter, GENE turns back and watches the Governor's husband, but keeps walking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. EMERALD BAY ROOM - DAY - 12:28PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is emptying, that's where the crowd came from. GENE comes in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WOMAN is heading for the door with a centerpiece she's just copped.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, is the...thing over?

</GENE>
<WOMAN>

</GENE>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Nice speech. But it's the same at all these...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
But GENE has turned away. The WOMAN gives him a face, grabs another centerpiece and exits. A CLEAN-UP CREW is starting to go through the room. GENE leans against a wall, breathing through a combination of relief and agony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. SMITH is suddenly next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check your itinerary. Move along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
GENE gets out the itinerary. "12:30 - 12:45 - Hors d'oeuvres/ Buffet w/Friends of Eleanor Samara Grant - INVITATION ONLY - Bona Vista Lounge".
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This says "invitation only".

</GENE>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
MR SMITH digs into the manila envelope, comes out with a handful of security badges, name tags, invites. He plucks the name tag that MS JONES printed earlier. It has a red ribbon signifying a Major Donor to the Campaign. He fastens it to Gene's lapel.
</DIRECTION>

:SC: INT. LOBBY ENTRANCE TO THE "RED" ELEVATOR - DAY - 12:28PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE approaches. He notices a flurry of movement, a small GROUP OF PEOPLE moving determinedly through the lobby. It is GOVERNOR ELEANOR GRANT with a small entourage! She is a handsome woman in her fifties. The entourage consists of KRISTA BROOKS, Eleanor's, late-twenties assistant, a few assorted POLITICAL AIDES and a couple of PEOPLE WITH NAME TAGS. GENE is not sure what to do. The group reaches the elevator. KRISTA pushes the button.
</DIRECTION>

The elevator doors open. They crowd in. The doors start to close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gene looks around, where did Mr. Smith go?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE springs forward, thrusts his hand between them. The doors stop, then bounce open. GENE is startled, finding himself face to face with a cold eyed bodyguard.
</DIRECTION>

It comes out a little louder then he intended. He has turned, his back to the door. Everyone looks at him. He's committed.

GENE looks at her. She smiles back.
</DIRECTION>
<KRISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRISTA>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at what she refers to: the manila envelope he holds, the one MR. SMITH gave him.
</DIRECTION>
<KRISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that something precious?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRISTA>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that's,..that's fine
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
He gives it to ELEANOR GRANT. KRISTA hands over the pen. GENE's eyes flick over to MR. SMITH who is staring at the envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's her name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
GENE looks at the Governor, only inches away, back to MR. SMITH, who raises his eyes, nods, his silent message curt - do it! GENE pulls his eyes away.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her name? Her name is Lynn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
ELEANOR GRANT writes the autograph. MR. SMITH'S eyes drill into him. GENE looks over. MR. SMITH raises a hand to his face, pretends to scratch an itch. His other hand taps his wristwatch. GENE's hand slides toward his jacket pocket. Sweat beads on his forehead. He's barely aware of KRISTA talking to him.
</DIRECTION>
<KRISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's funny. I don't even keep a pad of paper with me anymore, everything's gone so electronic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRISTA>
<DIRECTION>
He gives her a quick, weak smile. His free hand wipes the sweat from his face.
</DIRECTION>
<KRISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it wasn't for double A batteries I'd be in big trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRISTA>
<DIRECTION>
He is slowly reaching into the pocket with the gun, but stops when he notices MR. SMITH'S hand slide into his jacket, where his gun is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at the other MR. SMITH, earphone, crewcut-Security. There is the hint of a gun on his hip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE's eyes widen, dart to MR. SMITH'S face, his hand sliding into his coat. His hand hovers over his gun, trembling. Is the SECURITY MAN staring at him?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELEANOR GRANT hands over the autograph.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you all right? Elevators make me queasy, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
GENE gives her a sick smile, abruptly turns away. He takes his hand out of his pocket. It's shaking. He clenches it to stop the shakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors open, startling him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	She was right in front of you! What's wrong with you!?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
His fists clench. He seems about to lose control. He backs GENE into a corner, physically terrified.

</MR_SMITH>
<GENE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the gun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
He raises a fist. Struggles with the impulse to smash GENE, controls it. Angrily, he takes the gun from GENE's pocket, expertly loads it with bullets from his own pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't get many chances like that, Mr. Watson. That's the way life works. Don't blow the next one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
He indicates the glass,wall of the elevator with his eyes. GENE looks out and down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE'S POV

The van. It's moving into a parking spot across from the Bonaventure, on Flower Street.

The elevator continues its descent and the van disappears from view. GENE strains to see it again, but it's impossible.
</DIRECTION>

MR. SMITH jams the loaded gun into GENE's pocket.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. SMITH walks out. GENE follows. MR. SMITH, suddenly becomes self-conscious, walks away from GENE. The object of his shyness: A JAPANESE TOURIST COUPLE nearby. The man is taping his wife with a video camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEW THROUGH VIDEO CAMERA - 12:31PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see what the camera is seeing, the WIFE, smiling. Behind her, we see GENE, looking confusedly after Mr. Smith. He turns, walks out of frame. In the corner of the picture, a read-out of the TIME:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
12:31:00.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 12:31PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back in real life, GENE walks toward a shoeshine stand outside the Men's Room. "Huey's Polished Act" and below that, hand- lettered, "Disabled Veteran" where HUEY himself, a fiftyish black man, reads a "Smithsonian" magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees GENE and perks up - a customer.
</DIRECTION>
<HUEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Having a rough day? Down at the heels as they...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUEY>
<DIRECTION>
But GENE goes right past HUEY and into the Men's Room.
</DIRECTION>
<HUEY>
<DIRECTION>
(calling after him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't see your face, you don't pay!

<DIRECTION>
HUEY gives up, goes back to his magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MEN'S ROOM. - DAY - 12:31PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gene goes- over to one of the sinks, runs the cold water, splashes his face, looks in the mirror, into his own eyes. He tries to find an answer, a way out. A pay phone, on the wall behind him, comes into focus. Then a hand reaches in, grabs the receiver...and yanks it, snapping the wire. Gene spins around. It is MR. SMITH, of course.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. SMITH smiles. GENE doesn't. MR. SMITH leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY

GENE exits the Men's Room and walks back the route he came.

HUEY sets down his magazine again.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Having a rough day? Down at the heels as they say? What you need is a shoe shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUEY>
<DIRECTION>
It's HUEY's usual patter, he's said it a thousand times. GENE looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. SMITH is in the lounge area, facing the Flower Street entrance, able to keep the Men's Room and GENE in view.
</DIRECTION>
<HUEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take ten, take a break, take a seat, take a load off. Put the world in perspective.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUEY>
<DIRECTION>
GENE lets HUEY usher him into a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gun in his jacket pocket clunks against the arm of the chair. A grim reminder. He pulls out the itinerary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

The minute hand clicks to 12:33 as he watches.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON HUEY - 12:33PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He works away at GENE's shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<HUEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, are you a visitor or lucky enough to live in The City of Angels?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUEY>
<DIRECTION>
It's more of HUEY's patter, no real substance to the inquiry.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm...I'm visiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
GENE watches MR. SMITH frown and amble toward the shoeshine stand.

	What do you do, if I may be so bold?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUEY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just an accountant.

<HUEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants? They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUEY>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MR. SMITH - 12:33PM

He takes note of the conversation and wanders back to his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON HUEY - 12:33PM
</DIRECTION>
<HUEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you take tips. Time was a tip was between a man and his customer. Not any more. They've figured out what they call a formulae, don't laugh, it ain't for babies. They take your sales, see, and slap a percentile on there, figuring that somewhere between your lies and your bad luck they'll hit on the mean amount, mean meaning "in the middle", but if you ask me it means "just plain mean". Why you can have Uncle Scrooge wring a nickel over your poor out-stretched palm, or Daddy Warbucks dropping pearl stick-pins like manna from heaven, don't make no difference, they'll tax your behind according to that same figure. Doesn't seem quite right., does it?

	No. No, it doesn't.

<HUEY>

</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
GENE I keep wondering what she would do if she was here. She'd figure it out. She'd run it down like a column of numbers. Pro's and cons. That's the way she was: Lists all over the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HUEY's manic shoe-shining slows down: who has he got in his chair?
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drove me crazy. There must have been one on me. I didn't add up so she left. That's what attracted me to her In the first place. She made up her mind and she did it. She wouldn't sit around waiting for...whatever. She'd do something. She'd do something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
HUEY keeps his eyes on his work. He's afraid he's got a live one.
</DIRECTION>
<HUEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, well, you know, for a quality shoe you can't beat a good wingtip. Wears like iron. You're a wise man. There ya' go. Two bucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUEY>

HUEY gestures for GENE to get down. GENE steps to the floor. He pays HUEY with a twenty.
</DIRECTION>
<HUEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got anything smaller?

</HUEY>
<GENE>

GENE looks around the lobby, at MR. SMITH, the Flower Street entrance, the rest of the area, feeling the gun in his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<HUEY>
	<DIALOGUE>

HUEY nods toward the bar.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HOTEL BAR AREA - DAY - 12:3 6PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE walks into the area of the bar. The BARTENDER is just returning to chat with a customer, a REPORTER who is getting sloshed. GENE moves slowly along the bar, into an area where MR. SMITH'S view of him is blocked.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So where was I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>

GENE hears this and glances towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah. She's dumping the Good Old Boys like yesterday's newspapers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
GENE sees that MR.SMITH can no longer see him. He scans the lobby, sees a smaller door that leads onto Flower Street.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The white boys are in for it. When they got her elected they never thought she was gonna make the Governor's office look like the United Nations.

GENE comes out the door, dashes across the street, weaving through the traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once across, he heads up the sidewalk toward the van, keeping low, sneaking up behind it. He crouches by the front door, one hand sliding into his pocket for the' gun, the other -on the door handle. He raises his head cautiously and looks inside the cab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No MS. JONES up front at least. He takes a breath, braces himself. With one motion he jerks the back door open, yanks out the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. VAN - DAY - 12:37PM

The first thing he sees, fixates on, is LYNN. She is stretched out on the seat, eyes closed, mouth open. She appears dead.

MS. JONES is sitting on the seat behind the one LYNN is on. GENE points the gun at her face. She smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<MS_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What we have here is what they call a Mexican standoff. The thing you gotta ask yourself is, "What's behind the seat?" Now, a twenty-two'd go right through it, but even a button will throw a twenty-two off so there's a good chance it'd get screwed up somewhere along the way, miss the target. Maybe a thirty-eight? A thirty-eight'11 drill pretty straight, unless it hits metal, then it'll bust up in little bitty pieces. They'll keep going but they'll be slowed down quite a bit. How's about a three-fifty-seven? It'll go through the seat, her, you, the dashboard, shit, it'll go through the engine block before it knows it's hit anything, end up in some pedestrian three blocks away. What do you think? What's my poison?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
GENE look at Lynn's sleeping face - the gun in his own hand. He lowers the gun, defeated.
</DIRECTION>
<MS_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well it's a comfort to know you've got the co-Jones to pull that thing out. Whether you've got the balls to pull the trigger we've still got to see.

The Governor and her husband have an arm around each other. They are smiling, relaxed, quite the" happy couple. They give each other a warm kiss. Camera flashes, recording the moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE, heading toward them, has to thread his way through a large WEDDING PARTY - tuxedos and bridesmaid gowns. When he clears them he has neared the impromptu press conference.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON BRENDAN GRANT - 12:3 9PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is now alone in front of a campaign poster, fielding questions from a few remaining REPORTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Farther on, ELEANOR GRANT and her entourage can be seen taking the escalator up. GENE heads that way, passing BRENDAN GRANT.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My wife is not interested in negative campaigning. She wants to accentuate the positive. I don't know about you but I find that refreshing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN_GRANT>
<A_REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever thought of running for office yourself?

<BRENDAN_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles, charmingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN walks by. The Governor's husband's eyes follow her appreciatively as he says:
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just a business man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON GENE - 12:40PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He nears the escalator. It's crowded and GENE is pulled into the midst of NEWS PEOPLE, TV, RADIO, PRESS. He joins the flow and lets it pull him along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE rides the escalator to the Second Floor and follows the crowd up two flights of the circular stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down a short tunnel and out onto the Pool Deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - POOL, DECK - HIGH ANGLE - 12:41PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About an acre of grass on the Fourth Floor. Skyways connect the Pool Deck to the office buildings across Flower and Figueroa. A platform has been set up with chairs and microphones in front of a podium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. POOL DECK - CLOSE ANGLE ON GENE - 12:41PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE blinks in the sudden, bright sunshine. When his eyes adjust, he finds himself in a line that is approaching A SECURITY MAN with a hand-held metal detector. He panics, turns, trying to escape, but finds himself bumped along, trapped. The line shuffles forward. He turns, determined to make a supreme effort to escape and finds himself facing a 2ND SECURITY MAN, who waves him to one side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
2ND SECURITY MAN Excuse me, sir, You don't have to wait. I can take you over here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE is dragged forward. He looks around; no way out. He stands, expectant, as the detector slides down one side of his body, is lifted over to the other. Down it slides, toward the pocket concealing the gun. GENE waits for the alarm - which doesn't come. The SECURITY MAN operating the gizmo deftly switches it off as it passes the weapon. GENE is pushed on, looking back, confused, alarmed, finds himself among:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRESS by the dozens. Eleanor Samara Grant SUPPORTERS by the hundreds. SECURITY MEN and COPS IN UNIFORM. GENE moves through them, trying to figure out what just happened. He glances back to the 2ND SECURITY MAN, and bumps into one particular POLICE OFFICER, plain clothes, badge in pocket, who reacts with a quick laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POLICE OFFICER Easy, sir. Got to watch where you're going in a crowd like this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is a handsome, solid-looking guy. You'd trust him. Call him OFFICER TRUST. OFFICER TRUST seems to be in charge. He moves off through the crowd, giving LOCAL POLICE orders in an easy way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE looks around. He can't see MR. SMITH. He edges his way after OFFICER TRUST, who reaches the wall beyond which is the drop to the street. He leans there comfortably, scanning the crowd, GENE reaches the wall a few yards away from him. He looks out at the city, getting his courage up. Just as he turns to approach OFFICER TRUST:
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you're thinking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
GENE freezes! MR. SMITH appears from the crowd, joins him. He smugly flips his walkie-talkie into the air, catches it.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would you do in my place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
He flips the walkie-talkie, catches it.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bitch would be dead. Course I ain't sayin' which bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
He flips the walkie-talkie. GENE lashes out, smacks the walkie- talkie. It sails over the edge, falls and smashes onto the sidewalk four stories below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. SMITH goes ballistic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE walks away from him - right up to OFFICER TRUST.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a plot to kill the Governor. If you don't believe me, check that guy right there. He has a gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
OFFICER TRUST looks at MR. SMITH and then at GENE.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER_TRUST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So do you, Mr. Watson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER_TRUST>
<DIRECTION>
And OFFICER TRUST reaches in his hip pocket for a spare Walkie- Talkie that he tosses to MR. SMITH.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER_TRUST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got this under control?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER_TRUST>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<OFFICER_TRUST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't look like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER_TRUST>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's under control.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<OFFICER_TRUST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It better be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER_TRUST>
<DIRECTION>
OFFICER TRUST walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. SMITH stares at a devastated GENE. He sticks the walkie- talkie into his pocket, grabs GENE under the arm, drags him to an isolated corner.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I oughta throw you after that walkie- talkie but I'm going to give you a break because you're an amateur.

<WAITER_M>

(O.S.)

The WAITER offers a tray of hors d'houvres.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, thanks. Have a cracker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
GENE shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a cracker, Mr. Watson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
GENE woodenly takes one. The WAITER moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was this guy. Big guy. Irish- Italian. Red-faced, black-haired, jolly son-of-a-bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
We see them from a distance - just a couple guys chatting.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody could make me laugh like him. We closed more bars together than I can count. He was my pal. I loved that crazy mick, I'm not ashamed to say it. But he was fuck-up. He had this image of himself. Thought he was con man. Always trying to shave the edge. Nickel and dime. I'll always miss him. Tell me why.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me why I miss him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How should I...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me why he's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
GENE stares at him for a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You killed him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
He moves in on GENE, crowding him. He breathes hard, looks like one insane piece of work.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I loved that motherfucker but I got the call and I put him down like a sick animal. So if you've got any doubts about what's going to happen if you don't deliver let me tell you something. I'd make gravy out of your little girl just to season that black Irish cocksucker's meat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
A wave of applause catches their attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON ELEANOR GRANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She and her entourage enter the Pool Deck and walk toward the platform. ELEANOR GRANT gladhands people on the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MR. SMITH - 12:45PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns' back to GENE.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do what you're supposed to do. Do it now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs GENE and gives him a push. There is a general movement in the crowd toward the platform. GENE is buffeted along. MR. SMITH follows him, keeping him in sight, but then a PACK OF PHOTOGRAPHERS move in, start snapping, lifting their cameras high to shoot over the crowd. MR. SMITH instinctively turns away, hiding his face. He moves around the PHOTOGS and finds himself separated from GENE by the mob. He searches, trying to spot him.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON GENE - 12:4 6PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the crowd, GENE is bumped this way and that. His face displays an inner devastation. His eyes focus desperately on something ahead:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is the back of ELEANOR GRANT'S head. She is turning this way and that, greeting supporters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENE's hand slides into his pocket, grips the gun. He is at the end of his rope. He is going to do it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON ROSTRUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A local POLITICO mounts the platform, taps the microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOCAL POLITICO Can I have your attention Please! Please welcome a man who was for 19 years the distinguished Mayor of Los Angeles. The honorable Tom Bradley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CROWD reacts loudly, yells and whistles. GENE-pushes his way forward.

	It is my extreme pleasure this afternoon to introduce to you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM_BRADLEY>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON GENE - 12:4 6PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is now a few yards from ELEANOR GRANT. He comes up against the SECURITY MAN who gave him the once-over with the metal detector. The man's eyes slide over him, then he looks away. He nonchalantly steps aside, moves off through the CROWD.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM_BRADLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...a woman who can only be characterized as a one-of-a-kind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM_BRADLEY>
<DIRECTION>
GENE is close to ELEANOR GRANT. She is just a few bodies away, visible between them. His hand moves in his pocket. He swallows. The impulse sweeps over him and...
</DIRECTION>

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	...and go to the mat with greedy special interests...

</TOM_BRADLEY>
<DIRECTION>
GENE looks at KRISTA, studies her intensely. She's a bit unnerved.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM_BRADLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The finest Governor our state has ever had...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM_BRADLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Again GENE looks at ELEANOR GRANT. She's turning around, facing the crowd, facing him.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM_BRADLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My friend and yours, Governor Eleanor Grant!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM_BRADLEY>
<DIRECTION>
ELEANOR GRANT raises her arms. A perfect target. The CROWD roars as GENE turns back to KRISTA. He leans into her, speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.

<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
Krista assesses Gene, his desperate tone of voice. Obviously a nut case. A well-dressed nut case, but a nut case nevertheless. Krista, nervous, looks around for help.
</DIRECTION>
<KRISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, sure, I'll help you. Let me get Mr. White. I'm sure he can assist you, he's our...

Hidden by potted plants and campaign posters at the fringe of the CROWD, GENE confronts KRISTA, covering her with the pocketed gun. In the background, ELEANOR GRANT delivers a ringing speech, accented with applause.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please...please...you have to believe me... They have my daughter. They want me to kill Eleanor Grant — or they'll kill my daughter.

GENE pulls the gun from his pocket. She recoils, thinking he's going to shoot her.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>

	Look, how did I get in here with this!?

</KRISTA>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</GENE>
<KRISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.

GENE offers KRISTA the gun. She is surprised, to say the least. She takes it gingerly, with only the tips of her fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you trust me now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at the gun, at the strange man.

	I guess I'll have to. Come on, there's one person we can go to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRISTA>

MR. SMITH stands by the open door. Before GENE can speak, MR. SMITH moves. It is fluid and cohtroled and fast. He marches across the room, detouring to grab a pillow from the couch. He takes the gun, shoves" it- into the pillow and goes face to face with KRISTA. She just has time to wonder what is going on There is a double muffled gunshot. Shock fills her eyes, she slides to the floor. GENE can only stand there, unbelieving, freaked to the gills.

He tries to rush to the bathroom but MR. SMITH is right there, gripping him. GENE struggles frantically, uselessly, watching the bathroom door close. MR. SMITH is beyond anger. He grabs GENE'S throat, muscles down. GENE grips the iron hand that's cutting off his air.

</DIRECTION>
<HUEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, ladies. No time to be shy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUEY>
<DIRECTION>
GENE kicks off his shoes, shucks his pants. He trades his pants and jacket with GUSTINO, who has done the same. GUSTINO's pants are too big for GENE. His pants are too small for GUSTINO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUSTINO goes into a stall and closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HUEY comes back from the door.
</DIRECTION>
<HUEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gustino! Drop 'em!

GUSTINO has taken a seat inside the stall, but with GENE's pants still up. He drops them.
</DIRECTION>
<HUEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And cover up them socks. Man, who dresses you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUEY>
<DIRECTION>
HUEY leads GENE to another door. "Service Personnel Only". He taps on it. It is opened by a Latino JANITOR. HUEY and GENE slip through the door, shut it. The JANITOR begins mopping the floor as MR. SMITH comes in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes come to rest on the stall. All he sees are GENE's shoes and GENE's pants crumpled around the ankles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. SMITH smirks and leaves.

The Janitor raps on GUSTINO's stall with the mop.

<DIRECTION>
Lit only by a bedside lamp. ELEANOR GRANT is laying on the bed, dressed, towel across her eyes, bare feet elevated on a pair of pillows. GENE edges over slowly to her. He stands over her, not knowing how to begin.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>

ELEANOR GRANT lifts a hand, moves the towel from her eyes.

She sits upright, reaches for the phone! GENE moves, putting his hand on top of hers on top of the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, please.

</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
They stare at each other for a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She bolts for the door! Gene beats her to it! She backs up to the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eleanor Grant is a strong, tough woman, but she's not fearless.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.

<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.

	That's...a comfort to hear.

She studies him.

<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.

</GENE>
<ELEANOR_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were very nervous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR_GRANT>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was because I had this...in my pocket
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
He slowly pulls out the gun. She takes it in.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need you to listen to me. Carefully. Three lives depend on you listening very carefully to what I have to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
(friendly as can be)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. But suppose we set up an appointment. I have an important speech to deliver and you're cutting into my nap time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Very slowly, she moves to the table, lifts the phone ELEANOR GRANT My assistant, Krista Brooks, takes care of constituent...
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Krista Brooks is dead.

</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
She freezes, slowly replaces the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR_GRANT>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.

</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shot her?

</ELEANOR_GRANT>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

</GENE>
<ELEANOR_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who did?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR_GRANT>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<ELEANOR_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR_GRANT>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And your husband works for somebody else.

An increasingly edgy MR. SMITH is looking at the Men's Room door. He glances over to OFFICER TRUST who's keeping an eye on him. He looks at his watch again, then gets up and heads for the Men's Room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:19PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. SMITH enters. HECTOR is at the urinal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. SMITH checks out the feet under the stall. He has to bend over to check properly. GENE''s shoes, GENE' s pants legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HECTOR notices MR. SMITH'S actions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. SMITH is aware that he's been noticed, but he is very suspicious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HECTOR flushes the urinal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. SMITH stays by the stall. He is going to look over the top of the stall. He rises on his tiptoes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But HECTOR is staring at him like he's a pervert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. SMITH is suddenly embarrassed. He backs away from the stall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HECTOR washes his hands, watching MR. SMITH in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. SMITH leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HECTOR dries his hands. He walks over to the stall and knocks on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<HECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
And GUSTINO tosses a Bellboy jacket over the top of the stall. HECTOR puts it on.
</DIRECTION>
<HECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Gustino, what takes you so long? You need to eat more fiber.

<DIRECTION>
ELEANOR GRANT sits against the headboard. GENE sits on the edge of the bed, the gun all but forgotten, held loosely in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew you wouldn't believe me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<ELEANOR_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR_GRANT>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't blame you. I don't have any proof. But nothing like this occurs in a vacuum. You can't be totally oblivious. You must suspect something. You're doing things which are making people angry. People who have been in power a long time are losing their jobs. You know them better than me. How much does it mean to them? How far would they go to hang onto it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes go inward, reflecting a vague doubt. GENE sees it, hurries to follow up on this possible chink in her armor. Excited by it, he gets up, forgets to cover her so closely.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<ELEANOR_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling, covering her inner thought)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR_GRANT>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENE>
<ELEANOR_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
GENE, across the room looks at the gun in his hand. He takes the plunge.
</DIRECTION>
<GENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This? I've never even fired one.

</GENE>
<ELEANOR_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>

ELEANOR GRANT stares up at FRANCO, back-lit by the light coming from the next room. It gleams off the gun he holds in his hand. She stares from the gun up to his hulking frame.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it, Governor!? What's wrong!?

It is MS. JONES'. She is in the driver's seat. She looks back at LYNN who is trying to amuse herself one way or another. She checks her gun. She pulls out her walkie-talkie, puts it on the seat beside her. She starts the car.

The stall door opens and GENE comes out, zipping up his pants. He brushes right past MR. SMITH, heads for the door. MR. SMITH reaches out, grabs him.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You forgot to wash your hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
He throws him against the sinks. GENE washes his hands. MR. SMITH leans against the sink next to him In the mirror above the sink, GENE sees the stall door swings open. GUSTINO Is huddled in the corner, feet up on the toilet. MR. SMITH doesn't notice.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got faith in you, Mr. Watson. I know you're not just a regular guy, see, I know that. Even if you don't know it yourself. Maybe that's why I picked you.

Other lights have been turned on. ELEANOR GRANT is fixing her hair in the mirror. FRANCO is cleaning up the broken lamp. There is a perfunctory knock on the hall door and it opens, revealing BRENDAN GRANT. The MYSTERY MAN hovers in the background.

	Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
