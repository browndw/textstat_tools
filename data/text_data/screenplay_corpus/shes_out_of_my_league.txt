INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dozen or so shadowy people are seated in the darkened room. A slide projector dimly lights MR. FULLER, a crew-cutted Robert Stack type in a suit, as he addresses the group. The current slide is a still from a security video of a blurry figure - it could be any of about a billion people.
</DIRECTION>
<FULLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...So, let's keep a steely eye out for this bastard.

<DIRECTION>
(THEN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before we dismiss, this is your monthly reminder of why we're here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FULLER>
<DIRECTION>
Fuller advances to a slide of the American flag. Close on one of the group - a heavyset bald man in his mid-thirties. He politely pays close attention to the presentation.

Close on another face in the group. A doughy man with three- day scruff and a trendily long haircut. He looks bored, rolling his eyes at the speech.

<FULLER>

The lights come up and as the group files out we get a better look at their uniforms. The TSA agents move out into the...

<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRPORT - SECURITY CHECK POINT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The agents take their places, manning the screening equipment. We push in on the bald man as he takes up his post next to the walk-through metal detector. This is KIRK KETTNER. He is not a looker. His uniform only serves to highlight his least attractive features but his eyes and demeanor are pleasant and kind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scruffy agent is STAINER. He stands at the x-ray monitor. As the bags begin to move through, he does not pay any attention, rather he hands Kirk a flyer.
</DIRECTION>
<STAINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kirk, bro. Tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAINER>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT: The flyer reads, "Wheel in the Sky - a Tribute to Journey at Club Vertigo - Every Tuesday Night!" Stainer is pictured wearing a massive afro in the band photo.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, Stainer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<STAINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dude, you never come see us anymore. It's been like four months. Time to forget about Marnie and get back on the whores.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAINER>
<DIRECTION>
Stainer does a sex dance that makes everyone uncomfortable. Fuller shoots a stern look from his office.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not that. It's my Grandma. I'll probably be at the hospital for the next few nights.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<STAINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shit. I spaced that. How's she doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAINER>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's hanging in there but it doesn't look good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<STAINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dude, I'm sorry. She's a great lady. That sucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAINER>
<DIRECTION>
A Middle-Eastern man in a cowboy hat is next in line. Mr. Fuller appears behind Kirk, taps his shoulder and subtly motions to the Arab. Kirk smiles at the potential terrorist.

EXT. AIRPORT CURB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Follow a pair of perfect female legs as the woman's heels click along the sidewalk, suitcase rolling behind. Although we can't see the woman riding on these legs, we can see several men stare as she passes by on her way into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRPORT TICKETING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More stares from more men and even a few women as we follow the legs to the check-in line. The legs glide to the front and stop to wait for the next available ticket agent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the slightly upward angle, we see two young male ticket agents. (One on each side of the legs.) One is black and one white; each are dealing with customers. They simultaneously notice our woman. They suspiciously eye one another and the race is on. Each agent begins typing furiously to expedite their current customer in the hope of waiting on her next.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Angle on the WHITE AGENT as he waits on a yuppie couple.
</DIRECTION>
<WHITE_AGENT>

<YUPPIE_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grant, you don't want to lug that thing all over the airport.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YUPPIE_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The agent leans back and issues a bothered sigh. He looks to his right to check the progress of the BLACK AGENT, who is waiting on an old Asian woman.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACK_AGENT>
<DIRECTION>
(RUSHED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you pack your bags yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACK_AGENT>

The Asian woman obviously did not understand a word of the question but she smiles and nods along.

</ASIAN_WOMAN>
<BLACK_AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No sweat. Keep it moving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACK_AGENT>
<DIRECTION>
The Asian woman is not going anywhere. The black agent leans into her face and barks once like a dog. Her smile turns to fear as she backs away, ending the race in a dead tie.
</DIRECTION>
<BOTH_AGENTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOTH_AGENTS>
<DIRECTION>
Reverse to show the woman they were competing for. She is a classy, sophisticated, blonde around thirty. Drop dead beautiful. She is startled by the sudden call from both men. She laughs off her little scare and then randomly chooses the black agent. He shoots a smug victory grin over to his co- worker, who is being an overtly sore loser.

</STAINER>
<DIRECTION>
Stainer takes the guitar out and starts riffing on it as the bins and bags pile up before him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At Kirk's station, Molly (the blonde bombshell) is crossing through. Every guy who can see her has been struck dumb but Kirk banters with her like he would anyone else. No flirting or stammering - just friendly and relaxed.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning.

Molly's long legs carry her toward the gates as every man except Kirk watches. Fuller saunters up and nudges Kirk.

MARNIE (the plain woman) stands and takes Kirk aside.

INT. AIRPLANE 737
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly is sitting in a window seat. The flight is mostly empty. The two other seats in her row are unoccupied until a CREEPY BUSINESSMAN moves from the row behind her to the seat next to Molly. He casually smiles as though there is nothing odd about taking the center seat while the aisle seat (and many full rows) are open. Molly looks at the vacant seats and then at him as if to say, "You've got to be kidding."

Kirk comes in and stops at the bar to order a beer. Two men are waving to him from a table near the stage. Kirk gets his bottle and snakes through the crowd toward his friends.

On stage, Stainer (in his afro wig) plays guitar as his band finishes the last chorus of "Lovin', Touchin' Squeezin'."

Kirk's cell phone rings. He has to talk loud over the music.

	Kirk, I'm sorry about what happened with us. You're going to make someone very happy someday, but you have to get over me first, okay? Is it a deal?

Marnie hugs him again and then departs.

	Entrepreneur? Kirk, I know that guy. He owns a Pizza Hut.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So? That's a business.

</KIRK>
<STAINER>

	That's defeatist thinking.

	You're saying you don't want to go to the moon? That's bullshit.

The game has started. Kirk, Stainer, Molly and Patty are cheering. The puck smacks the glass before them and another player skates up for it. As he mucks it from the edge, he looks up and sees Molly. He's distracted just long enough to get brutally checked face first into the glass. A penalty is called on the player who hit him. That player skates into the penalty box near Molly. The name on his jersey reads, "REESE." He speaks with a thick Canadian accent.

It's Friday night and several college parties are raging in the complex. Kirk leads Molly up the stairs and down the balcony hall toward his door.

Molly walks around and examines certain items. Kirk quietly hides a framed picture of Marnie. Molly passes his computer desk where she coos at a screensaver of baby polar bears. Just as she passes it, she bumps the mouse and the computer comes to life, revealing a "Hot Back-Door Asians" website. Molly didn't see it and Kirk scrambles to turn off the monitor. She turns to see what he's doing. He smiles. She moves on to a rack of DVDs.

Molly brushes his hair back with her hand. Kirk is frozen with fear. Molly leans in. Kirk also leans in but not too far. Molly smiles, realizing that it's up to her to make this official. She takes him by the collar, reels him in and kisses him. They make out for a moment. Kirk is near panic but he does his best to keep it together.

Kirk opens the fridge and thrusts his pelvis in. He takes a few deep, calming breaths. He closes the fridge - still at full alert. Kirk searches the kitchen, his panic building.

Kirk runs the water while he digs under the sink. He finds duct tape. He pulls some tape off the roll. It makes a loud noise that causes Molly to pause and Kirk to tense up. Kirk opens his pants and begins taping down the trouble-spot. He coughs hard to cover each subsequent tug of the tape roll.

They walk to the door. Molly leans in and they kiss a few moments more. Kirk winces as the tape is getting a little snug. She drops her keys and then goes down on one knee to retrieve them. Suddenly she starts coughing. She puts her fist over her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk's POV: As her head and fist bob in front of his crotch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk winces again. She hears the tape start to give way. She looks up, slightly confused. Kirk looks around as though he's looking for the source of the sound. Molly stands.

INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk lies in bed staring at the ceiling fan. The smile continues as he drifts off to sleep. Time lapses as Kirk sleeps and the sun comes up. Still smiling, his eyes open like a shot and he reaches for his phone - "No Missed Calls."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE OVER MUSIC:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1) Kirk gets up and goes into the bathroom. He checks his gut and hairline in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
2) From under his bed, he pulls out a Total Gym still in the box. It is dusty, unopened and has a ribbon still attached along with a card that reads, "Happy Graduation - Love Mom and Dad." He sits in the living room bewildered as he reads the directions. The parts are spread out all over the floor. He works out on the machine but it soon violently collapses underneath him. He checks his phone. "No Missed Calls."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
3) He throws away unhealthy snacks and treats from the cupboards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens an untouched box of Healthy Bran and fills a bowl. He watches cartoons as he heaps sugar on the healthy cereal and then checks his phone. "No Missed Calls."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
3) He surfs the web. He reads info on the Hair Club For Men site. He moves to Hot_or_Not.com. The first woman is very pretty. He rates her a seven, the next is also pretty and gets another seven, the next girl is very unattractive. Her score is three. Kirk feels bad for her and rates her a ten. He checks his phone. He moves on to "BackDoorAsians.com."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
4) Kirk watches a Connery James Bond movie on TV. The lower third reads, "AMC's 24 Hours of Bond." No Missed Calls. The sun is setting and Bond is now Roger Moore - No Missed Calls. Kirk digs a box of Ding Dongs out of the trash and eats them as he watches. It's dark outside and Kirk is in bed watching Timothy Dalton - No Missed Calls. The morning light is creeping in as Pierce Brosnan does the driving and Kirk is still awake looking devastated - No Missed Calls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
5) Kirk is at a convenience store buying milk. He is a mess - tired, unshaven, wearing a frumpy sweatsuit. He passes the magazine rack and something catches his eye. It's a gorgeous picture of Molly on the cover of Phoenix Entrepreneur Magazine. Kirk holds up the magazine and then catches his own reflection in a mirror on a sunglasses rack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
6) Kirk is walking home. Every street sign, billboard and T- shirt he sees reads, "NO MISSED CALLS."

INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands in the shower sulking. He hears the phone ring in the next room. He jumps out, grabs a small towel and starts to dry off as he runs into the bedroom. He reaches the charger base but the phone is not there. He stands and listens hard to the ringing. He runs into the living room. Angle on the phone. It's hiding under a pillow on the couch. In the background, Kirk rushes around the room flipping up papers and magazines. The phone keeps ringing and Kirk's panic increases until he finally spots the phone. Kirk dives for it, losing his towel in the process.

Kirk and Stainer come out of a record store and walk past the shops and restaurants. Kirk holds a stack of flyers for Stainer's band. As they walk, Kirk hands flyers to Stainer who posts them on walls and kiosks with a staple hammer.

<STAINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kirk, it's a simple rule of life. Look around. People are pretty evenly matched.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAINER>

Kirk and Stainer look at the couples that stand at the bus stop, sit in the outdoor cafes and walk down the sidewalk. Each couple is fairly closely matched - pretty with pretty, ugly with ugly, heavy with heavy, fit with fit.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but Stainer, she was the one who asked me out. So, why...

<STAINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just count yourself lucky. You got to kiss a goddess and you got out before she recalibrated your hardware. A chick like that can raise the bar too high and then once she dumps you, nobody else measures up.

<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you're right. You know what - it's good. It's better. I'm actually relieved. You should have seen this Talon guy. Man! All I've been thinking about is having to be naked in front of her. I don't need that kind of pressure.

The valet pulls a red Ferrari up to the mismatched couple and the nerdy guy opens the door for her. Stainer shakes his head as if to say, "Was there even a doubt?"

The phone rings again. Kirk glances down at the phone. Stainer keeps a stern eye on Kirk. RING! Close on Kirk's eyes turning weak. RING! Close on Stainer's threatening eyes. RING! Kirk gives up and looks away. Stainer's eyes calm. Kirk snatches the phone but Stainer grabs Kirk's wrist, pinning it to the table. RING!

The evening light is a bit dimmer as they give Noodle back to Mr. Riley. Kirk turns toward his parents' house. Now there's a car parked in the driveway and a jacked-up, knobby- tired pick-up parked out front.

	Hmmm. Honestly, I don't really do a lot of weddings. I specialize more in fund-raisers, corporate events, that kind of thing. Right now I'm working on the annual benefit for the Children's Cancer Center.

Kirk splashes water on his face and then looks for a towel but can't find one. He's forced to use his sleeve. He is a wreck. He takes a deep breath and steps out into...

MONTAGE OVER LOUD CATCHY TUNE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1) Kirk and Molly walk arm in arm through the air show crowd. Kirk's POV as every guy that passes checks her out. Close on Kirk's proud expression. The Blue Angels take flight. Close on the planes as they weave in and out of an intricate formation. A wider shot reveals that their jet trails spell out "MOLLY" inside a heart. Reverse to pan across Molly (worried about Kirk's reaction), Kirk (trying not betray his insecurity) and Stainer (trying to hold back his laughter.)
</DIRECTION>

2) Kirk and Molly in a crowded movie theatre. She squeezes his hand and he smiles back at her. Molly turns back to the screen and Kirk's smile quickly degrades into a dirty look. The shot widens to reveal who Kirk is glaring at - another man (also with a date) sits on Molly's opposite side and stares down at her cleavage. The man looks up to meet Kirk's gaze and smiles back. He offers Kirk a fist-tap behind Molly's head. Annoyed, Kirk doesn't tap back. Molly is oblivious to this exchange.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
3) As Molly walks down a city sidewalk at night, Kirk has stopped to tie his shoe. When he trots after her to catch up, he is tackled by two cops.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice try pervert!
	</DIALOGUE>

Molly spins around, horrified.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay ma'am. This fat tub of shit was following you but we got him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DIRECTION>
Molly angrily grabs Kirk by the arm and frees him from the cop's grasp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
4) Kirk, in his TSA uniform, addresses a group of patients at the Children's Cancer Center. He demonstrates a metal detector wand. Molly sits with the kids who look bored out of their minds. Suddenly, the kids light up and Kirk feels he's making an impression until he realizes that Talon has come up behind him. Talon is dressed in his flight suit and carrying an arm-load of toy jets. The kids excitedly jump up and gather 'round Talon; some even hug him.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dressed up and wearing party hats, Kirk, Stainer, Devon, Jack and about thirty others stand in a small, classy restaurant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is decorated with balloons and streamers. A huge banner reads, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY KATIE!"
</DIRECTION>
<STAINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seriously, what's with the banner? She's blind, right? Seems like they could have saved a few bucks there.

Patty runs in.

</STAINER>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>

They hide. Molly leads her sister, KATIE, into the restaurant. "Surprise!" Molly hugs Katie.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (to Stainer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still think she's Al Qaeda?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>

Stainer brushes off the comment. Molly waves Kirk over.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Katie, I'd like you to meet Kirk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<KATIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's so nice to meet you, I've heard great things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATIE>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, thank you. Molly raves about her big sister non-stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<KATIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATIE>
<DIRECTION>
Katie reaches out to feel Kirk's face. She's a bit perplexed by the result. Two blind teenaged boys approach.
</DIRECTION>
<BLIND_TEEN>

<KATIE>

</KATIE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's nice to meet you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
They each feel Molly's face and then start elbowing one another like a couple of horny construction workers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cake is brought in as everyone sings an unrecognizable but uncopyrighted birthday song. Katie blows out her candles.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your wish, Katie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<KATIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish Kirk would play the piano for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk's face drops. Molly kisses her sister on the forehead as she has obviously coached the response. Immediately Patty is behind Kirk, pushing him. Kirk tries to politely decline but now Katie has him by the hand and is leading him to the piano bench. Everyone applauds and cheers for him to play.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really. I can barely play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<KATIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Kirk! For my birthday?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk is sweating. He reaches for the keys but he is now white as a ghost. Molly watches in suspense, rethinking what she's done. Kirk's hands shake. He moves them around, hunting for a place to begin. The party-goers stare and the room gets quiet. Kirk puts his hand over his mouth as though he might vomit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly presses play on a CD player behind the bar. Suddenly, a Cheap Trick song kicks in over the restaurant's sound system. Katie jumps up to dance with her friends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk gets up from the piano and tries to laugh it off. Talon appears behind him and puts a hand on his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<TALON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay Kirk. You'll rock us next time right chief?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALON>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hey Talon. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<TALON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you're here. I feel terrible about our little misunderstanding. I don't know what had me thinking you were a gay fella. Molly tells me you two have been seeing each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALON>
<DIRECTION>
Patty passes between them and gives Talon a dirty look.
</DIRECTION>
<TALON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's got every right. I'd hate me too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(THEN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to congratulate you, Poncho. You're the better man. Now, I'll step aside and truly wish you the best of luck. I wouldn't wish losing that girl on my worst foe. But, make no mistake, you blow it and I'll be waiting in wings. Love and war, right chief?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALON>
<DIRECTION>
Talon gives Kirk a respectful military salute. Kirk holds his forced confidence until Talon departs. Once alone, Kirk's poise deflates and he plops down into a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The party goes on and Katie opens a small present.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, it's a DVD.

<STAINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? It's closed captioned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAINER>

Patty and Kirk are sitting and talking at a table that is away from the group. Across the room, Talon raises a glass to them. Patty gives Talon the finger.

	Okay.

	</DIALOGUE>
</PATTY>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<PATTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not a big deal but she's really self-conscious about it. Talon and some other guys she's dated have been weirded out and made her feel like a freak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATTY>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<PATTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's better if she tells you but if you can't deal with it, just get lost now and don't put her through that heartbreak again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATTY>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. I wouldn't do that.

Patty heads off to get some cake. Kirk sits, considering this information. He looks at Molly. She is wearing a small black dress. She looks perfect in every way. Kirk crosses the room and walks out to the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RESTAURANT FRONT SIDEWALK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He throws his hands up in the air and does a happy dance similar to the one he had done after their first kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stainer, Devon and Jack are around the corner as Stainer and Jack are smoking a bowl. Devon hears Kirk's celebration and peers around the corner. He waves the others over. The guys come around the front to join Kirk.

	Ahhhh No.

</DEVON>

	Sure, I get it. She needs a good guy like Kirky 'cause the guys she dates can't handle it, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAINER>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It sent Talon packing.
	</DIALOGUE>

Kirk and Stainer high five. Jack and Devon look disturbed.

<DEVON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what's wrong with her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEVON>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know yet. Patty just said she had a physical issue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DEVON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well that could be anything. Did she say it was a birth defect?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEVON>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She said it was, "something like a birth defect."

	What if it's something really bad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KIRK>

	I hope it is. I hope it's something that would make most guys run screaming. It won't matter to me. I love her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's cool that you love her but it's pretty fucked up to be rooting for a harsh deformity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DEVON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, wow. What if this is Patty's way of telling you that Molly is a man?

INT. RESTAURANT - LATER

Kirk and Molly are cleaning up after the party. Kirk is relaxed and in a fantastic mood. Patty gets her coat and hugs Molly before exiting. Molly sheepishly approaches Kirk.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>

	Kirk, I'm so sorry about the piano thing. It was stupid of me.

Kirk opens a bottle of wine. He pours one glass to share.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They sit on the couch talking. Kirk is on! He is confident and silly and Molly is eating it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are making out passionately on the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly stands and extends her hand to Kirk. Kirk stands and his boner is impossible to miss. This time he looks down at it as if to say, "How 'bout them apples!?" Molly laughs and leads him into the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk sits on the bed and Molly goes into the bathroom. He lights a candle. He is now in a normal state of nervousness but nothing like he had been before. He pulls out a stick of gum. He chews it quickly and spits it out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk lies down and then sits up and then repeats this. He decides to sit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly opens the door. She is wearing sexy ligerie and slippers. She looks perfect. She crosses to the bed and sits down next to Kirk. They kiss but Molly stops.
