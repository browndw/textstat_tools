<DIRECTION>
We're watching a pair of hands arrange white sugar packets, blue Equal packets, and pink Sweet and Low into small containers. With precision and lightning speed, the mixed up colors and crumpled packets are transformed into neat little color-coded rows. Wait, this container has three Equals and four Sweet 'n' lows. The hand quickly plucks the mutant Sweet 'n' Low. There. Symmetry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move up those hands and meet SAM DAWSON as he surveys his domain. Something about him. He's extremely compelling, uniquely handsome. But it's more than that. Those eyes, they sparkle with the wonder of a child. Life's cynical edge has not etched it's path across this face. They light on a COFFEE CUP held by one of the Regulars.

REBECCA is in the middle of a major contraction. Her face is the opposite of Sam's. Hardened. She lets out a scream that stops Sam dead in his tracks. GERTIE, a no-nonsense Black Nurse, looks up from the monitor.

EXT. HOSPITAL - NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam, holding the baby, and Becca, having just checked out, walk down the steps of the hospital holding their complimentary plastic baby bag. Sam is nervous haling the precious cargo and Becca is agitated. They see the bus pulling up and down the street and Sam moves quickly so they can hurry and catch it. As he approaches the bus, he looks to Becca by his side, but she is not there. He looks around and no sign of her. Frantically turning in a full circle, he sees the fabric of her dress disappearing into the crowd down the street. He screams.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>

	Becca! Becca!

The more he screams the faster she moves away. Till there's no trace of her. Sam stands in the middle of the busy block holding Lucy to his chest, devastated.

Sam holds the now sleeping baby to his chest. Next to him is the plastic bag from the hospital containing diapers, two cans of formula and a half empty bottle of milk. Sam is surrounded by PASSENGERS, the eerie world of the underground at night. Instinctively, Sam holds her even tighter, two against the world.
</DIRECTION>

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A marvel of organization. A closet reveals clothes on hangers exactly equidistant from each other; precisely folded T-shirts, underwear and socks organized by color. A carefully systemized record collection fills makeshift bookshelves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beatles posters from every era decorate the walls. Becca's things sit in one corner. An island of chaos in an "Hold Everything" showroom. The kitchen counter has been transformed into a changing table. Bottles and pacifiers lined up next to a stack of cloth diapers. Underneath, a clothes line of baby clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of a CRYING BABY breaks the silence. The camera follows and finds the CRADLE: a DRAWER tucked snugly into a blanket hanging like a hammock between two chairs. An exhausted SAM POPS up from his bed, behind the hammock. He swings the hammock, hoping against hope the baby will go back to sleep.

Peace. A punch-drunk Sam lays the sleeping baby into the cradle as if she were a bomb that might detonate. He tiptoes, his FIST raised victoriously - "YES!" He doesn't get two steps before Lucy wakes screaming. Defeated, he picks her up. HELP. The PHONE RINGS. HE PRESSES speaker.

Lucy sits in Annie's lap, getting her first piano lesson. WE SEE LUCY'S TINY FINGERS on the keys. In a SERIES OF DISSOLVES, it is joined by Annie's hand tapping out one note, now two notes, and as the weeks pass, a chord. Until finally the notes merge to become the most unlikely duet of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star".

Balloons and a banner reading "Happy Birthday, Lucy!"

RITA HARRISON and her assistant burst in. Rita moves in opposite circles around the room. Looking for something. In fact, as we watch Rita, we realize that she never stops moving. Period. Ten steps ahead of anyone, too much energy, too much caffeine, not enough food. If she slowed down a beat she might get vulnerable. Can't have that. Can't be wrong. Can't really look you in the eye. Can't help it if she's smarter than anyone else in the room. Any room. Any time.

EXT. CHILD AND FAMILY PROTECTIVE SERVICES - HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam, broken, walks down the long hallway with Rita toward Margaret Brown's office. Suddenly, Rita stops as she and Sam both see -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUCY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting, hopeful on the bench. She searches Sam's face for the verdict. The minute she sees sorrow in his eyes, she knows. She runs to him, gluing herself to his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No Daddy! No Daddy! No Daddy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
In a SERIES OF WORDLESS DISSOLVES, they hold each other in the hallway through the entire forty five minute visit. The only thing moving is the hands of a large wall clock in the background. Pained, Margaret reaches for Lucy.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET_BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Lucy. It's time to say goodbye.

<MARGARET_BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please help me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET_BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
Rita, aching from a place she thought she buried long ago, shakes her head, NO. Now, Margaret literally has to wrench Lucy away from her father's arms. Lucy bellowing as she pulls her down the hallway. Sam is frozen in incalculable pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear "Fool on the Hill". We follow a trail of PINK LIQUID melting down the hall and come to Annie's door where a pile of grocery bags and newspapers sit in a PUDDLE OF STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM. Suddenly, the needle SCRAPES LOUDLY across the record, followed by a mysterious POUNDING against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA MOVES to the WINDOW. Inside, the lights are dim. Lucy's HAMMOCK SWINGS EMPTY, ghostlike. Sam, curled into a ball in Lucy's bare corner, bangs his head over and over again against the wall, overcome with grief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DANNY'S ROOM - RITA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The POUNDING CONTINUES as we see Rita standing in the doorway, watching her sleeping child. This stranger that she's raised. She moves to cover him, this tough little boy, when she sees POOH BEAR tucked under his arm. She tucks them both in, tenderly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DAY

Saturday in idyllic suburbia. Sam, directions and a map in his hands, tentatively rounds the corner. A small bouquet of flowers in his hands when he stops - STARING AHEAD AT --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lucy looking absolutely radiant in a new spring dress. She stands on the front porch with RANDY, who wears a red smock and is setting up TWO EASELS AND PAINTS. There's a tiny chair for Lucy and a tiny chair for her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON LUCY AND RANDY

BACK TO SAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From where he stands, all he sees is Lucy getting everything she deserves. He looks down at the tiny bouquet in his hand - feeling profoundly inadequate, he reaches for some flowers from a garden he's passing. Puts them in his bouquet. Then stops. Feels guilty. Tries to put the flowers BACK. He stares up at Lucy on the porch a few houses away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lucy sits on the steps. Randy sits right next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK ON SAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where he WAS standing, but is now GONE. The flowers lay in the dirt. From the porch, Lucy looks out and waits. And waits. And waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STARBUCKS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Saturday. The place is buzzing. Sam listlessly cleans the tables, without the usual energy and verve. A TODDLER marches around a table, playing under the adoring gaze of his parents.

As Randy reaches for her, Lucy pours black paint on her.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lucy sits in a ball on the corner of the porch. Her eyes swollen from crying. Finally, she gets up and moves to the tiny chair that Randy put out for her. Straightens the easel and begins to paint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front door opens and Randy comes out having washed her face and hair. Without speaking, Randy straightens her easel and sits down next to Lucy and begins to paint. Randy and Lucy paint in silence for a long time. Then -
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to send me away now, aren't you?

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - EVENING

We see SAM sitting at Lucy's miniature toy piano as he plays with one finger. IN A SERIES OF DISSOLVES, as DAYS and WEEKS PASS, we see SAM'S HANDS at the PIANO -

<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With Lucy and Randy's hands as they PAINT side by side to Sam's sad melody. Lucy's pictures start ANGRY, angular with blacks and blues, then GRADUALLY soften and the dark figures recede. By the END, there is a BRUSHSTROKE of the red of Randy's smock peeking into the corner of Lucy's picture.

We come back to Sam, having withdrawn completely into himself serenading no one.

INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>

We see Lucy and Randy sitting on her bed unwrapping the birthday presents. TIME HAS PASSED. They look close, almost like a mother and daughter. Lucy finishes unwrapping Sam's present and we see a stack of ONE HUNDRED DENNY'S NAPKINS.
</DIRECTION>

Lucy half-smiles and unconsciously begins to fold one of the Denny's napkins into an origami bird. Then crushes it. Then cautiously:

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - WEEKS LATER - DAY

Sam sits in a dark corner; maniacally folding newspaper into an odd origami pattern. There's a knock at the door - Sam doesn't move, he just continues folding his paper.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Rita bursts through the door and then stops. Sam has created an origami wall of newspapers, intricately woven together. A fortress against the world. He keeps folding - doesn't even look at Rita. He's more far gone than she could imagine, she walks gingerly to the wall and knocks gently on it.

People like me have perfect husbands screwing someone far more perfect than me and my son, my son hates me, I try too hard and I push and he knows it and I talk in that voice, that voice I promised I'd never use, and I've screamed, I've screamed horrible things to him, a five year-old because he doesn't want to get in the car at the end of a day and he stares at me with such anger and I hate him then. I know I'm failing you, I know I'm disappointing you, I know you deserve better but get in the fucking car! It's like every morning I wake up and fail, and I look around and anybody, anybody can pull it off, but somehow I can't. And I know, I know I have everything, and I'm still miserable and it's pathetic. I know it's pathetic. No matter how hard I try, something about me will never be enough.

He looks her straight in the eye - she's undone by the intimacy of the moment, by the strength of his purity. And staring into his eyes, she begins to sob, walls crumbling. He kisses her elbow, her shoulder, her forehead, her eyes, her tears. And something ignites between them - something confused and scary and deep and filled with a passionate ache.

EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

Randy kisses Lucy goodbye as she heads toward school. We follow Lucy - suddenly a BIRD SAILS THROUGH THE SKY and LANDS IN FRONT OF LUCY. It's an ORIGAMI BIRD. She looks around - but doesn't see Sam anywhere. But she feels him. She walks toward school, clutching the bird, past a tree and we move up that tree and see Sam nestled in the branches. There. They made contact.

INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - 2 A.M.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lucy lies in her hammock, unable to sleep. Staring at the little origami bird on her window sill. She moves it, opens the window wide, quickly takes Mr. Jeeters - and within a moment she's out the window and onto the limb of the tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAIN THOROUGHFARE - NIGHT

"The night grows teeth..." stray dogs fight over garbage - a wino talks to himself and in the midst of it all walks Lucy in her pj's. Mr. Jeeters tucked under her arm. Lucy crosses the street. HONK! the screeching of tires...

<DIRECTION>
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>

We're looking at an old fashioned fire escape when suddenly we make out a figure climbing higher and higher. It's Lucy. We catch glimpses of her and then lose her as the neon sign across the street blinks on and off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam's asleep. Suddenly his eyes open wide. And like an animal sensing danger, he gets up. We HEAR THE SOUND of something THUMPING AGAINST RUNG AFTER RUNG OF THE FIRE ESCAPE. He rushes to his window and looks to see --

Until FINALLY, we see Lucy in her hammock at Randy's house looking out the windows, which have now been completely covered with BARS. Her room is filled with origami birds from the 100 Denny's napkins, her birthday gift. Lucy gets out of her hammock and tiptoes across her room - quietly opening the door.
