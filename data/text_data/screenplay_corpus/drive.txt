INT. CAR ENGINE - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're close on a maze of metal rods, tubes, and wires. It's only as we pull out that we realize it's the engine of a car. Over the image we hear a voice talking on a phone.

</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
DRIVER hangs up the phone. He folds his map of LA and slips it in his duffel bag. A few clothes and other essentials are neatly packed inside. He zips the bag shut and takes one last look at a cheap TV set. On screen, a movie is playing. On a radio, the LA Clippers are taking a pounding from the New York Knicks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT/ APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver strides through a dimly lit car park, carrying his duffel bag. A YOUNG COUPLE emerge from their car after a late night out. Driver lowers his eyes, avoiding their gaze as he makes his way towards a sleek 1970's Chevelle
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ALVARADO - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Clippers-Knicks game plays on the car radio now. Driver is only half listening, focused on the road. We see his face in the passing neon lights. Feline good looks. Impassive blue eyes. Something almost melancholy in his unwavering gaze. He drives carefully, letting other cars overtake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver glides into the parking lot of another low-rent apartment block.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clutching his duffel bag Driver heads towards the car park elevator. Hurrying out in the opposite direction he sees a pretty GIRL in her 20's wearing a waitress outfit. Their eyes meet briefly, before Driver walks on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver heads down the hallway and unlocks the door to his new apartment. It's not all that different from his last one. Clean, sparse, and anonymous. He doesn't even bother to walk in. He tosses his duffel bag inside and locks the door again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver's back on the road, the basketball game still playing on the radio. He drives past a row of brightly lit Mexican food shacks on Silver Lake Boulevard and turns into a run down garage lit up with a neon sign - Shannon's Picture Car Warehouse - vintage cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHANNON, the owner of the garage, has a distinctive limp. Driver follows him past rows of vintage cars.

Driver casts his eyes over the unimpressive vehicle then holds out his hand for the keys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. SILVER IMPALA/ TOY DISTRICT/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The basketball game is approaching the end of the third quarter. Driver's behind the wheel of the Impala now, cruising past rows of dingy toy stores on 3rd Street. He glances at his watch. It's 9:50. He checks his mirror then turns into a side street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. IMPALA/ ELECTRONICS SUPERSTORE/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vast electronics superstore dominates the deserted street. Under the pale yellow glow of the street lamps, Driver sees signs advertising a `huge blow out weekend sale'. He pulls over, making sure he has a good view of the entrance. On the radio, the basketball commentator is getting more excited.
</DIRECTION>
<BASKETBALL_COMMENTARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...This is some comeback from the Clippers! Only a few minutes ago they looked dead and buried!...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASKETBALL_COMMENTARY>

Driver reaches under the seat and pulls out a small handheld scanner. He switches it on, tuning it to the right frequency. Crackling police dispatches are interspersed with the basketball commentary now.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BASKETBALL_COMMENTARY>
<DIRECTION>
Out of the corner of his eye Driver sees two MEN approach. He doesn't react, expecting them. They cut through the fence with bolt cutters and approach the main building. Driver watches them pull on their masks, then one of them takes out a shotgun and blasts the lock to the front door. Instantly the alarm shrills. The only thing Driver does is to turn on his stop watch.
</DIRECTION>
<BASKETBALL_COMMENTARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Time out Knicks...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASKETBALL_COMMENTARY>
<DIRECTION>
The stop watching keeps ticking away, the siren blaring, the commentary continuing, the police scanner crackling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The storefront is hidden in shadow, impossible to tell what's going on inside. Driver looks at his stop watch. Almost three minutes. One of the masked men emerges now, carrying a duffel bag. He hurries over and gets in the back of Driver's car without a word. There's no sign of the other robber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The commentary continues, so does the crackling on the police scanner. Four minutes. Still no sign of the second armed robber. His companion in the back starts to look nervous, wondering what's happened to his partner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver doesn't betray a hint of nerves. Four and half minutes on his stop watch. Thirty seconds more and he's on his way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the second robber appears from the shadows, running as fast as he can to the getaway car. He jumps into the back seat a few seconds short of five minutes and Driver screeches off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/ EXT. SILVER IMPALA/ STREETS/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver thunders over the 1st Street bridge towards Boyle Heights, then eases his foot off the gas, slowing to a steady speed. In the back seat the two armed robbers rip off their masks, looking pumped up with adrenalin. Driver studies them in his rear view mirror, then swerves right on Mission Street as his police scanner crackles to life.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_SCANNER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	...Airships dispatched...Downtown and Boyle Heights...All units standby. Repeat, all units standby...

</POLICE_SCANNER>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead, the lights of Downtown L.A. glitter against the night sky. Hovering between the neon green glow of the skyscrapers Driver sees the red and white glint of a police helicopter. He switches off his headlights, turning left on Santa Fe Avenue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. IMPALA/ALLEYWAYS/INDUSTRIAL AREA/DOWNTOWN - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The armed robbers watch in tense silence as Driver weaves in and out of the industrial alleyways with his lights switched off. It's as if he's trying to find his way out of the maze or probing to see if there's anyone out there.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_SCANNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...1 Baker 11, headed south on Boyle Avenue...No sign of suspects...Repeat, no sign of suspects...
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICE_SCANNER>
<DIRECTION>
The armed robbers look relieved when suddenly a police car glides past at the end of the alleyway, its lights also off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's like catching a glimpse of a passing shark's fin. Driver taps the brakes gently, his car sliding to a stop. He stays there a moment, then eases the Impala forward, turning in the same direction as the black-and-white.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. IMPALA/ LA RIVER INDUSTRIAL AREA/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a high-risk strategy but Driver follows the black-and-white at a distance, hidden in the darkness, knowing other squad cars won't be checking the same route. The police car makes its way through the dimly lit industrial zone, unaware it's being shadowed. Driver turns his car radio up a whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<BASKETBALL_COMMENTARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...And for the first time in the game the Clippers have the lead. 71 to 69. Seven to go in the Fourth here at the Staples Centre...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASKETBALL_COMMENTARY>
<DIRECTION>
Driver turns the sound back down. Up ahead, the police car swings left, disappearing from view. Driver slows down too, anticipating the next obstacle. He doesn't have long to wait. In the distance he suddenly sees the piercing beam of a police chopper's search-lights, sweeping the area one more time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver floors the gas, speeding straight towards the approaching helicopter. The armed robbers are too stunned to protest. They just sit there, watching the sweeping searchlights getting closer and closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then suddenly it becomes clear what Driver's doing. Up ahead, there's a small underpass below the 7th Street bridge. Driver slides the car under the safety of the bridge just before the chopper's searchlights spot them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. IMPALA/ UNDERPASS/ LA RIVER INDUSTRIAL AREA - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The roar of the helicopter thunders overhead. The underpass is crammed with dirty mattresses and shopping carts. Sleeping HOBOS can be seen under dirty blankets. Driver waits for the echo of the helicopter to fade, then moves forward again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. IMPALA/ OLYMPIC BOULEVARD/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gloomy yellow street-lamps shine down on the industrial zone. Rows of delivery trucks are parked outside the meat-packing factories. Driver cruises cautiously down the deserted street. The crackling of the police scanner and the droning of the basketball commentary add to the tension. Finally up ahead he sees car-lights streaming back and forth on Broadway.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get down...

<DIRECTION>
The armed robbers lie flat on the back seat, paying Driver more respect now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. IMPALA/ BROADWAY/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a steady flow of traffic on Broadway. Driver falls in behind the other cars. On the radio, the basketball game is still playing.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	...Three thirteen left on the clock. Dunleavy calls a time out and it's the Clippers by one...

</DIRECTION>
<BASKETBALL_COMMENTARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Buckle up your seat belts Clippers fans. This game really is too close to call...
	</DIALOGUE>

The two cars pass each other slowly. Driver sees the cops in the Black-and-White peering at the Impala as they head past. He turns down the basketball game and focuses on the scanner.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_SCANNER>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT/ EXT. IMPALA/ WEST PICO BOULEVARD/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT.

Driver bursts out onto Pico now. A squad car headed in the opposite direction slows down as it sees him but is caught up in the flow of traffic, unable to turn round and give chase.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_SCANNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...1 David 11...suspect headed West on Pico...

</POLICE_SCANNER>
<DIRECTION>
Driver threads his way through the vehicles in front of him, so smooth and effortless it's hard to tell how fast he's going. He glances up as he hears the dull rumble of a police chopper overhead. The helicopter is almost directly above him, swinging its search-beam back and forth to get a lock on his position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver pushes the car as fast as it will go, but there's no way of outrunning the chopper. Blue light floods the asphalt around him as he guns down Figueroa.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. IMPALA/ STAPLES CENTRE PARKING LOT - NIGHT.

The Impala screeches from one level to the next. With a game going on, the parking lot is almost full. Finally Driver pulls into a free parking space.

	<DIALOGUE>
	...What a remarkable comeback...Outplayed for most of the game, the Clippers have shown incredible resilience...

Driver glances at the armed robbers and nods. It's time. They climb out of the car, merging in with the crowd. Driver watches them disappear, then slips on a Clippers cap, climbs out of the Impala himself and heads towards another car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STAPLES CENTRE/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>

Outside the parking lot, the police are waiting, stopping anything that looks like an Impala, shining their flashlights into the windows. Wearing his Clippers cap and a Clippers sticker on his new car, Driver calmly drives past them, making his getaway.

EXT. FILM SET/ SAN PEDRO/ LOS ANGELES - DAY.

<DIRECTION>
Driver's face is fixed ahead, sunglasses hiding his eyes. As we PULL OUT we see to our surprise that he's wearing a policeman's uniform. It's only as we pull out further that we see several other `POLICE OFFICERS' sitting in the same fold up chairs, reading car magazines and scripts as they're powdered by MAKE-UP GIRLS, and realize we're on a movie set.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver glances up from his script and sees another STUNTMAN being fitted with an SFX mask. The stuntman now looks identical to the STAR of the movie who stands nearby.

Driver floors the gas, screeching out of the alleyway. He swerves between several oil drums then straightens up on the main road.

<DIRECTION>
In his rear view mirror he sees a black Dodge Charger appear on cue, bearing down on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver slows to forty, like he's supposed to, but the black Charger keeps coming at speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver's eyes stay fixed on his rear view mirror, judging the other car's speed and angle of approach to perfection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Charger slams into the back of Driver's car at sixty miles an hour, hitting him just above the left rear wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver's reactions are quick as lightning, counter-steering as his Black-and-White goes careening off the road. He keeps the car upright long enough to slow it down before it finally flips end over end.

INT. ELEVATOR/ APARTMENT BLOCK/ ECHO PARK - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver stands in the elevator as it climbs slowly. It reaches the ground floor then the doors slide open. Driver finds himself face to face with the pretty girl he saw the other night. She looks a little startled to see him, then recovers

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Which floor, ma'am?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fourth please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Driver presses the fourth floor button even though it's already lit. The doors shut and the elevator starts to climb. Driver stares out quietly. Irene takes a glance at him, feeling awkward in the silence. She looks relieved as the elevator doors finally open. Driver steps aside to let her out first.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver and Irene walk down the corridor in the same direction, only a few feet apart. She seems more aware of his presence than he is of hers. She reaches the door to her apartment first.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>

	Goodbye...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DRIVER>

EXT. SAUGUS SPEEDWAY - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bright sunlight. In the distance we see a trail of dust moving across the flatland. Everything is silent, then slowly the hum of an engine rises as the stock car turns towards us. It shimmers in the heat waves, the noise of its engine getting louder as it picks up speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shannon stands with his friend Bernie Rose at the edge of the makeshift track, staring at the glittering car with its colorful signage advertising everything from Snickers to Cheerios.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like a chocolate bar. You're gonna have to tell me if that's fast or slow `cause I got no idea...

<DIRECTION>
INT. RACE CAR/ SAUGUS SPEEDWAY - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even in the cramped space of the roll cage there's something effortless about the way Driver controls the car. His eyes are fixed in concentration, his body tensing only slightly as he lifts his foot off the gas and turns the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAUGUS SPEEDWAY - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The glinting vehicle is lost in a cloud of dust, then reappears again, moving even faster now. The STOCK CAR'S OWNER, a bearded hot-rodder with a t-shirt that says, "Drive it like you stole it", joins Shannon with a confident smile.
</DIRECTION>
<STOCK_CAR_OWNER>

Bernie Rose pays no attention to their banter, his eyes fixed thoughtfully on the stock car as it finally slows to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RACE CAR/ SAUGUS SPEEDWAY - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver climbs out of the car. As he looks up he sees Shannon limping over with the stock car's owner, a couple of MECHANICS, and Bernie Rose.
</DIRECTION>
<SHANNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks a little long in the tooth to me. Think we should take her home?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANNON>
<DIRECTION>
Driver shrugs. Shannon grins, turning to Bernie now.
</DIRECTION>
<SHANNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bernie, this is the driver I been telling you about...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANNON>
<DIRECTION>
One look at Bernie Rose and Driver senses the power and authority behind his deceptively gentle eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SHANNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bernie's thinking of investing in our race team...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANNON>
<DIRECTION>
The old mobster holds out his hand, meeting Driver's gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My hands are a little dirty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. So are mine...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
He gives Driver a big grin and a warm handshake, sizing him up. Driver smiles politely, gazing back at him. The stock car's owner interrupts the moment between them, holding a stopwatch.
</DIRECTION>
<STOCK_CAR_OWNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Couldn't see much wrong with that. You beat the fastest lap by more than half a second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOCK_CAR_OWNER>
<DRIVER>

Bernie's still studying him.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You too...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes stay on each other, then Driver follows the stock car owner and his mechanics back to the car. Bernie Rose stares after him quietly, thinking to himself. Shannon can feel he's getting interested.
</DIRECTION>
<SHANNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gonna give me the four?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANNON>
<BERNIE_ROSE>

<DIRECTION>
INT. SUPERMARKET/ ECHO PARK - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tinny supermarket music plays in the background. Driver walks past the vast selection of instant coffee brands, bemused by the choice. Suddenly he notices something out of the corner of his eye. At the far end of the aisle his pretty neighbor, Irene, is browsing through the confectionery section. Standing next to her is a young boy of six or seven, (BENICIO). He grabs a multi-pack of snickers and puts it in Irene's shopping basket. Irene calmly picks it out, replaces it on the shelf, and takes a single snicker bar for him instead. As Driver watches them, the boy turns around and notices him. Driver heads down another aisle before Irene sees him too, keeping to himself to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAR PARK/ SUPERMARKET - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver heads out of the supermarket with a small bag of groceries when he spots Irene and Benicio again in the car park. Irene sits in a battered Oldsmobile, trying to start the engine. She tries several times then gets out in frustration, opening the hood and peering at the engine she has no idea how to fix. Benicio peers in too, trying to be helpful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver hesitates, all his instincts telling him to continue to his car and drive away, but as he feels Irene's increasing frustration he can't help himself, finally heading over to help.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene looks over and sees him coming, surprised at first, then smiling. We watch from a distance as they talk now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR/ APARTMENT BLOCK/ ECHO PARK - DAY.

Driver, Irene and Benicio stand in silence in the elevator, Driver clutching some of Irene's grocery bags.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<IRENE>

She pours him a glass of water and hands it to him.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me a second...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
She walks out of the room, leaving Driver alone with Benicio. The little boy stares at him fixedly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM/ IRENE'S APARTMENT - DAY.

<DIRECTION>
Irene closes the bathroom door behind her, looking at herself in the mirror, feeling a little uncertain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benicio's still staring at Driver. Feeling a little awkward, Driver takes a long piece of string from his pocket, tugs it gently, then holds up two pieces of string.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benicio keeps staring at him, puzzled by the magic trick. Irene walks back into the room, smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just move to LA?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DRIVER>
<IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
(A gentle smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too many questions, huh?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Driver smiles back awkwardly, not sure how else to respond. Irene switches on the TV for Benicio, sitting him down on the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver has a sip of water, glancing around the room. He notices a few photographs on a side table. Most of them are of Benicio and Irene, but one of them shows the little boy standing next to a strikingly handsome Latino man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene turns around and sees him looking at the picture.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Benicio's father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Driver takes in the significance of this, then looks back at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's he do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's in jail.

<DIRECTION>
He nods, a little embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't that dangerous?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
He seems thrown by her concern.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>

Irene takes the remote and changes the channel for him. Driver watches her quietly, then drains his glass of water.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like another glass?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>

He catches the disappointment in her eyes, but she covers it with another good humored smile.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, thank you for your help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>

EXT/INT. STREET/ DRIVER'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Passing traffic roars by on the busy street. Irene and Benicio are walking home from the bus stop, chatting happily. They look like they've just come back from the beach, Irene carrying a basket full of towels, Benicio clutching a dusty soccer ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver watches them from the window of his apartment, blowing gently on a cup of coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The reflection of passing neon rolls down the Camaro's windscreen. Driver's cruising down Hollywood Boulevard, shut off from the world outside, listening to `Purple Rain'. The HOOKERS and HIPSTERS have taken over the streets while up above airbrushed movie stars stare down from their lofty billboards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT/ MINI MALL - MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's early morning and Driver's been driving all night, unable to sleep. He heads across the parking lot towards a garishly lit mini-mall. Up ahead a small group of GANGBANGERS are hanging out with intent. They see him coming and look over intimidatingly. Driver's only reaction is to bunch his car keys in his hand, the longest key sliding between his second and third fingers like a weapon. The gangbangers don't see it but the unflinching look in his eyes unnerves them and they look away, letting him pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

	You're Shannon's buddy, right? We met last year. You drove me and my brother back from Palm Springs...

	Next run we hired another wheelman - I spent six months in jail, my brother got himself killed...

Driver looks up quietly, fixing him with his icy gaze. The Redneck's smile slowly fades. He considers his response for a moment, then decides against it, standing up.
</DIRECTION>
<BEARDED_REDNECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's good to see you again...

</DIRECTION>
<SHANNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds like a goddamn M-16...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANNON>

Driver smiles, popping the hood. As Shannon limps out of the vehicle he sees a battered Oldsmobile drive into the forecourt. He takes one look at the owner, then runs his hand through his white hair, breaking into a friendly smile.

<SHANNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what seems to be the problem, ma'am?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANNON>

EXT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - DAY.

	That would be great...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
She glances round and sees Benicio standing in the forecourt with Driver, watching him work on his own car now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver's so busy tuning the engine he hardly notices the boy. His lack of interest finally gets a rise out of Benicio.

He stares back at her in the silence, both of them looking a little uncertain.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry if I put you on the spot, you know, just showing up like that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes stay on each other, the attraction palpable. Driver finally breaks the tension, making a tentative move towards the door. Irene opens it for him, looking up into his eyes. Driver knows he could kiss her, wants to, but something inside holds him back. Instead he just offers his help.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need a ride anywhere over the weekend I'm not doing much...

Benicio sits in a dentist's chair, looking nervous. Irene sits beside him, mimicking his expression, trying to make him relax.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DENTISTS/ NORTH HOLLYWOOD - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene emerges with Benicio from the dentists. The little boy is clutching his mouth, making a show of being in pain. Irene teases him gently as they walk. Driver waits for them in his car, watching them quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ECHO PARK - SUNSET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soft rock plays on the car radio. Irene sits in the passenger seat with a smile. Driver looks at her curiously as he drives, no idea why she's grinning. Benicio suddenly leans forward and changes the radio to a different station -- hard rock blaring out. Driver lets it go for a moment, then changes it back. Benicio responds, until it becomes a game, Irene laughing now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The roar of machinery. We see quick shots of Driver's day in the garage -- fixing cars, taking out some fruit he's left to ripen in his tool box for lunch, working on more engines and frames. At the end of the day Driver and Shannon examine the stock car.
</DIRECTION>
<SHANNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I still can't believe I bought this piece of shit...

He grins, looking at Driver.

<SHANNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought maybe we'd take her for a run Thursday or Friday.

<DRIVER>

INT. LIVING ROOM/ IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the TV, a Japanese cartoon is playing, a masked hero confronting the villains, the screen flickering from color to black and white. Driver and Benicio sit on the couch, watching the cartoon. From their relaxed body language it's clear some time has passed and they know each other a little better.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's happening now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<BENICIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's telling him if he doesn't leave the earth alone he'll fight him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENICIO>

Irene calls out from her bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm almost ready...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Driver looks back at the screen. Werewolves appear now, surrounding the hero.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like he's in trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<BENICIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENICIO>
<DIRECTION>
Just as the fight begins the color on the TV screen flickers.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna show you another trick...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Benicio watches curiously as Driver gets off the couch and kneels beside the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is pretty complicated. You watching?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Benicio nods. Driver suddenly gives the TV set a hard smack and the interference stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think you can remember that?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Benicio grins. Driver smiles back then looks away as he hears the phone ring. Irene walks out of her bedroom, dressed in her waitress's uniform, and answers it.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?...Yes?...Yes, this is she...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Driver sees the look of surprise on Irene's face as she listens to the voice on the other end. The doorbell suddenly rings. Irene catches Driver's eye and asks him to open it. He heads over, checks the spy-hole, then opens the door. A YOUNG WOMAN who's sitting for Benicio walks in, looking at Driver curiously.
</DIRECTION>

Irene's friend heads past Driver and scolds Benicio affectionately.

	It's 8:30. Teeth. Pyjamas. TV off.

Driver looks back at Irene now. She puts down the phone, forcing a smile but still looking distracted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene sits next to Driver in the passenger seat, staring out of the window at the glittering fountain in Echo Park.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never come this way before...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a short cut...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The park looks pretty at night...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at Driver, watching him quietly, then looks away again.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Irene takes a long time to answer, still staring out of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was my husband's lawyer on the phone. He's getting an early release...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to sound casual. Driver takes the news quietly, even though it hits him like a sledgehammer.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's great...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm happy for Benicio...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Driver knows she's trying to explain herself but doesn't say anything, driving in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead the traffic lights turn red and the car slows to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, the silence is unbearable. Irene pauses, then looks at Driver. He's even more handsome in the shadowy half-light, something achingly lonely and melancholy about his stillness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hesitates, then moves her hand towards his, brushing the back of his hand, then slipping her fingers between his.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gesture is tiny but charged with emotion. They both stare out in silence, fingers clasped, then Irene gently withdraws her hand, as if nothing's happened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside the lights change to green.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - SUNSET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of laughter. A sign over the door says, Welcome home Dad. Inside the apartment there's a small party going on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene's husband, STANDARD, has been released from jail and his FRIENDS and FAMILY are here to celebrate. Holding Benicio in his arms he makes a thank you speech to his guests.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'm touched and grateful that you're all here today -- even though I know it's probably for the food not me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
His self-deprecating humor gets a chorus of laughter and agreement from the guests. Irene is standing next to her friend Cindy, looking a little uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Anyhow, now that I've completed my MBA in catering from Chino Business School...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(MORE LAUGHTER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Irene, Benicio and I are finally going to get our lives back together...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his glass to her.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to thank my wife for being the smartest, most beautiful, most patient and loyal woman I know...

More applause. Irene stares back at Standard's handsome face, feeling even more uncomfortable.

Driver lies on his bed, gazing up at the ceiling, listening to the sound of the party echoing down the corridor.

It's nighttime and the party's getting louder. Standard's on the phone to someone, trying to hear them over the music.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, I can't hear you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
He heads into the bedroom to take the call. The voice on the other end is accented and unfriendly.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
((ON THE PHONE))
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you hear me now, you cunt?
	</DIALOGUE>

	Sure.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gonna come see me tomorrow, you understand?...

<DIRECTION>
Across the crowded room, Irene is looking for Standard. She sees him in the bedroom, switching off his phone, and heads over.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Benicio wants you to put him to bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
He gives her a warm smile.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who was that on the phone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My parole officer. He thinks he may have found me a job.

The noise of the party is finally too much for Driver. He gets off the bed and slips on his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT/ CORRIDOR/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene is finding the party overwhelming too. She heads out into the corridor to have a cigarette when she sees Driver across the hallway, locking the door to his own apartment. She hesitates, then calls out.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns around and sees her standing there with a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry about the noise. I was going to leave a note under your door warning you we were having a party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. I won't complain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish you would. Maybe the cops'd show up and send everybody home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes stay on each other, the music pounding in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The car works great by the way. Hasn't stalled once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Another awkward silence, so much she wants to say but can't.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, if you're hungry we got plenty of
	</DIALOGUE>
<FOOD>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly she turns around as she hears her apartment door open. Standard stands there with Benicio, holding a bag of trash. He pauses, then smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought if we emptied the trash everyone would get the message and go home...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
He grins at his wife, then looks over at Driver, his smile hiding whatever he feels inside.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the new neighbor, right? Benicio's told me all about you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Driver seems unsure how to respond.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a great kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't take any of the credit. He's got a great mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Standard rests his hand gently on Benicio's head, still staring at Driver.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He tells me you drive for the movies?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must be pretty good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I get by.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not like a nine to five gig, huh?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
He's still smiling but there's a slight edge to his voice. Irene looks uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to take that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes are still fixed on Driver.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to come in, join us for a drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got some things to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At this hour of night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Standard, he's busy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Standard doesn't respond, still holding Driver's gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if we're still going by the time you're back you know where we are. It's good to meet you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
He slips his arm around his son now and continues down the corridor, brushing past Driver on his way to empty the trash. Driver looks at Irene, then heads off in the same direction as Standard and Benicio to take the elevator. The two men stand there in charged silence, one emptying the trash, the other waiting for the elevator, only Benicio oblivious to the tension.

Standard, Irene and Benicio are having dinner at a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant. We still sense the distance between Standard and Irene, but Benicio seems completely unaware of it, talking excitedly as he eats his pizza. Standard reaches out and takes Irene's hand gently as he listens to his son.

INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVER LAKE BOULEVARD - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A noise of hammering and drills. The corporate signage has been scraped off the race car and the seats ripped out. Bernie Rose has bought his partner Nino to the garage to take a look at his investment.
</DIRECTION>
<NINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...We paid three hundred fucking grand for this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINO>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I paid for it. Out of my own pocket. Anyway, that's just the shell. You start with the shell, then you build the frame, then the motor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Pointing to an engine nearby)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I paid three hundred for that. The money goes on the inside not the outside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE_ROSE>
<NINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck that. If I'm gonna blow three hundred I wanna make sure everyone can see it. Go waste your money on something else...

Shannon smiles nervously, worried Nino's going to sabotage his deal with Bernie.

	You buy it. Shannon sell him the car...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE_ROSE>

At the far end of the garage Driver hears them laughing, too busy working on his car to pay any attention. Shannon opens the door of the Thunderbird and invites Nino to take a seat.
</DIRECTION>
<SHANNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try her out. She's more comfortable than a water bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANNON>
<NINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I already got a fucking water bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINO>
<DIRECTION>
He sits heavily in the car and starts prodding and pressing all the control buttons as if he wants to break them.
</DIRECTION>
<NINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does this fucking thing do?

</NINO>
<SHANNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Windshield wipers.

	How about this little clit? I don't know whether to fuck it or drive it. Fuck it, I'll drive it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINO>
<DIRECTION>
Bernie Rose shakes his head at his partner's foul language then looks away, observing Driver quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver applies a blow torch to his car, so absorbed in his work he doesn't hear Bernie Rose approach.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How you doing?...

Driver hears him and turns off the blow torch, standing up respectfully. Bernie Rose gives him a friendly smile.

</DRIVER>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gonna be ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
There's something gently challenging in his gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope so...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cautious man. Like myself. Don't wanna make promises you can't keep...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Driver smiles but doesn't respond. Bernie Rose finds him as hard to talk to as everyone else. Across the garage, Nino sits in the T-Bird with Shannon, still fucking with him. Bernie watches them.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He ever tell you how we met?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Driver shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did some producing back in the 80's. Interesting pictures. Kind of European. Shannon arranged the cars for us and did all the stunts. I knew he was overcharging me but I loved having him around. His next business venture he tried the same thing with some of Nino's friends they broke his spine. He never had much luck...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
He's about to continue when they're interrupted by a familiar voice.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Driver turns around and sees Irene's husband, Standard, heading towards him with a confident smile.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a minute? I want to -
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're talking...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Bernie Rose barely raises his voice but it's full of quiet menace and authority. Standard pauses, stung, but instinctively senses this is someone you don't mess with.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll wait outside...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Bernie Rose watches him leave with a look of contempt, then turns back to Driver with a smile, resuming their conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The reason I'm telling you this is because he's got a lot invested in you. So do I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes stay on each other with just a hint of tension.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything you need just let me know...

Driver nods. Bernie Rose studies him a moment, then finally walks away.

Driver joins Standard in the forecourt of the garage, the midday sun blazing down on them.

</STANDARD>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about it.

</DRIVER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do worry. I like to pay my debts.

Driver senses the quiet pride in his voice, and lets it go.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call it fifty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Standard counts out some bills from his tattered wallet, his eyes lowered.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was thinking of trading her in for a new car. Something fast and cheap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't have both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright then, fast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Even though he smiles Driver senses just a hint of tension on his handsome face.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
(Pointing to a car)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something like that Buick over there'll cost you nine grand but there isn't much point in a city where you can't drive faster than sixty five.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Standard considers the car a moment, something clearly bothering him, then looks back at Driver.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must think I'm an asshole?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Driver isn't sure what he's getting at.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't know.

</DRIVER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I am. Six months inside for holding somebody else's stolen shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles ironically, his gaze still fixed on Driver.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I appreciate what you did for my family when I was away but I don't plan to fuck up a second time...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
It's a thinly veiled message that he's back and here to stay. Driver stares back at him when Shannon emerges from the garage with Bernie Rose and Nino, calling out.
</DIRECTION>
<SHANNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, kid! Come say goodbye, the money people are leaving!...
	</DIALOGUE>

Driver and Standard stare at each other a moment longer then Driver breaks off.

<DIRECTION>
Passing traffic blurs past. Through the windows of a Mexican restaurant we see Irene at work, serving tables in her waitress's uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver's parked across the street, watching her from his car. He hesitates, conflicted, then finally gets out of the car.
</DIRECTION>

Irene walks out of the kitchen with a tray of food, then stops as she sees Driver sitting at a booth. She looks surprised to see him, but pleased, serving her table first then heading over.

Their eyes stay on each other, oblivious to the noise.

<IRENE>

	We haven't seen you around in a while. You must have been pretty busy?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DRIVER>

She smiles, glancing at the tables she's supposed to serve.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can I get you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I already ate. I just wanted to see how you were?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
His concern touches her and makes her uncomfortable at the same time.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're okay. Standard thinks he may have found a job so I can give up my night shift...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Driver stares back at her with his intense gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Benicio misses you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
From the way she says it she could almost be talking about herself.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He keeps asking me to invite you for dinner...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
His gentle gaze is finally too much for her. She grins, excusing herself.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I better serve some food...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
It's only when she has her back turned that we see how hard this is for her. Driver watches her walk away, lost in thought.

<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN/ MEXICAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT.

Irene piles some plates of tacos on her tray, bracing herself to go back out and face Driver -- but when she finally walks out again he's no longer there.

Driver leans out of his car window and inserts a key to open the gates of the underground car park.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ UNDERGROUND CAR PARK - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Driver descends into the darkness of the car park, he sees a group of SHADOWY FIGURES walking in the opposite direction, heading up the ramp, one of them being pushed in a wheelchair. Their leader, a large, balding man, (COOK), glances in Driver's direction then looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver cruises past the mysterious group and winds his way further down the car park. Suddenly he notices something else in the shadows. A figure lies sprawled against one of the pillars. A smaller figure kneels a few feet away. Driver stops his car now, climbing out to see what's happened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The prone figure groans in pain. As Driver approaches he realizes it's Standard. His face is covered in blood and he clutches his ribs. The smaller figure is Benicio. He stares at his father helplessly, then looks up at Driver in tears. Driver kneels beside Standard, checking nothing's broken.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>

</STANDARD>
<DRIVER>

Driver glances at Benicio. He looks terrified. Standard raises his head painfully and looks at his son.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, Benicio. I'm okay...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Driver watches the boy struggling to hold back his tears.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't say anything to your mother, you understand? This is between you and me.

Benicio nods, too choked-up to speak. Standard turns to Driver.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standard is bent over the sink, splashing water on his face. As he turns off the tap he notices how neatly Driver's laid out his toothbrush, shaving cream, and razor. He finally turns around and looks at Driver.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. Sorry about getting all this blood everywhere...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
He's still shaken but tries to pass it off with a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking punks took me by surprise...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Driver watches him, unconvinced.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking punks didn't look like they needed to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Standard looks at him in surprise now.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You saw them, huh?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Driver doesn't answer, waiting for him to continue. Standard hesitates, still not sure whether to trust him.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ever been inside?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

Standard takes another glance at the items laid out neatly by the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I owed some protection money in the joint.

Driver begins to see how worried he is.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They want twenty thousand. I told them I couldn't pay so they want me to do a job for them...

</STANDARD>
<DRIVER>

Standard stares back at him.

	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't.

</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, then he finally opens up.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a pawn shop in the valley. I tried to back out tonight, they said they'd come after Irene and Benicio next time...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Driver stares at him in surprise now, more concerned than he shows.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you take them away?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where would I go? Irene finds out I fucked up again I'll lose everything...

He sounds upset, angry with himself.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This lousy job's my only way out...

Driver stares at his battered face and the blood stains on his t- shirt, then walks out of the bathroom to check on Benicio.

Benicio is watching a baseball game on TV, his back to Driver.

<DIRECTION>
The little boy nods without turning round, still frightened by his ordeal.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want something to drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Benicio shakes his head, trying to hide his tears. Driver heads over, then stops as he notices something in Benicio's hand. The little boy is clutching it as if he's afraid to let go.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have you got there?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Benicio holds out his hand to reveal a small bullet. Driver stares at it, then looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who gave you that?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<BENICIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of those men. He told me not to lose it...

</DIRECTION>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got you to do this fucking job for me, why do I need to pay someone else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOK>
<DIRECTION>
Standard sits next to Driver, holding his ground even though he's clearly intimidated by the Albanian.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll pay him out of what's left of my share. I can't do something like this on my own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>

He grins, looking at Driver now. Blanche doesn't even seem to hear them, hung-over from the previous night.
</DIRECTION>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look like you're hard to work with?

</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>

Blanche gets up from the table before Cook can respond.

Standard looks worried, trying to diffuse the tension.
</DIRECTION>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what does he mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOK>
<DIRECTION>
Driver looks him calmly in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You tell me where we start, where we're headed, where we'll be going afterwards. I don't take part, I don't carry weapons, I drive...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Standard seems surprised by Driver's professional patter. So does Cook. Even Blanche looks interested for once.
</DIRECTION>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Standard, get Blanche her coca cola.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOK>
<DIRECTION>
Standard hesitates, but has no choice. As he leaves to fetch Blanche her drink, Cook starts to write something down on the palm of his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, here's the deal. This much for Blanche, this much for that asshole minus what he owes me, and this much for you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOK>
<DIRECTION>
He holds up the palm of his hand to Driver, the words Fuck Off written in marker pen.
</DIRECTION>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You still interested?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOK>
<DIRECTION>
Driver looks at him, all his instincts telling him to walk away, but he stays where he is, thinking of Irene and Benicio.
</DIRECTION>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Anything else?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOK>
<DIRECTION>
Driver stares back at him with his clear blue eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We do this job he's paid his debt. You leave him and his family alone...

Driver sits at the dinner table with Standard, Irene and Benicio now. Standard's in high spirits, beaming at his wife.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I was such a jerk the first time we met. We're at this party and I see the most beautiful girl I ever laid eyes on and I walk over and say, `Hello Miss, my name's Standard Guzman'. She takes one look at me and asks, `Where's the deluxe version?'...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(HE LAUGHS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It took me like a minute to get it...

</STANDARD>

Irene smiles awkwardly, glancing at Driver. Benicio grins, eager to please his dad.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't get it either do you, Benicio? Hope you didn't inherit your Papa's brains.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
He ruffles his son's hair then pours himself another shot of tequila. Irene notices he's drinking, turning to Driver.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like some more chicken?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes stay on each as she serves him. Standard sees the look between them but his only reaction is to drain his glass and tuck into his food.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now this is what I call a deluxe chicken. Irene and I are gonna open a restaurant together once I raise the money. That's why she's working in that Mexican joint. Figure out how it's done. She's got more ambition than anyone I know, more smarts too...

Irene looks at Standard as he pours himself another drink.

</IRENE>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, we're celebrating. I've got my family around me and our new friend...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his glass to Driver now. Driver senses how nervous he is about the job ahead, and how uncomfortable he is depending on someone his wife clearly admires.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>

Irene stops and looks at him in surprise.

His quiet confidence concerns her even more.

<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Standard gets up from the table, lifting Benicio up in his arms and carrying him back to his bedroom. Driver watches them. Even in this kind of mood Standard's clearly devoted to his son. Irene waits until they're gone, then turns back to Driver.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>

She hesitates, torn, then looks up at him again, needing to confide in someone.

<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every time he makes that speech about taking me and Benicio away from here he's in some kind of trouble...

Driver sees the deep concern in her eyes and feels even more torn. Irene gets up, clearing away some plates.

Driver strides through the parking lot and climbs in his car.

Driver sits in the car as if it's his retreat from the world. He stares out, then turns on a stop watch, listening to it tick, finding his balance again in the familiarity of the ritual.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PAWN SHOP/ TARAZANA/ LA - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pawn shop is nothing much to look at from the outside, another anonymous LA store front. Driver's parked the car a hundred yards from the entrance, his police scanner crackling. Standard sits beside him in the passenger seat, looking tense.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
(Forcing a smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to make light of it but doesn't sound convincing. Out of his window he sees Blanche cross the street and enter the pawn shop and looks even more nervous now.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Irene and Benicio think the world of you, you know that, right?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Driver glances at him, sensing his anxiety.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say something happens to me, you think you could find a way to take care of them?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Standard's still staring ahead, but Driver can sense his fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not too late...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Standard considers a moment, then shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta do this for them...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
He forces a smile, slips on his sunglasses, then finally opens the door.

</DRIVER>
<STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see you in four...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Driver watches him cross the street with a strong sense of foreboding. Standard enters the pawn shop. Driver starts his stopwatch now, listening to the seconds tick away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He casts his eyes around the street, observing the smallest details -- the number plates of other vehicles; the windows of overlooking buildings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The white hot sun blazes down, reflecting on the pawn shop windows, hiding everything inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The police scanner crackles but picks up no activity. Driver listens to his stop watch, in his own world. He starts the engine and sets off, cruising slowly past the pawn shop, heading for the corner where he told Standard he'd be waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls over by the curb when suddenly he notices something. Parked a hundred yards down the road he sees another vehicle glinting in the sunlight. To the ordinary eye it's no different from the other cars parked nearby, but to Driver it stands out. For one, it's a Chrysler. Secondly, it has reinforced bumpers and racing tires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver's stopwatch shows four minutes now. He looks away from the Chrysler, gazing at the doors of the pawn shop, expecting Standard and Blanche to burst out at any moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But there's no sign of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The seconds tick away. Five minutes. Driver hesitates, all his instincts telling him to drive off, but he stays where he is, thinking of Irene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he sees Standard and Blanche emerge from the pawn shop, Standard clutching a big black gym bag in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles at Driver as he approaches when suddenly he hears the crack of gunshots behind him. Driver sees the look of panic on his face as he spins around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GUY IN A SUIT strides out of the pawn shop. Crouching low in an expert firing position he squeezes off several shots. The force of the bullets sends Standard flying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver sees him hit the sidewalk, arterial blood pumping from his neck. Blanche screams, grabbing the gym bag and leaping into the back seat of the car. Driver hesitates, takes one last look at Standard's lifeless body, then hits the gas as more gunshots crack behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Driver's car roars down the street, the Chrysler suddenly comes to life, pulling out of its parking place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/ EXT. CAR/ STREET/ TARZANA/ LA - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver glances in his rear-view mirror and sees the Chrysler on his tail. It doesn't seem to be trying to close the gap, just following at a discreet distance. In the back seat, Blanche zips open the gym bag, then stares in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<BLANCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Christ, there wasn't supposed to be this much money!...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLANCHE>
<DIRECTION>
There are literally stacks of hundred dollar bills crammed inside the gym bag. Driver catches her reaction in the mirror, but his attention is focussed on the Chrysler. Up ahead, at an intersection, the lights turn red. Driver thinks about running them, but decides against it, braking sharply. The Chrysler draws up beside him, its windows glinting in the sunlight.
</DIRECTION>
<BLANCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Move for Chrissakes!...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLANCHE>
<DIRECTION>
Driver ignores her, still watching the Chrysler out of the corner of his eye. The lights change to green but Driver doesn't move. Nor does the Chrysler. Behind them, other cars start honking their horns. Suddenly Driver roars off, swerving left at speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chrysler reacts, screeching off in pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver floors the gas. On speed and power his vehicle may be no match for the Chrysler, but in traffic the odds are even. He weaves his way past the slower cars, putting obstacles between himself and the Chrysler. The pursuing car matches him move for move, staying on his tail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the back seat, Blanche looks terrified, buckling herself in.

<DIRECTION>
Driver swerves left then suddenly makes a hard right onto a deserted canyon road. The mustang somehow manages to make the same turn. It gets close enough to "pit" Driver, its nose pressing against the rear corner of Driver's vehicle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver's almost run off the road, but manages to save it and regains control of his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mustang pulls out wide to build momentum and smash into him. As it moves in to deliver the knockout blow, Driver pulls the Emergency Brake and spins 180 degrees, causing the Mustang to miss and lose control for a brief moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the two cars are nose to nose, barrelling down the road, Driver heading in reverse as fast as he can, the Mustang closing fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It rams Driver's front bumper. BAM! The two cars separated for an instant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mustang guns it, ready to smash into Driver again...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver clocks an upcoming three way intersection dotted with construction equipment. In a last ditch attempt to evade his pursuer he throws a reverse 180, then incredibly keeps going, spinning 270 degrees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mustang tries to make the same turn, but this time the maneuver is beyond his ability. Driver's suckered him into a corner he can't control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mustang crashes into the construction equipment in a sickening crunch of metal on metal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver guns the motor and speeds away.

The black gym bag lies open on a double bed, full to the brim with stacks of cash. Blanche sits on the bed, looking pale.

</DRIVER>
<BLANCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</BLANCHE>
<DIRECTION>
She glances at the bag, staring at how much more money there is. Driver switches on the cheap TV set with the remote, flicking through the news channels. There's no mention of the robbery yet. He zips up the bag and heads out.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay here. Don't answer the door...

Blanche nods, too shaken to protest.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A soap opera plays on the TV. Driver walks back into the motel room. Blanche lies on the bed, looking more relaxed. Driver picks up the remote and flicks through the channels until he finally finds a breaking news story on the robbery. There is a police mug-shot of Standard on screen.
</DIRECTION>
<TV_REPORT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...The armed robber was pronounced dead at the scene. He was identified as Standard Guzman of Echo Park, Los Angeles...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TV_REPORT>
<DIRECTION>
Driver listens to the report in silence. Blanche seems upset again, confronted with the reality of what's happened.
</DIRECTION>
<TV_REPORT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Other details are unclear but the owner of the pawn shop told reporters that the robber had no accomplices and that the items he'd taken had been recovered. In other news...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TV_REPORT>
<DIRECTION>
Driver switches off the TV, staring at the blank screen in surprise. He turns to Blanche.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The guy saw you grab the money and jump in the car -- why didn't he say anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<BLANCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BLANCHE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any idea there'd be another car waiting?

This time she takes a fraction too long to answer.
</DIRECTION>
<BLANCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I already told you everything -
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLANCHE>
<DIRECTION>
Driver suddenly slaps her -- hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just got a little kid's father killed. You think I won't hurt you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his hand to slap her again and this time she talks, tears welling in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<BLANCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Cook told me another car would hold us up...but he never said anything about this much money or anyone getting killed...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLANCHE>
<DIRECTION>
Driver stares at her quietly, beginning to put the pieces together in his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were gonna rip us off and split the take?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
She nods guiltily.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long have you known him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<BLANCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a couple months. We were fooling around. I've never been mixed up in anything like this -
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLANCHE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know his real name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<BLANCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He told me it was Chris, but I just called him Cook.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLANCHE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to take me to him right now, you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
She nods, terrified, tears running down her face.
</DIRECTION>
<BLANCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	....Can I go wash up?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLANCHE>
<DIRECTION>
Driver nods distractedly, his mind racing. Blanche heads over to the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she disappears inside Driver notices something on the bed where she's just been lying. It's her cell phone. Still flipped open as if she's called someone recently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver reaches for the cell phone when he notices the silhouette of a MAN crossing the curtains. Someone's outside. The door handle of the motel room starts to turn, slowly -- then suddenly there's the roar of a shotgun from the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver reacts in an instant, rushing towards the bathroom door. He has to barge it open, something obstructing his way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM/ MOTEL ROOM - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver almost trips over Blanche's sprawled body as he bursts through. One quick glance and he knows she's dead - half her head blown off. Another quick glance and he sees her killer, a big burly HITMAN, trying to climb through the same bathroom window where he just shot her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver moves like lightning, grabbing the man's arms before he can get off another shot and pulling him through the window. The hitman lands heavily in a sea of broken glass, cutting his forehead open, blinded momentarily by the blood in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver takes his opportunity and slams the man's face back into the glass strewn floor, stunning him for a few more seconds as they struggle. Crawling away, he grabs the towel rack and pulls the metal bar off the wall. Using it as a spear he impales the hitman and grabs his shotgun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the bedroom, the 2nd HITMAN finally kicks the door open. Driver bursts through the bathroom door at the same time -- firing the 1st shooter's shotgun. The force of the blast picks up the 2nd hitman and flings him against the wall like a rag doll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The startling explosion of violence is over just as suddenly as it began. Driver slumps to the floor in exhaustion, his hand and his arm ripped open by the broken glass. There's blood splatter all over the wall. Neon lights from outside flashing on the dead man's face. But no panicked footsteps or sirens yet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver crawls over to the dead hitman and rifles through his pockets. All he finds are a set of car keys.
</DIRECTION>

An underworld doctor, "DOC", a shabbily dressed old man who looks well past his prime takes out a small bottle of scotch along with his surgical tools, preparing for Driver's arrival. Shannon watches him uncertainly then heads downstairs as he hears a noise in the garage.

Driver looks up at him warily from Shannon's pull out bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax. Just having my fun with you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
Doc picks up his bottle of scotch from among his bowls of Peroxide and Betadine, takes a drink, then offers it to Driver.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a hit off that. Chances are you'll need it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
Driver shakes his head, closing his eyes. Shannon watches him quietly, concerned for him but also curious about the money.

Sunlight pours through a doorway. Driver heads down some stairs, passing some half naked STRIPPERS at the bar. There's a handful of CLIENTS watching a pole dance, but otherwise the place is empty. Driver turns down a long corridor. A couple of STRIPPERS emerge from their changing room, surprised to see him, but he puts them at ease with a friendly smile.

He hears Cook striding impatiently towards the door now. He waits, then suddenly kicks the door open, right in Cook's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before Cook can recover, Driver storms into the office, smashing him across the shoulder with the hammer. Cook collapses in a heap. Driver's about to hit him again, when he sees that Cook's left hand is broken and there are cuts and bruises on his face. Someone's clearly given him a beating since the robbery.

</IRENE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes stay on her, as if he's trying to tell her something more. She looks confused, staring back at him curiously when a small voice interrupts.
</DIRECTION>
<BENICIO>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENICIO>
<DIRECTION>
Driver looks over at the little boy.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Irene begins to see the guilt in his eyes and slowly it hits her. She stares in disbelief, reeling.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry about your father...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Benicio nods. Driver keeps staring at the boy but can't find any more words of comfort. Irene watches him, still stunned. He looks back at her.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't talk now. I have to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I give you a ride?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at him in dismay, close to tears.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The car's working fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then let me walk you down...

She wants to say no but can't.

INT. CORRIDOR/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver and Irene head down the long corridor in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
(Almost a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Driver misunderstands, thinking she's talking about Standard.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was into one of the prison gangs for a lot of money. He was trying to protect you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great job...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
She walks faster now, striding towards the elevator. Driver follows her.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I still have the money. Whatever you need -
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
She turns around and slaps him hard.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you, a bank? I work for a living. I don't need your widow's pension!
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes well up with tears, staring at him in anger and frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just tell me one thing. How did he talk you into it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't talk me into anything. I've been doing this my whole life. It's what I do...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at him in deep disappointment.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stupid me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns away when the elevator bell rings. The doors open, revealing TAN SUIT. Neither Driver or Irene recognizes him but we do. He smiles, pretending to look confused.
</DIRECTION>
<TAN_SUIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, I'm supposed to be going down...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAN_SUIT>
<IRENE>

</IRENE>

She steps into the elevator. Driver follows her in.
</DIRECTION>

	Which floor?

Tan Suit presses the button and the doors slide shut.

INT. ELEVATOR/ APARTMENT BLOCK/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver and Irene ride down in silence, their eyes fixed on each other. Tan Suit watches them quietly, considering a move, but Driver glances at him and he smiles, biding his time. The lights on the panel descend. The elevator bell finally rings as they reach the lower level. Tan Suit hesitates, but Driver waits for him to go out first. He nods goodnight and heads off into the darkness of the parking lot. Driver follows Irene, the two of them heading in the opposite direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The overhead lights flicker, the huge underground car park hidden in shadow. Driver walks alongside Irene in silence. In the distance Tan Suit's footsteps slowly fade.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm leaving. I want you to come with me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Irene can't believe what she's hearing.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You and Benicio...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
She's almost too stunned to speak, walking even faster now.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're crazy. I don't even know you -
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will. Once I straighten out this thing I'm getting out for good. We'll go some place. Anywhere you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head, fighting her feelings for him.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't work like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
She stops and looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because people like you never get out. And I don't want my son to grow up like that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
She holds his gaze with regret. Driver's about to respond when suddenly he catches a fleeting movement out of the corner of his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat -- then he suddenly lunges -- grabbing Irene and pulling her to the ground. In the same instant Tan Suit appears out of the darkness, opening fire with his automatic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bullets spark as they hit the concrete floor and the other parked vehicles. Driver drags Irene behind a car now, covering her with his body as Tan Suit fires another burst.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More sparks light up the darkness, the bullets penetrating the car with ease, narrowly missing Driver and Irene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver moves again, dragging the terrified Irene behind him. Tan Suit loses sight of them in the darkness, striding past rows of parked cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver turns to Irene as they take cover behind a pillar. She looks terrified -- not just of Tan Suit but of him. It's as if all her worst fears have been confirmed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver stares back at her, then hears Tan Suit's footsteps approaching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He holds her gaze apologetically, then gets to his feet and runs, trying to draw Tan Suit's fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tan Suit hears him and opens up again, more bullets lighting up the darkness. Driver keeps moving. Tan Suit strides after him, reloading, when suddenly his gun jams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crouching behind another vehicle, Driver sees this and takes his chance, darting out after his pursuer. Tan Suit sees him coming and runs, the hunter becoming the hunted now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still lying on the ground, Irene listens to their echoing footsteps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver runs after Tan Suit through the darkness, gaining all the time. Tan Suit looks desperate now, tiring. He turns to face his pursuer but Driver's on him in a flash, hurling him against a car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tan Suit slams into the car, losing his balance. Driver grabs him, swinging him around, smashing him into another car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene's watching from the shadows, stunned by the violence. She picks herself up and runs towards the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver keeps slamming Tan Suit against the car, beating the resistance out of him. As his body begins to slump, Driver grabs him by the throat and rams his head into a car window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The glass splinters with blood, the force of the blow shattering Tan Suit's skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver looks around for Irene now and sees her standing in the elevator, framed against the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stares back at him, but makes no attempt to step out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver stands there, his hands covered in Tan Suit's blood. The elevator doors finally close, hiding Irene from view.

Shannon gets out of his car. Driver is waiting for him by his own car, silhouetted against the streetlight. Shannon stares at him a moment, then notices the blood stains on his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<SHANNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANNON>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nino's guys came after me. How did they know about Irene?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Shannon takes a moment to reply, looking dazed.
</DIRECTION>
<SHANNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I called Bernie...I asked if he could help. Him and Nino are like brothers. I told him you weren't interested in the money, that you only did it for the girl...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(From the heart)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted to make sure once you returned the money that was the end of it...

Driver doesn't seem to hear him.

</SHANNON>
<DRIVER>

</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Shannon says nothing now, knowing he's right.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're gonna come after you to find me. You have to leave...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Shannon takes this in slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<SHANNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you gonna do?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANNON>
<DIRECTION>
Driver doesn't answer, but from his silence Shannon can guess.
</DIRECTION>
<SHANNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How the fuck did this happen? We're supposed be in Charlotte or Daytona drinking champagne out of trophies and getting laid by pit lizards...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernie Rose looks quietly furious.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I already gave you my advice. You should have taken your money and left this guy alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Nino and Cook sit opposite him, both of Cook's hands broken now.
</DIRECTION>
<NINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not that simple, Bernie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINO>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not now that it's bounced up in your face.

He looks at Cook's broken hands.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sun's in my eyes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Nino doesn't look at Cook, a clear indication he should do as he's told. Cook stands up, humiliated, and walks over to the windows. Bernie Rose waits for Nino to explain.
</DIRECTION>
<NINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...The money belonged to a half assed wiseguy from Philly. I had a tip-off he was keeping a million in a pawn shop and was gonna invest it here in LA, try to run a rival operation. I wanted to teach him a lesson...

The lights in the restaurant gradually fade as Cook shuts the blinds.

	I stole from a jumped up punk who was gonna step on our business -
	</DIALOGUE>

	I don't give a fuck who gave him their blessing. This is my city -

	Your city? This is a big city, pal, and last time I checked we were partners! -

	Then why the fuck didn't you come to me before you set up your dummy robbery or hired this fucking amateur?!...

Cook sits back down at the table, having closed the blinds. Nino looks almost embarrassed for once.
</DIRECTION>
<NINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was off to the side, Bernie. I didn't wanna involve you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINO>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, now you fucked up I am involved. Anyone finds out you stole from the family they'll kill both of us -
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE_ROSE>
<NINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What family? These fucks still call me a kike to my face. I'm fifty nine years old, they pinch my cheek, treat me like a fuckin' kid. They're the reason we left New York in the first place. Decrepit old men waving us over to their dinner and domino tables to complain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINO>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those old men gave us the funds to move out here.

	And I made them a lotta money. I made you a lotta money too...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINO>

He stares at Bernie, genuinely indignant now.
</DIRECTION>
<NINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pay them half of everything I fucking earn and then they set up some fucking kid from Philadelphia just because he's a fucking wop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINO>

There's a hint of sympathy in Bernie's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The money always flows up, Izzy. You know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
He calls Nino by his childhood name now, emphasizing the fact that they're both outsiders in this organization. For the first time Nino's tough guy act slips and he looks anxious.
</DIRECTION>
<NINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why this driver has to go. Him, and maybe your friend Shannon, are the only two people who can tie me to the robbery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINO>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about this prick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE_ROSE>

He doesn't even bother to look at Cook.

The two friends stare at each other as if Cook didn't exist.

	I'm asking for your help. I shoulda' come to you first, Bernie. I know that. We're a team.

He stares at Bernie apologetically, appealing to their friendship.
</DIRECTION>
<NINO>

	I'll pay you back the three hundred you spent on the race car.

Cook hesitates, thinking Bernie's fucking with him for having two broken hands. He stares back dumbly and it's the final straw. Bernie suddenly grabs a stainless steel fork and rams it in his eye. As Cook screams, Bernie takes a knife and buries it in his neck. He twists the knife deeper for good measure, then with one powerful sweep of his arm clears Cook off the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cook's not dead yet, just writhing on the floor, choking on his own blood. Bernie Rose keeps his eyes fixed on Nino.

The CREW are setting up for their first shot of the day. In the background we see a DIRECTOR blocking out an action scene.

	<DIALOGUE>
	He tried to put it right.
	</DIALOGUE>

He stops, facing Shannon.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right now so am I. I don't take care of this I'm in big trouble...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE_ROSE>

He stares at his old friend.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any idea where he is?

</BERNIE_ROSE>
<SHANNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably across the border by now. Mexico. Belize. That's where I'd go...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANNON>

Bernie Rose smiles, not believing a word.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He just walked out on you after everything you've done for him, took all the money?

</BERNIE_ROSE>
<SHANNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's gratitude, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANNON>
<DIRECTION>
Bernie Rose can't help grinning, fond of Shannon despite everything.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ever tell you how long Izzy and I been friends? Since we were six. Only Jews in a neighborhood of wops. Long as I can remember he was getting me into trouble and I was getting him out of scrapes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks almost apologetic.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone else I'd take your side...

</BERNIE_ROSE>
<SHANNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone else I'd do the same...

</SHANNON>
<DIRECTION>
Bernie Rose watches him with a mixture of affection and regret.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this fucking kid to you anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Shannon shrugs, no idea himself.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I leave here without finding out where he is, there'll be others coming after me. I guarantee they'll be too stupid to figure out you won't talk and drag this out unnecessarily...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE_ROSE>
<SHANNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I'm glad you got here first...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANNON>
<DIRECTION>
Bernie Rose holds his gaze, then looks away, admiring the shiny stock car.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, it's too bad, I was getting excited about our race team, having my name all over the car. I think we could have made something of this business...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE_ROSE>
<SHANNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, I'd have fucked it up too...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANNON>
<DIRECTION>
Shannon smiles, reconciled with himself. Bernie Rose grins, and extends his hand. They shake hands firmly, like old friends, when suddenly Shannon recoils, as if he's been stung.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see now that his shirt sleeve is covered in blood, his vein cut all the way from his elbow to his wrist. He looks dazed, paralysed with shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernie Rose holds a razor knife in his hand, the blade wet with Shannon's blood. He takes Shannon gently by the arm and sits him down against the boot of the stock car.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't feel a thing. Close your eyes and you'll fall asleep...

There's something threatening in the old mobster's eyes now. The husband moves to close the door but Bernie jams it open with his elbow, shoves him aside, then looks over at the wife.

Sunlight glints on the parked vehicles by the curb. Driver slows down as he approaches the sign for Shannon's Custom Kings, glancing out of the window to see if anyone's staking out the garage. Satisfied there's no-one there, he drives through.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver pulls open the garage door and sees the rows of vintage cars shimmering in the shafts of sunlight. As he heads past the vehicles he suddenly spots a figure slumped against the stock car. Shannon's eyes have been closed, his head resting gently against the trunk of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver kneels down and lifts him up in his arms, holding him for a second, then lays him down on the floor. He turns back and opens the car boot now, revealing the black gym bag full of money.

<DIRECTION>
Nino stands in the kitchen, wearing a beautiful suit but no shoes or socks, listening on his cell phone. We hold on the curious image for a moment, then reveal a beautifully dressed WOMAN polishing his shoes. And now we see more of Nino's MEN, also smartly dressed and accompanied by GORGEOUS WOMEN, getting ready for an event. Nino's talking to his wife on the phone.

Two big Lincoln Towncars are parked outside. Across the road we recognize Driver's car. He opens the trunk. When he closes it again we see that he's wearing the eerily convincing SFX mask. He crosses the road, entering the pizzeria.

Driver rams the Lincoln at over a hundred miles an hour, hitting it just above the left rear wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT.

The impact is momentous. The huge Continental is lifted up in the air and spun round at the same time. It slams back into the tarmac then flips end over end for a hundred yards.

Among the carnage, we see Nino, bloodied but still alive. He unbuckles his seat belt and crawls out of the twisted wreck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver gets out of his car, calmly walking over to the pulverized Lincoln. He sees Nino stumbling off towards the beach but doesn't hurry after him yet. He checks to make sure the other passengers are dead, then heads on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH/ OCEAN/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nino stumbles through the sand, running for his life now. He looks behind him and sees Driver calmly pursuing him. He keeps running, but he's badly injured, slowing all the time. Fear clouds reason and he staggers towards the crashing waves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver slows down as he watches the gangster wade into the ocean, a pathetic last attempt to evade him. The crashing waves and the undertow are an impenetrable wall. Every time Nino tries to wade out further, the ocean drags him back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver stares at his trapped prey. Nino's attempts become more and more feeble as the ocean exhausts him and snuffs out any hope of escape. Finally he retreats back into the shallow water, barely able to keep his footing. He turns around and faces Driver, the crashing waves still smashing into his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stay like that for a moment. Gazing at each other. Driver silhouetted against the white sand. Nino trapped in the ocean. Then Driver wades out into the water. Nino has no fight left in him, staring at the masked man. Driver stares back at him then grabs him by the throat, forcing his head under the water. Nino splutters as Driver lets him up again.
</DIRECTION>
<NINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was Bernie...Bernie Rose killed your friend not me...

A large Chinese restaurant. We follow Driver through the crowd. He sees Bernie Rose sitting at a table on his own, pouring himself a glass of wine. The mobster's dressed for the occasion, wearing a jacket and tie. He smiles at Driver as he sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Care for a glass?...

Driver doesn't smile, gazing back at him across the table. Bernie Rose doesn't seem to care.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I can recommend the duck. Hell, I can recommend everything -- Walnut prawns, shredded beef, Velvet chicken -- but the duck's to die for...

	She's got her head screwed on right. I got two ex-wives, three kids, four grandchildren. Not one of them speaks to me now...

</BERNIE_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles again, looking into Driver's eyes with just a hint of sympathy.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is what I'll do for you. You give me the money, nobody knows she exists. But it's a different matter with you. These people I have the misfortune to be involved with, they don't mind Nino being gone, but they'll wanna know what happened to him...

EXT. PARKING LOT/ LINCOLN BOULEVARD - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver's car is parked at the back of the parking lot, half hidden by a fenced area for garbage. Driver pops the trunk, taking out the black gym bag with the cash. Bernie Rose doesn't even look at it, still admiring the car.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much does something like this cost?

</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess we won't be seeing each other again..
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Driver reaches out to give him the bag, when suddenly Bernie's hand snakes out of his pocket, twisting a switch-blade into Driver's gut. He pulls it out, ready to stab again, but this time Driver catches his wrist, slowly forcing the knife up to his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes are fixed on each other for a moment, with something like regret, then the blade pierces Bernie Rose's neck, sinking deeper and deeper. Driver holds the old man in his arms as he dies. They stay like that, locked in a fatal embrace, then Driver lowers Bernie Rose gently to the ground, out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood seeping through his shirt, Driver picks up the gym bag and puts it back in the trunk, slamming the door shut.

Driver climbs out of his car, wearing a jacket over his blood- soaked shirt. He walks to the back of the car, kneels down, and hides the keys behind the left rear wheel, drops of blood dripping on the tarmac beneath him. He gets up again, then sets off through the maze of parked vehicles, dialling a number on his cell-phone.

Irene hears his labored breathing now, looking concerned.

Driver's skin looks deathly pale, his eyes a haunting shade of blue. He keeps walking through the maze of cars, casting his eyes from one vehicle to the next, looking for the perfect ride.

Driver climbs into the front seat of the Camaro, catching his breath. He sits there a moment, sheltering from the world outside, then pulls out a pocket knife, opening the blades until he finds the screwdriver. He starts with the left side of the steering column, then gets to work on the section below the turn signal.

Driver's face is completely still now. So are his eyes. He looks almost at peace. There's a long pause, then slowly he leans forward and turns on the ignition. As the engine comes to life, we CUT TO BLACK.
