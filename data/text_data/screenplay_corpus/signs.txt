INT. WINDOW - MORNING

<DIRECTION>
We are looking out a second story window of a house. The backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym, worn from use. A single tree throws shade onto a barbecue and a picnic table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The backyard is lined by crops. Corn. Golden and brown. Six feet high.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everything is perfect. Like a postcard. And then we HEAR A CHILD SCREAM. IT'S FAR AWAY. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S COMING FROM.

GRAHAM HESS wakes up from his sleep. He thought he heard something. He listens. HE HEARS THE HEATER. THE REFRIGERATOR DOWNSTAIRS HUMMING. THE OCCASIONAL BIRDS OUTSIDE CHIRPING.

A bathroom door is open. WE HEAR THE SINK RUNNING. WE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF TEETH BEING BRUSHED.

Outside the bathroom on the bedroom wall is the sun faded outline of where a large CATHOLIC CROSS used to hang. It's ghostly stained forever on the blank wall.

He walks through a thin layer of crops and emerges in a clearing. Two German Shepherds are running back and forth. They are clearly agitated.

Graham looks around at the THOUSANDS OF CORN STALKS LYING FLAT ON THE GROUND. THEY LAY IN A GIGANTIC CIRCLE, A HUNDRED FEET WIDE.

Graham Hess looks around in a daze as he walks out into the center. Merrill, Bo and Morgan follow him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Why is no one saying the obvious? This is just a rash case of copycats. Someone, somewhere, does the first one. It's on TV, it's on the internet. In less than an hour a couple hundred people get the same brilliant idea and here we are... on the verge of mass hysteria.

We are in a narrow ARMY RECRUITING CENTER. Inside the small storefront space is a desk. A gentleman sporting a CREWCUT sits behind it.

A young man, Merrill's age, sits at a side card table filling out some forms.

<CREWCUT_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...

LIONEL smirks.

	He'd just swing as hard as he could every time. It didn't matter what the coach said, didn't matter who was on base, he'd whip that bat through the air as hard as he could... Looked like a lumber jack chopping down a tree.

	Felt wrong not to swing.

Graham is staring out the windshield. Merrill follows his stare to a thin, thirty-year old man in a LEATHER JACKET coming out of a store. Merrill's face changes expression too. They both stare as the man passes in front of the car.

THE VOICE LIKE SOUNDS ARE UNDER A CRACKLE BUT ARE CLEARER AND LOUDER.

Bo runs to the front bumper and climbs onto the hood.

Graham cuts her off by taking a seat on the hood. He takes hold of Bo. All four are on the car now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Morgan stands up on the roof of the station wagon. Merrill holds him by the waist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bo tries to get up onto the roof by climbing over Graham and the windshield. Graham boosts her up over his head with both hands.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merrill you got her.

Merrill reaches out his free hand. Bo reaches out to him. THE SOUND FROM THE MONITOR SUDDENLY CHANGES.

	Stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone STOPS exactly where they are. Graham holds Bo over his head. Bo reaches out to Merrill. Merrill sits on the roof with one arm out. Morgan stands with the baby monitor raised high in the air. The Hess family remains very still on the hood of their station wagon as they listen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CRACKLING IS GONE. THE VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ARE CLEAR AND UPFRONT. THERE ARE TWO DISTINCT TONES IN THE MIX.

	<DIALOGUE>
	There's two of them talking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORGAN>
<DIRECTION>
THE VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ARE NOT WORDS BUT MORE LIKE GRUNTS AND GURGLING LIKE SOMEONE DROWNING. THE SOUNDS ARE BEING CREATED BY INHALES, NOT EXHALES. A SEQUENCE OF THESE SOUNDS IN ONE TONE IS FOLLOWED BY SILENCE AND THEN THE SECOND TONE BEGINS ANOTHER SEQUENCE LIKE A CONVERSATION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham struggles to hold Bo up. Bo struggles to keep her arms out. Merrill struggles not to turn his face to the incredible SOUNDS ABOVE HIS HEAD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TONES ESCALATE IN VOLUME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Morgan's eyes widen as THE SEQUENCE OF SOUNDS BECOMES SHORTER AND FASTER. THE TONES BECOME HARDER, ANGRIER. THE SILENCES ALMOST GONE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE VOICE-LIKE TONES REACH A LOUD FEVERISH PACE, ALMOST VIOLENT AND THEN WE HEAR A CLICK AND THEY'RE GONE.
</DIRECTION>

Beat. Everyone looks up at the baby monitor. The red lights are off. ONLY THE BLAND HUM OF NORMAL STATIC COMES FROM IT'S SPEAKER.

WE ARE AT THE EDGE OF THE CROPS LOOKING BACK AT THE HOUSE. The LIGHTS are on in the kitchen. We see Graham, Merrill and the children doing dishes after dinner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DOG IS BARKING FURIOUSLY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUR VIEW TURNS TO LOOK AT THE BARN THROUGH THE CROPS. Isabelle, the remaining German Shepherd is tied to a post outside the barn. The dog whips back and forth frantically. She keeps looking in our direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE HEAR A SCREEN DOOR OPEN. WE TURN TO LOOK BACK AT THE HOUSE. Graham steps out the back screen door with a bowl of dog food and a bowl of water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We watch him as he walks towards the frantic dog. When he gets close, Graham slows. He approaches the dog carefully. He places the two bowls close but not too close. The dog has no interest in them. She keeps barking and glaring in our direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham watches her for a few moments, and THEN TURNS AND LOOKS DIRECTLY AT US FROM ACROSS THE YARD.

WE PULL BACK INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE CROPS.

Graham stands frozen looking across his yard. Isabelle, the dog turns in desperate circles behind him. Graham's eyes stay focused on the same point in the darkness. He talks to no one.

	You know something? Even entertaining the possibility of this for a minute has been exciting.

Graham reaches the barbecue area. There's a flashlight on the picnic table. Graham TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT ON. A NARROW BEAM FALLS ON THE GRASS FIVE FEET AHEAD OF HIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham starts toward the crops.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a kind of faith. It's an intoxicating thing to believe in something you can't see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON THE WALL OF CORN CROPS LINING THE BACKYARD. Graham steps right up to them. He hesitates and then steps into the field of
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORN CROPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can't see two feet in any direction. Six foot stalks of corn line Graham on all sides. THE FLASHLIGHT THROWS A WAVERING BEAM ON THE CROPS AHEAD OF HIM.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were always good at that...
	</DIALOGUE>

THE BEAM OF HIS FLASHLIGHT FINDS A NARROW PATH. Graham starts following it. His shoulders brush crops on either side.

SOMETHING MOVES UP AHEAD.

<DIRECTION>
Graham stops. HE SHINES HIS LIGHT DOWN THE PATH. Nothing but crops disappearing into darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll be secretly kind of sad for everybody, when this turns out to be -- all just make believe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
THERE'S MOVEMENT RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. Graham spins and aims the FLASHLIGHT AT THE CROPS TO HIS RIGHT. THE LIGHT ONLY PENETRATES A FEW FEET INTO THE CROPS.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're wasting your time here! I'm not going to report this or anything you do to me crops, to the news or TV or anybody! You're not going to get famous!

</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. There is no response. GRAHAM CAN HEAR HIS OWN BREATHING... IT SOUNDS HEAVY, ECHOISH... LIKE THERE'S TWO OF HIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Graham holds his breath. THE SOUND OF SOMEONE ELSE BREATHING CONTINUES BEHIND HIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham turns and drops the FLASHLIGHT at the same time. THE BEAM OF LIGHT TURNS OFF WHEN THE FLASHLIGHT HITS THE GROUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRAHAM IS IN DARKNESS NOW. HE LOOKS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BREATHING. BUT CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. HIS OWN BREATHING IS FAST AND LOUD NOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham kneels down and gropes in the darkness. His hands search over the ground in all directions. They finally touch the flashlight. Graham quickly fumbles with it to find the "on" button. He does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BEAM OF LIGHT SHOOTS ACROSS THE GROUND. SOMETHING POWDERY WHITE STANDS FIVE FEET AWAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It instantly moves into the darkness. Graham tries to get up. He stumbles backwards into the crops. He's tangled in crops as he struggles to rise. He gets up and starts running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leaves and stalks slap him from all directions. He panics. He doesn't know where he is. THERE IS SOMETHING COMING BEHIND HIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham makes a sudden right turn. He puts his hands in front of him to protect his face and eyes. He's running as fast as he can. HE HEARS STALKS OF CORN BREAKING BEHIND HIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another sudden turn, this time left. Graham emerges into his
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACKYARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham keeps running across the yard. ISABELLE BARKS FRANTICALLY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Graham reaches the porch stairs, he stops and turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is no one behind him. The wall of crops fifty feet away sway in the gentle night breeze.

Graham gains control of his breathing. He turns and walks to the screen door, slowing his breathing down with each step.

Graham steps into the kitchen. His hair is messed. His shirt has a few leaves from corn stalks stuck to it. He locks the back door.

<DIRECTION>
The children don't notice his presence. They're splashing each other at the sink as they clean the dinner dishes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham looks through the kitchen doorway to the family room. He sees Merrill there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill's hands are in his pockets as he stares at the WOODEN BASEBALL BAT mounted above the fireplace. Merrill doesn't notice him either.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham takes two steps to the kitchen table and slowly takes a seat. His breathing is a slow controlled pant. He runs one shaky hand through his hair as he gathers himself and thinks. His kind eyes stare down at the ground as he slows his mind. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill is the first to notice him. He moves from where the baseball bat is hung, into the kitchen. As he passes the children at the sink, he turns off the faucet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The children stop playing and look up to Merrill. They follow his stare to the kitchen table.

The children SCREAM and cling to their father. THEIR SCREAMS DIE DOWN. The PHONE RINGS again. Graham gets up. He closes the book.

EXT. REDDY HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mailbox reads "R. Reddy."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a gray and white house at the end of the quarter mile driveway. We saw the roof of this house from the Hess hallway window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham stands at the front door and RINGS THE DOORBELL AGAIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Graham tries to look inside. Curtains block his view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham walks around the porch. Turns the corner of the house. He looks in a side window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW IS OF A KITCHEN. THE KITCHEN CHAIRS ARE ON THEIR SIDE. THE KITCHEN TABLE ITSELF, IS UPSIDE DOWN, LEANING AGAINST A CLOSED DOOR. THE ROOM IS TOTALLY WRECKED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham stands straight up. He looks around nervously. He takes two steps back towards the front of the house and the safety of his station wagon before he notices the GREEN TRUCK parked to the side of the house.

There is someone sitting in it.

EXT. REDDY DRIVEWAY - DAY

The passenger side window of the truck is open. Graham steps up to it and looks inside. The thin man with the leather jacket, we saw in town, sits behind the wheel. He stares out the windshield. He is covered in sweat.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello Ray.

RAY REDDY doesn't look over. Doesn't react. Keeps staring.

Ray clutches the steering wheel tightly, turning his knuckles a yellow white.

Graham glances to the backseat of the truck. There are two large bags over flowing with clothes.

If I'd fallen asleep then, I'd a ended up in a ditch with a head ache. It had to happen at that right moment. That certain ten-fifteen seconds when I passed her walking.

<TV_ANCHOR>

</TV_ANCHOR>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill sits up in his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PICTURE OF THE ANCHORMAN IS REPLACED BY A HANDHELD VIDEO IMAGE ON THE TV SCREEN. THE IMAGE IS OF A FAMILY ROOM WHERE A BUNCH OF CHILDREN IN DRESS CLOTHES CROWD AROUND A SLIDING GLASS WINDOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CHILDREN ARE SPEAKING PORTUGUESE EXCITEDLY. THEY LOOK AT THE CAMERA AND POINT TO THE OUTSIDE THROUGH THE GLASS DOORS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HANDHELD IMAGE MOVES OVER THEIR SHOULDERS TO LOOK OUT THROUGH THE GLASS INTO A CRAMPED BACKYARD. THERE IS A RECTANGULAR TABLE WITH PARTY DECORATIONS AND AN UNTOUCHED BIRTHDAY CAKE ON IT. COLORFUL BALLOONS FLOAT AROUND THE BACKYARD. THERE IS NO ONE OUTSIDE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE IMAGES PANS AROUND THE DENSE FOLIAGE THAT FORMS A WALL AROUND THE YARD. THE IMAGE ZOOMS AND SEARCHES IN THE DARKNESS OF THE BRANCHES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chair in the closet CREAKS as Merrill leans forward a little towards the television screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE HEAR A BURST OF PORTUGUESE. THE IMAGE PANS AWAY FROM THE GLASS DOORS BACK INTO THE HOME. WE LOOK DOWN A NARROW HALL TO THE KITCHEN. A BOY WITH A BIRTHDAY HAT IS SEATED ON THE KITCHEN COUNTER, POINTING FRANTICALLY OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW. HE YELLS IN PORTUGUESE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CROWD OF CHILDREN AROUND THE GLASS DOORS START RUSHING INTO THE KITCHEN. THEY ARE JOINED BY A FEW ADULTS. THE IMAGE FOLLOWS THEM IN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE KITCHEN WINDOW IS BLOCKED BY HEADS WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVE.
</DIRECTION>
<MERRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Move children! Vamonos!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRILL>
<DIRECTION>
THE IMAGE FINDS AN OPENING OVER THE SHOULDER OF THE BOY WITH THE BIRTHDAY HAT AND ANOTHER CHILD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE ARE NOW LOOKING OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW. WE SEE A NARROW ALLEY ONLY A FEW FEET WIDE CREATED BY A STONE WALL AND A SMALL GARAGE BUILDING. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL IS DENSE FOLIAGE. THE WALL ENDS A FEW FEET AFTER THE GARAGE BUILDING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE HEAR THE CHILD'S VOICE VERY CLOSE TO US SPEAKING IN PORTUGUESE. THE CAMERA PANS JUST A LITTLE AS THE FACE OF THE LITTLE BIRTHDAY BOY FILLS THE SCREEN. HE TALKS EXCITEDLY DIRECTLY AT US AND AT SOMEONE BEHIND THE IMAGE.
</DIRECTION>
<BOY_WITH_HAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Esta atras da garagem! Esta atras de ai! Is behind!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY_WITH_HAT>
<DIRECTION>
THE BOY GESTURES TO THE GARAGE BUILDING. THE IMAGE SETTLES BACK ON THE WINDOW. WE STARE AT THE NARROW ALLEY. THE IMAGE ZOOMS A BIT. SEARCHES THE EDGE OF THE GARAGE BUILDING. THE IMAGE STARTS WIDENING OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND THEN WE SEE IT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE KITCHEN ERUPTS WITH CHILDREN'S SCREAMS AS A LARGE NON- HUMAN FIGURE MOVES FROM THE GARAGE BUILDING TO BEHIND THE WALL. IT'S OUT OF SIGHT IN LESS THAN A SECOND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill is frozen like a statue. His mouth is open a little. The closet FILLS WITH THE PANDEMONIA OF THE KITCHEN ON THE VIDEO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE VIDEO IMAGE ON THE NEWS, PAUSES. BEAT. WE SEE IT REWIND. WE SEE THE FIGURE ZIP BACK BEHIND THE GARAGE IN A FLICKER. THE VIDEO STOPS. PLAYS AGAIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE IMAGE ZOOMS A BIT. SEARCHES THE EDGE OF THE GARAGE BUILDING. STARTS TO WIDEN OUT. THE KITCHEN STARTS TO FILL WITH SCREAMS AS THE FIGURE APPEARS... THE IMAGE FREEZES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE NEWS HAS PAUSED THE VIDEOTAPE ON THE EXACT MOMENT THE NON-HUMAN FIGURE IS VISIBLE. IT'S HALFWAY ACROSS THE ALLEY. IT'S MOTION HAS BLURRED IT, BUT YOU CAN TELL ITS SHAPE NOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill Hess stares stunned at the IMAGE OF AN UPRIGHT ANIMAL LIKE CREATURE. THE STRIATIONS ALL OVER ITS BODY LOOK LIKE BRANCHES. EXACTLY LIKE BRANCHES. THEY MATCH THE BUSHES WHERE IT WAS HIDING, PERFECTLY.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

<DIRECTION>
The door swings open slowly. Graham steps into Ray Reddy's kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cabinets are open. Dishes are broken. Chairs are turned over. The faucet is running full blast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham's eyes move across the room. The kitchen table is upside down and leaned up against the pantry door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SOUND OF A GLASS JAR BREAKING ON THE GROUND CAN BE HEARD INSIDE THE PANTRY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham takes a few conservative steps to the middle of the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leans a little bit and listens. From behind the pantry door WE HEAR THE SOUND OF BREATHING. THERE ARE QUIET MOVEMENT SOUNDS. THE SOFT SOUND OF GLASS BEING CRUSHED AS IT'S BEING WALKED ON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham can almost see the bottom of the door around the leaning table. Graham stands up straight and thinks it over. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham takes two small steps closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he leans, he can now see the entire bottom of the pantry door. THERE IS LIGHT LEAKING OUT FROM BENEATH IT. THERE IS SHADOW BEING THROWN FROM INSIDE THE PANTRY. THE SHADOW MOVES BACK AND FORTH UNDER THE DOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>

	If you tell us your name and why you did it, we'll give you the same deal we gave the others. Don't throw away your life son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham bends down where he stands. He puts his head near the wood floor. He tries to look under the door. All he can see are the bottoms of a couple shelves in the corner of the pantry. He's at too severe an angle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham sits up. He's only four feet away from the pantry door. He looks around not knowing what to do. His eyes fall on a bunch of kitchen knives that have spilled from a drawer onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a butcher knife from the group and moves closer to the door. Beat. He reaches with the butcher knife underneath the slanted kitchen table. He uses the knife like a mirror to see under the door. Graham watches the SOFT REFLECTION IN THE FLAT STAINLESS STEEL SURFACE OF THE BLADE. WE CAN MAKE OUT BROKEN GLASS AND RIPPED OPEN PACKETS OF RICE AND CEREAL ON THE GROUND. THERE ARE POCKETS OF SHADOWS WE CAN'T SEE INTO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham pulls the knife out. He sits there kneeling two feet from the door. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a deep breath and starts to lower his head under the slanted table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops halfway down. He loses his nerve and sits up. He rises to his feet as he places the butcher knife on the counter. Graham starts walking across the kitchen. He gets to the door. Puts his hand on the doorknob.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stays like that for a long time. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham lets go of the doorknob -- He turns and walks quickly across the kitchen -- He picks up the butcher knife -- He kneels down next to the pantry -- He ducks his head under the slanted kitchen table -- He places his cheek to the floor, only inches from the bottom of the door, and looks into the pantry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is broken glass and rice throughout the wooden floor of the pantry. Nothing else.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham stares at his VIEW OF THE FLOOR. Something's wrong. Parts of it feel like a painting. THE PAINTING MOVES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO BLACK EYES OPEN -- SEEMINGLY SUSPENDED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM. THEY ARE SIDEWAYS. THEY LOOK AT GRAHAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRAHAM YELLS. HE JOLTS UP. HIS HEAD HITS THE SLANTED TABLE HARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOUR LONG FINGERS AND CLAWS, THE EXACT COLOR OF THE WOODEN FLOOR REACH OUT AND MISS HIS FACE BY A FRACTION OF AN INCH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRAHAM REACTS. THE BUTCHER KNIFE COMES DOWN FAST AND HARD ON THE PROTRUDING WOOD COLORED FINGERS. SLAM!

THE STATION WAGON SUDDENLY BRAKES.

Two black skid marks form on the road as the station wagon comes to a fast stop.

A BIRD lays limp on the asphalt. Its head is crushed.

</GRAHAM>
<MORGAN>

EXT. HESS HOUSE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE ARE WATCHING THE HOUSE FROM THE CROPS. We see Graham inside the house, closing the window shutters in one room after another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE a stack of wooden boards on the porch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUR VIEW MOVES to the barn where Isabelle is tied. She is not pacing. She is not barking. She sits staring right at us. She is shivering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUR VIEW MOVES to the garage building where we see Merrill carry a huge pile of his clothes and things down the stairs. He's moving into the main house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill walks across the yard. His eyes look around carefully as he moves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Part of the pile in his arms falls to the grass as he crosses the lawn. He stops walking and starts to gather up the fallen things. He picks up a couple shirts and two baseballs encased in glass cases.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The glass encasing one of the souvenir baseballs, has cracked. He takes the ball out. Stares at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We watch from the crops as Merrill puts down his pile of clothes and things on the grass. He looks around and finds what he's looking for. A rake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill unscrews the fork on the rake from the wooden handle. With the wooden stick in one hand and the souvenir baseball in the other, he turns to face the crops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE PULL BACK A LITTLE INTO THE CROPS. PART OF OUR VIEW IS OBSCURED BY STALKS, BUT WE STILL SEE MERRILL CLEARLY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill looks around cautiously again, before getting into a batter's stance. His left leg digs into the grass in front of him. His weight is mostly on his back leg. He looks out into the distance high over the crops. He throws the baseball up in the air...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill grabs the wooden handle. Merrill's shoulders move with blinding speed. The wooden rake handle slices the air. And misses the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ball drops at Merrill's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE WATCH as Merrill picks up the ball and tries again. This time his shoulders move even faster. The wooden stick actually makes A RESONANT SOUND as it cuts the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ball drops at Merrill's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE WATCH THROUGH THE CROPS as Merrill snatches the ball up and tries a third time. This time he YELLS as he swings. He rips the air with the wooden stick so fast it blurs to the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The baseball drops at his feet. Strike three.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill stands still in the yard. He's breathing a little heavy as he stares down at the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gently picks it up. He walks back to his pile of things and then suddenly turns. He throws the ball in the air as he does. His left leg goes out. His weight goes to his right leg as he turns his shoulders with astonishing speed and power...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SOUND OF THE BASEBALL HITTING THE WOODEN HANDLE CRACKS ACROSS THE WHOLE YARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ball rockets into the air. We watch it fly overhead... sail high over the crops... it becomes a tiny dot in the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a long beat of silence it comes back to earth. It lands in the street and bounces twenty feet into the air. It cleared at least four or five hundred feet of crops. Maybe more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE LOOK BACK to Merrill standing in the backyard. He drops the wooden stick to the grass and moves for his things. He piles them in his arms. When his arms are full, he starts for the porch. WE WATCH FROM THE CROPS AS MERRILL GOES INSIDE THE HOUSE.

Morgan gets up from his seat. He goes to Graham's chair. He leans against his dad's arm and cries with him. Graham's fork stops moving. He watches as Bo moves from her seat to his other side. She holds her dad's arm and cries.

Graham's eyes stay locked on the crops which go on and on into darkness. He moves closer to the glass. Watches the top of the corn stalks swaying slightly with the wind.

SOMETHING MOVES IN THE DARKNESS.

Graham's eyes moves to where the corn crops fade into black forty feet away. Graham goes very still.

LINES EMERGE IN THE CROPS; THE KIND OF LINES MADE BY SOMEONE TRAMPLING THROUGH A FIELD. WE CAN'T SEE WHO'S MAKING THEM. ALL WE SEE ARE THE COUNTLESS LINES BEING FORMED.

Graham looks around again... the same things... the same table... the same closet... Graham stops and stares at the closet. It has a wooden folding door that opens and closed on a guide rail. The wooden folding door is very tall. Its top is one foot from the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham goes to the closet and grabs the door. He starts rocking it hard. Pulling it out... It starts to come out of its guide rail... Graham leans back with all his weight... The thin wooden door rips out of place. One end is still attached at the hinge. Graham pulls it straight. It reaches into the middle of the landing. It stands right next to Merrill. Right under the attic trapdoor. Its top is only a few inches lower than Merrill's reach.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill hesitates and then lowers the attic trapdoor. It connects with the top of the closet door and stops. The trapdoor is now open almost a foot... We can now see part of the bottom step of the wooden pull out stairs that lead to the attic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill and Graham step away as the closet folding door holds the weight of the attic door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, the spring on the attic trapdoor recoils as the pressure is let up. The trapdoor closes. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It opens with force, slamming the top of the standing closet door with a THUD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The attic trapdoor closes again. Opens again with force. THUD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The closet folding door begins to pull away from the hinges keeping it upright.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham moves down the stairs. Merrill follows him.

INT. FRONT HALL - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SCRATCHING NOISES FILL THE HOUSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Morgan and Bo are frozen watching a set of long fingers reach under the front door. THE COLOR OF THE FINGERS CHANGES -- TO THE EXACT COLOR AND TEXTURE OF THE YELLOW CRACKED PAINT ON THE DOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUD. THE TRAPDOOR SLAMS THE TOP OF THE FOLDING DOOR UPSTAIRS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham and Merrill arrive in the front hall. Graham takes Morgan and Bo by the hand and leads them quickly down the hall. Merrill backs away as he watches the top of the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER THUD ECHOES THROUGH THE HOUSE.

INT. KITCHEN - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The swinging door swings open and closed behind Merrill as he enters the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham has moved the chairs away from the kitchen table and waits by it. Merrill goes over and the two of them push the table against the swinging door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They take the kitchen chairs and pile a couple on top, and jam the rest underneath the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham leans against the kitchen counter. Merrill stares at the pile of furniture.

Graham points to a set of narrow stairs that lead to a darkened door at the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<MERRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no way out of there.

</MERRILL>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Graham looks at the faces of his frightened children.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
THUD.

<MERRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should we make a run for it out the back?

</MERRILL>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're right behind the door.

Merrill looks at the boarded up back door. Graham turns to Bo and Morgan who stand against the wall.

<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. Your grandma said, "No." He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
THUD WITH A CRACK OF WOOD FROM UPSTAIRS. Merrill turns and stares at the barricaded entrance to the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must have pulled his arm at an awkward angle. His elbow popped right out of the socket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
THE LAST THUD COMES WITH A SOUND OF WOOD SPLINTERING. THE CLOSET FOLDING DOOR CRASHES TO THE GROUND IN THE UPSTAIRS HALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE HEAR CREAKS AS THE ATTIC TRAPDOOR OPENS.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't scream or anything. His arm just flopped to his side and he got real still.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<MERRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRILL>
<DIRECTION>
Graham moves towards the basement stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I held him in my lap in the back seat as we drove to the hospital. I couldn't stop crying... We need to go into the basement now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Graham gestures for the kids to come to the stairs. Morgan and Bo move to their father slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what your Uncle Merrill did right after the doctor put his arm back in place? He jumped off the table and gave me a hug. He had already forgotten that I was the one who hurt him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Graham ushers the two children down the stairs. He waits for Merrill. Merrill turns from the kitchen door and walks toward him. Merrill stops and looks down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<MERRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We won't be able to get out of there.

</MERRILL>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>

Beat. Merrill's eyes fill with water. He doesn't look up at his older brother.
</DIRECTION>
<MERRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRILL>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill walks down the stairs. Graham waits at the top. He watches the kitchen door with the table and chairs against it. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THERE IS MOVEMENT OUTSIDE IN THE HALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door starts to force its way open. THE TABLE AND CHAIRS BEGIN TO SCRAPE ACROSS THE KITCHEN FLOOR LIKE NAILS AGAINST A CHALK BOARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE HEAR VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ENTER THE KITCHEN. SOUNDS MADE FROM INHALES, NOT EXHALES.

Graham comes down the last few steps and enters the basement.
</DIRECTION>
<MORGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We forgot our foil helmets!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Graham closes the door behind him. It has no lock.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need something to wedge against the doorknob.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
The basement is lined with metal shelves. The shelves are cluttered with all sorts of canned goods, extension cords, cleaning supplies, decorations, outdoor tools. Merrill rummages through the shelves frantically.
</DIRECTION>
<MORGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll read our minds!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORGAN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're scaring your sister.

</GRAHAM>
<BO>

<MERRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm looking!

Merrill moves to another set of shelves. He starts knocking things to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<MORGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll know our secret thoughts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORGAN>
<DIRECTION>
There is SCRATCHING AGAINST THE DOOR. The doorknob turns. Graham grabs it with both hands. The door begins to push open.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merrill!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<MERRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRILL>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill reaches between two stacks of shelves and pulls out a pick for digging in the ground. He holds it up in the air. It has a three-foot wooden handle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill turns and rushes in Graham's direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A single light bulb hangs from a wire in the ceiling. It is the only light in the room. Merrill CLIPS THE LIGHT BULB with the end of the wooden handle as he crosses the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BULB SHATTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BASEMENT IS INSTANTLY BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<BO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO>
<DIRECTION>
WE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF SUDDEN COMMOTION, VOICES. STRUGGLING AT THE DOOR. STEPS ON BROKEN GLASS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK. A BEAM OF A FLASHLIGHT COMES ON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IT ILLUMINATES MORGAN STANDING NEXT TO A RACK OF METAL SHELVES. HE TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT IN HIS TINY HANDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE NARROW BEAM MOVES ACROSS THE DARKNESS. IT FINDS MERRILL AND GRAHAM LEANING UP AGAINST THE BASEMENT DOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORGAN MOVES THE BEAM DOWN TO THE PICK, WHICH IS WEDGED BETWEEN THE DOORKNOB AND THE GROUND. THE PICK WAVERS A LITTLE WITH EACH PUSH FROM THE OTHER SIDE, BUT HOLDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SCRATCHING AND MOVEMENT OUTSIDE THE DOOR BEGINS TO LESSEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Morgan slowly moves THE BEAM BACK UP TO HIS FATHER'S FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Bo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAM SEARCHES IN THE DARKNESS. THROUGH THE BOXES, BETWEEN THE SHELVES... IT SETTLES ON A SMALL FOOT HIDING BEHIND A COUPLE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG FOOD. BO'S HEAD SLOWLY APPEARS. SHE SQUINTS AS SHE LOOKS IN THE LIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<BO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER BEAM COMES ON. IT REVEALS MERRILL AT THE SHELVES WITH A SECOND FLASHLIGHT. HE LOOKS OVER THE CONTENTS OF THE SHELVES NEAR HIM. BEAT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON A RADIO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns the knob to "on." The radio lights up, but no sound emerges for it's speakers. Merrill turns the channel knob and checks all the stations. No sound. No signal. He listens to the LIGHT HUM FROM THE SPEAKERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MERRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's happening out there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRILL>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.

<GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
(in the dark)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't even imagine.

</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
THEY ALL LISTEN TO THE DEAD AIR HUM FROM THE RADIO SPEAKERS.
</DIRECTION>
<MORGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORGAN>
<DIRECTION>
THERE IS A LOUD BANG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOTH FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CRISSCROSS OVER THE BASEMENT AND COME TO A STOP ON THE DOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER BANG. THE DOOR VIBRATES. THE PICK WITH THE WOODEN HANDLE HOLDS IN PLACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRAHAM STEPS INTO THE BEAM OF LIGHTS. He looks at the door and then turns and faces the lights.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're just making noises. They're not trying to get in.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are they doing that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Graham looks at Merrill's corner of the darkness. Morgan moves his BEAM ONTO MERRILL.
</DIRECTION>
<MERRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They want our attention on the door?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRILL>
<DIRECTION>
BANG. A beat of silence.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're distracting us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<MERRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRILL>
<MORGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.

</MORGAN>
<MERRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MERRILL>
<MORGAN>

<DIRECTION>
BANG.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morgan, give me your flashlight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Morgan puts the FLASHLIGHT ON THE GROUND AND ROLLS IT ACROSS THE FLOOR. THE BEAM SPINS IN TINY CIRCLES SHOWING THE BROKEN GLASS OF THE BULB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FLASHLIGHT COMES TO A STOP IN GRAHAM'S PALM. He picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there an air vent in here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill moves next to Graham. ANOTHER BANG FROM THE DOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They aim their FLASHLIGHTS IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM. The brothers move in opposite directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRAHAM MOVES HIS BEAM UP AND DOWN CHECKING THE WALLS AND THE CEILING AS HE MOVES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERRILL MOVES BETWEEN SHELVES, ONE AT A TIME. HIS FLASHLIGHT PEERS BEHIND THE STACKS OF CANNED GOODS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BANG ECHOES THROUGH THE BASEMENT DOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill and Graham are at opposite ends of the room now.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can feel air.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<MERRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.

</MERRILL>
<DIRECTION>
THE TWO BEAMS OF LIGHT START MOVING TOWARDS EACH OTHER.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's getting stronger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<MERRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm close.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRILL>
<DIRECTION>
BANG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAMS MOVE UP AND DOWN OVER THE FINAL WALL. GRAHAM AND MERRILL MOVE CLOSER AND CLOSER... THE TWO BEAMS FINALLY COME TO A STOP IN THE SAME PLACE... THEY SHINE DOWN ON MORGAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE SITS ON THE GROUND AGAINST THE WALL. HE STARES UP AT THE TWO LIGHTS.
</DIRECTION>
<MORGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORGAN>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BEAM OF LIGHTS YOU CAN SEE HIS HAIR MOVING GENTLY FROM A BREEZE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRAHAM AND MERRILL TURN THEIR LIGHTS STRAIGHT INTO THE AIR VENT HE'S LEANING AGAINST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EYES ARE REVEALED IN THE DARKNESS OF THE VENT. A NARROW SET OF METALLIC COLORED FINGERS SHOOT OUT BETWEEN THE HOLES IN THE VENT GRILL AND GRAB MORGAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORGAN SCREAMS. THE FLASHLIGHTS DROP TO THE GROUND. THERE'S A DESPERATE SCRAMBLE. FEET MOVE THROUGH THE BEAMS OF LIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE CAN'T SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.
</DIRECTION>
<MERRILL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold the vent!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRILL>
<DIRECTION>
SOMEONE PICKS UP A FLASHLIGHT. WE SEE GLIMPSES OF STRAINING FACES. MORGAN SCREAMING.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pull him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
THE FLASHLIGHT IS DROPPED AND PICKED UP AGAIN. WE SEE IT IS BO WHO IS HOLDING THE LIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BO TURNS THE LIGHT AT THE VENT. MERRILL IS THE ONLY ONE THERE. HE PRESSES ONE OF THE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG FOOD AGAINST THE METAL GRILL. HE DRAGS THE SECOND BAG OVER WITH HIS FOOT AND SLAMS IT AGAINST THE FIRST BAG. HE QUICKLY MOVES OUT OF THE LIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BO FOLLOWS HIM WITH THE BEAM. SHE FINDS HIM DRAGGING AN ENORMOUS BAG OF FLOUR OVER TO THE VENT. HE HEAVES IT ON TOP OF THE PILE. HE LEAVES THE LIGHT AGAIN. RETURNS WITH ANOTHER GIANT BAG OF FLOUR. GRUNTS AS HE THROWS IT ON TOP OF THE REST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERRILL FALLS TO THE GROUND EXHAUSTED. THE PILE OF DOG FOOD AND FLOUR COMPLETELY OBSCURE THE VENT. A CAN OF SOUP ROLLS ON THE GROUND NEAR MERRILL. HE SLOWLY PICKS IT UP AND PUTS AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT OUNCES ON THE PILE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill slowly catches his breath. He reaches over to his side and grabs the remaining flashlight. HE TRAINS THE BEAM AROUND THE ROOM TILL HE FINDS MORGAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE FINDS THE BOY IN GRAHAM'S LAP. MORGAN IS SEATED WITH HIS BACK AGAINST GRAHAM'S CHEST. USING HIM AS A CHAIR. MORGAN'S FACE IS PALE. HE IS TAKING VERY LONG SLOW HEAVES. IT SOUNDS LIKE THE AIR IS GOING THROUGH A STRAW. HE'S SUFFOCATING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRAHAM LOOKS UP INTO THE LIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't have his medicine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill looks at his nephew turning gray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham pulls Morgan closer to his body and talks into the child's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be scared Morgan. We'll slow it down together. Feel my chest. Feel it going in and out. Breathe like me. Breathe like me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Morgan's throat is closing -- his face is filled with strain and panic.
</DIRECTION>
<BO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He can't breathe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO>
<DIRECTION>
Bo moves to Merrill and curls up with him as they watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham closes his eyes. Beat. He opens his eyes and talks into Morgan's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay with me. Stay with me. I know it hurts. Be strong baby... It'll pass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Graham closes his eyes -- talks to the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do this to me again. Not again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill stares at his brother's desperate face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham's eyes open as Morgan's tiny fingers press down on Graham's hand. The fingers squeeze with all the strength they have.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham looks to Merrill helplessly. Merrill's eyes fill up with water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham's eyes close.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate you. I hate you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Graham's eyes open as he leans in close to Morgan's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fear is feeding it... Don't be afraid of what's happening... Believe it's going to pass... Believe it... Just wait... Don't be afraid... The air is coming... Believe... We don't have to be afraid... It's about to pass... Here it comes... Don't be afraid... Here comes the air...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
A THIN STREAM OF SOUND EMITS FROM MORGAN'S THROAT. LIKE THE SOUND OF AIR LEAKING FROM A BALLOON.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There we go... We don't have to be scared at all... We know it'll pass. We believe it... Don't be afraid Morgan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Morgan's fingers relax a little on Graham's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LEAKING BALLOON SOUND TURNS BACK INTO THE SOUND OF AIR THROUGH A STRAW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill watches as Graham's face stays pressed up against his son.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feel my chest... Breathe with me. Together... The air is going in our lungs... Together... We're the same. We're the same.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill watches as Morgan's chest starts to move in sync with Graham's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SOUND OF THE STRAW FADES AS MORGAN'S BREATHING TURNS INTO LABORED BREATHS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham's eyes close. He starts crying. He speaks to no one.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
(soft)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Morgan's fingers relax on Graham's hand. Merrill watches as father and son breathe together. Merrill and Bo hold each other tight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FLASHLIGHT FLICKERS ON GRAHAM AND MORGAN'S EXHAUSTED FACES. THEY BOTH STARE OUT INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE BASEMENT. TEARS DRYING ON THEIR CHEEKS. THEY'RE BOTH LOST IN THEIR THOUGHTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MERRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should save the flashlights.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRILL>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Graham nods without looking over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERRILL PRESSES THE BUTTON ON HIS FLASHLIGHT. THE BEAM OF LIGHT ILLUMINATING GRAHAM AND MORGAN GOES OUT. THEY DISAPPEAR INTO SHADOWS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill looks down to Bo, who has the second flashlight in her hand. THE BEAM POINTS UP AT THE BASEMENT CEILING ABOVE HER AND MERRILL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill nods to her. She reaches down and presses the button.

<DIRECTION>
THE BASEMENT IS ENGULFED BY BLACK.

Graham opens his eyes from sleep. HE SQUINTS FROM THE LIGHT OF THE HANGING BULB IN THE BASEMENT.

Merrill steps into his vision.

THERE'S A WHEEZING SOUND FROM THE CORNER OF THE ROOM. Graham and Merrill turn to look at Morgan -- laying down on Merrill's folded sweater. Morgan's breathing is strained. He still looks grey.

<MERRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.

The two men stand under the single dangling light bulb. Graham quietly turns and looks at Morgan. He moves across the room towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill watches as Graham kneels down and reaches to Morgan's side. Graham unclips the baby monitor from his son's belt.
</DIRECTION>

Graham walks back to Merrill. He holds it out between them. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns it ON.

A SLIGHT STATIC IS HEARD. GRAHAM TURNS THE VOLUME ALL THE WAY UP. THE STATIC GETS A LITTLE LOUDER, BUT DOESN'T CHANGE. THERE ARE NO NOISES, NO SPIKES, NO VOICES... JUST EMPTY ELECTRICAL STATIC. Beat.

Graham makes eye contact with Merrill. Beat.

The basement door cracks open a few inches. Beat. Merrill opens it all the way.

DUST FLOATS UP IN THE DAYLIGHT THAT SPILLS DOWN THE STAIRS.

Merrill moves up the stairs by himself. He reaches the top and looks around. Turns back down to the faces at the bottom. Gives them the thumbs up.

Graham leads Bo up the stairs. He carries a limp Morgan in his arms.

THE BACK DOOR IS WIDE OPEN.

WE HEAR SOUNDS FROM THE TV FILTERING IN FROM THE HALL.

Graham and Bo and Morgan watch as Merrill walks over the toppled chairs to get to the cabinets.

Graham gently lays Morgan on the sofa.

WE HEAR CHEERING COME FROM THE TELEVISION, FILTER THROUGH THE FRONT HALL AND INTO THE FAMILY ROOM.

INT. FAMILY ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham pulls the television into the family room. Careful not to trip it on the carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GLASS OF THE TELEVISION IS LIKE A MIRROR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham moves the television into position. THE BLACK SCREEN REFLECTS THE FAMILY ROOM BEHIND GRAHAM AS IT TURNS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE REFLECTION OF A CREATURE SILHOUETTED PANS ACROSS THE TELEVISION SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TV stops moving. Graham stays frozen with his hands on either side of the television cart. He's slightly bent over. His back is to the family room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham straightens and turns around slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Morgan is held by his waist three feet in the air. Morgan's face turns to the color of ash as his throat closes up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment it appears he's suspended in the air. Then we see the outlines... and we see the eyes. The black eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a creature close to seven feet tall standing in the middle of the family room. It's powdery skin has taken on the shades, lines and colors of the family room so perfectly, it almost disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It blinks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham and Bo have turned to stone. Bo stands frozen in the front hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill comes out of the doorway from the kitchen to the family room. He takes two steps into the room and comes to a stop next to the fireplace. The inhaler and syringe in his hand fall to the ground. The creature is between Graham and Merrill in the middle of the family room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Morgan is dying. THE LAST SOUNDS OF AIR STOP IN HIS THROAT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lines of the chairs and windowsill mimicked on the creature's skin move as the creature moves its free hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham's eyes shift to the hand. THREE OF THE CREATURES FINGERS ARE MISSING -- SLICED OFF BY A BUTCHER KNIFE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature's hand moves to Morgan's face. It tilts its fingers and palm back. THE COLORS ON THE HAND ARE ALREADY CHANGING TO MATCH IT'S NEW POSITION IN THE ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small pore opens up on its wrist. A YELLOWISH GAS STARTS TO LEAK OUT OF THE OPENING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham looks up from the leaking poison gas to the face of the creature. It's large empty black eyes lock on Graham's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRAHAM STARTS TO HEAR A HIGH PITCH RINGING SOUND -- IT BEGINS TO ENGULF ALL SOUND IN THE ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRAHAM STARES HELPLESSLY INTO THE LARGE BLACK EYES.

WE MOVE INTO GRAHAM'S EYES... THEY WIDEN. WE SEE THE EMOTION IN THEM. HIS MOUTH BARELY GETS THE WORDS OUT.

WE ARE BLINDED BY A BRIGHT LIGHT. THE LIGHT IS MOVING. WE REALIZE IT IS THE HEADLIGHTS OF A CAR THAT PULLS TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car door opens. Graham Hess steps out. His coat is open. He is wearing a black shirt and black pants. A priest's white collar sits under the lapel of the black shirt. Graham looks around in a daze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are on a country road. THERE ARE STROBING RED AND WHITE LIGHTS FILLING THE NIGHT AIR. Four police cars are scattered amongst the tow trucks and the ambulances.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large group of officers and workers hover around a green truck that has swerved off the road into a grouping of trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Officer Edgar Paski walks up to Graham. He whispers something into a walkie clipped to his shirt as he approaches. Edgar looks badly shaken. Beat. The two men look at each other.

The other officers turn and look as Graham walks by them. He walks on, unaware of the stares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slows as he reaches the back bumper of the truck. It sticks out onto the road a few feet. He comes around the side of the vehicle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLLEEN HESS is beautiful in a delicate way. Her straight brown hair falls down over her small face. She leans over the front bumper of the truck onto the hood. Her head rests on her arms like a child resting on a school desk. Her back is against a tree. The lower half of her is obscured by the truck.

She's able to raise her head and shoulders as Graham walks up to her. She is shivering slightly.

WE ARE IN THE FAMILY ROOM. THE HIGH PITCHED RINGING SOUNDS FADE AND ARE REPLACED BY THE BREATHING IN THE ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BREATHING IS JOINED BY THE HISSING OF GAS AS IT'S BEING RELEASED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE FORCES POISON GAS OUT INTO MORGAN'S UNCONSCIOUS FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ROOM IS ENGULFED WITH STREAMS OF SUNLIGHT FROM THE BROKEN WINDOWS. THE LIGHT SEEMS TO CATCH CERTAIN THINGS IN THE ROOM AND MAKE THEM STAND OUT. THINGS ON SHELVES, THINGS ON TABLES, THINGS ON THE WALL.

Graham's eyes are not on Merrill. Merrill follows his eye line to the baseball bat mounted above him.

Beat. Merrill reaches up and takes the bat off its resting place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature starts to move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill's hands tighten around the handle as he walks forward. He stops. His weight shifts to his right leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature begins to turn and becomes more visible as its lines and colors don't match in position in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill's left leg goes out. His torso and shoulders turn with staggering speed and strength. The bat slices through the air of the family room... Contact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature gets HAMMERED across the back with the baseball bat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Morgan is dropped. He falls to the carpet of the family room in an unnatural crumpled pile. His arms and legs flop lifelessly to the carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature turns to face Merrill. All the creature sees is the BLUR OF WOOD as Merrill swings like a lumberjack. SLAM. The creature falls to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham takes Bo by the hand and moves to Morgan. Graham picks up his son's limp body in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature moves to its feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill's hands choke up on the bat. Merrill's eyes are on fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham leans down and picks up the full syringe of medicine on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill SCREAMS as he swings again. His powerful muscles pull his shoulders whipping around. The bat connects with the creature across its chest. The creature is thrown back into the wall. Two glass of water fall off a shelf and CRASH ONTO THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER. The water connects with it's skin. The creature makes a HIGH PITCHED INHALE SOUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bo and Graham look up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER STOPS CHANGING COLORS AND WITHERS INTO A POWDERY WHITE.

Merrill steps in. THE WOODEN BAT MAKES A SOUND AS IT CUTS THROUGH THE AIR. SLAM! It connects with the creature. The creature falls back into the coffee table. Bo's glasses of water crack and SPLASH OVER the creature's TORSO. ANOTHER HIGH PITCHED INHALE SCREAM. His torso turns a powdery white. Parts of its body are still changing and matching its environment. Parts are white.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature stands again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrill looks for the next target in the room. Bo points to the dinning table where the old chicken teriyaki, bacon cheeseburger and spaghetti with meatballs sit untouched.

MERRILL YELLS WITH EVERYTHING IN HIS LUNGS. His wrists turn. His shoulders torque. THE WOODEN LOUISVILLE SLUGGER SLICES THE AIR AND SHATTERS WHEN IT CONNECTS WITH THE UPPER CHEST OF THE CREATURE. PIECES OF WOOD SPLINTER OVER THE FAMILY ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE WAVERS AND THEN ALL SEVEN FEET OF IT TIPS OVER. IT FALLS BACK. IT CLIPS THE TV STAND AS IT FALLS. IT LANDS ON THE GROUND WITH A THUD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE'S BLACK, EMPTY EYES LOOK UP IN TIME TO SEE BO'S GLASSES OF WATER RESTING ON THE TELEVISION, FALL... AND SPILL OVER THE EDGE -- RIGHT ONTO ITS FACE.
</DIRECTION>

THE CREATURE'S SCREAMS FILL THE FAMILY ROOM -- AND THEN SUDDENLY STOP.

IT BECOMES VERY STILL. EVERY INCH OF ITS BODY TURNS A WITHERED, POWDERY WHITE. BEAT.
