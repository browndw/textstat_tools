:SC: THUNDERHEART
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DRUM. Beating slow. And deep. Like a heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE GREAT PLAINS SOUTH DAKOTA - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something is rising from the Black Hills. A sphere of light, too red to be the sun. A sphere of contained fire, undulating in crimson and ochre, and rising slowly, majestically, to the pulse. To the DRUM. It is the sun. But it is a Paha Sapa sunrise. A Black Hills sunrise. And it is spectacular.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DRUM, pounds deeper, bigger, as the sun gets higher. Stronger. Igniting a vast landscape of gentle slopes and foothills; throwing shadows on the plains that look like, as the Indians say, an old man dancing. The grass is golden. And high. The wind moves through it, snakes through it. Slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEGIN CREDITS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Voices; a TRADITIONAL INDIAN SONG (Lakota), summoning Wakan Tanka - The Great Mystery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now, rising up over one of the small land waves, a head comes into view. Shoulders. A man, running in ghostly SLOW MOTION, his long black hair trailing in the wind. The INDIAN MAN wears only buckskin pants and a bone choker around his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Legs and arms churning, the man runs with antelope grace, backlit by the sunrise, bounding toward us. Running... his heart pounding. SONG RISING... DRUM POUNDING... FIVE MORE VOICES in high-pitched tremolo join the song.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then the runner soars, like an eagle from a bluff, airborne, flying over a small dip, arms outstretched, and it would be a wondrous thing if there were not a fine, crimson, mist all around him and if slow motion was not suddenly overtaken by LIVE SPEED, revealing the brutal force of gunfire which has slammed the Indian into the air, throwing him. Slamming him hard into the grass. And it is over as quickly and violently as a deer shot dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LAKOTA SONG ends abruptly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT - THE GREAT PLAINS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the sun burns like lava at the horizon. DRUM beats like a heart. And Somewhere off in a distant cottonwood, an OWL. Then Silence. Deep, disturbing stillness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAPITAL BELTWAY - WASHINGTON. D.C - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROCK N'ROLL shatters the silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cars -- a multicolored metallic criss-cross reflecting off a building made of mirrors -- races past an electronic billboard that blinks in red skyhigh digital: PRUDENTIAL LIFE INSURANCE. 7:59. 73 degrees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The D.C. Superhighway. And off behind it, in the distance, Capital Hill holds imposing vigil, the massive cast iron dome of The Capital, catching the sun. But everything is soon smothered by a METRO BUS, hogging the far lane of the Beltway, leaning on its HORN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Good morning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the rock n'roll is everybody's radio, everybody's tempo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARBON MONOXIDE WAVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shimmers across the beltway hugging then releasing a solitary vehicle that we stay with... move with... A black Nissan 240 SX, hard-waxed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 240 SX - TRAVELING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the wheel -- an intense young man with close-cropped black hair, eyes hidden by sunglasses. Whatever he does for a living, he does in a suit (not expensive but well-fit. But we might also note that any extra suit cash has gone instead into the silver-plated watch on his left wrist). Lean as a rake, sallow in the cheeks, there is something insatiable about him -- a hungry energy that won't let him go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAY LEVOI, late 20's, early 30's, pulls out of a threatening traffic jam and races on the narrow right between thirty cars and a cement girder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. T STREET - OUTSIDE WEST-CENTRAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black SX has jumped off an exit and has entered the light- industrial section of Washington. It pulls up near a loading dock behind an old gray building and several parked cars and vans. Ray steps out, smooths his jacket, locks and SETS HIS CAR ALARM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another young man -- chubby, clean-shaven; in a nicer suit than Ray's -- steps out from a parked Miata, and approaches Ray. CARL PODJWICK balances a coffee, a U.S.A. Today and a black eel-skin briefcase.

	Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
They stop at the door of a service elevator and Carl breathes. Expanding his chest, exhaling. Ray adjusts Carl's tie for him, his collar. He speaks quietly. Quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.

INT. GRAY BUILDING - FENCING OPERATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl follows Ray into the big sparse room of unfinished sheetrock walls. There is nothing in here but cardboard boxes, and two people; a bearded HISPANIC MAN standing behind a counter, writing on a clipboard. The other is a middle-aged BLACK MAN in a purple silk shirt sitting in a chair with a newspaper held open. He barely looks over the top of the Wall Street Journal.

Ray walks up to the counter. Carl lingers, fidgeting. Ray sets his briefcase on the counter and click-clicks it open. The Hispanic fence man looks inside, and begins pulling out stacks of treasury checks.
</DIRECTION>

Ray gestures to Carl and he nervously sets his briefcase on the counter, fumbles with the first latch. The second. He flips it open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fence man casts his eyes down at a neat cache of Grade A Treasury. A lot of it. Then his eyes rise to Carl.
</DIRECTION>
<FENCE_MAN>

Carl's eyes flit to Ray. Ray's eyes flit to Carl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis crushes his newspaper down and lifts a big Colt Python from his lap just as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A section of sheetrock kicks open and THREE FEDERAL OFFICERS bust out, each clutching a handgun, SHOUTING inaudibly.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	F.B.I.! Get your face on the fuckin' floor! MOVE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Carl startled, does an almost effeminate dip down to one knee, but that knee is swept out from under him, slapping him flat onto plywood where he is instantly frisked down by the fence man who is wielding a 9 mm handgun. But the white collar criminal is more stunned by the fact that --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray is walking across the floor with his hands in his pockets over to the Mr. Coffee. He pours one, and adds some milk. Turns and watches the bust while opening a packet of Sweet n'Low.

Ray rests his weight against the coffee station, takes a careful sip. Carl is yanked to his feet by the fence man and he stands there, looking at Ray, baffled. Completely shocked.
</DIRECTION>

Coffee in hand, Ray walks briskly toward the door.
</DIRECTION>

Ray turns. Louis takes a few steps toward him, putting his gun back in his waistband.

<LOUIS>

Ray stands frozen, holding the door knob, and digesting what are apparently influential words.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make sure ya spell my name right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Ray just stares for a moment. Then hurries out the door.

Carl, being arm-gripped by two agents and photographed like a trout, gazes bewildered at the door.

<DIRECTION>
INT. FBI DIRECTOR'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
8x10 BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOS dealt like cards onto a table, one on top of another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1 -- an aerial shot of some wasteland.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
2 -- a closer bird's eye of the same, what looks like a NASA photo of Mars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
3 -- a vast expanse of the Great Plains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROBERT F. TULLY, Number-Two-in-Command, deals a fourth photo onto the table. He is an understated, fatherly man, well- manicured in cotton pencil-striped shirt, white-tab collar and tie. The photos and maps and files a foot deep on the huge table are neatly organized.
</DIRECTION>
<INTERCOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SA Levoi, Sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INTERCOM>
<TULLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TULLY>
<DIRECTION>
Seated, at the far end of the table, engrossed in the deep spread of information, SA (Special Agent) FRANK COUTURE is about to break the record for longest single ash on the end of a cigarette and the smoke forces his eyes into tight, concentrating, slits. "COOCH" as they call him in the Bureau has seen thirty years in some rough "provinces". He has survived the Hoover era and is a legend in the Sessions era but survival has honed an edge. An edge with a touch of ironic cop humor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray enters, walks into a firm shake.
</DIRECTION>
<TULLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TULLY>
<RAY>

	Mister Tully.

</TULLY>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No, no. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Ray sits nervously across from Cooch who looks up from the photos and studies the younger man through reading glasses and cigarette smoke, and he looks at him like he doesn't know who the hell he is or why he's sitting there.
</DIRECTION>
<TULLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TULLY>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah -- right.

Cooch sticks his cigarette in his left hand, shakes with his right.

</TULLY>
<COUTURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Ray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUTURE>
<DIRECTION>
The handshake is still locked. Cooch is still squinting at the younger agent. Ray obviously knows something about Agent Couture.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an honor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Tully leans back in his chair, crosses his legs casually.
</DIRECTION>
<TULLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray, we're taking you off the street. We need you out in South Dakota.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TULLY>
<DIRECTION>
Ray's enthusiasm suddenly deflates.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	South Dakota...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?

</RAY>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>

Ray looks completely baffled now, swinging a look from Cooch to Tully.
</DIRECTION>
<TULLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(scanning file)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.

</RAY>
<TULLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TULLY>
<DIRECTION>
Ray nods, looks from Tully to Cooch. What's going on here?
</DIRECTION>
<TULLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TULLY>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<TULLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TULLY>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Tully straightens the edges of a bureau memorandum.
</DIRECTION>
<TULLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TULLY>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --

<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --

A beat. Ray lowers his eyes to the photos.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Ray looks up at Cooch. Another uneasy beat. Cooch lights a cigarette as if lighting a cigarette was a science.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about it, Ray. As long as the people have proof that we sent them one of their own, no one's gonna ask you to weave baskets or make it rain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Ray sits before the files and photos, looking unsure. He has come to garner a promotion but has just been sent to The Graveyard. Or in the FBI argot, Indian Country.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tully pivots his leather chair in a full circle and slaps an assignment folder down in front of the young agent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE GREAT PLAINS - SOUTH DAKOTA - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The very landscape from opening image. Gentle waves of land, rolling out to touch the Black Hills. The sun rises up out of the distant silhouette like a waking God. HEARTBEAT DRUM. Hypnotic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then a car blows by, throwing up gravel and agate and gypsum. ZOOOOM! Right by us. Gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When a dense screen of red dust clears, an old, bent, metal sign at roadside becomes visible. It reads, through punched and rusted bullet holes: "Entering Bear Creek Indian Reservation."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEARTBEAT DRUM calls in the high-pitched, mournful voices of LAKOTA SINGERS. The same haunting song.

Cooch opens a folder that sits between them, and taking his eyes off the road for a dangerous five seconds, locates some photos, and hands them to Ray. Ray's expression tells us they are not pretty.

Ray considers this as he looks out at the unfamiliar terrain while on the RADIO, a D.J. speaks in LAKOTA LANGUAGE. Ray... back at Cooch, studying his face.

as they drive through the first settlement, a little, broken and scattered community, littered with wrecked cars on blocks, and overpopulated with hungry dogs. HEARTBEAT DRUM softly under.
</DIRECTION>

SIX INDIAN CHILDREN with dirty but beautiful faces and long blue black hair run alongside the car, curious. One of them YELLS SOMETHING we don't understand.

<DIRECTION>
PAST the trading post -- a white man's store -- where SIX OGLALA SIOUX -- four men, two women sit like wax figures, only their eyes moving to light on the freshly waxed government car.

A lone dog -- all its ribs showing -- chases, BARKING.

EXT. BADLANDS - SHORT TIME LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are on the Moon. Or Israel. But not America. Not any America we've ever seen. A thirty-mile eroded landscape of dunes and crevices, soft rock strata and fossils. Barren. And eerie. A LAKOTA DEATH SONG underscores the otherworldly ambiance of this place as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOES scuff through the gumbo and multi-colored stones. Two pair of black, spit-shined, lace-ups. Three. Tripping. Scuffing. And then a fourth pair. But they are not loafers. They are Georgio Brutini's and they belong to --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray, as he and Cooch follow two Special Agents from the regional office. SA MILES is about Cooch's age, balding. SA SHERMAN is closer to Ray's age but instead of a suit like the rest, he favors an army-green jacket. Neither is a South Dakota shit-kicker but transplanted field agents. All four shield their eyes with dark glasses, and here in the Badlands it is wise because the sun makes dunes shimmy and craters become faces. It plays mischief on the eye, making Ray and Sherman nearly trip on --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DEAD BODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lying face down in the rainbow sand. Dried blood and horse flies cover his blown out torso. The agents stand over him, breathless from the rugged walk.

The agents start back through the Badlands. Ray is already squatting a safe distance from the body, covering his nose with a kerchief while looking in the file.

Cooch takes a bended knee on the other side of the body. Flies buzz on and around the corpse.

Ray looks up impressed. Cooch rises and walks off gingerly, scanning the surroundings.

<RAY>

</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch is standing ten feet away, staring at the ground. Ray walks over, carefully. He follows Cooch's frown down at the twisted layers of earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE GROUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a circle has been etched deep in the soft gumbo, and in the center of the circle, a white eagle plume sticks straight up, dancing in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch and Ray each lower themselves to their haunches to study the strange sight. Cooch puts his reading glasses on, stares at it. Then lights a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray hefts up a camera and begins CLICKING off shots. He starts moving around it, taking shots at different angles. And then the sound of a DISTANT MOTOR draws both agent's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
way out in the bizarre moonscape of eroded rock and earth, a lone figure on a motorcycle bounces and grinds, born out of a silvery heat mirage. It's fifty yards off but heading straight for us. The HEARTBEAT DRUM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE - RAY AND COOCH try to make the figure out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BADLANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the archaic mud-caked Harley chugs and stalls, spits and choices, and begins an incredible drive straight up the steep side of this natural wonder. At the throttle is an imposing figure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WALTER CROW HORSE is a portly Indian in his late-thirties with a black reservation hat worn low over a face that seems to have been cast from a bust of Sitting Bull. Sitting Bull with aviator shades. Denim jacket over checkered shirt. Faded jeans. Well broken duct-taped boots. His hair is worn long in tight duel braids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rusted bike bajas up and down slopes, finally stalling out, twenty feet or so from the murder site. Crow Horse swings his bulk off the bike like dismounting a horse. He looks around suspiciously then pulls a rolled-up blanket from the carrier rack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LEO LITTLE SKY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lies in death. Crow Horse's boots move in stealthily, creaking like saddle leather.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He squats and looks at the corpse... then looks around with animal alertness. He reaches into the front pocket of his jacket and pulls out some Bull Durham tobacco. He pinches some and offers it to the four directions around the body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He then unrolls the blanket, begins to move the dead man... sense something and wheels to see Cooch standing behind him, one hand behind his back where his gun must be, and the other hand holding up open wallet. The sun hits his badge.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse hawks his eyes onto a big rock, a full second before Ray steps out, his .45 drawn but held at ease.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse slowly raises his arms as Ray moves up to him, studying him.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<CROW_HORSE>

</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Ray frisks the Indian, finds an old leather wallet, and then a gun. A .38.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?

Cooch walks around to the front of Crow Horse, and studies him.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know where I am. I'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. It's your call. Who are you?

</COOCH>
<RAY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. A long, dead of South Dakota, Badlands pause. Cooch turns and looks at Ray who holds up the open wallet, revealing a badge. Like Cooch's it shines in the sun.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter Crow Horse. Tribal Police.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch stands staring at the Indian... then takes a few steps over to Ray and grabs the wallet. He examines it. Then looks at Crow Horse and laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a fucking cop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
The Indian cop has plenty of time to get up on his own but he kneels there, tauntingly, waiting for Ray to help him. Ray walks over and offers a hand. Crow Horse takes it, and pulls himself up, looking square into Ray's sunglasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch walks over and hands the officer his wallet, and his .23. Crow Horse takes the items, eyeing the older agent.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Ray does a take but quickly recovers, meeting Crow Horse's scrutinizing gaze. Crow Horse nods to Ray, and Ray nods back in case it's the Indian thing to do. Crow Horse nods again. Ray nods again.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Ray stares at Crow Horse, uneasy. The wind sings through the Badlands.

<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>

Crow Horse says something in Sioux to Ray. Ray just stares.

<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</CROW_HORSE>
<RAY>

Crow Horse is staring at Ray.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a nice suit.

Ray looks offended. Cooch puts a hand on Crow Horse's shoulder and walks him toward his beat-up motorcycle.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>

Crow Horse turns and looks at Ray. Ray is quick this time.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.

</RAY>

Crow Horse appears to be getting on his bike when suddenly he moves like a cat and lays his knife to the dead man's head. He cuts away a patch of hair.

Cooch and Ray stand there, watching Crow Horse mount his bike and push off down a nasty slope back through the Badlands. He starts his motor. It dies. Then starts again.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?

</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Ray and Cooch look off across the Badlands, as far out of their element as they can be.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON - THE WHITE EAGLE PLUME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in the circle in the sand, fluttering in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gold spit-shined Le Baron eases to a crawl, passing an old wooden sign. "Leaving Bear Creak Indian Reservation."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And immediately pulling in front of a squat old bar with a burned out neon Miller light. DWIGHT YOAKUM croons "Youuuuuu- Got-Your Little-Ways" on the jukebox from inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Buffalo Butte bar has several cracked and sun-bleached buffalo skulls hanging off the edge of its flat roof and big faded white letters painted across the front read: "No Indians Allowed."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(This sign actually exists today in the res-line border town of Scenic, South Dakota). The car pulls up beside a pick-up and parks. Ray and Cooch step out, careful to walk wide around a PITBULL in the bed of the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WHITE LOCAL walks out of the bar and looks askance at the suits. As the two feds approach the bar, Cooch looks up at the warning sign. Ray sees it too.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, Ray. You're gonna have to wait in the car. I'll bring you out a cheeseburger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
The young agent smiles, amused, starts to enter the bar but --
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray spins quickly, paranoid about entering. But the man calling to them is --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An Indian himself. TRIBAL PRESIDENT OLIVER CLEAR MOON, a small man in his late fifties who peers out at the agents through fat bifocals. He wears a straw cowboy hat, red windbreaker and his hair is cut short, or "bobtailed" as the Indians say.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clear Moon is walking away from a parked pick-up truck, toward the white men, eyeing the two with deep curiosity.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR_MOON>
<DIRECTION>
(heavy Indian accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You made it. Was-te.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR_MOON>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch discreetly peeks into a folder as he walks toward the man
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must be... President Clear Bone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<CLEAR_MOON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clear Moon.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to the sky)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Moon. You must be the Sioux.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR_MOON>
<DIRECTION>
He is pointing his long, skinny finger at Cooch.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. That's Ray here. Ray...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<RAY>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Clear Moon beholds the young agent with hopeful eyes, a smile breaking across his flaccid brown skin. He takes Ray's hand in a respectful double-clutch and grips him tightly... almost desperately.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR_MOON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's about time they sent us one of our own. Was-te.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR_MOON>
<DIRECTION>
He keeps pumping Ray's hand, looking into his face with great admiration. Cooch looks on with amusement.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR_MOON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Things are no good here. It is like war zone. We need an official who understands what is good for the Indian people. Who knows Indian way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR_MOON>
<DIRECTION>
Clear Moon has not released Ray's arm as he leads them to a string of seedy motel units across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought we were staying on the reservation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLEAR_MOON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR_MOON>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLEAR_MOON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR_MOON>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's starving, Mr. Clear Moon. Get him some raw kidney. He hasn't had any Indian food in days...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
And Clear Moon guides them through the front door of room 13. Ray looks over his shoulder threateningly at Cooch who winks and pats his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RESERVATION LINE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lone headlight appears out of the black. HEARTBEAT DRUM. But faster. Relentless. A "res" car, a dented, rusted, peeling old station wagon, drives slowly toward the reservation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then suddenly, someone steps in front of the car. A BIG MAN in cowboy boots and blue jeans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL - ROOM 13 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray lies in bed. Awake. He is hanging off the bed with a file open on the floor and using the moon to light photos and memorandums. And then he hears LAUGHTER outside. And GLASS BREAK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets out of bed quickly, snatching up his pants, putting their on, and going to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV - OUT WINDOW:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEVERAL LOCALS out in front of the bar help a middle-aged INDIAN MAN out of the station wagon.
</DIRECTION>
<WHITE_LOCAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where you goin'? Back to the res?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE_LOCAL>
<DIRECTION>
A young local bends down behind the Indian while another shoves him, sending him tripping over the bent man and onto his back in the dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<WHITE_LOCAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What ya doin'? You drunk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE_LOCAL>
<DIRECTION>
MORE LOCALS come out from the bar, beers and drinks and interested in what's going on.

REVERSE - RAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
at the window, observes. Cooch enters from the connecting room, puffy-eyed but quickly buttoning his shirt. He shares Ray's view.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's take a walk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Ray is transfixed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Indian man, is pushed into a stumble, and caught by another white man as a little game of catch takes place. Cooch, stepping into the circle, shirt half unbuttoned, hair a mess, looks on. Then steps in front of a big local and catches the Indian as he comes stumbling. He holds onto him, looking at the faces that turn his way. Ray steps up beside him, looking tense.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's goin' on here?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't walk across the goddamn street without some breed-ass fallin' all over me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
And then Cooch shoves the Indian with all his might back across the road. The locals resume their fun, and Cooch looks at a local man and shares a chattering laugh that makes Ray do a serious take.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch out now, he wants a kiss, Ray, wants a kiss --
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
The Indian ends up stumbling back toward Ray, and Ray catches him this time. The man maintains a perfect vacant expression and keeps acting as though nothing of the sort is happening. But he is dizzy, and exhausted, and Ray keeps him from falling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch looks at Ray. Their eyes meet. Ray shoves the man forward. This time, instead of catching him, the local on the receiving end, hauls off and punches him in the face. The Indian drops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch runs in, grabs the Indian under the arms and drags him back to his car.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead, skin, get your ass back on your sacred land. Get outta here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
He shoves him behind the wheel as the locals crowd around. They don't see Cooch throw the wheel stick in drive, and lean into the man's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get outta here. Drive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch slams the door, and kicks it, and the vehicle lurches forward. A beer can clanks off the rear window, and rolls clanking into the middle of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray stands there with the locals as they all watch the car drive off across the reservation line. Cooch, belly sticking out of his unbuttoned shirt, and a breathless smile on his face, heads to the bar without breaking stride. This man has done "underground" before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUFFALO BUTTE BAR - NIGHT - SHORT TIME LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch and Ray sit in a booth with DENNIS VAUGHN, a strapping local man, ranch-raised, and gentlemanly. In fact, downright likeable.
</DIRECTION>
<DENNIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what type of salesmen are you gentlemen anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENNIS>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Liquor. We heard they like their drink on the reservation, and we were gonna see if we couldn't unload some surplus on the way to Nebraska.

BROOKS, a small, older man with a feed store cap and a clean cowboy shirt, comes over with a beer and a pensive look on his face. He pulls up a chair and positions himself at the end of the booth.
</DIRECTION>
<DENNIS>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BROOKS>
<DENNIS>
	<DIALOGUE>

Cooch laughs good-naturedly. Ray smiles. But Brooks looks offended.

EXT. OLD TRAILER - ACROSS FROM BADLANDS – SUNRISE
</DIRECTION>

Ray walks to the front door of a war-torn trailer that is halfway swallowed by weeds and plants. It is static out here. Dead still. Ray approaches the front door. There is a huge hole in it. He knocks above the hole.
</DIRECTION>

After a moment, the door opens a crack. A dark, weather-beaten face barely shows.

</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
A tattered chair is pushed against the door, covering the hole. Ray stands up, turns on the steps. And before he can let out a flustered sigh, he spots something across the dirt road. Something that makes him remove his shades, look again. Whatever it is, it doesn't make him happy, and he is hurrying across the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BADLANDS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A motorcycle, parked between the road and the badlands. We've seen the ancient bike before. Ray walks past it, looking at it.

He pushes his shades up on the bridge of his nose and looks down into the moonscape.

Walter Crow Horse is down there, on his haunches, "feel tracking", laying his fingers inside tracks and reading them. He doesn't even look up at the sound of the FBI agent's footsteps.

</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>

	The man you want... stepped outta the car, dragged Leo out, laid him down. Then walked over here and made a circle in the earth with a stick. I can't find the stick. He stuck an eagle plume in the circle, got back in his car, dustin' his own prints with a pine bough for about six feet, but he missed a print, right here, see. He got in his car and went Hell- bent-for-Holy-Sunday outta here. He ditched that pine bough three miles across the flat, in the Little Bear River, it floated down to Thundershield Gap. The car hit paved road, and was outta here.

Leo was killed right here.

<DIRECTION>
EXT MAISY BLUE LEGS HOUSE – BLACK TAIL DISTRICT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A trailer sits off from the river in beaten solitude. There are two junked cars and one burned black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wind blows across deep bald tire tracks. Ray walks slowly beside them, surveying, following them to a place where they become puckers and skids next to a dilapidated outhouse. There is a shotgun blast in the side of it. Ray studies it, enters the outhouse. Exits, and walks the rutted gumbo earth to where it meets rolling hills of golden grass. He stands here, mesmerized.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHICKENS scratch around in the dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like so many far-off res homesteads, this is a haunting place. Made more so by a persistent SQUEAKING, a rusty, metallic squeal coming from --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WATER PUMP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
across the yard, where MAISY BLUE LEGS, a Sioux elder, works the handle. She wears thick bifocals and keeps her hair under a bandanna. No water comes forth from the pump, and she tries again and again until she breaks a sweat. And then she sees the waal'cu standing out there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Urgently, she turns and starts back to her trailer with an empty coffee can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray starts after her.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>

She mounts the metal steps. Ray is losing her. He gets a foot on the bottom step, and attempts something he does not want to do.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Blue Legs. I'm Indian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Halfway through the screendoor, Maisy turns and looks at the young man in suit and shades.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Sioux.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Maisy lowers her bifocals, studies him. Then walks in, slaps the door shut, and locks it. A towel hung as a shade folds down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray lingers at the bottom of the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
And he walks around the side of the trailer, looking at the ground. In the gaping space between the trailer blocks, and the grass, there is much junk stored, and Ray kneels to look. He is drawn to a pair of cowboy boots, caked with dried mud. He picks up a boot, looks at the sole, then touches the mud. His fingers break through the hardened crust and come back moist and blue. He looks at this sniffs it. There is a tense, water-torture like tempo coming from the old pump where water barely drips onto a hub cap in the dirt. Ray sets the boot down. Goes to grab the other boot and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a WESTERN DIAMOND BACK RATTLER coils out from the shade of the boot, RATTLING and HISSING from white mouth and three- inch fangs, and Ray has done a backflip and roll, slapping his shoulder holster and pulling lead and BLAM! BLAAAM! he unloads two, and the reptile is so dead, there's not even enough snake left to make a truck-stop key chain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He kneels there, flushed in the face, holding his breath and double-clutching his gun. The SHOTS ECHO through the Badlands like the aftermath of dynamite. From inside the trailer, he can hear CRYING. A low moaning. Praying softly.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. Mrs. Blue Legs! It's okay!

POV:

off in a backfield, lit by a hot fire, a small round hut covered in patchwork quilts, canvas and buffalo hide. A strange mist floats around it, and from inside, voices are heard -- A DRUMMING AND CHANTING in LAKOTA. And EAGLE SOUNDS. Dozens of shrill whistles. Are there birds inside this thing?

An INDIAN YOUTH DOOR TENDER with shoulder length hair falling over a T-shirt, steps out of the dark and walks to the fire. He prods it with a broken pitch fork.

Cooch moves up on the sweat lodge, looking quizzically at it, trying to figure out how to open it. He grabs a canvas flap at the front and after a moment's hesitation and a look at Ray, he tears the flap away.

A BLAST OF 200 DEGREE STEAM explodes forth and Cooch dances back, throwing up his rifle.

Grandpa Reaches crawls out first, ignoring the "Hands on your head" order from Cooch. His eyes move back and forth between the two agents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIVE MORE INDIANS, from 16-45 come out, looking confused. Cooch makes the towel-wrapped men spread out in a line. The old man is speaking to the others in LAKOTA, and Ray steps up to him, cuts him off.

<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hands on your head, Sir. Come on, come on...

The archaic figure just looks through him. Starts to walk away. Ray takes his thin arm. He locks eyes with the old man. Slowly, he obeys, raising his hands and laying them on his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the lodge, the last man emerges. It's Crazy Horse reborn out of the burning sage. JIMMY LOOKS TWICE is in his mid- thirties -- big, well over two-hundred pounds. But lean. His braids fall nearly to his hips. His face is handsome but at the moment, twisted in a full-blood's scowl.

As Cooch starts marching Looks Twice toward the house, Ray keeps an eye on the departing. One of them stops halfway to the fence and turns. Grandpa Reaches looks at Ray with eyes that have seen one hundred and one hard years in Indian Country.

Whatever has taken his arm has done so with such force, his body jolts like he's touched raw voltage.

Jimmy Looks Twice spins from the porch with a skillfully executed back kick, knocking Ray off the step and to the ground. The Indian bolts like a deer into the darkness.

<DIRECTION>
Ray rolls in the grass, throwing his M-16 up. He hesitates. But only for a moment before FIRING and decimating the corner gutter, a junked car, several trees. But no sign of Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>

Cooch falls back in the grass badly mauled. His arm has been ripped open down to the bone.

Ray takes off, crashing through weeds, into a stream, wading through mud. He throws his flashlight left and right. He crosses the river, shines the light in a field of wild sage. Nothing. He runs like a sprinter, looking everywhere. But as he enters an --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OPEN FIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
all he finds is Jimmy's towel. He picks it up and looks around the area, breathing heavily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then suddenly, something leaps up out of the grass. Ray swings his M-16 up, ready to blast. But it is a DEER, taking off into a mystical blue night. THE DRUM. Beating fast. Heavy.

TURTLESHELL RATTLE. EAGLE BONE WHISTLES.

A SMALL TRAILER that has thirty junked cars in its yard and serves as a reservation parts store is crawling with FEDERAL MARSHALS; car doors are being opened, trunks. TRACKING DOGS run through the cars. WARPATH DRUMS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- A BELL UH 1-B "HUEY" HELICOPTER chutters low over the grasslands, over the Badlands, flattening wheat. It swings down over the main settlement. CHILDREN gather in the street to look up at it but then run when --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- SIX FEDERAL CARS come down the main road. They pass by --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- THE FRONT PORCH OF THE TRADING POST where Ray stands, talking to the elders. A few of the same from earlier but several new ones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is sweat-drenched, and has shed his jacket and tie. He is showing them photos of Jimmy but getting no response. And then, for a little iodine on top of that, a MOTORCYCLE ENGINE, spitting and choking and coughing comes around the corner, Walter Crow Horse, manning the handlebars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls up to Ray and just looks at him. DRUMS FADE.

EXT. GRANDPA SAM REACHES TRAILER - OUTSIDE SETTLEMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silent. The unnerving silence of the Great Plains filled only by FLYS, big horseflies, buzzing around drying sage that hangs from the rafters of a shade arbor. A GOAT stands under it, just gazing across --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the vast spread of grass and dry land where an ancient Airstream trailer sits lop-sided. Sheets are hung as curtains. Six old cars -- two from the early 50'a -- sit stripped to the hubs on blocks in the overgrown grass. The air is dry and heavy and the only sound is --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLYS. Ray swats at them as he steps over a truck seat that lies in the grass, stuffing and springs hanging out. Crow Horse walk. a few steps ahead, toward the trailer.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why does he wanna see me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?

Crow Horse stops walking, making Ray do the same.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you go see an elder, you always bring some tobacco as a gift.

Ray reaches into his shirt pocket and fishes out a pack of Marlboro. Crow Horse glances at it, and shrug-nods. They continue on toward the trailer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grandpa Samuel Reaches sits in a taped and tuckered easy chair, his alert black eyes moving from side to side. We recognize him from the sweat lodge ceremony at Looks Twice' although today he wears a straw cowboy hat giving him a more youthful look despite a face like a map of the Badlands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wears a vest over a western shirt, baggy work slacks, old cowboy boots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His brown wrinkled hands run over the top of the Marlboro pack as if he's reading braille.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse sits across from him on a stool. Ray leans on one of the plain green walls, looking uncomfortable. A three foot adhesive fly strip hangs from the ceiling, thick with dead ones. There is a black and white TV with Sesame Street wailing, honking and guffawing through static.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grandpa fixes his eyes on Ray for only split seconds at a time but one gets the feeling he's doing an incredibly deep reading of the young man. Slowly, he sits up -- focusing intensely on Ray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to speak. A hoarse, strained, string of LAKOTA, spoken like it used to be, gesturing toward Ray. When he finishes, he sits back in his chair. Ray looks intrigued.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did he say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray looks puzzled. Crow Horse laughs bull-wild as Grandpa takes up a fly swatter and takes out a big horsefly. The old man begins speaking Indian again.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says there's something wrong with Big Bird -- he's crazy,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stops laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says you stopped the Inipi ceremony last night...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse turns a questioning look at Ray. Ray doesn't flinch.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He knows me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says he saw you in a vision some time ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse stops translating suddenly even though the old man continues speaking. Crow Horse looks concerned, and ASKS A QUESTION IN LAKOTA. We don't know what he's asking but the tone is absolute amazement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This question triggers an exchange between he and Grandpa, the old one getting angry. Grandpa wins.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess he had this vision some time ago, in the Moon of the Popping Trees -- uh, back in the winter. He says you come from Wasi'cu city in the East but that your people... way back... are of the Minniconjou Sioux. But you yourself don't know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray's brow is drawn tense as he stares at the old Indian, absorbing the translation. Grandpa speaks more fervently now, incorporating Indian sign. Each time Grandpa does the hard Sioux HAND SLAP, Ray blinks.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says he knew you'd be coming to Bear Creek. He was told. It is the will of Tunkasilia -- the grandfather that you come here. He says let's smoke the caanunpa the sacred pipe, symbol of truth. So that there will be no lies between us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
The old man has taken a long wooden stem and a red stone bowl from a beaded pipe bag. He joins the two together then begins offering a pinch of tobacco to the Four Directions. While this goes on, Ray fidgets.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's he smoke in that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.

The old man is offering the pipe to Ray.

</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't smoke with him, it means you're hiding something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray takes the pipe, looks at it... then passes it to Crow Horse. The big Indian takes it from Ray, giving him a long eye, then offering the pipe to The Directions before smoking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse puffs hard, eyes closed, then slowly releases some smoke upward. Ray watches it climb and fade. The old man then takes up an old turtle shell rattle. He speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says Wakan. Sacred. Five hundred year old turtleshell rattle, passed down from the Grandfathers. Heavy duty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes the rattle very slightly, moving it in front of Ray. He speaks just above a whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says, it is good. The Spirits are here. The Spirits want to know what you're doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>

Ray smirks.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him I'm trying to find the man who murdered Leo Fast Elk. Ask him if he knows where he is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse asks the old man in Lakota. No answer. The pipe is back to grandpa, and he offers it to the Directions, to the Earth then upward before smoking himself. He begins to speak again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Passionately. In long glottal Sioux sentences, adding sign, fingers crossing, brushing an arm, a slap here and there,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is working himself into an excited state, and Ray keeps looking at Crow Horse, very interested in the old man's answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally Grandpa's breath comes up short and wheezing, he ends his oratory with a solid hand slap.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did he say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said he doesn't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse ignores him. Grandpa speaks again. More hand language.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The old man is staring at Ray while whispering to Crow Horse. He strokes his badger claw necklace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse looks at Ray and seems hesitant to translate this new piece of information.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... Grandpa likes to trade; no one stops by here without gettin' stuck in the old Indian barter. He, uh... he likes your shades.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
Grandpa smiles toothlessly. Ray who has his driving glasses in hand, lifts them to say "these?" but Grandpa sees it as an accepted deal, and swiftly removes his necklace. He holds it out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray slowly, hesitantly surrenders his sunglasses, and takes the necklace. Crow Horse bursts into laughter and so does Grandpa, enjoying a good trade. He draws a hand through the air in a sort of horizontal karate chop, meaning done deal. Ray looks confused. Out of his element. And out of his shades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another fly gets snagged on sticky tape.

<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray stares vacantly.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He also said "listen to the water."

SLACK TAIL POWWOW GROUNDS - RES - LATER

CLOSE ON A TERRIFYING FACE -- painted in blazing red and yellow, black around the eyes. A ridge of feathers high along the hairline, and a mouth open, tongue trilling -- SCREAMING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WACIPI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is going down. A Powow. Held in the center of a huge arbor. This DANCER, a traditional Kit Fox dancer, is dressed in authentic costume and is dancing with TEN OTHERS dressed in various traditional garb and paints.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under the arbor, TWO HUNDRED INDIANS in modern clothing sit on blankets or in lawn chairs, watching the dancing. A group of SINGERS sit around a big drum, beating on it, and wailing the song that keeps the dancers hopping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIXTY CARS (res beaters) are parked off around the arbor, less interested kids sitting on them, smoking cigarettes. A few actually have MTV hair-cuts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drifting through the cars and people are Special Agents Couture, Miles, Sherman and Levoi. They stroll through, incongruously, checking out faces. Vehicles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray slows his step and takes in --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE POWWOW CIRCLE

as the dance ends. WEAK APPLAUSE. The POWWOW CALLER, a big Sioux with a crew-cut and cowboy shirt, speaks through a scratchy P.A. system.

An OLD-INDIAN MAN sitting in a lawn chair, removes his cowboy hat and reaches down toward a blanket. He brings up his VFW hat, adorned with medals and puts it on. Slowly, he rises, and shuffles out to the center pole along with --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOUR OTHER VETERANS who have exchanged cowboy hats for veteran's caps. There is even a traditional dancer in there, wearing a veteran cap. As a mournful WAR SONG is banged out by the singers, a flag is unrolled by the veterans. An American Flag. Unrolled, and set on the mast. And together, all five Indian men, hoist --

high. Slowly it climbs. Proudly. It blows in the hot South Dakota wind.

Chasing Hawk hands the mic over to another Warrior. MAGGIE EAGLE BEAR would be the most beautiful woman Ray has even seen if she was not the meanest-looking. Her thick black hair falls over a denim jacket down below her horse-hair belt. Her faded jeans are stuffed into worn cowboy boots. And she is full of fire. She begins speaking in LAKOTA. Fluently. And with hand sign, like the old man.

And he slowly retreats to his lawn chair under the arbor.

Chasing Hawk, Maggie and the other Warriors strut up to the agents. All but one who is bound to a wheelchair. We've seen RICHARD YELLOW BIRD, the big Cheyenne who wears a Red Power baseball cap, an earring, and thick bifocals -- in one of the file photos. His arms are plastered with tattoos.

Yellow Bird sits there, staring up at him through thick glasses But then Maggie Eagle Bear takes the handles of Yellow Bird's wheel chair. She looks at Ray with eyes that are choke- cherry black, eyes that look right through him. He returns the glare. And then she pushes Yellowbird forward and leaves the feds alone.

The front door creaks open, and the subject dashes back out. In the dark we cannot latch onto features.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the junker van comes alive, guns onto the dirt road, racing toward the running Indian who gets the door of the truck open but freezes in the van's highbeams as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray leaps out, M-16 in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FBI, freeze, Motherfucker -- drop it, drop it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Ray maneuvers in Quantico fashion, keeping the rifle on the Indian's back. The Indian drops what he's holding. And turns around. It's not a he. We've seen her before. At the Powwow. Maggie Eagle Bear. Her hair is pulled back tight, braided.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray moves in toward her, surprised at first, but still cautious
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn around, put your hands on the roof of the truck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
She does what he tells her. As Ray moves in on her, he notices an INDIAN CHILD sitting in the passenger seat, looking out into the highbeams, frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray toes Maggie's legs out wider, frisks her one-handed, pats down her boots.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>

<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>

</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie turns around, looks Ray in the eye. He looks self- conscious in the cowboy hat.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The people are glad they sent you. They usually send in guys who come at ya with highbeams, screamin' "drop it, Motherfucker", stick a gun in your face, frisk ya down. Even if ya got a child with ya. No, it's good to have ya. It's gonna be was-te times on the res.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray is looking down at what she dropped. A bundle lying in the grass. He bends down, starts to untie it.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was gonna warn ya about messin' with somebody's medicine bundle but I forgot you know all about that stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BUNDLE -- an eagle skull, tobacco strings, sage, sweet grass, and several white eagle feathers.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MAGGIE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.

<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who did?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>

</RAY>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray.

If this information doesn't throw Ray, the use of his first name does.

<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you gonna keep that medicine bundle or are you gonna respect its power?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray is holding the medicine bundle. He deliberates, then hands it over. She takes it with careful hands, casting a somewhat surprised look up at him.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?

Maggie gets in the truck, starts it up. She looks out at him, studying him. Trying to figure him out. HEADLIGHTS are coming fast from down the main road.

</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie drives forward, turning down another little wagon road, and bumping into the black night only moments before, Cooch's Le Baron pulls in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SA Miles and Sherman's vehicle pull in behind it. The regional feds fall in behind Cooch, everyone, packing rifles.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>

Ray turns, nodding. An FBI van pulls in from the other direction and FOUR AGENTS empty out, wearing FBI windbreakers and heavily-armed.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_SHERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do we got, Ray?
	</DIALOGUE>

<RAY>

<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd she say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch nods. The agents form a tight unit out below the upside down flag.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see it.

</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Ray reaches inside his pant leg, down around his boot and carefully removes a white eagle feather. He gingerly tucks it in a plastic bag.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Way to go, Raymond. Miles, take that to lab. Sherman, I want you to go back to base and produce some written material. Something that indicates that our girl Maggie is leaking information to us. And make sure that material finds its way into the hands of the Warrior Movement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Sherman and Miles, take off. Cooch, an impressive master of COINTELPRO, now turns to the van squad.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gentlemen missed that medicine basket. Go back through the house, and make sure you missed nothing else. And lay some wire, too. Let's do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
The van squad moves toward the house, leaving Cooch and Ray alone in the highbeams that light the yard.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Ray nods, impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch bends down near the road, touches the dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her oil pan is shot.

Cooch wipes the oil on a handkerchief as he rises, smiling playfully at Ray. He starts back toward his car. Some sort of bird is COOING in the night.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get a tail on her, Ray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Ray looks up at the upside down flag. Then watches Cooch walking way.

	Cooch.

<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A long way from home. You be careful out there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch, standing there with his glasses on and his right arm bandaged, looks tired, too. He gets in his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the yard, Ray starts for the van, the res dog, trying to follow. He chases it away. And then as he gets closer to the van, he looks up to investigate the COOING SOUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE TOP OF THE FLAG POLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
there is a shadow. What looks to be a large bird. It just hovers. In the shadows.

Ray looks up at the pole, watching. Then walking on.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEAR CREEK RES - SUNRISE

Mind-blowing sunrise of airbrush red. Clusters of lodge-pole pine. The spectacular mesa. PAINT HORSES graze in a field, a few out in the center of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the old man comes down the front steps in a frail walk, carrying a paper plate. He steps down into the sage clusters that grow just off his trailer, and offers the plate up toward the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He then stoops, and scrapes a half-eaten English muffin, some potato chips and half a banana onto the Earth in a neat pile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He straightens his back the best he can, looks up again, and prays softly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BADLANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
possess an otherworldly beauty at this magic hour, a maze of shadows and rainbows. In the distance we cannot mistake the frame of Walter Crow Horse. He's out there, long hair blowing against the white bluffs. Stalking. Tracking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE VILLAGE ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a puppy chases a hen in a klutzy, innocent manner then bumps into the tire of a parked car. Taking a shot at doghood, he hikes his leg, squirts a hubcap belonging to --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch's Le Baron. Cooch leans on the hood, drinking a coffee from a foam-plastic cup, and supervising SIX G-MEN who have a map spread out over the hood and are discussing it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAGGIE EAGLE BEAR'S HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is way out in a remote corner of the res, a little home, trailer and tipi right on the river. The river is rushing hard this morning, catching the light of the sun. Maggie's truck is parked in front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out at the river, Maggie, her hair long and unbrushed, and wearing an extra large T-shirt and nothing else is hauling water in buckets from the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE INDIAN CHILDREN are with her, helping her. Near the house, an OLD WOMAN in bifocal glasses, feeds some chickens, and a cat that gathers with the chickens and eats feed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OLD VAN – NEAR MAGGIE'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray, still in his field clothes sits, training binoculars on the distant house. He opens a carton of milk, drinks some. Then hears a whimpering. In the passenger seat sits the three legged res dog. Ray has taken him with him. He drinks some milk, then opens the carton up fully and sticks it out so the dog can lap it up. Ray laughs in disbelief, shaking his head.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For all I know, you're Jimmy. And you're just waiting for a shot at my jugular. Drink, Jimmy. Milk is good for you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
The dog is lapping the milk, desperately. And then a ROARING. A motorcycle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE SIDE MIRROR: Crow Horse, racing up on the left of the van. Ray pulls his hat down low, and sits back. The motorcycle passes on the left, slowing enough so that Crow Horse can flip Ray the middle finger. Then he races on, far down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray sits there, shaking his head. He'll let it go. Bullshit. He starts the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRIBAL POLICE SHOOTING RANGE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse guns in, sliding in dirt up to the run-down, low budget shooting range -- six plastic milk jugs on sticks, jammed in the mud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later, the van hammers in. Parks. Ray gets out. He's removed his hat so as not to invite any crap from Crow Horse.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.

Ray executes a hard, slapping, "up your ass" gesture.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a nice day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse bursts into laughter in his raspy, staccato laugh. He walks off a few steps, picks up a spent shell and pitches it. His laughter simmers and he gets serious.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.

	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse fingers an eagle feather that hangs from his hat band.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --

	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.

<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see the connection.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The connection is, it did a head number on him. He's petrified of cars. Won't drive. I've known him all my life, and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. He rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it. The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car.

<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.

Ray lets a pent-up sigh escape.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>

</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse chews this over, unable to hide a nagging frustration. He shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When Leo was dumped out there in the Badlands, he was dropped on his back. Our man made an effort to turn him over, onto his face. It's an old Ind'n belief that if a dead man is turned face down, his spirit won't leave. And in the killer's case, it won't come back and jump all over his shit. That's an Ind'n thing a white man wouldn't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
The two of them stand there, thinking this over. Ray takes out his notebook and starts writing. Crow Horse walks away, turns to face the propped up targets.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's the way it is. Write it down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
To punctuate, Crow Horse slaps leather, draws his .38, and begins blasting at the milk bottles. He hits the bank. A tree. One of the posts. But not a single target.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he is done, he looks over his gun, disappointed. Starts reloading. Ray starts laughing, looking at the missed targets
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You laugh all you want, Breed. Sunset tonight, I get my man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>

Ray looks at Crow Horse, sees that he's serious, and follows him toward his motorcycle.

<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, Crow Horse. I'm listening. I'm listening to the trees, to the stones. Who is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse turns toward Ray, and creates a long dramatic pause.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damned if I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
And he hauls his bulk onto his motorbike.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the Old One. He did a Yuwipi ceremony last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse winks at Ray as he slams the kickstart. To no avail.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>

And Crow Horse nails his kick start. The BIKE ROARS alive and the Indian works the throttle hard, leaving gravel and black exhaust. Ray stands there, drifting between logic and instinct. He looks at his watch, then starts at a slow, thoughtful shuffle toward his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dust-buzzard broncs and bounces down Grandpa's driveway, coming to a stop near the wrecked cars. Crow Horse dismounts and unhooks a carton of smokes from the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later, the junker van pulls in, bouncing and shaking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse stares at the approaching vehicle, his eyes hidden behind Ray's former shades. He cracks a slow smile because --

Ray is stepping quickly from the van, and carrying two packs of Marlboros.

INT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER

Grandpa sits in his chair, his black eyes moving smoothly from side to side. Smoke enshrouds his ancient face, giving the sense of another time and place. He speaks LAKOTA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse, sitting on a stool across from him, holds The Pipe. He passes it to Ray who sits in a busted lawn chair next to him. The room is dark as the sun sets out the window in red and purple. Ray looks at the pipe. Grandpa will not speak until Ray smokes. And so he does, drawing on the stem, awkwardly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEARTBEAT DRUM as Grandpa speaks Indian.

<CROW_HORSE>

<DIRECTION>
Ray looks at Crow Horse, searching for a hint of lightness. But there is only great reverence as he watches Ray blow smoke upward.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says, in the Yuwipi ceremony last night, he saw you... going back into the land beyond Red Deer Table. I was with you. But that was all the Spirits let him see so he doesn't know if you were killed or not. But he thinks you probably were.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray smirks as he passes the pipe to Grandpa. Crow Horse looks nervous. Grandpa offers the pipe to the directions and then disengages the bowl from the stem. He speaks again. Crow Horse translates.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go to the land where the Elk-People- used-to-live and you will find the answers you came here looking for. But you must go as two. That is the vision. I have spoken. And this is so.

	You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DIRT ROAD NEAR EAGLE BEAR'S - RES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The van sits parked down the road from Maggie's dimly-lit home. Ray sits behind the wheel, watching the house. LOCUSTS make a steady and unnerving sound. It is black. Black under big sky. Ray lets his head sag out the open window and he takes in the vastness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV: stars. Millions of stars. And an incredible full moon. It hangs huge over distant fields, a perfect sphere. The top half of the moon is yellow, the bottom half a lava red.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE - RAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stares at it, lost in thought. From Maggie's house, he hears someone SINGING. Singing a traditional SUNDANCE SONG while they haul water from the creek. A WOMAN'S VOICE, trilling out the beautiful but haunting "hey-o-hey-o-hey-o-hey-ohhhhh."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray just sits, listening. And then something draws his attention to his rearview mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The res dog, lying in the back seat is GROWLING. Lip curled back, growling low.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray looks at him, looks out the window. Blackness. Nothing but the sound of locusts. And a slight crosswind in the wheat fields. The dog stops growling. And Ray fixes his gaze on the house again, lifting a pair of binoculars and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOOOOOM! The rear windshield is SHATTERED by an explosion. Ray throws himself low across the passenger seat -- BOOOOOM! The driver's side window and part of the door explodes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RES ROAD NEAR EAGLE BEAR'S

The federal van is HAMMERED BY GUNFIRE. All the windows, shattered, the metal doors splayed. Someone is going for the kill,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PASSENGER DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is thrown open just as its window implodes, and Ray slides out belly first, gripping his M-16 and crawling like a dog soldier into tall wheat at roadside as the car, the road, the wheat, the dirt, the night are slammed by gunfire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The res dog overtakes Ray and vanishes in the wheat. Ray vanishes, too. It is quiet for a moment, then Ray, pops up ten feet away, and UNLOADS THE M-16, in a left to right, clean sweep before dropping again. He lies there, listening. The LOCUST HAVE GONE QUIET. His breath is heavy. His heart's got to be pounding through the dirt he lays in.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEARTBEAT DRUM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAY'S POV: Four-hundred feet across a flat area of sandstone and grass clusters, something shimmers in the undulations of the harsh morning sun. Something of pea green and rusty metal... glass catches sunlight and makes prisms. A car. An old res car, sitting in a long, chasm in barely a foot of green water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Ray picks up a handful of stones, sifts them in his hands.
</DIRECTION>

Cooch watches him slosh shoes first through a rut where the water shimmers a foot deep or less.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the Little Walking River.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Ray turns, shucking up mud.

	The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.

Ray doesn't hear Cooch. He stares past the SAC at the long wide chasm, wet in some places, arid in others, and what he hears must be an echo in his head.
</DIRECTION>

Cooch is listening to a TRANSMISSION across his radio and he walks off a few feet, exchanging information with the REGIONALS.

A flat-bed tow truck drives past the motel with the killer's car on it. Behind the truck is a fed car which stops at the motel, and the Le Baron which also pulls in. Miles and Sherman get out from the first car, Ray and Cooch bail from the Le Baron.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With RADIOS TRANSMITTING, the agents walk, dusty and tired, into room 14. Ray hesitates, snagged by the sight of --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A motorcycle parked in front of the Buffalo Butte Bar. Parked with pick-up trucks and station wagons. It's the mud-caked old Barley. Parked right under the NO INDIANS sign.

He puzzles over this.

INT. BUFFALO BUTTE BAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark. Even during the day. Cigarette smoke. Sawdust. On the archaic juke box, RANDY TRAVIS sings "Old 8x10" while behind the bar, the BAR OWNER, an old man with long white hair and beard, busies himself with leather work. SEVERAL WHITE LOCALS sit on the old water drum bar stools.

Heads lift, turn when Ray enters in his "fraternizing" clothes -- jeans and boots, leather jacket. He scuffs up thick sawdust as he heads to the furthest booth back where --

Ray just stands tense, staring at him. And it's strange. Because he hasn't really looked like he has any Indian blood up to this moment. But dressed the way he is, and his eyes glaring, face drawing tense, he might pass for a breed although that's probably the Italian. But Ray doesn't answer the question. Crow Horse starts laughing. Drunkenly.

Crow Horse rises and walks unsteadily across the floor, leaving the bar. Brooks is whispering to the others, apparently about who Ray is. The bar man comes up to Ray, holding a tray, on which sits a shot and a beer. Ray looks at it for a moment.

Maggie's old pick-up is parked near an arch gate of the tiny cemetery where a tall monument is fenced off from other graves There are tobacco offerings and other medicines hanging on the fence and on the monument.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a quiet place. Still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie stands before the unkempt monument in her denim jacket, her hair blowing across her face in the wind. She PRAYS IN LAKOTA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind her TEN CHILDREN from the Bear Creek School stand, heads bowed respectfully. Two of them sit on the lap of Richard Yellow Bird who looks on from his wheelchair, praying quietly with Maggie. When Maggie completes her prayer, she ties some tobacco to the monument then turns and faces the children. One of them, a LITTLE GIRL -- heavy-set -- raises a hand that we might note is deformed. As many of the children we have seen on the res, are.

As if exhausted by the thought, Maggie sits down on the bluff, looking out at the children who are still singing the song. As she speaks, she begins digging her fingers in the earth. Ray stands over her.

Maggie looks at him, considering. Then toward the long dark silhouette of a mountain range across the plains.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See those Black Hills out there, Ray? When the people lost the land in 1868, the government took everything but those hills. They allowed us to keep those Black Hills, to live there. Signed a treaty. Until they found gold. Then they told us we had to leave because of National interest. They broke that treaty. Anyone who fought or spoke out against it, wound up dead or in jail. And the people wound up here. On a reservation.

Maggie is laughing as she looks back at the children who are no longer singing. Ray reaches inside his jacket and takes out five polaroids. He shuffles them as he ponders. He hands one to Maggie who has caught herself opening up too much to the Wasi'cu.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>

Maggie is looking away. She picks a long blade of grass and smoothes it in her hands.

Ray looks at her a moment longer then rises, dusting off his jeans, and standing there. He thinks for a long moment, pinches the bridge of his nose, then looks out at the Black Hills, pensive.

	Goodbye... Wa-shee.

<DIRECTION>
Ray stops. She stands on the bluff, her hair riding the wind and her eyes searing. And then her lips do something that might qualify as half a smile. A sense of humor rising up through anger. Survival humor.

<DIRECTION>
Ray looks at her for a long moment. And then he walks on, leaving her there.

Exhausted, Ray lays his head back on the seat, and lets a long, constricted breath free. THUNDER ROLLS like the slow, deep roar of some giant bear up in the hills. He opens his eyes, looks out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV: rain is coming down, and Maggie is getting the children into the back of her truck. She helps them get a tarp over their heads. Then as Yellow Bird pulls himself into the cab of the truck, she hefts the wheelchair and two boys load it in.

She gets in, starts up, and rolls off down the sloping road.

EXT. LE BARON - WOUNDED KNEE – STRANGE TWILIGHT

Ray steps out of the car into the rain and closes the door. He stares at the burial grounds. Then slowly, he starts toward them as if magnetically drawn. HEARTBEAT DRUM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shroud of mist lays over the cemetery, growing thicker as the rain falls harder. DRUM BEATS DEEPER. Ray is walking toward the memorial, getting drenched. Then he hears something strange. HOOFBEATS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAY'S POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
coming down the dirt road, toward him, a HORSEMAN drives his mount at a fast trot. The rider is only a vague image in the mist, his face hidden. As he rides closer, we can make out a shotgun in his hand. And he throws it up, takes aim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE - RAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
paralyzed for a moment. And then going for his gun. But it's not there. He's left it in the car. He breaks into a run. But there's a shorter distance now between the horseman and the car and Ray has no choice but to turn and flee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His boots slap wet pavement, and his breath draws heavy and desperate as he bounds off the road and races down a grassy slope, looking over his shoulder, panicking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His legs and arms churning, his face contorted. And then someone passes him out, running just as hard. AN INDIAN WOMAN in 1890 Winter rags, clutching a BABY to her breast and CRYING. SCREAMING. Ray looks at her, incredulous as he runs. But he keeps running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rider is right behind him. He FIRES. The GUNSHOT CRACKS the sky like thunder. BOOOOM!

<DIRECTION>
INT. LE BARON – TWILIGHT

Ray jumps awake. Cooch is POUNDING on the window. And the three-legged dog inside is BARKING. Ray quickly rolls the window down, letting in THUNDER.

Cooch starts to say something then takes note of Ray's peaked face. Sweat runs down his temples, beads at his nose.

Three clean, late-model fed cars pull down the muddy drive as two SWAT vehicles pull in from another road. The Le Baron pulls in, and Ray bails out with the others. When he sees where he is, he looks distraught.

Agents are running behind junked cars, positioning themselves around the trailer.

The old man slowly removes his hat and hangs it on a knee. Carefully he places his wrinkled hands on his thinning white hair. His eyes seek out Ray who stands in the doorway, M-16 in hand, looking concerned. He stares at Ray.

Cooch storms into a back bedroom, Miles moves to a window. Sherman stands over the old man.

In a blizzard of rain, Jimmy Looks Twice in a cowboy shirt, jeans and boots, leaps off the top of the Airstream, clutching his medicine bundle. FLOODLIGHTS HIT him from all directions. BULLHORNS screaming at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to turn a corner and runs right into a fed. Ray, having run out the back door has slammed right into him. He has his rifle on him, and they stare each other down for a split second before he is converged on. Guns at his back, at his head.

He is swept off his feet, face down, and frisked. He looks up at Ray, desperately.

Ray watches Jimmy as he is shoved into the back of Miles and Sherman's car and driven away. He is twisting around in his seat to look at Ray. Desperately. The SWAT teams disband, return to their vehicles.

Cooch heads to his car and Ray starts shuffling toward his as if he is dared by it all. He is looking at the trailer and there on the rickety porch is Grandpa. He comes down the steps slowly, holding his hat on against the wind. He watches the cars pulling out.

	I was one years old there when our people were shot down. My mother hid me in the snow in a blanket. One of those killed was a Holy Man called Wakiyan Cante -- Thunder Heart.

Ray frowns, disturbed by this story.

The old man is speaking with conviction. With power.

	Thunder Heart has come. Sent here to a troubled place to help his people. That's what I am told. Maybe you're right and I am mistaken. Your mind is young, mine is old. If so, so be it. Ho Hecetu Yelo. I'll speak no more.

</GRANDPA>
<DIRECTION>
Ray stands, almost paralyzed, digesting this. He turns and looks into the old man's sharp eyes. Grandpa has closed his eyes, and as he is pulverized by the rain, he turns his face toward it and from way down in his belly, he begins to SING IN LAKOTA. And it is too much. Too weird. He wheels and hurries to the car. Gets in, and beats a fast path out of the old man's lonesome patch of land.

POOL BALLS knock from inside the bar while outside, A DAKOTAN takes a piss near a truck while his GIRLFRIEND stands at his back, yelling at him. CHARLIE DANIELS sings country on the juke Ray heads to room 13, starts unlocking the door. Cooch comes up behind him.

<DIRECTION>
Cooch hurries across the rain-swept street. Ray steps inside and closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROOM 13 - BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray closes the door, and stands there. He seems to be having trouble breathing. He looks down at his boots. There is something on the floor. Something that has been slipped under the door earlier. He just stares down at it. Then slowly stoops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: the polaroid of the res car he gave to Maggie earlier. She
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has returned it. He turns it over. Written across the white backing of the photo, in dark black marker is the name -- YELLOW BIRD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray stares at this for a moment then hurries over to boxes of files on the bed. He rummages like a nervous thief and comes up with a folder. He flips through it, casting off files and 302's and profiles and finally stopping on --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The 8x10 BLACK AND WHITE of Richard Yellow Bird seen earlier. Sitting in his wheelchair, Red Power cap on, tattoos marring big arms. And under it a DOUBLE MUG SHOT stamped LEAVENWORTH PRISON. Under that ANOTHER PRISON MUG SHOT stamped SIOUX FALLS PRISON. And under that a --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THIRD MUG SHOT stamped "PAROLED."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray, his eyes fixed on this one, takes a few steps and sits on the end of the bed. He then stuffs the file back in a box, and takes off toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RESERVATION ROAD - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Le Baron throws up loose rock and red dust, driving toward a place where the sun begins a slow drop behind the Black Hills. HORSES run out of the road. HEARTBEAT DRUM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MULE DEER DISTRICT – RES - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tarpaper shack. Outhouse. Clothesline on which jerked meat hangs. No cars. A lonely, unnerving place. Le Baron pulls in. Ray gets out, adjusting the gun at the back of his waistband. He starts for the shack. Ray raps a fist on the splintered plywood door. Knocks again. He checks out a boarded- up window. The door finally opens. Just a crack. Tiny black eyes peer out into the fading light.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm looking for Richard Yellow Bird.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Ray sticks his open badge, gold eagle wings, near the crack. The door closes. Then unlatches and opens. Yellow Bird sits there in his wheelchair, tiny tobacco bundles in his lap. He's been tying them.
</DIRECTION>
<YELLOW_BIRD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Washington Redskin. Thought you'd be gone by now.

</YELLOW_BIRD>
<DIRECTION>
He pivots his chair to allow Ray room to enter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. YELLOW BIRD SHACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yellow Bird, in a T-shirt that reveals twenty different ink tattoos, rolls himself across the warped floorboards to a cheese crate where his eye glasses sit. He puts the thick bifocals on and focuses resentfully on Ray in the ochre flicker of the dirty room.
</DIRECTION>
<YELLOW_BIRD>

<YELLOW_BIRD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ever try solitary confinement?

</YELLOW_BIRD>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?

</RAY>
<YELLOW_BIRD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Washington sent ya. I know that.

	Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Yellow Bird stares at Ray.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An arrangement was made between you... and us. Do you remember that arrangement?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Yellow Bird looks at Ray, strangely, shaking his head. Ray starts to look like maybe the game's not working. Like maybe this doesn't add up. But --
</DIRECTION>
<YELLOW_BIRD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here, ain't I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YELLOW_BIRD>
<DIRECTION>
Ray lets a tense breath out.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<YELLOW_BIRD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck you talkin' about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YELLOW_BIRD>
<DIRECTION>
Ray sits in a busted chair, reaches down to his ankle holster and pulls out a .38. He holds it, resting it on the arm of the chair. He strains to look out through the boarded window. Yellow Bird fidgets in his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get up out of the chair, Richard.

</RAY>
<YELLOW_BIRD>

Yellow Bird stands. He takes a step forward. Limping. He's got leg problems but he can walk. Heels first. And bowed. But he can walk. He is shaking.
</DIRECTION>
<YELLOW_BIRD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right?

	</DIALOGUE>
</YELLOW_BIRD>
<DIRECTION>
Ray is trying hard not to reveal his horror at this confession, at this understanding of the machinery. He sits there with his gun, blinking away sweat that beads at his brow. Yellow Bird is weeping in a highpitched voice that doesn't match his great bulk.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.

</RAY>
<YELLOW_BIRD>

	I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.

Ray grabs onto these words, rolls them silently on his lips And now Yellow Bird is getting suspicious of the fed.
</DIRECTION>
<YELLOW_BIRD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. Wait -- what are you doin'? You ain't a FBI. You ain't the law. Let me see your --

Ray snaps out his gun, straight-armed.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Yellow Bird jumps back, raising his hands.

<YELLOW_BIRD>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</YELLOW_BIRD>
<DIRECTION>
And then HEADLIGHTS pierce the gaps in the boarded windows. Yellow Bird collapses against the wall, bangs his head off it. He lets a long, pained, cry escape from under his breath and he begins a slow slide down the wall, to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray peers out the cracks in the boards.
</DIRECTION>
<YELLOW_BIRD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, I don't know who the fuck I am no more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YELLOW_BIRD>
<DIRECTION>
Ray gets up, putting his gun away and heading to the door. He stops and looks back at the Indian, sitting on the floor, clutching his knees, staring into the kerosene flicker.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You and me both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Yellow Bird looks at him, his glasses foggy, his face contorted And Ray leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. YELLOW BIRD'S SHACK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray steps out into the falling night. There is a car parked there. With a high aerial. Ray raises a hand in a slight wave, walks on. At the fed car, A REGIONAL AGENT behind the wheel, waves a hand. Watches Ray get into the Le Baron.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray gets in the car and takes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LE BARON - TRAVELING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray drives like a crazy man through the dark reservation. Through miles of open land and strange rock formations. And he looks trapped. HEADLIGHTS flicker in his rearview. He sees this. Slams the gas pedal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RES ROADS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Le Baron races at 85 down the dirt stretch. A moment later a car rattles by at 90.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray reaches over to the passenger seat and pulls up the M- 16. He lays it across his lap. Looks in the rearview again. Then makes a sudden sharp turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls off the road quickly, throwing up dust into the already foggy night, the car goes out of control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOUNDED KNEE MEMORIAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car that was following drives right past the narrow layby, hidden by grassy slopes and keeps flying down the long stretch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LE BARON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray skids through the dirt, trying to stop -- he can't -- and the Le Baron fishtails, smashing into a chain-link fence. And coming to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Breathing as if he's been running not driving, Ray looks behind him to make sure he lost the car. He did. When he turns back to his wheel, he sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE CHAINLINK FENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lit by his headlights: THE WOUNDED KNEE gravesite. He is right up on the arch, and the tall stone marker beyond it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOUNDED KNEE MEMORIAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Le Baron just sits parked, headlights making the night fog crawl up from the base of the old tomb, along the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver's door opens slowly. And Ray steps out. He walks through the arch. Into the small fenced area. Up to the stone which is overgrown with stubborn weeds, half-hidden in mist. Ray studies the tomb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV: THE NAMES ON THE STONE ARE CHISELED VERTICALLY:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHIEF STANDING BEAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. HIGH HAWK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AFRAID OF BEAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Weeds are grown up over the rest of the names. Ray's hands clear them, grab at them and rip them away from more names:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRETTY HAWK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLUE AMERICAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHERMAN HORN CLOUD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With frantic abandon, Ray is ripping weeds away. He drops to his knees, clearing weeds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STRONG FOX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUNDER HEART
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING DOWN and then suddenly back up to the name:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUNDER HEART
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ON - RAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
kneeling in the weeds, the wind getting restless around him, screaming the way plains winds do but only these winds are filled with a whistling. What sounds like EAGLE BONE WHISTLES, piping shrill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray kneels before the marker, staring at the name on the stone, his hair thrown around by the wind that drives across the grass, whistling eagles, building to an unbearable, pitch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray stares at the name as if he is looking through a small hole into another world. A world that frightens him. He gets up and backs away from the stone, through the gate. And gets back in his car, quickly. He takes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAGGIE EAGLE BEAR'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The little home on the river. Dark. Empty. Ray runs up the steps, pounds at the door. No answer. Pounds again.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maggie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
He keeps knocking. Nothing. He hurries back down the steps, starts around the back of the house and something attacks him, leaps at him from the dark, knocking him off his feet, into the grass. Hits him again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But as quickly as he falls, he rolls, throwing up his hands and blocking a savage kick aimed for his face. He traps the boot, twists it and drops the attacker onto his back. In a matter of seconds, he is on top of the man, sticking his gun in his throat. He grabs a flashlight from his jacket and shines it in the man's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse. Breathing like a wild animal.

When Crow Horse doesn't respond, Ray looks over and finds him staring. He looks back to the road. And when he looks back at Crow Horse, he is still staring at him.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>

Ray brakes. Crow Horse is looking past him. Ray turns. The spectacular mesa that we have admired with every sunrise, looms massive now that we are under it. Moonlight falls on it. And the HEARTBEAT DRUM pulses from it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHERE-THE-ELK-PEOPLE-USED-TO-LIVE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The land behind Red Deer Table is Badlands. Badlands pierced by a few rutted old wagon roads. At a place between two grotesque buttes, Crow Horse stops, looking uneasy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He digs into his pocket, pulls out some loose tobacco and spills it on the ground. Then he walks on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray observes this, starting forward, then stopping long enough to fish a cigarette out from his pocket and drop it next to Crow Horse's offering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE BADLANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray and Crow Horse walk, carefully under a full moon, scanning the area. Crow Horse stops, checks out some tracks. Ray walks on, looking up at the table. He shines his flashlight up and it illuminates --
</DIRECTION>

A RED RIBBON, tied on stakes on a ridge. Ten stakes. Twenty stakes. Ribbons blowing in the wind.

Ray sweeps the light along, walking faster, and then something frightening occurs. Something... some unseen thing snags him by the leg, sucking him into the Earth with a horrible GUSHING SOUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray is drawn into a hole up to his hips, a bluish-black slime, oozing out around him. Crow Horse grabs him, struggling to pull him up. He does, stumbling back and stepping into a hole himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two men are wheeling, throwing flashlight beams around, slapping through a wet jelly, and finally getting their bearings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray touches the ground where a blue-black chemical solution oozes out with water from the aquifer below. His flashlight scans --

Ray is looking past Crow Horse at --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something strange in the moonlight. COYOTES. Some forty yards away, on a flat stretch of stoney ground. Six Coyotes, dancing in the shadows of rock formations. MOVING IN ON THEM as Ray walks forward, they circle... scatter... run back... circle again. Look straight at Ray, eyes glowing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE - RAY
</DIRECTION>

and Crow Horse walk toward them. To the place they just left. A place in the dirt, they were digging up. When they reach it, they stare down into the dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lies there, face down. Denim jacket and a shock of black hair, thrown into tangles and dirt. It was buried. Until the coyote caught wind. Crow Horse bends down, touches the jacket... turns the body over And almost vomits when he sees Maggie Eagle Bear.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEAR CREEK VILLAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sordid little village the feds first drove through sits sleepy on the rim of sunrise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DOG BARKS hollow as the Crow Horse motorcycle chutters down and coasts up in front of one of the little homes -- rundown but it has a satellite dish and a decent car like so many. The Le Baron pulls up behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LE BARON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse walks over to Ray's window, his jeans and boots muddy. No one speaks for a long moment, the night filled by crickets. And that one dog.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This Clear Moon's house?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse crosses the street. Ray sits there, and he looks almost hurt by this statement. But he is the white man. But he is Indian. He lets a long breath escape, rubs at a temple. He takes out a smoke. Tries to light it. His hands are shaking too badly. But he gets it lit, and sits tense, looking in his rearview.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLEAR MOON HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oliver Clear Moon sits in a chair, his strong Indian mouth, beginning to tighten at the jowls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across from him, Crow Horse sits on the edge of a couch. MRS. CLEAR MOON, a rotund, gentle woman brings him a coffee. A TEENAGE GIRL in a men's extra-large T-shirt stands in the hall, looking at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clear Moon in pajamas, rises, and with a coffee in hand, starts walking in slow steps toward the kitchen. He loses control before he gets there and hurls the cup across the room into the sink, smashing it. He wheels and faces Crow Horse. He SPEAKS LAKOTA. Asking questions. Crow Horse SPEAKS LAKOTA. Answering him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Clear Moon, understanding, shakes her head in disbelief and her eyes begin to well. Oliver, walking back to his chair, sits, and thinks for a moment. MORE LAKOTA. He gets up, goes to a drawer and rummages. He sits again, and tosses something onto the coffee table. It is a badge. A tribal police badge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LE BARON - PARKED - CLEAR MOON'S - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray nervously awaits Crow Horse's words as he appears at the window again. The Indian shows hope in his tired eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.

EXT. YELLOW BIRD'S SHACK - RES - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shack is just as Ray left it earlier, kerosene flickers dancing yellow through the gapped boards. Ray and Crow Horse with guns drawn, approach the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.

	He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse snakes around toward the rear of the shack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray knocks at the front door. It is unlatched and it creaks open a little. Ray pushes it open and sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. YELLOW BIRD SHACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An empty wheelchair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. YELLOW BIRD SHACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray steps away from the door, looking around the vast plains as the sun comes up out of the Black Hills. He is roadblocked, and it shows in his eyes. It's all getting too big.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse leans against the shack, watching Ray. And then RADIO STATIC from inside the Le Baron. Ray pivots and stares at it as if someone is inside the car. His call signal is being paged. But he just stands there, looking at it.
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	X21. Read. X21...

A long, unnerving pause. No response from the other side.

The Le Baron is already out to where sight reaches farther than sound and silent white dust mushrooms skyward.

EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RAVEN is sentinel on a telephone wire that crosses the road from the bar to motel. A few trucks remain parked in front of the joint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray approaches room 13, looking shell-shocked. His boots leave blue mud prints all the way to the door. He unlocks it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray has cast off his field clothes and is halfway into one of his cleaner suits. He looks haggard but still buoyant, his eyes piercing. The connecting door creaks open and Cooch walks in. The SAC is freshly showered and he is fidgeting with a Windsor knot. He studies his number two man, says nothing for a moment but is obviously holding something down. His face is a red hue.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
(extra casual)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Couldn't sleep, Ray?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Ray looks at Cooch. When he speaks, his voice is dry.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch crosses the room, and picks up Ray's jeans which look like they went through a sandlot tackle match in a mud hole. Ray tucks his clean shirt in; watching Cooch.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had to finish something with Crow Horse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch walks up to Ray slowly and takes his face in his hand, turning it toward lamp light to study the bruise along his left eye, a residual from a Crow Horse hook.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's where you were. You had to go back and have it out with the Indian law...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Ray nods, and Cooch slowly breaks a smile. An insecure smile but a smile just the same. He starts to laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fucking hot head, we can get in trouble for that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch laughs in amusement and Ray's face crinkles into a grin as he lowers his eyes, wiping a paper towel over his face. And then, suddenly, Ray lunges at Cooch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slams the Agent in Charge against the hollow wall, and holds him there. His eyes wild.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you tell me what we were doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch is stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're running a cover-up and you didn't --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch suddenly explodes, throwing Ray off of him and sending him reeling back against the sink. He points a finger at his charge.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking Everglades, Mister.

</RAY>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch's eyes go frighteningly cold. He can't believe what he's hearing.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ. What are you doing? What the hell were you doing out there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Ray says nothing. He just stands there, against the sink, breathing like a fighter against the turnbuckle.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --

<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...

</RAY>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.

	We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?

</RAY>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. We neutralized enemies of the United States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Ray turns to the sink, turns the faucet on to get some water on his face. The water only trickles into the basin.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, Ray. You think I don't like the Indians? Not true. These were noble people but their day is gone. They're a conquered nation. They want all of America back but they can't even keep the garbage out of their own front yards. It's sad, Ray. But it's just the way it is. We have to function as a colonial police force out here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Ray leans on the sink, watching the water start to spurt free. He shuts it off. Turns to look at Cooch. And it is then the door opens -- some knocking after the door is already opened -- and SA Miles enters.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>

Crow Horse chugs along on his motorbike toward the council, his long hair and eagle feather trailing in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two federal vehicles are waiting in front of Cooch's Chevy and Ray's Le Baron. One is an FBI van where Sherman helps THREE AGENTS load file boxes and computers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch walks with Ray toward the Le Baron, looking at him as the go. Ray looks better as he breathes the morning air. As they pass the second fed car, the back window power glides down, and someone looks out with a friendly smile.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR_MOON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, there you are. The Sioux.

Ray stops dead. Beholds the Tribal President who wears a western cut jacket and a strained expression behind his smile. He hole a hand out to Ray.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR_MOON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got the troublemakers off our land. Good, Was-te.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR_MOON>
<DIRECTION>
Ray stares at him, speechless. Horrified. What is he doing here? What about the council fire? Ray somehow nods. Then walks on to the Le Baron. Cooch gets behind the wheel of the car that Clear Moon sits in. Clear Moon's eyes follow Ray to the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RES ROAD - TO GRANDPA REACHES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse guns past a little shack. As he does, he looks in his side mirror then out across the grasslands. Then quickly
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN HIS MIRROR: a car has pulled out from behind the shack. CROW HORSE observes this. Then twists the fuel throttle hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LE BARON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray gets behind the wheel, looks at his watch. He is panicking. He starts the car, reverses, slams into drive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAY’S POV: swerving and reckless as he races forward. Sherman, walking around to one of the cars has to run out of the way. The other agents clear out, looking in confusion as Ray cuts a hard U -- sweeps PAST THE BAR, SMASHES INTO AND THROUGH the old hitching post -- and HEADS TOWARD the reservation which lies vast before him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL

Sherman appears beside Cooch aiming a questioning look. When Cooch quickly gets back behind the wheel, Sherman pulls his radio up and starts yelling into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch reaches out the window and grabs his radio arm.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, damn it. You call teams in and this is gonna be a fucking media event. Get me three cars, six agents, block all reservation exits. It's under control.

EXT. ROAD TO GRANDPA REACHES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse passes by an abandoned horse trailer. When he does, another car pulls out. And follows. The first car passes by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse sees he's being followed. He cranks his throttle and the engine grinds then dies. He heels his kickstart on the fly, and keeps it alive. But his old horse is no match for the big engines coming up fast behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING

Ray is leaving little transitional developments and trailers behind. His eyes bore into the road before him, looking for a sign of Crow Horse, and in the rearview for a sign of his FBI mentor.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD TO GRANDPA REACHES - BADLANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse has the throttle open. But the two cars are coming up on both sides, trying to sandwich him. To his right the Badlands loom deep, a drop into a caliche netherworld of jagged rock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He throws the bike right, trying to ride the thin ribbon of shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FIRST CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
floors it, and swipes him, and the bike goes over the edge, launched into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BADLANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where it does a violent triple flip, throwing Crow Horse then smashing into a tent shaped dune.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RIFLE

sticks out from a window and punches the Badlands with THREE SHOTS.

The Le Baron rifles past the abandoned horse trailer. Black smoke drifts in a wind ahead.

	DROP IT.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse, rises, sucking wind, and ditches his gun in the Badlands. Ray holds onto his .45 a moment longer. Then drops it. He stares at --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WALL OF MEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch, SA Miles, SA Sherman, Six regional officers, six Clear Moon goons. And now, coming out of the backseat of Cooch's Chevy, Oliver Clear Moon, walking tentatively, cautiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch lowers the bullhorn. He takes the opportunity to stare at Ray. To let Ray stare at him. The older agent looks broken.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Crow Horse, get your face in the dirt. Ray... come forward. Let it go. Let's just let it go...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE STRONGHOLD ENTRANCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse lowers himself to a knee then lies face down. Ray just stands there, the wind against him.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Ray. Come forward.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way, Cooch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Ray refuses to move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COOCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sweating, tries to keep control. All around him, hands are on guns. Cooch is walking toward Ray.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray. I'm coming to talk to you. I'm gonna walk you out of here. And we're gonna get the hell outta this place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch walks toward him, a gun hanging at one side, bullhorn at the other. The agents behind him, around him, all raise rifles, all take aim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sherman, looking sick, gets to a knee and sets aim. The sound of clacking steel, all around. But Cooch seems disturbed by the sound. Because its coming from above. He raises an eye from the rifle sight to see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALONG THE EDGE OF THE BUTTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIFTEEN INDIANS, training rifles and shotguns down below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHERMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks up from his rifle, bewildered. Then alarmed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALONG THE EDGE OF THE BUTTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PAN across fifteen Indians -- old people, women, kids. Their weapons are weak but many.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And at the end of the row, Maisy Blue Legs rises, clutching a rifle. And PAST HER, ANOTHER. TRADITIONAL PEOPLE, many from the trading post porch, rise to the edge, armed. Silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Twenty, twenty-five, thirty traditionals, forming a line along the ridge, a line that runs in a circle, broken by the Stronghold entrance, then starting again on the next butte. Thirty-five, forty of them. And more, standing along the opposite craggy rock, some wearing tractor caps, some cowboy hats, some just long hair blowing in the wind. Fifty, sixty, SEVENTY-FIVE RESERVATION PEOPLE forming a circle on the rocks; it's Little Big Horn revisited. A fourteen year-old boy struggles to keep a huge shotgun at his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWN BELOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clear Moon's mouth is as dry as Badlands soil. Cooch is panicking, his eyes running along the high edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stands equally astonished, assessing the back-up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CROW HORSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lifts himself, stands, taking in the sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE EDGE OF THE BUTTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stepping stiffly but steadily through the line of armed locals, pushing his way to the very edge so as to look down, Grandpa Sam Reaches. The wind makes feathery tails out of his long thinning strips of white hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWN BELOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray looks up at the old man, then turns to face Cooch.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right, Cooch. It's over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Cooch slowly, lets the bullhorn fall. Then the rifle. He looks back at Sherman who does the same, and all the way down the line, everyone dropping their arms under the threat of a lot more guns from above. And now Ray walks forward, collecting his gun. Anderson Chasing Hawk, one of the Warriors, runs down to Ray, breathless.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASING_HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the exits are blocked. There's two more fed cars tryin' to get in. And some press.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHASING_HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Ray notices that Cooch is staring at him, hard. He shakes his head slowly. Strongly.
</DIRECTION>
<COOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOCH>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let the press through.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Chasing Hawk takes off, running, and Cooch watches in consternation. Ray just stands eye to eye with him, holding his ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP TO ARIEL VIEW - OVER STRONGHOLD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And along the ridge, Grandpa and the locals don't budge, watching every move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLIMBING HIGHER, we rise above the circle of proud Sioux to see, on the inside of the Stronghold, thirty old trucks and res cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLIMBING HIGHER into and through the fast-moving clouds that the Lakota call The Grandfathers as the HEARTBEAT DRUM and LAKOTA SINGERS takes over all sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEAR CREEK RESERVATION - MAIN SETTLEMENT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The HIGH WINDS of THREE MEDIA HELICOPTERS are delighting a storm of Indian children and BARKING DOGS, running through the streets past junked cars on blocks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over on a little plot of grass and dirt, a pair of hands are digging a small hole. Ray lays a pine cone in the hole and looks down at it for a moment... before hand-plowing the dirt back over it and patting it flat. He rises, knocking dirt off his knees and hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse walks over, bandaged and favoring wounds, and Ray falls in with him, walking down the middle of the village road. His eyes are tired. But hopeful.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The people are already talkin' about their vote for a new tribal prez. They wanna vote for Jimmy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray nods, encouraged as they walk along. His eyes follow the helicopters.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the water...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bought her some time, Kola. Ain't never gonna be over... but you bought her some time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some Indian time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the dusty, dented Le Baron and stand there, looking at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indian time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
Crow Horse offers a hand to Ray. He takes it in a white man's shake then follows Walter's cue into the Indian "allies" grip and slap. They hold it there, looking into each other's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
(concerned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where ya gonna go, Ray?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray ponders for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't have another vision...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray shrugs. Crow Horse discreetly gestures below his belt.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray cracks a smile, a long time coming.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You take care.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray stands looking at him, searching for words.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ain't no word in Sioux for goodbye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray goes to get in his car. But he sees someone sitting across the street on the trading post porch. The old man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray considers him for a moment then walks over. They lock eyes. Grandpa stares at Ray as if he's never seen him before, and then arcs a brow. He touches his sleeve at the wrist. Ray rolls his sleeve back to reveal his Rolex. Grandpa smiles and Ray strips it off. He hands it to the old man and his face crinkles into caliche earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grandpa holds the watch up in the light, admires it then puts it in his shirt pocket. He moves a flat hand through the air in the "done deal" sign language. Ray, a little surprised that he gets nothing in the trade, returns the smile and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets to his car and wipes away two inches of dust from the broken windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LE BARON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After THREE TRIES, he gets the engine started. He pulls his gun off his waistband, goes to lay it on the passenger seat and finds something there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grandpa's sacred caanunpa. The Pipe. Symbol of truth. Ray looks out the window at the old man who is watching him with those sharp black eyes. Ray lifts his hand, holds it flat, and does the Sioux done deal sign.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEAR CREEK RESERVATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Le Baron eats up the dirt road at a moderate, gravel crunching pace. It slows as it passes Maggie Eagle Bear's quiet home on the river. Children walk with the old woman, carrying buckets from the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Le Baron slows to a crawl, then drives on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TRADING POST PORCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where the elders sit, watching the dust blow.
</DIRECTION>
<CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (voice lingering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We will be here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROW_HORSE>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CROW HORSE walking off down the road. He stops, and looks over his shoulder, trying to glimpse the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LE BARON driving off the res, under big sky as it ascends a rough hill, waddles through potholes, negotiates with some horses in the road and rolls on toward the reservation line where the sun throws shadows that look like an old man dancing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE PLACE IN THE ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where West goes to Rapid City, and East back to Bear Creek, Ray stops like the bullet-punched sign orders. He doesn't go West. Doesn't go East. He sits there. Fishes a smoke out from a pocket, clicks a lighter, and fires up. He sits there, smoking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deliberating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDEN CUT TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And after a long silent beat, A DRUM. Like a heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END CREDITS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
