PROLOGUE

<DIRECTION>
BLACK. We HEAR the soft voice of Frances Farmer.

<FRANCES>

EXT. PUGET SOUND - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On an expanse of water, calm and undisturbed. After a moment, it begins to ripple as something rises toward the surface. A girl's face breaks through.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't a murder. I think God just died of old age. And when I realized He wasn't any more, it didn't shock me. It seemed natural and right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
The girl, FRANCES, is 16, blond, very pretty: she seems like the most persuasive proof imaginable of God's existence. She swims toward the shore with long graceful strokes... then climbs the steps of the old wood jetty on West Point Beach.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And yet I began to wonder what the minister meant when he said, 'God, the Father, sees even the smallest sparrow fall. He watches over all his children.' That jumbled it all up for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PUGET SOUND - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The banks of Puget Sound, dotted with elm trees. Frances sits comfortably in the fork of a tree writing in her diary. Towel around her neck, her hair splayed out and drying golden in the sun.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But still sometimes I found that God was useful to remember, especially when I lost things that were important. 'Please God, let me find my red hat with the blue trimmings.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FARMER HOME - FAMILY ROOM - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances is now reading aloud from her diary, gently swaying back and forth in a rocking chair. An older woman, LILLIAN FARMER, sits opposite on the couch, listening and nodding from time to time. A small suitcase stands by the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It usually worked. God became a superfather that couldn't spank me. But if I wanted a thing badly enough, He arranged it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
ERNEST FARMER appears in the doorway and hesitates, listening to his daughter read.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if God loved all of His children equally, why did He bother about my red hat and let other people lose their fathers and mothers for always?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Ernest goes to Frances and kisses her softly on the top of her head. She looks at him briefly, smiling slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<ERNEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bye, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERNEST>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you next weekend, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to the door and picks up his suitcase, glances at Lillian. She doesn't look up. He leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I began to see that He didn't have much to do about hats or people dying or anything. They happened whether He wanted them to or not, and He stayed in Heaven and pretended not to notice.

INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances stands at a podium. Other STUDENTS and TEACHERS sit to either side of her on folding chairs. Above the proscenium is engraved: West Seattle High School. Below that a banner hangs: "NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL ESSAY COMPETITION, 1931."
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wondered a little why God was such a useless thing. It seemed a waste of time to have Him. After that He became less and less, until He was... nothingness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
The AUDIENCE consists of parents, students, and local dignitaries. We SEE several shocked faces. Lillian is there also, smiling. Seated next to her is a distinguished-looking woman, ALMA STYLES. Ernest sits on the other side of the auditorium, looking a little worried.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I felt rather proud that I had found the truth myself, without help from anyone. It puzzled me that other people hadn't found out, too. God was gone. We had reached past Him. Why couldn't they see it? It still puzzles me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Frances closes her notebook and looks up, waiting for some response. There is a deep shocked silence, then a smattering of applause. Lillian claps enthusiastically, then rises to her feet. In the back a WOMAN also stands.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going straight to hell, Frances Farmer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
A stately man sitting next to her, her husband JUDGE BENJAMIN HILLIER, puts a restraining hand on her arm. The woman continues to glare at Frances.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances stares back, dumbfounded.

EXT. SEATTLE STREETS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screen erupts into violence. A large unruly MOB skirmishes with POLICE in a cobblestoned square. On a truckbed addressing the crowd -- which carries placards reading: "Organize Now!", "Workers of the World Unite!", and "Elect Kaminski!" stands MARTONI KAMINSKI. By his side, leading the crowd's responses, stands a younger man with sharp piercing eyes, HARRY YORK.
</DIRECTION>
<KAMINSKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?

	No!

<YORK_CROWD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!

A TITLE COMES ON SCREEN: GOD'S IN HIS HEAVEN AND ALL'S RIGHT WITH THE WORLD? 'NOT SO!' SAYS YOUNG FRANCES FARMER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We realize we've been watching a newsreel. We SEE the SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT presenting Frances with an award.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seattle is in the news again as a high school junior wins a national competition and a hundred dollar prize with an essay denying God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
City Hall steps. Judge Hillier and other BIGWIGS speaking heatedly to reporters.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This prompts civic officials to charge that left-wing politicians are encouraging atheism in the city's schools. Miss Frances Farmer was unavailable for comment, but her mother Lillian --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
Lillian stands in front of her wood frame house addressing a small CROWD of reporters, photographers, and curious neighbors.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Farmer, a well-known local dietician, stepped to her daughter's defense.

</ANNOUNCER>
<LILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(emphatically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frances has not turned her back on the Lord, they're just having a momentary difference of opinion. What child hasn't questioned the Lord's mysteries in order to better understand them? To paraphrase Mr. Voltaire, I may not agree with what she says, but I'll defend to the death her right to say it. Freedom of speech, unlike in the dark countries to the east, still lives in America! And in my home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Among the AUDIENCE in the cinema, we SEE Frances and her father. Frances slinks down in her seat until she's hidden from sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET (SEATTLE) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances carries library books and a small grocery bag. Her hair and skin gleam in the sun. People in their yards stare at her as she passes. She walks on, coming to a group of CHILDREN slightly younger than herself who are playing in front of a union hall. A girl, EMMA, 13, glances up.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi Emma.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Emma looks away quickly, returns to her play.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bye Emma.

Frances shakes her head as she walks on.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Frances hesitates, then turns to look:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man in his twenties whom we recognize as Harry York, Kaminski's compatriot, leaves a group of men in front of the union hall and walks toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(friendly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mere. I wanna talk to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Frances keeps walking. Harry hurries after her.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reaches her, grabs her arm)

<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't touch me.

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>

She stares at him. He's got a newspaper wedged under one arm.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(waiting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay then...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not me. But other people seem to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?

</HARRY>
<FRANCES>

(examining him)

	<DIALOGUE>
	No... Actually, you look more like a cop.

Harry laughs.

	That's rich. Hey, if I was a cop, I'd be packing, right?

(holding coat open)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see a gun? Go on, search me. Pat me down.

Frances hesitates, leans toward him as though about to frisk him. Their eyes meet, and she pulls away, suddenly embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
	</DIALOGUE>

</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm not. The newspapers're --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Could look bad for you and Kaminski too, I guess.

	Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.

</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.

They half-smile, awkwardly, as if neither really wants this encounter to end. Then Harry doffs his hat.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bye.

<DIRECTION>
She nods shyly and starts up the path toward the house.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON Judge Hillier in his robes, identified by a nameplate on the bench.

<HILLIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are perilous times. With the economic collapse comes hopelessness and desperation; and people turn to dangerous ideas --

<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.

</WOMAN_S_VOICE>

The CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK. We SEE that the courtroom is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<HILLIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those of us who represent law and order must be vigilant. Who's behind this, her mother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILLIER>
<DIRECTION>
Now we SEE who he's talking to: Alma Styles, the woman who sat with Lillian at the school auditorium.
</DIRECTION>
<STYLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Impossible. As her attorney, I've known her for years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STYLES>
<HILLIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the father, he's a little pink. Maybe he wants to show our schools in a bad light, shift some support to Kaminski and those jackals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILLIER>
<STYLES>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's no influence; he doesn't even live at home. No, I think Frances wrote that essay with no mischief intended. It was her teacher who entered it in the competition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STYLES>
<HILLIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, the publicity must stop. It's no good for Seattle and no good for the country.
	</DIALOGUE>

(sternly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep an eye on this, will you, Alma?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILLIER>
<STYLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, your honor.

He nods with satisfaction. Two right-thinking people fighting for what they believe in.

INT. FARMER HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ernest Farmer sits alone, motionless, at the table. Between two candles, facing him, is Frances' check for a hundred dollars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR bustle from behind the kitchen door, then Lillian and Frances enter juggling several hot dishes. Ernest rises. They set down the dishes, Frances intentionally placing the bread between the check and her father.
</DIRECTION>
<ERNEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERNEST>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>

She moves the bread so Ernest again faces the check. As Lillian slices the bread, father and daughter eat grimly.

</LILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She leaves. A long silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They both glance slightly awkwardly at the check.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances takes it, folds it, and puts it in her pocket, out of sight.

	I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.

</ERNEST>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>

<ERNEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.

	Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERNEST>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<ERNEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERNEST>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Kaminski a Communist?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<ERNEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.

Sitting at a rolltop desk. She's looking through a large scrapbook. We SEE articles about nutrition and diet, some featuring Lillian's picture, others with her name in the heading. She listens to the conversation in the other room.
</DIRECTION>
<ERNEST>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The label's not important, Francie. What's important is: this country's got nine million unemployed and something's gotta be done about it. Besides: left-wing, right-wing, up- wing, down-wing... they don't mean much. All a label is usually is a way to call somebody a dirty name.
	</DIALOGUE>

Lillian's face becomes set. She looks down at the book. An article titled "Girl Denies God" is there, freshly pasted. She lays a hand on the blank page opposite.

Lillian appears in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>

	Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?

</LILLIAN>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Ma.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<LILLIAN>

	You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --

	They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.

	No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.

	What can we do, we must live! We shall live, Uncle Vanya...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Frances is acting with a nervous young man, CHET. As her speech progresses, the camera moves in nearer and nearer, ending with a close-up. It is as if we are being drawn in by her emotion.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then we shall rest, we shall rest. We shall hear the angels, we shall see the whole sky all diamonds, we shall see how all earthly evil, all our sufferings, are drowned in the mercy that will fill the whole world. And our life will grow peaceful, tender, sweet as a caress...

As the curtain opens and the players take their bows, we SEE in the audience: Lillian and Ernest, Lillian clapping madly, crying, nudging Ernest to clap harder.

INT. UNIVERSITY READING ROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
A celebration in progress. Masks of Comedy and Tragedy hang on the walls. DRAMA STUDENTS lounge about: eating, drinking, talking noisily. Bing Crosby is on the record player, singing "I've Got The World on a String." The Drama Teacher is holding court to a group of attentive students.
</DIRECTION>
<DRAMA_TEACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Art is a constant struggle. Some of you have the will but not the ability. For others, the opposite. I don't wish to be harsh, but only one of you on stage tonight combined the two...

The front door opens. Frances and Chet enter.

The young men rush over to congratulate her. Frances takes a mock bow. She laughs as people cheer. TWO GIRLS observe from the back.

INT. UNIVERSITY READING ROOM - SEVERAL HOURS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Things have quieted down. The Drama Teacher has cornered Frances and is gesticulating drunkenly, waving a copy of "Voice of Action." Frances is also tipsy, but pays close attention to her mentor.
</DIRECTION>
<DRAMA_TEACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!

<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'll never win that.

They are silent for a while.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to him?

<HARRY>

	But they're using you!

	Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.

<DIRECTION>
They've reached Frances' room. She puts on her coat.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>

She stares out the window. We see Ernest mowing the lawn.

	I have to do this on my own. You see, I've learned your lesson very well. To do what I think is right and everyone else be damned.

Frances turns and heads back down the hall. Lillian follows.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>

Frances keeps walking.

Passengers climb onto the bus. As Frances is hugged by her Drama Teacher, the Tall Spectral Man approaches her. In his arms he carries a potted plant, a Bible, and a flashlight.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Here is a Bible for solace... and this plant to remind you of the eternal seed in all of us... and finally, a flashlight to illuminate your path through darkest Russia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALL_SPECTRAL_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Frances accepts the gifts, bewildered. The Tall Spectral Man stares at her through hollow eyes. She staggers on toward the bus, looking like a bedraggled Statue of Liberty. The Tall Spectral Man sings an ethereal hymn.

Lillian blocks Frances' path. Frances looks at her tearfully.

Inside the bus, Frances stares out the window and shakes her head sadly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bus starts. Everyone looks at Lillian. She is motionless... Furious. Frances sighs, and the bus moves off unimpeded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a homicidal rage in Lillian's eyes as she stares after the vehicle. Then the Reporters rush toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you say now, Mrs. Farmer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_REPORTER>

Next is a SNAPSHOT of Frances on board on ocean liner.
</DIRECTION>

Then TWO SNAPSHOTS of her in what is clearly Moscow. She wears a Russian hat. The Kremlin stands behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then SNAPSHOTS of her in New York, with a small clipping from the "New York Times":

Below this is a magazine advertisement showing Frances in a glossy Chesterfield ad. Her hair is swept up off her head, and she looks glamorous, artificial, very different from how we've seen her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lillian takes up the paste brush and liberally swabs the opposite -- blank -- page of her scrapbook. A handwritten letter from Frances lies beside her. She removes a clipping from the letter and spreads it out. The clipping says: "STARS OF TOMORROW" and shows a semi-circle of girl's faces inside garish stars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lillian circles Frances' photo and sits back to admire it.

Frances' hair is tightly curled. She is dressed in a grotesquely ruffled white gown and seated on a small stool. Behind her TWO ASSISTANTS fuss with bunches of white carnations hanging on a grid. A seasoned PUBLICIST kneels nearby and a woman with a coffee cup, CLAIRE, surveys the scene.

	'The most interesting thing about Frances Farmer is that her road to Hollywood was 12,000 miles long. After winning a beauty contest, the first prize of which was a trip to Europe...' She made some deal with the Commies and went to Moscow, but I'm not going to say that, am I?

INT. STUDIO ACTING CLASS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO STUDENTS are doing a scene from "Design For Living." Others sit around watching, whispering, flirting, sleeping... but Frances is paying very close attention, making notes. The MAN next to her rubs her arm and whispers something. She grimaces and pays no attention. Then she notices, two rows in front, a young handsome student, DICK, who's also making notes. She stares at him for a second, then back at the stage.

<DIRECTION>
Frances sits on the couch talking on the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you get the check?... Oh my God, it opened?!, what'd you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Water lands on her face. She grimaces playfully.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I hope I get bigger parts, they don't come much smaller.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
The last line is garbled as water streams in her mouth. She fumbles for something on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm fine. I just have water in my mouth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
She finds a water pistol on the floor, picks up the phone, and starts searching for her assailant.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Mama, I'm not changing my name. They can't actually make you, you know? Most people don't realize that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(playfully, covering receiver)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Dick...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
She flings open the bathroom door and finds him: Dick from drama class. A furious water battle ensues.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, nothing's going on.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(fast)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you too, Mama. Give my love to Dad. Bye!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
She hangs up, lowers her gun as Dick squirts her. She's getting wet. Her shirt clinging to her breasts. She likes it.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, handsome. You win.
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. HOLLYWOOD SCREENING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the small screen we SEE Frances in the arms of a MAN IN FIRE CHIEF'S HAT.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kurt!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<FIRE_CHIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRE_CHIEF>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, Kurt, I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<FIRE_CHIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRE_CHIEF>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Kurt!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<FIRE_CHIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRE_CHIEF>
<DIRECTION>
ON SCREEN the corners of Frances' mouth begin to tremble, but her eyes remain wide and innocent. The Fire Chief slowly inclines his head toward hers. The brim of his hat hits her forehead. Frances covers her face with her hands and bursts out laughing. The Fire Chief looks stunned. She tries to control herself.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking into camera)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, let's go back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Laughter inside the screening room. A small light flicks on, and from behind we dimly SEE TWO MEN.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_1>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is that? What's she doing?

	That's talent, Andy.

EXT. CATWALK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances smiles and eases shut the screening room door. We HEAR the Laughing Man inside shout: "Let's see that again!" Frances puts a cigarette in her mouth and fishes for a match.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man's hand appears, holding a lighter. She looks up: It's Harry, wearing a garish Hawaiian shirt and a Panama hat.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry! Harry-god-damn-York! A real person!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Frances throws her arms around him. They hug warmly.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How ya doin', Farmer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Came to get a tan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
They compare forearms.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(staring out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kaminski.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They killed him. They threw him out that window.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eight stories.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She stares down two stories to the ground, imagining:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(also staring down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(walking on)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(brightening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(confidentially)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How d'ya like the camouflage?

EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry and Frances walking arm in arm.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what ability you're interested in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For old time's sake.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry... I met someone.

</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(stiffens slightly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Frances shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She nods.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Then it's temporary.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All actors are phonies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He's joking, but she doesn't respond.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Serious, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey that's great, Farmer, just great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles wistfully, seeing him cover up his disappointment. She squeezes his arm and they continue walking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SOUND STAGE - SET (RHYTHM ON THE RANGE) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lights being adjusted, cameras set, actors walking through their blocking. In the midst of this we SEE Frances, dressed in western attire, making a point to the WARDROBE MISTRESS, who is listening without enthusiasm.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(spreading her arms)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These creases... I look like I just came from the laundry! I'm supposed to be hiding out in boxcars, sleeping on floors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<WARDROBE_MISTRESS>
<DIRECTION>
(cool)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the suit we fitted on you, Miss Farmer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDROBE_MISTRESS>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I know that. But it could look more realistic, don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<WARDROBE_MISTRESS>
<DIRECTION>
(looking her over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll do. No one will notice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDROBE_MISTRESS>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll notice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR a man conspicuously clearing his throat. Both women turn as Mr. Bebe steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<WARDROBE_MISTRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Mr. Bebe, good morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDROBE_MISTRESS>
<DIRECTION>
He nods imperceptibly.
</DIRECTION>
<BEBE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come along with me, Fanny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEBE>
<DIRECTION>
She hesitates, then goes.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.

<BEBE>

	You see: We've got to change that name.

</BEBE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances and Bebe come through the sound stage door into the light. He gestures to indicate what direction they're going, but remains silent, watching her. She's uncomfortable, blinking like a bird.
</DIRECTION>
<BEBE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEBE>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<BEBE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I intend to make a great deal of money off you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEBE>
<DIRECTION>
Frances is taken aback. This is all rather blunt.
</DIRECTION>
<BEBE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It."
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEBE>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<BEBE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEBE>
<DIRECTION>
They hear a ruckus in the distance and turn and look: PICKETERS are fighting with POLICE. It is raucous, brutal. Bebe turns back to her with a stern look:
</DIRECTION>
<BEBE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEBE>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<BEBE>
<DIRECTION>
(fierce but very muted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm concerned with everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEBE>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm the one up there on the screen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<BEBE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEBE>
<DIRECTION>
She's about to reply, but he quickly takes her hand and raises it to his lips. Kisses it very formally, like a suitor. Then turns and walks into the sumptuous executive office building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She watches him go.

Brightly colored bulbs flashing, causing the wisps of fog around them to glow. The bulbs spell:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"COME AND GET IT" WITH SEATTLE'S OWN FRANCES FARMER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A noisy CROWD is gathered outside the theatre, straining against velvet cordons. Big black limos disgorge couples in formal evening wear, to the applause of the crowd. All slightly small-town, off-key.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry, now sporting a mustache, hat pulled down over his face, stands across the street.

Two limousines streaking through the night.

Frances sits next to a faceless STUDIO EXECUTIVE. She's all dolled up. She looks uncomfortable. Silence. She glances up at the limo ahead of them.

INT. FIRST LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Dick sits between Lillian and Ernest A REPORTER and PHOTOGRAPHER crouch in front of them.

	I guess it's no secret that I'm proud. Only twenty-one years old, and look at all she's done.

	As for her looks, I flatter myself that she gets them from me.

	Obviously.

</DICK>

He winks at the reporters.

	And not only has Frances come home a star; she's also brought me this big handsome lug of a son-in-law!

Dick smiles and hugs them both.

They're stopped at a light. Outside their window we SEE DERELICTS, casualties of the depression, huddled in the night.

INT. FRANCES' LIMO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's staring at the derelicts. We feel her sympathy for them. Almost like she'd rather be out there. A MAN WITH HOLLOW EYES shouts something at them.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd he say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>

She rolls down her window. The Studio Executive beside her looks at her like she's crazy.

EXT. THEATRE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The two limos pull up, the second emptying first. As Frances gets out, the CROWD cheers wildly. She walks past them, eyes glazed. She doesn't see Harry, who is held back by cordons. Lillian is posing and signing autographs. In her tight, formal dress, Frances looks radiant but constricted. As she walks, voices assault her:

Again there is a cordoned area in the center where Seattle luminaries are sipping champagne. Reporter #1 lurches forward:

<REPORTER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you make some statement about Seattle, how the city helped you, or the schools --
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER_1>
<FRANCES>

	Well, the truth is the city had nothing to do with it. I was lucky. And what wasn't luck was hard work.

	Miss Farmer, I can't tell you how proud I am to meet you.

She embraces and kisses Frances, who's more than a little put off. After the kiss, she takes firm hold of Frances' hand and won't let go. Judge Hillier steps to his wife's side. Lillian also approaches.

<DIRECTION>
A hideous silence. Judge Hillier is fuming. His wife is aghast, the key to the city extended awkwardly in front of her. She shoves it into Frances' arms.
</DIRECTION>

Frances moves to leave, but her arm is taken by the Studio Executive, who escorts her into the theatre. The crowd follows. Lillian is utterly mortified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THEATRE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We TRACK along the side of the theatre. An exit door is thrown open, and Frances storms out. As she does, she trips over an OLD INDIAN BEGGAR. She stops and looks at him. He peers up at her with large forlorn eyes... then holds out his hand. A connection is made. All the anger drains out of her. She gives him money, several bills. He breaks into a wonderful crooked grin. She starts away, hesitates, then hands him the key to the city. He stares at it, bewildered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She strides away toward her limousine, which is now parked with several others at the end of the alley. The CHAUFFEURS are talking and smoking a cigarette. Her chauffeur sees her and hurries to his limo. As it pulls into the street, we see Harry drift back to the curb and stare after it.

	You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>

	Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.

	I don't have what they want, Harry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stares at the water)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(important)

<HARRY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
They start to walk now along the beach. We see Harry's car and the chauffeured limousine parked above.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.

	The chauffeur. He's watching.

	He deserves a show. He missed the movie.

She kicks off another shoe, sailing it into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances is zipping off her dress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry bends to pick up the first shoe.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A single glass slipper left glittering on the pearly sands. Who was that girl, anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Harry watches her, mesmerized. The dress is off.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Come and get it,' Harry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
She skips off down the beach, her dress strewn on the sands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, from the darkness, we SEE her underclothes fly into view. Harry can restrain himself no longer.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(excited)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hot damn!

He drops the shoe and runs after her, tearing off his clothes. After a moment, from the darkness, we hear her squeals of laughter.

EXT. STUDIO - HOLLYWOOD - DAY

The street outside the Studio Main Gate. Actors, directors, etc. arrive in their shiny expensive autos. Among them is Frances in her old battered Ford. She waves to the Guard and drives through.

EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY

As Frances pulls into her parking space, Claire, the woman from the photo session, strolls up.

	Hi Frances, got a minute?

</CLAIRE>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.

They walk toward the dressing room.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My clothes?

<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!

Claire is laughing. They go inside.

Posh, fit for a star. Frances smiles at the MAKEUP MAN.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning, Eddie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
As Frances sits at the table and Eddie goes to work:
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?

Dick is talking on the phone in the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, of course she'll make a statement on women's rights. Call back tomorrow, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>

He hangs up. Immediately the phone rings again. He stares at it wearily, then answers:

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dwayne Steele's residence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>

Through the half-open door to the bedroom we see Frances dozing, an open script laid out beside her.

</DICK>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claire?
	</DIALOGUE>

	Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?

<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(apprehensively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fired?

</FRANCES>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.

</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
Frances looks stricken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dick presses on.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Yes.

	Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.

	I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No?

</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Dick is crumbling inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
We watch it sink in. Confusion... self-pity... building gradually to resentment and rage. He starts to throw a tantrum. Hurling things around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances just sits there.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God... I think you're overplaying this a bit...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
He hurls a pillow against the wall and rushes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances looks after him, then turns. She's now facing the bureau.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Dick.

A mirror sits on top of the bureau. She looks into it. Doesn't like her expression. Turns the mirror away.

INT. THEATRE LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A playbill in a theatre lobby reads: "Mt. Kisco Playhouse, 1937 Summer Season: 'THE PETRIFIED FOREST'." Among the names listed is: "Frances Farmer, the 'Come And Get It' Girl. Suddenly we HEAR an eruption of applause.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THEATRE - AUDIENCE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT SHOT on two men: HAROLD CLURMAN -- a thoughtful aristocratic man -- and CLIFFORD ODETS, who is taller, slimmer, with black hair and intense dark eyes. Around them we see (mostly HEAR) the AUDIENCE going crazy, leaping to its feet, yelling "Bravo! Bravo!" Clurman and Odets sit impassively. As the hurrahs die down and the audience files out, the two men sit there. Finally Clurman turns to Odets. Odets nods very slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances sits in the cramped room, listening intently to Clurman. Occasionally she sneaks a glance at Odets, who is pacing like some caged beast.
</DIRECTION>
<CLURMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLURMAN>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(watching Odets)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<CLURMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLURMAN>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<ODETS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a tramp from Newark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ODETS>
<CLURMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me, but I think you'd be perfect for the part.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLURMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Odets is pacing furiously, seizing their attention. He stops, looks at her, then resumes.
</DIRECTION>
<ODETS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Farmer, for me this is not a play: it's an assault... a seduction... a plea for understanding. I think we live in a time when new art works should shoot bullets... and you make very attractive ammunition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ODETS>
<DIRECTION>
He stops. Tentatively, almost boyishly, he smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She returns it. She's charmed.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<ODETS>
<DIRECTION>
(mysterious, intimate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Golden Boy.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</ODETS>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BELASCO THEATRE MARQUEE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It reads "Golden Boy". Crowds of people streaming out of the lobby. A sign over the box office reads: "Tomorrow's performances sold out."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Odets sits on the curb. Behind him the lights in the theatre lobby flicker off. PEDESTRIANS stroll by: an odd mix of affluent theatre crowd and 1930s bums.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances emerges from the theatre, sees him sitting there. Sits beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
He nods.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanted to talk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Another nod. He's silent. He peers up the street. A GIRL, 16, selling pencils catches his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<ODETS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see that girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ODETS>
<DIRECTION>
She looks like a waif: tough, vulnerable, pleading with a WEALTHY COUPLE, following them down the street. A drama being played out in the distance, out of earshot.
</DIRECTION>
<ODETS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's who my play is about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ODETS>
<DIRECTION>
Frances watches the girl.

INT. WORKING CLASS BAR - LATER

The same conversation continuing:

<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<ODETS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!

</ODETS>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I want to. I'm trying!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<ODETS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ODETS>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<ODETS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.

</ODETS>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLATFORM - SPANISH EMBASSY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clurman is delivering a speech in the background as PHOTOGRAPHERS snap pictures. Behind them on the platform Frances and Odets continue their conversation in whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<ODETS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can see it. You just have to let it out. Trust it. No one will quash you here, but it's still a fight, a struggle! Being true to your art, being honest, is always a struggle!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ODETS>
<DIRECTION>
We now HEAR Clurman's speech. The initial words below were background to the above. What we HEAR now is underlined:
</DIRECTION>
<CLURMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(presenting check to SPANISH CONSUL)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!

She is seething. Gorgeous. Alive.

</CLIFFORD>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
As she feels the anger coursing through her body she realizes what he's talking about. She looks at him, still breathing heavily. Gradually her face turns toward a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches out and, with exquisite tenderness, kisses her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ODETS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

Later. They enter slightly drunk, laughing. He takes her coat.

</CLIFFORD>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
She's looking at the apartment. He sees her. A dark thought flickers across his face, and he breaks into an exaggerated act:
</DIRECTION>
<CLIFFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	her bedroom. I can't ask you to...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh well. I guess I better leave then.

She starts to put on her coat. He watches her.

	Okay, but come here first.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

INT. BEBE'S PANELLED OFFICE - HOLLYWOOD - DAY

Bebe's huge desk. Variety Headline: "ACTRESS FIGHTS FASCISM!" Next to the newspaper are a dozen pencils which Bebe is lining up precisely parallel. His expression is totally obsessive, crazed.

Behind him a woman (TORA) is cutting his hair. A STUDIO LAWYER paces nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.

<DIRECTION>
Frances emerges from the stage door to a throng of AUTOGRAPH SEEKERS. She smiles tiredly, but good-naturedly complies. A little ways back stands a boyish YOUNG MAN holding a single red carnation. When the Autograph-seekers are satisfied and all but a few have trailed away, the Young Man steps forward.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone chattering away... then hushing slightly. Heads turn: Frances is descending the stairway in one of Connie's dresses. She looks absolutely radiant... like some kind of goddess.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes, looking very pleased at her appearance and the others' reaction, hands her the drink.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>

Frances bristles. Barnes looks on nervously: It's all becoming unravelled again.

<YOUNG_REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My employer would like to know something very important: is it true your friend Clifford sleeps in the nude?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
Frances is broiling. She stares at him. Under her steady gaze, the snide smile gradually fades from his face.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>

He blanches. This hits home. Frances turns on her heel and leaves.

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances rushes out, followed by Barnes and a few curious partygoers. She is very upset. Tight. Holding it in. Barnes pleads with her, tries to stop her, but she leaps in the car and speeds off, spewing gravel over him. The partygoers salute her with their drinks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A CLIFFSIDE COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the pale moonlight we SEE the dim outline of a poster tacked to the outside wall. The highway disappears down to the sea glittering dully in the distance. We HEAR the RISING SOUND of an approaching car. Its headlights crest the hill, illuminating the poster, showing a woman driving an open car, seated beside the outline of a familiar mustached figure. The poster reads, "When You're Riding Alone, You're Riding with Hitler." The lights grow brighter, almost blinding. The car, accelerating furiously, flashes by. Then we HEAR a motorcycle start up. It emerges from the blackness and speeds off in pursuit. A roadsign reads: "Dimout Zone."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances drives fast, tears running her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MOTORCYCLE COP pulls up alongside and shouts, "Pull over!" She hesitates. He waves insistently. Gradually she slows. He gets off his bike and walks over, preparing the usual lecture.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay...

</COP>

He leans over the car and sees Frances, her hair wild and tangled.

She leaps out of the car. The Cop turns off the car lights. As Frances passes his motorcycle, she switches on its lights.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DIRECTION>
He runs after her, turning off the motorcycle lights on the way. When he catches her, he grabs her arm. She struggles, grabs the flashlight from his belt. She switches it on and holds it high, its beam spearing wildly out to sea. He lunges for it, knocks her down. They struggle. He rolls on top of her, pinning both her arms with one hand... trying to handcuff her. She writhes, knees him in the balls. She crawls away, desperately clawing at loose stones. The Cop, angry now, hurls her down again and manages to get the cuffs on. As they dig into her wrists, she tries to bite him. The Cop, winded from the battle, yanks her to her feet and drags her, kicking and screaming, to his motorcycle. He pulls out his radio mike.

CAMERA PULLS BACK to show several newspapers spread out on the balcony of Frances' beach house. As the papers ruffle in the wind, a little kitten swipes at them.

Frances sits in the sun writing in her diary, the same one we saw at the opening of the film. A man's shoes COME INTO VIEW.

Waterfront bar, full of SAILORS, WHORES, and HEAVY DRINKERS. Hanging over the bar is San Diego paraphernalia.

Frances and Harry sit at a table. Heavy boozing has led to philosophizing:

	Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze.

In the background, we SEE a DRUNKEN SAILOR lurching toward their table.

	Of course, it's not up to me to say anything. I'm just crew... Y'know, you hair's so fine you'll lose it if you're not careful. Wonder you all don't, the things you do to yourselves. In fact, I think you are already... Fact, I think you better --

The phone RINGS. She winces, groans, tries to open her eyes then squeezes them together: hung over. Her arm flails out, finds the light and turns it off.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances, looking disheveled, dazed, and over-tired from a sleepless night in jail, stands alone before the JUDGE. Next to the PROSECUTOR sits Tora, her jaw heavily bandaged, glaring at Frances. The spectator's section is packed.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>

<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you expect him to look you up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Suppressed laughter ripples through the courtroom.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's fine with me...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to spectators)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen --

</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Frances moves closer to the bench.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you telling me you didn't have a little rum in your pineapple juice this morning? I can smell it from here, Your Honor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
The courtroom erupts into surprised laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's enough!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Frances laughs triumphantly and spears the air with her finger, pointing at the Judge.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the truth! I can smell it from here -- you old hypocrite!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
The laughter grows. The Judge bangs his gavel.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine!

(rising)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
The Judge pounds his gavel. Frances is about to say something when suddenly the realization of what's happening hits her. The Judge is leaving the bench. A REPORTER runs out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(frightened now)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute... I haven't got a lawyer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
The Judge ignores this.

(shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I want to know is do I have any civil rights?

</FRANCES>

The Judge closes his chambers door behind him. Frances turns slowly. The Matrons are coming toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to make a phone call...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
She lunges at the Matrons, trying to get past them.

	I have a right to make a phone call!

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE COURTROOM - A ROW OF PHONE BOOTHS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Reporter is phoning in his story. The hallway is pandemonium.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
(from his notes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The kleig-lighted road to fame and fortune is strewn with heartbreak and despair. Today film star Frances Farmer, tarnished by alcohol and drugs" -- 'm I going too fast for ya?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
In the next phone booth we SEE Harry listening to the Reporter's spiel. He regards the confusion around him with calm eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE COURTROOM DOORS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They burst open. The Matrons and Two Cops come out carrying Frances. Reporters and Photographers rush past her.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're stealing my civil rights! Help me! I'm being kidnapped! Oh God, help me! Help me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
She suddenly sees the phone booths. Her eyes fill with tears, her shoulders slump forward and her lower lip begins to tremble. She no longer struggles.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(to a Matron)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haven't you ever had a broken heart?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
The Matron relaxes her grip and gives Frances a handkerchief. Frances dabs at her eyes... wraps the kerchief around her knuckles... and slugs the Matron in the jaw, sending her sprawling. Frances runs to the phones.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God, she's loose!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
Frances throws herself at the door of the booth. The Reporter is delirious with joy: what a story!
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's attacking your correspondent! Right here in the Court Building! Good God, this bitch is crazy! Someone stop her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
Frances pounds at the door a few more times, then moves to the next booth... into the arms of Harry.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Harry shakes his head. Before he can speak, Frances is grabbed from behind and dragged toward the elevator.

	With what must surely be the final act of madness, the curtain falls on Frances Farmer's once promising career. The crazed blonde who at 27...

<DIRECTION>
Harry opens the door to his booth. The Reporter looks up at him.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it a second, Bub...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
Harry says not a word, but punches the Reporter hard in the face. The Reporter sags, out like a light. In the confusion, no one has noticed a thing. Harry pulls the door shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COURTROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances is sitting in a wooden chair. The venetian blinds over the tall windows are almost completely closed. The room is dim and terribly quiet. A WOMAN is murmuring something to a kindly-looking JUDGE. Another MAN is standing beside her. Frances can't quite make out the words.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and we feel that this would be more appropriate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...a difficult decision, but, I'm sure, the proper one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
He nods to the other Man who, together with the Woman, turn away from the bench. As they pass in front of one of the tall windows, Frances recognizes the Woman. It is Alma Styles.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
She feels an arm slip around her shoulders and she stiffens. Her mother's face appears by hers.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mama, what's...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're taking me home!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Two other WOMEN appear at either side of Frances and Lillian. Lillian tenderly takes her daughter's face in her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First things first, little sister. Trust me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses Frances on the forehead. Frances looks at the two Women. They are smiling understandingly at Lillian. Frances looks a little alarmed.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. ENTRANCE DRIVE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wood-panelled station wagon turns the corner of a tree- lined road and heads up toward tall wrought-iron gates. On a white-washed wall are black letters: "MEADOW WOOD CONVALESCENT HOME". The Station wagon, a similar sign on its door, pulls up. The gates swing slowly open, and it travels up a long tree-lined driveway. As it goes by, we see Frances sitting in the back seat between Lillian and one of the Women from the previous scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car heads up toward a large Spanish-style building set back among some trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A SMALL OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances sits in front of a desk nervously smoking a cigarette. Lillian stands at a window looking out at a broad expanse of well-manicured lawn ending at a row of oaks in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why it's beautiful here! What a view!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Lillian smiles enthusiastically at Frances, who stares accusingly back: she's not falling for that.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An awkward moment of silence. Lillian fidgets, doesn't know what to say. She is rescued when the door opens and DR. SYMINGTON (early 30s, glasses, white coat and ingratiating smile) enters. He holds his right hand out to Frances.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good afternoon, Miss Farmer. I'm Dr. Symington.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Frances stares at the proffered hand. Lillian steps in quickly and takes it.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good afternoon, Doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Doctor winks at Frances and puts a hand on Lillian's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm very pleased to meet you, Mrs. Farmer. I'm sure we'll have more of a chance to talk later. Right now I think it's important that your daughter have a chance to settle in. Perhaps it would be best if you said your goodbyes here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles pleasantly. Lillian is obviously very put off by the idea. She looks at Frances who stares unseeingly out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Well, I have some background that you should probably know about if you're...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no doubt, Mrs. Farmer. If you'll speak to the girl at the desk, she'll arrange an appointment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to the door and opens it. Lillian is momentarily at a loss, but she acquiesces. She bends down and tightly hugs Frances, who pats her on the back a couple of times.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be back real soon, little sister. You be a good girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She waits for a reply and then, getting none, starts out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(staring out window)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mama!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Lillian turns back expectantly.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(warningly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I want to go home, Mama.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Lillian looks to the Doctor, who nods sympathetically at her.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll see, little sister. Everything will be fine. The doctors know best.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She goes out and down the hall. The Doctor closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks are hardly necessary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It ain't for lack of trying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(seductively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
He reddens ever so slightly and looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel I've known you for a long time... you see, I've followed your career... you're a fascinating case... I'm looking forward to resolving your predicament.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
Frances' face begins to set in hard planes.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! Are you really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(can cripple your ability to function...)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops as Frances rises and leans over his desk:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please sit down...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Normal. Average.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. Will you please sit down now?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Symington says.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Did you really say that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This whole thing is a joke!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay calm, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(soft, seductive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning harder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(very hard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have someone show you to your room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Symington stares at her. With a careful, almost scientific gesture he moves thumb and forefinger over his lip, then rubs the two fingers together. Yes, there is sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really should get some rest now. Nurse will meet you outside. Good day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes a button on his desk and reaches for a folder. Frances hasn't moved. She gazes at him evenly.
</DIRECTION>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there something else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't say 'Symington says'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes are very calm now, he smiles at her patronizingly.
</DIRECTION>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Symington says.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANCES' ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Small, white, spartan and rather pleasant. Lillian is standing by the window, testing the locks. She turns and goes to the bed, fussing with the pillow, seeming very uncomfortable. She pulls at the corners of the mattress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and a tall, sullen-looking MATRON walks in. Lillian doesn't pay much attention to her.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not much on hospital corners, are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<MATRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You Farmer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATRON>
<DIRECTION>
Something in her tone makes Lillian look up. The Matron closes the door behind her and advances. Lillian assumes her full height.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances is walking with a NURSE. They pass a variety of other patients, some of whom look old or beaten but few of whom seem overtly crazy.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So this is the nuthouse...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
The Nurse smiles confidentially at her.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey... take my word for it. This is a resort.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
They get to the door and HEAR Lillian's protesting voice:
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have no right!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
They enter and SEE the Matron struggling to get Lillian's coat away from her. Lillian pleads with Frances.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Frances bursts out laughing. The Matron releases Lillian and comes for Frances.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANCES' ROOM - DAY CLOSE-UP OF A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A little fluid squirts out the tip.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Frances strapped down on a white cot. The Nurse is holding the syringe while a THIN NURSE and an ATTENDANT stand by.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got to tell me what it is!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<THIN_NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's insulin. It throws your body into shock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIN_NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
Frances looks at her suspiciously, uncertain whether to believe this, and turns toward the Nurse with the hypodermic.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE_WITH_HYPO>
<DIRECTION>
(reassuringly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just vitamins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE_WITH_HYPO>
<DIRECTION>
This sounds more reasonable. Frances relaxes somewhat.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE_WITH_HYPO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A, C, B-Complex, certain minerals...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(inserting hypo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just stay relaxed... Good, now open your mouth a sec.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE_WITH_HYPO>
<DIRECTION>
Frances does. The Attendant jams a rubber bar between her teeth. Frances squirms, fights. The Attendant holds the bar in place. And the Nurse pushes the plunger on the hypo. Frances goes rigid. Her eyes widen, her back arches. With a loud hoarse cry she starts to convulse. The SCREEN BEGINS TO FADE into bright white light. She is unconscious. The SCREEN IS NOW BLANK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COURTYARD - MEADOW WOOD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances sits beside Lillian on a bench. Other patients with ground privileges wander aimlessly about.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is an open carpet bag at Lillian's feet and, in her lap, a bundle of letters and telegrams that she's showing to Frances. Frances seems restless.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and here's the one from Duluth. A war widow with five children. She works in a defense plant and she's very worried about you. I answered her that she shouldn't let worry over you affect her vital work; and that you'd be back on the silver screen in no time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She hands it to Frances, who lets it drop beside her on the bench.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are these all opened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why did you bring them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your fan mail, little sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(looking off, under her breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You kill me, Mama.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Frances sighs. She looks for something to divert her attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SYMINGTON'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances is alone in the room. The door is ajar. She's standing over Symington's desk, which is empty except for a doodle pad. The doodle she's looking at is extremely bizarre, sadistic... After a moment, Symington ENTERS holding several folders. Frances' manner changes very subtly.
</DIRECTION>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(sitting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. It was very good to see her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Any problems?

	Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.

<DIRECTION>
(a performance)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.

(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<FRANCES>

</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Frances is wrapping and unwrapping a handkerchief around her knuckles. Looks a little crazy. Symington's watching it. She stops.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYMINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
Frances stares at him. Stunned. Horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<SYMINGTON>

<SYMINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?

</SYMINGTON>
<FRANCES>

	'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!

Symington smiles patronizingly.

	<DIALOGUE>
	...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!

EXT. MEADOW WOOD CONVALESCENT HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few PATIENTS stroll about, visiting with relatives. Frances lies on a chaise lounge. She's wearing a robe and dark glasses, a big hat, and she seems to be sleeping. THE CAMERA APPROACHES. Her hair is a mess, her skin splotchy. And something is moving: her hand... one finger on one hand is moving in agitated little bursts. We realize she is not sleeping at all...
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi there. How 'bout a walk in the woods?

She looks to one side and sees him. Frowns. Takes off her glasses and runs her fingers nervously through her hair.

<DIRECTION>
Frances and Harry walking in a relatively secluded area. She glances around continuously... suspiciously.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're doin' stuff to me, Harry. Can you see it? You feel it? They're putting stuff in my food or something, my water, and they're using it to put thoughts in my head. You understand? They're trying to re- arrange what's in my head, they're trying to drive me crazy! Oh, Harry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
She breaks down and weeps on Harry's shoulder. Harry looks around warily.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't stay here anymore, you understand? I can't, I can't. I gotta get home. I gotta get somewhere else, anywhere, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Harry nods, squeezes her arm firmly -- a warning -- as a white-coated ATTENDANT APPROACHES. Frances straightens up.
</DIRECTION>
<ATTENDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Miss Farmer! Time for your bath, Miss Farmer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATTENDANT>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen: to the left. Straight through the trees and over the wall to your left. My car is there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
The Attendant reaches them.
</DIRECTION>
<ATTENDANT>
<DIRECTION>
(as if to a child)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's time for your bath!

<ATTENDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come along now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATTENDANT>
<DIRECTION>
Frances starts to move off with the Attendant. For an instant Harry -- and we -- wonder if she really is crazy.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frances! Did you hear what I said?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns. The Attendant turns. She smiles sweetly, madly.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, Harry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
The Attendant is between her and Harry. We SEE her face turn dark. She shoves the Attendant toward Harry and shouts:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(fiercely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over the walls!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
She runs. The Attendant staggers toward Harry, who knocks him down with two punches. ANOTHER ATTENDANT runs up. Harry whips out an icepick and brandishes it at them:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want crazy? I'll show you crazy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
The Attendants hold their ground. Harry runs after Frances.

Frances and Harry crash through bushes, come to a high wall.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(offering to lift her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Frances hugs him tightly, kisses him. He lifts her by the waist, and she grabs the top of the wall and hauls herself up. Harry joins her. We SEE, over the wall, a Lincoln Zephyr waiting on a dirt road. Harry and Frances jump down as we HEAR the Two Attendants burst through the underbrush and haul themselves up. As their heads pop over the top of the wall, they see the Lincoln disappearing down the road in a cloud of dust...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LINCOLN - DUSK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry, eyes bleary and shoulders hunched, tries to concentrate on the road ahead. The RADIO DRONES quietly, a lazy saxophone ballad. After a while, there's movement in the back seat and Frances sits up. She yawns and stretches as Harry watches her in the mirror.

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.

A hand puts a nickel in, and we HEAR Bing Crosby singing "Love Is So Terrific." We PAN across the dance floor, where Harry and Frances are dancing.

	Love is so terrific Such a funny feeling Makes you want to cuddle And coo...

Frances sighs and begins to play it. Lillian scrunches down and begins to hum along.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just a flow gently sweet Afton day. Life has been so good to me. Why, I have just about everything one could wish... but I still have so many blank pages in my scrapbook.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>

She smiles warmly at Frances. Frances abruptly stops playing.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>

	I think I need a little air.

Lillian nods, moves aside. As Frances heads for the door:
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.

INT. FLEA-BAG HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DERELICTS sleep on broken couches and armchairs. In a corner by a pay phone Ernest Farmer sits at a rickety desk piled high with briefs. Frances sits across from him. They've been talking.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...So what do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<ERNEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.

</ERNEST>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that, Dad, but --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<ERNEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERNEST>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<ERNEST>
<DIRECTION>
(after a pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERNEST>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<ERNEST>

Frances rises from her chair, looking around the room to hide her tears. Ernest rises too.
</DIRECTION>
<ERNEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and...

	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(excited)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you.

	They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances, you can't do this to your fans! Why, they've been praying for you all through this nightmare. You can't turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail I've been answering!

She points to a stack of letters on the table.

<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!

	Mama, shut up!

Frances storms out. Lillian sits back in the chair, suddenly looking very old. She massages her wrists...

INT. LARGE OFFICE - DAY

Dark. Blinds drawn. We SEE a single light with a green shade, HEAR the soft coo of Lillian's voice. The CAMERA SHIFTS gradually onto her earnest face.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All my life, I've tried to live up to my parents' example. To have the independence of mind and fortitude of spirit that have made this country great. I taught that to Frances: Speak out. Aspire. Make something of yourself, something --

DR. DOYLE, a psychiatrist, and the others are seated with Judge Hillier around a table.

</DOYLE>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... yes.

</LILLIAN>

Doyle fills in a line on the printed form before him.

Alma holds up Lillian's bruised wrists as evidence.

	Her married name?

INT. DOWNTOWN SEATTLE BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's late. Frances stands at the bar acting out a joke for a small audience of devoted DRINKERS.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Looking for a drink, and the town is deserted, he can't understand it. Finally he finds a bar, goes in -- the place is empty, bartender's closing up. Salesman says, 'Gimme a martini.' Bartender's real nervous, he says, 'No, no, no, I gotta close. Big Otis is coming to town.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them is a large window covered by a gauzy curtain. In the street a police car cruises slowly past.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Salesman says, 'I don't care. I gotta have a martini.' So the bartender fixes him a martini real fast, grabs his money, and runs out the back. Salesman sits there sipping his martini,... he's got the bar all to himself... Then he hears it. This big roaring in the street. RRRAAAAAAA!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stomping her feet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gigantic footsteps... coming closer. Stopping.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE the police car again... It stops out front.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enormous hands reach in, grab the swinging doors and rip them off their hinges. This huge man stomps in. Picks up a chair and hurls it over the bar, smashing the mirror -- whiskey and glass flying everywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
TWO COPS appear at the window, looking in.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He turns to the salesman: 'What the hell're you doing in here!' Salesman says, 'I'm just drinking a martini.' 'Oh yeah?' the guy says. 'Well you better get outa here! Big Otis is coming to town!'
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>

Everyone laughs. A long moment of enjoyment. Then Frances turns, looks out the window and sees the cops.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hillier behind the bench. Doyle sits at a table with Alma Styles. A COURT RECORDER taps out his notes in an odd, jerky style. (NOTE: This scene is INTERCUT, where appropriate, with shots of FRANCES in a bare room, wearing a strait jacket.)
</DIRECTION>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...From her history, it's apparent the patient suffers from a paranoid reaction with pronounced egotism. Her violent responses have recently included aggression against her mother. In view of the deep-seated nature of her ailments and her failure to respond satisfactorily to insulin shock, it is my opinion she may ultimately require permanent institutional care.

</HILLIER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STEILACOOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Huge, dark-red brick buildings with barred windows, loom out of the fog and trees. A van pulls up to the front entrance. Two MEN get out, open the back doors and assist Frances out. She is strapped into a strait-jacket. She yells and struggles violently but a piercing SCREAM stops her. She looks up at the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From a top floor window, a thin, white hand protrudes from the bars and waves "hello".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STEILACOOM HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances is dragged kicking and screaming down the shiny linoleum-covered hallway. There are many patients here, talking to imaginary birds, laughing at unheard jokes. A few of them notice Frances, most do not. The two Orderlies arrive at a door and throw it open. A bare 6'×10' room is revealed with a narrow cot and no windows. Frances is pushed inside and the door locks shut with a resounding click.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TREATMENT ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MEDICAL STUDENT wheels a small electrical machine up to a table. On the table Frances is securely strapped down. TWO DOCTORS grease Frances' temples and put two metal electrodes on them. The electrodes are connected to the machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>

Doctor #2 nods and jams a rubber bar into Frances' mouth. The Medical Student steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<STUDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I push the button on this one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUDENT>
<DIRECTION>
Doctor #1 shoots a silent query to Doctor #2.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.

The Medical Student pushes the button with great gravity. Frances' body immediately begins to convulse. It seems as if it will never stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STEILACOOM - A WOMAN'S WARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beds three inches apart. Women patients lie on them in varying stages of madness and decay. Some are bound to their beds with coarse cloth strips. One bed is empty, the bonds chewed through. We find Frances sitting on the floor staring at a hissing radiator. Her lips are caked with blood. Her eyes are glazed. She is dreaming. Or remembering...

INT. STEILACOOM - THE HYDRO-THERAPY ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A NURSE ushers Frances and two ATTENDANTS into a sparse tiled room with dilapidated plumbing and fungus growing between the tiles. In the center are three steel baths with hammocks suspended above them. The Attendants strap Frances into a bath as Dr. Doyle enters.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(speaking with difficulty)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you believe that.

</DOYLE>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
The Attendants lower her into the empty tub.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.

	You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
The Doctor smiles sympathetically.
</DIRECTION>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
As he turns to leave, Frances laughs triumphantly. The two Attendants lower her into the bath and begin to fill it with ice-cold water.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>

They shove a rubber bit between her teeth. She immediately spits it out and defiantly starts to sing in order to keep her teeth from chattering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STEILACOOM - DINING HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone eating gruel. A parade of lunatics. The edge of incipient violence is palpable. Frances eats listlessly. Others are playing with their food, devouring it ravenously, fondling each other. Suddenly a call starts up at the far end of the hall. Other voices join in. At first we don't understand it, but gradually the words become clear:
</DIRECTION>
<CHANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come and get it! Come and get it! Come and get it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHANT>
<DIRECTION>
The whole hall joins in. The Nurses make no effort to stop it. Others at Frances' table smile at her, try to push her to her feet. When they succeed, the hall breaks into applause and a new chaotic chant:
</DIRECTION>
<CHANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We want Frances! We want Frances!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHANT>
<DIRECTION>
The chant is quickly silenced by hushing sounds. Everyone is watching Frances. She climbs up on her bench. Her eyes are glazed, her face expressionless. This feels like some kind of automatic behavior. She takes an exaggerated posture and speaks in almost a whisper:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come and get it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
The hall breaks into riotous applause, catcalls, stomping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances climbs down from her bench. That was the entire performance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STEILACOOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two dark FIGURES move stealthily along the shadow of the main building. A little ways ahead, a door opens, sending a shaft of light across the ground. The two Men duck back into the shadows. Five young SOLDIERS EXIT, paying off and waving goodbye to one of the Orderlies. The door closes. They head off down the road laughing and joking together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two Men emerge from the shadows and approach the door. They try the handle. It opens. The first one in is Harry, followed by the other Man carrying a rolled-up bundle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STEILACOOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE Harry and the other Man, now wearing a white Doctor's coat, walking quickly down a dim hallway. They come to a large door with a barred window. The Man fiddles with a keyring and unlocks the door. They enter. We HEAR the door lock behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just inside the door the Doctor flicks on a flashlight and they walk down the center of the room. The beam of light sweeps over women PATIENTS in their cots, crammed side-by- side. Some are asleep, others stare blankly at the ceiling. A few smile invitingly at the two Men, whispering obscenities. The light falls on a bedraggled woman hunched over in a corner between the wall and a cot. It is Frances. Harry goes to her, putting his arms around her. She is very heavily sedated. Tears spring to Harry's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>

	Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.

</DOCTOR>

Harry holds her around the shoulders and straightens out her arm. Frances starts to struggle and moan loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... she knows about these. Shut her up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Harry glares at the Doctor, but puts a hand over her mouth and the Doctor injects her. Her arm is covered with sores.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(tenderly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll be okay, honey. He's just givin' you something to make you think, so that tomorrow you can tell 'em what they want to hear, okay? Tell 'em you were crazy as a loon and they cured you and you're grateful.

The two Men come out and the Doctor quickly locks the door.

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. 'Cause I don't want to see you again.

<DIRECTION>
Frances' face appears at the tiny barred window. We can just hear her:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, Harry. I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you too, Frances.

Behind Frances we HEAR the Women screaming: "I love you, Harry!" The Doctor takes Harry's arm and pulls him down the corridor.

<DIRECTION>
INT. WARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances turns to face the women in their cots. Collects herself. Looks repentant. She is practicing tomorrow's speech.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I realize now that I was a very sick woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<WOMEN_IN_WARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sick! She's sick!

	<DIALOGUE>
	She's... not... normal...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ONE_PATIENT>
<DIRECTION>
The others laugh. We realize that if Frances can handle this, she can sail through it tomorrow. The catcalls gradually diminish as she concludes her speech.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I was not taking responsibility for my actions. But now, thanks to your treatment, I feel ready to face myself, ready to resume the career which I so single-handedly shattered. I only hope... I hope I can make you all proud of me. Thank you. Thank you so much.

<DIRECTION>
The room is silent now. A very odd moment. To their astonishment, the other patients seem to believe her...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FARMER HOUSE - SUNNY DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vegetable garden is overgrown, the paint peeling. The house is in disrepair, but we can tell from the freshly-mowed lawn that some effort has recently been made...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car pulls up. Frances kisses Ernest on the cheek and gets out. As he drives off, she walks into the yard and looks around, heaves a sigh; she's home. Then Christmas lights spring on over the porch. Lillian comes out grinning broadly, followed by REPORTERS. Frances blanches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FARMER HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances sits on the couch next to Lillian. They're sipping tea and answering questions. Frances is uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>

<REPORTER>

	Who did your hair, Frances?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
She touches it shyly. It's swept up in a continental style.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I like to try different styles. Sometimes if you're old-fashioned enough, you find you're modern. Right, Mama?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Lillian laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think of all this, Mrs. Farmer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a miracle. Just a miracle.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The porch light goes out. Shadows pass over the curtained windows. Across the street a match flares. Harry is leaning against a tree. He lights a cigarette and settles back to wait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FARMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lillian walks from room to room turning off lights. Frances is neatly stacking the dessert dishes on a tray. Very domestic, out of character. She carries the tray into the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, just leave those things for now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Lillian smiles warmly at her.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for understanding, Mama.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Lillian links her arm with Frances' and they go upstairs together.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will, I promise.

</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
They hug each other.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night, dear.

</LILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Lillian waits until Frances has shut her door before closing hers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front door opens and Frances, suitcase in hand, slips out onto the porch. She eases the door shut behind her, tiptoes down the steps and, without looking back, starts down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances rounds the corner, then sees him: Harry, standing by his car, smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Harry...

</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
She approaches him tentatively.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.

</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Long beat. She turns and stares at him sadly.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't change the things they did to me, Harry. Only I can do that... by myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
He nods slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?

	I don't know.

	Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Except... time has a way of --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles wistfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope so, Frances.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
They hug. Together for an instant. Then she shivers as if the contact were too much.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(disentangling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
He nods, looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be seeing you, kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and walks slowly to his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barren desert. The middle of nowhere. A lone male HITCHHIKER, poor, stands at a crossroads. A car coming the wrong direction raises dust along the highway. It slows, stops, and lets Frances out. She is now dressed in jeans and a workshirt. She has a heavy tan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She glances across at the Hitchhiker and nods casually. He responds in kind. A relaxed silence follows. Two strangers passing. His voice, when he speaks, is gentle, calm:
</DIRECTION>
<HITCHHIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HITCHHIKER>

<HITCHHIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>

<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wherever they're going, I'm going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HITCHHIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HITCHHIKER>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
She stops. She sees now that the car heading toward her is a cop car. She averts her face... then tries to hide her gesture.
</DIRECTION>
<HITCHHIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HITCHHIKER>
<DIRECTION>
Frances sighs as the cop car speeds away.
</DIRECTION>
<HITCHHIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're looking for you, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HITCHHIKER>
<DIRECTION>
She's uncertain whether to trust him. Takes the plunge:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HITCHHIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HITCHHIKER>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I've never been able to figure that out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs. She shivers slightly, pulls her clothes around her. He takes out a small flask and offers, no strings:
</DIRECTION>
<HITCHHIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got a little whiskey here, warm you up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HITCHHIKER>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, truly grateful:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Then she sees a ball of dust nearing... a car on his side.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. Maybe they'll pick you up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
The car stops. Its lights flashing. COPS jump out.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HITCHHIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HITCHHIKER>
<DIRECTION>
She does. She's pursued. The Hitchhiker makes an effort to impede the Cops' progress, but is tossed aside. The Cops are slowly, inevitably, gaining on her.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Francie, you know I can't do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERNEST>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>

<ERNEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know.

We SEE them approaching a side road.

<ERNEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.

They are nearer the side road.

	I'll try to protect you, Francie. I will, I'll talk to her. We'll have a real talk.

(have I done?)

	<DIALOGUE>
	No! You're not talking now. You listen. You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. You can't pretend I love you because I don't. I can't. Not after what you've done to me. Because you see... I'm still me... I'm trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all.

INT. STEILACOOM - VIOLENT WARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ward is a huge room packed with nearly naked women, their hair cropped very short. The walls are corrugated tin nailed to bare wood framing. The place looks like an enormous tool shed. The SOUND OF GARBLED VOICES and SCREAMING never stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
These are the forgotten ones... beyond hope. Everyone here has lost any notion of what they might have once been. Their faces are slack, only their eyes glow with an animal ferocity. Some wander aimlessly about, unheeding of others who are pushing, kicking and screaming at them. Many squat in the dirt by the walls, mired in their own urine and excrement, chanting wordlessly to themselves. Some appear lifeless, their prone bodies shoved out of the way. Some women are involved in violent sex with themselves or each other, some in mindless fist-fights. In a far corner we SEE a group of men in various military and medical uniforms, their backs to us, facing the wall, grouped around something. We HEAR their cheering and laughing and joking, slapping each other on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SLOWLY MOVE CLOSER and can see over their shoulders the object of their hilarity. It's Frances, lying naked and spread- eagled on the floor. Four hospital ATTENDANTS pin her arms and legs. A SOLDIER, his pants down around his ankles, is squirming violently on top of her. Frances' eyes are open but glazed, her face turned away from her attacker. She is passive and unresisting. She is reciting to herself, over and over.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We shall hear the angels, we shall see the whole sky all diamonds...

Frances keeps reciting as one rapist gets off. The Soldiers cheer as another quickly takes his place.

EXT. STEILACOOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A heavy snow is falling. From the corrugated-tin Violent Ward, a thin white hand protrudes from a narrow window to catch a snowflake.

As it opens and closes, capturing individual flakes, a VOICE BEGINS TO SING "You Are My Sunshine...". We recognize Frances' voice, still surprisingly strong and steady.

INT. STEILACOOM - HOLDING WARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frances, barely conscious, lies strapped to a bed. Doyle and an ORDERLY approach her. Doyle nods toward her as if to say: that one. He and the Orderly unstrap her.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(to Doyle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll get you home, Frances.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Harry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
She's untied. The Orderly helps her up onto a gurney.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lies down. Doyle nods to the Orderly, who starts pushing her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is wheeled out and down:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Past other patients, doctors, etc. We see some of this from her point of view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes through two swinging doors, down another hall... at the end of which a man opens a door. She is pushed onto a:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is wheeled into a row... between two other patients. In the background we HEAR a voice:
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HARLINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One merely inserts the leucotome beneath the eyelid and presses up into the prefrontal lobe, manipulating it so as to sever the nervous connections between the thalamofrontal radiation and the body of the brain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HARLINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
The lights are bright, on her and the other patients. We cannot see, but we sense, an audience watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HARLINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because of the speed and simplicity of the operation, I am able, as you are seeing, to perform the procedure on ten patients in less than a half hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HARLINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
Frances stares up at a fan in the ceiling. It's moving round and round. The voice drones on.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HARLINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The operation is completely painless and can be performed without any sedative whatsoever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HARLINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
We now see vaguely that DR. HARLINGTON has moved to the patient on the adjacent gurney.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HARLINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have always known that this form of radical treatment was effective, but until now it couldn't be applied on a large scale. The old procedure required a full day's work by a surgical team to perform a single operation. In the same time, working alone, I can treat fifty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HARLINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
Frances turns and stares mutely, without emotion, at what's happening next to her: the leucotome (an ice-pick-like instrument) is inserted into a woman's eye socket...
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HARLINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This procedure works best on patients with extreme over-reactions to emotional stimuli. It can also be used as a last resort on those who seem impervious to other forms of treatment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HARLINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
The leucotome is then shoved up into the brain and twisted.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HARLINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In plain language, my technique severs the nerves which give emotional energy to ideas. Along with the cure comes a loss of affect... a kind of emotional flattening...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HARLINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
Frances turns away and stares at the fan again. There is something simple and pleasing about its rhythmic whirring...
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HARLINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...with diminished creativity and imagination. Patients become like good solid cake with no icing. But, after all, it is their emotions and imaginations that are disturbed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HARLINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
We glimpse the leucotome being withdrawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HARLINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These patients will soon be leaving the hospital.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HARLINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
Harlington's face moves vaguely into Frances' view.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HARLINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lobotomy gets 'em home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HARLINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
He moves directly over Frances, his pleasant face obscuring the fan. As the leucotome descends, we:

CUT TO:

EXT. FARMER HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Total disrepair: peeling paint, broken steps, fallen shingles... This house is easing slowly back to nature...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FARMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neglect is just as evident inside. Dust, faded rugs, torn yellow curtains. Lillian sits on the couch staring out a window. She has aged and looks tiny, frail, with no trace of her old formidability. The scrapbook is open on her lap.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was I saying? Oh yes, it was the Communists that did it to Frances.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ernest is hunched in a chair by the stone fireplace. FOUR REPORTERS crouch on the floor, totally bored. Yesterday's headlines are now old news.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They capture the mind by first seducing the heart. I suppose I never taught Frances to close her heart...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Two Reporters rise and edge toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... excuse us, Mrs. Farmer. We're going to have to... uh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<THIRD_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
(rising)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I better pack it in too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIRD_REPORTER>
<LILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(distractedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon? Oh, would you like more lemonade?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
The last Reporter gets to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<FOURTH_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
(kindly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we've had enough. Thank you, Mrs. Farmer. Goodbye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOURTH_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
He follows the others out. Lillian climbs wearily to her feet and goes to the window, looks out. Ernest stares into the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Ernie, I think we should have Frances' room repainted for when she comes home. That'll brighten her day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ernest looks at her wearily, as if she is stark raving mad. He knows damn well Frances isn't coming home...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN ON: A TELEVISION SCREEN against a dark background The show is "This Is Your Life". We SEE a smiling RALPH EDWARDS, reading from a large black book. Next to him stands Frances. She has aged dramatically, but is still a very handsome woman. She seems uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Dwayne Steele divorced you, and from this point on, your story takes a darker turn. Shunned by the Hollywood you criticized so harshly, alienated from your family and friends, you turn your back on professional commitments in New York, and alcohol and drugs enter your life. These are sad, desperate times for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARDS>
<DIRECTION>
Throughout this, Frances' jaw works slowly back and forth, not from anger, but in embarrassment and doubt.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARDS>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
We MOVE AWAY from the screen to see that the TV set is in the living room of a comfortable, tastefully furnished home. On the couch in front of the set sits Harry York. He still looks athletic, young for his age. Tears stream down his cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARDS>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were you an alcoholic?

ON THE SCREEN Edwards has moved Frances over to a seating area where various people from Frances' life are waiting, smiling at her. We've never seen any of them before.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and over 200 producers have been invited to watch your appearance here tonight... so who knows, Frances Farmer, anything's possible on your comeback trail!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating seating area)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And since your friends tell me they have to drive you everywhere, look what we've got for you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARDS>
<DIRECTION>
The curtains behind them open to reveal a car in a spotlight.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A brand new 1958 Edsel!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARDS>
<DIRECTION>
The audience applauds. Frances smiles guardedly.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Ralph.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<EDWARDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARDS>
<DIRECTION>
Applause.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Frances Farmer, this is your life. Good night. God bless you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARDS>
<DIRECTION>
The audience applauds. Frances smiles wearily and accepts congratulations.

EXT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - HOLLYWOOD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of PEOPLE are coming down the front steps, Frances among them. They all talk happily, Frances is silent but smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where shall we drop you, Frances? Home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(vaguely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... no, someone's picking me up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
The people all excuse themselves, calling goodbye. Frances waits by herself for a few moments, but soon begins to walk away down the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns. Harry is leaning against the side of a building, looking much as he did when they first met. But there is very little light of recognition in Frances' eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mere. I want to talk to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(flatly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>

Harry is a little puzzled by her reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How... how ya doin', Farmer?

</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?

the cue)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... you're looking well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
They are both silent a long moment.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you say that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Harry is alarmed now.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(taking her by the arm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frances!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She angrily bares her teeth; then just as suddenly she relaxes and becomes lucid.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get mad at me, Harry. Please. It's just... Some things happen for the best.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes his hand as if to shake it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry clasps hers tenderly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She holds on like an old woman, stroking his hand. For an instant she gets lost in time, just holding his hand. Then she looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very slow.
	</DIALOGUE>

(uncertainly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we're not going to stop, are we?

	No.

</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(reassured)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we're not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
It is as if she is able to express in words the last remnant of her indomitable will... but the words bear no emotional power.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That would be okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a little way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He offers his arm. She takes it. All rather formal. They stroll on together.
