:SC: WATERHOLE - STONEWALL PASS, NEVADA - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The desert between Las Vegas and Tonopah, nothing but sage and greasewood. Sound in the distance, a motor. It comes closer then fades, comes closer, fades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pan off the waterhole in the direction of the sound. It approaches again, a figure appears in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE MOTORCYCLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only the rider's back, silver-streaked hair. This gaunt figure circles lazily in the moonlight, motorcycle tires rumbling over the alkali. The circles get bigger and now bigger, and as he comes around this time, the moonlight catches his face, aristo- cratic cheekbones, a stringy beard, a pilot's light windbreaker. This is Howard, age 62, looks over 70.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - HOWARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sweeping under the moon, wider and wider and now he speeds towards the waterhole, giving the Harley full throttle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE WATERHOLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A knoll running up to the edge of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HOWARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
heading straight for the knoll, the chopper kicking up sage and greasewood and alkali behind it. Tremendous speed -- it hits the knoll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE MOTORCYCLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Howard flying through the air, his knees clutched around the machine, his eyes wide with joy, laughter ringing through the desert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The motorcycle clears the waterhole on the leap, Howard snug in the saddle, lands in the mud on the other side, skids, churns, the tires spitting mud, now he rolls out on the desert again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - HOWARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sweeping into a figure eight, testing his motor now, picking up speed once more, heading straight for the knoll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE KNOLL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The motorcycle invisible, only the sound blasting through the night, louder, louder, and now the motorcycle hits the top of the knoll. A rock, a stone, something, it kicks, it stutters, it flies short.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HOWARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face exactly the same as before, exultation at the leap, but there is no motorcycle under him now, only air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - HOWARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His momentum carrying him over the water and he lands with a crunch on the other side, his head hits the mud, a flare of blood spurts from his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOWARD'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eye catching sight of his motorcycle fluttering down, landing with a splash, bubbling as it disappears into the waterhole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT - DUSK - ON HOWARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
picking himself up, stumbling across the desert, nothing but silence around him, his feet kicking over the alkali. He trips, rights himself, moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - HOWARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
faltering, falling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks himself up, his face scratched, his lips crusted with saliva, blood caked around his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOWARD'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Way in the distance, the headlights of a car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HOWARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to raise his hand, almost furtively, but then he draws it back. He does not want to wave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks towards the moon, spins once like a shot-putter. Now he falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The headlights pass on down the Interstate. Darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEVADA HIGHWAY - NIGHT - LONG SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two headlights, one dimmer and more yellow than the other, are coming down the Interstate now. Sound -- a man singing. The song is horrible, the voice joyous.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
(v.o.) (singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Well, he called his elves together To soup up his old sleigh So Rudolph and the other reindeer Could rest on Christmas Day....'
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - NIGHT - ON MELVIN DUMMAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a face with no secrets, a cowlick and sideburns, looking younger than his thirties; Montgomery Ward pants and a shirt with cowboy roses.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'He's got a million miles to travel And he'll do it in one day Oh that's because old Santa Claus Got a souped-up Santa sleigh.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
The song trails off into a hum as Melvin pulls off onto the side of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MELVIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
undoing his fly. As he reaches into his pants, the sound of a car in the distance, he quickly turns to hide himself, the car passes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now he reaches in again, but another car catches him in its lights.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeesuz.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs back into his car, stomps on the gas, and he zooms off the highway and on to the alkali, up an old cattle road. Now he scuds to a stop, steps out onto the emptiness of the desert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pissing, sighing with relief, his sigh mingling with the crackling of his urine as it hits the desert crust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MELVIN'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pleasure. The same pleasure he feels at eating, sleeping, defecating, copulating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Climbs back into his car. Starts up the motor, backs around, and the headlight catches a body lying in the deserted cattle road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
blinks. Squints, now he throws the car into low gear, rolls slowly towards the body, stops a few feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The body doesn't move. Limp, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MELVIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
following the shaft of the headlight, moving towards the body. Poised a step away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now he crouches over it. A grunt. Melvin rolls it over. A beard, Howard's long hair. He lifts him, the headlight shines full into Howard's eyes, they open, flicker. Howard grunts again.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whut?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Howard doesn't stir, doesn't answer. Melvin cradles Howard's head, and the ear comes into view, fresh blood trickling over the clotting. Melvin heaves Howard up, half-stumbling, half- carrying him towards the car, opens the passenger side and shovels him in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slamming the door shut. Now Melvin looks out towards the desert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only blackness and silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
climbs into the car on the driver's side, looks over at his passenger. Howard has scrunched himself into a corner, his eyes are wide open now, and wild with terror. Melvin catches it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melvin smiles, nothing from Howard. Melvin smiles again.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whut's the matter, ol' buddy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Howard doesn't answer. He turns his head a little but as he turns, blood oozes.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whut are you doin' out here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Silence again. Howard doesn't take his eyes off Melvin. Melvin leans toward him. Howard braces himself against the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
(peering into Howard's face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That ear don't look too good to me. You want a doctor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Howard shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a doctor in Beatty. That ain't but a few miles. Want to go to Beatty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Howard doesn't answer, just holds himself stiff against the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll go to Beatty. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
He throws the car into gear, spins around and heads off to- wards the interstate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melvin at the wheel, Howard hiding in the corner of the seat offering Melvin as narrow a view of his face as possible. Suddenly a clatter, Melvin's head whips around, Howard has been taken with the shakes, terrible heaves, his teeth chat- tering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Howard doubles over trying to warm himself, clutching both shoulders cross-handed. Melvin reaches for the heater, clicks it on, nothing happens.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This ain't but a '66 -- damn heater never did work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Howard shudders again, a terrible whistling through his teeth. Melvin bangs the heater with his fist.
</DIRECTION>
<HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOWARD>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean it's okay? Now you just hold on there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Melvin pulls over to the side of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MELVIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
climbing out, opening the trunk. The trunk light shows two giant plastic bags full of white powder, some horse harness, a bow and arrow, a fishing rod, stuffed animals and pull-toys, a ratty blanket and a pillow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He fishes out the blanket and pillow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO-SHOT - HOWARD AND MELVIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melvin leans towards Howard, drapes the blanket over him, but does not drape. It is about the size of a shirt and the pil- low he places under his head would fit a doll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Howard regards them.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They belong to my little girl. Can't sleep without her bumby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Melvin laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Howard shivers, the tiny blanket falls off him. He doesn't have the strength to pick it up, Melvin bends over to re- trieve it, as he does his head hits the dashboard and the heater whirrs on.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, damn! Damn!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs again. Nothing from Howard, still underneath the baby blanket, but now allowing his head to ease back ever so slightly into the pillow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melvin reaches his hand under the heater.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Warm as toast! You brought me luck, ol' buddy. That heater ain't worked since my wife kicked it last time I undressed her in the car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Howard stirs slightly, Melvin squints over at him. Melvin reaches across Howard, flips open the glove compartment -- a torrent of bills and kleenex, a flashlight, half-eaten candy bars, some knitting needles, a pair of scissors, old Dixie cups.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melvin rummages around in the mess.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was lookin' for a band-aid.

</HOWARD>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said 'Up yours.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Melvin rummages some more, more papers fall out, Howard half- tries to pick them up.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave 'em. They ain't but a bunch of collection notices.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
He snaps the glove compartment shut, looks over at Howard's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We ain't gonna get to Beatty any too soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No doctors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOWARD>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There ain't no doctors there. Just a public health nurse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No nurses.

<MELVIN>

EXT. GABBS, NEVADA - BEFORE SUNRISE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The middle of nowhere. In the distance, dense, white chemical smoke curling up off the ridge where a magnesium plant hovers. Down below, almost a mile away, the town, rutted dirt streets lined with trailers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MELVIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
driving down a baked-clay side street, dirty dogs clearing out of the way. A battered Airstream trailer lies ahead on the right. Pulling into the yard, grassless and sandy, a plastic pool caked with mud. A pull toy straddling an old clothes wringer. A clothesline, a child's snowsuit pinned to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MELVIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
climbing out of the car, picking his way to the door of the trailer, past a new Honda leaning against the air drums.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MELVIN'S TRAILER - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dinette set fighting for space with a child's bicycle and toys. A new TV, a dishrag from the evening meal draped over it.
</DIRECTION>

Melvin moves to a partition, a blanket strung on a piece of twine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darcy, a nymphet 10 years old, sound asleep. He bends to kiss her, tucks the blanket around her. She smiles. Melvin adjusts the heater, then moves off, pulling the partition closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON LYNDA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in her middle twenties, hunched sexy shoulders of an ex-cheer- leader, busky and redolent with sleep now. Melvin peels off his clothes, they drop at his ankles as he climbs into bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MELVIN AND LYNDA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He touches her. And she stirs. Melvin is glazed with the heat of her sleep, the warmth of the bed, Lynda's proximity. He rustles, she tries to quiet him, but now he moves over her. Excited by her, and now she by him, their intimacy always contained, conscious of Darcy beyond the curtain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melvin falling asleep. Lynda awake beside him. The sound of a car pulling up. Lynda freezes. A car door opens, shuts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another car door opens, shuts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON LYNDA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't move, tuned into the sounds, familiar with them almost, dreading them. Now she gets up and goes to the win- dow, looks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MELVIN'S YARD - EARLY MORNING - LYNDA'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A jump cable being connected to a battery in Melvin's car. A spark flies, the car starts. Repossession men in their Montgomery Ward suits, flip the cable off, throw it in the trunk of their car. One starts to close the trunk, the other stops him.

One lifts the handlebars, the other the rear wheel, and they heave it into their trunk.

Lynda reaches for the telephone.

<DIRECTION>
ROAD TO GABBS - DAWN - A PICKUP

jaunting down the road. At the wheel in a straw cowman's hat, Clark Taylor. Stashed in a rack behind him, like a shotgun, his guitar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MELVIN'S TRAILER - DAY - LYNDA
</DIRECTION>

Lynda reaches for her own bag, and she sees Melvin turn over. She rushes out the door, then stops. Goes back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON LYNDA AND MELVIN For an instant, the feeling she might want to climb into bed with him. She reaches down, jostles him awake. Melvin looks up.

BAGGING ROOM - BASIC MANUFACTURING - GABBS, NEVADA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melvin is seated astride a crate in front of a bagging machine. He holds open the bag, the magnesium oxide powder pours out, the machine seals the bag. Melvin heaves it on a treadmill behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the base of the treadmill is Little Red, sacking the bags on a pallet as they come off. A forklift reaches in, plucks the pallet, and shovels it onto a trailer outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The whistle blows. Melvin hits a button -- the machine stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melvin reaches for his lunch pail. Opens it. The remains of a sandwich, encrusted with staleness. He snaps it shut, follows Little Red out onto the loading platform. They jump down, move into the weigh-shack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. WAREHOUSE AREA - DAY

A gauge for a scale, a radiator, a five-gallon coffee urn.

<LITTLE_RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tall with blue. Takes tolls on the Golden Gate Bridge. You'll like her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_RED>
<DIRECTION>
Little Red places the cup under the coffee spout. It doesn't flow. He tips the urn, now releases the spigot, the coffee spurts out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Follow the coffee from the spout to the floor. On the floor, a hole has been worn, like a crater, from the drippings of the coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you say, Melvin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_RED>

Smoke pours up from under Little Red. He jumps out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You little red asshole!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Melvin whips off his jacket, starts beating away at the smoking seat. Little Red is running around outside of the car, cooling himself. Finally, Melvin who is making no headway, rips the whole seat out from its slides, throws it in the road.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you drive. And stay awake!

Now he sits down on the commode. As he does, he sees the fringe and tassels of a go-go costume, lovingly laid out to dry on a towel. He picks it up, holds it away from himself. Now he brings it close, smells it, buries his nose in the tiny swatch of material.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<JUDGE_HAYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Melvin, I want you to know there is a still, small voice that many people are blessed with that tells them when the truth is being spoken. It has been said, 'What doth it profit a man if he gain the whole world yet lose his own soul?' If you are lying, Melvin, which you are, in my opinion, your soul may be in jeopardy, but I am not con- cerned about your soul, Melvin, right now I am concerned about your hide, because if I find that you are lying before this Court, I will make it a special duty to have a piece of your hide. I will direct that the district attorney bring a criminal prosecution against you and I will make it my special project that if you are convicted I will recommend that you do prison time. And I want you to know Nevada State Prison is no country club like the Gabbs local jail or wherever you have served time. If you're lying, you're going straight to Nevada State Prison. All right, Melvin?

	No, I haven't.

	Melvin, isn't it true you can't come up with an answer because it never happened that way?

<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is the way it happened.

	Well, Melvin, if it meant eternal damnation in hell would you just say it still happened that way?

	Yes, I would.

Melvin leans back. Darcy waves. Melvin waves back.

<FROST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go back to when you got the will, and everybody celebrated and you were a national hero, Melvin. And they asked you about your getting over a hundred million dollars and I think you sobbed, choked, went into a sort of deep, heavy mood. I was kind of caught by it as I watched it on TV, but then my wife said, 'My God, it is just like the women on the game shows!' I don't watch the game shows myself, but soon after I learned you had gotten your wife on one.

Melvin looks at Lynda. She waves.
</DIRECTION>
<FROST>

	Let's go through the Golden Gate together, Melvin. Tell us the real truth. I know the dream is so much better -- My God, I was a child in Minnesota during the Depression and I can remember, kind of hoping one of those trucks going by might have a box of chewing gum on it and it would fall off. That was the dream -- it never happened. And I never tried to make it happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROST>
<DIRECTION>
Frost takes a deep breath.
</DIRECTION>
<FROST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's make a deal, Melvin. Tell us the truth and you know what I'll give you -- I'll plead in your be- half a whole day to have the judge give you probation. But if you don't tell the truth, I'll do my utmost to see you never breathe another free breath in the state of Nevada.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROST>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.

<JUDGE_HAYES>

	Mr. Dummar, do you wish to make any response to what I would characterize as an offer from Mr. Frost?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_HAYES>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would like to say I don't know if the will is a forgery or not. If it is, I didn't do it. And if it isn't --

<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess it's for real.

</ROGER>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does that mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That means he believes you. On July 6th, they're going to deter- mine the validity of the will. Like he said, 'It's the only will we've got,' plus the positive testimony by the handwriting ex- perts. I think the will is going to be admitted to probate. You're going to get your inheritance.

MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>

Howard looking carefully at the dashboard. Very slowly he puts the car into gear, very slowly he releases the brake, and very slowly he rolls it out onto the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MELVIN AND HOWARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melvin watching as Howard drives. Howard watching Melvin watching him. Now Melvin's head begins to nod. His eyes close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HOWARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driving, now he turns, sneaks a look at Melvin who is sound asleep beside him. Gives the car a little gas and begins to sing.
</DIRECTION>
<HOWARD>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is very happy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Pack up all my cares and woes Singin' low Here I go Bye bye blackbird....'
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOWARD>
<DIRECTION>
The car becomes a dot. It never disappears, nor does the music end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
