On the backslope of a mound of rubble, a three-man TV crew (field producer, reporter, and cameraman, all wearing flak jackets) waits while the cameraman, JEFFREY TAYLOR, works to repair his malfunctioning minicam.

Throughout this sequence, ROD, the reporter, types on a laptop computer, oblivious to what is happening around him.

HOWARD, the field producer, lies on his stomach, peering cautiously over the crest of the rubble through binoculars.

Beyond him we see an empty street. It is lined with buildings blasted by shells: a sawtooth wall in the f.g., a ruined high-rise at the end of the street, billboards in an unrecognizable foreign language.

Keeping an eye on the rear-view mirror, Jeff nods toward the grocery bag, trying to change the subject.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd you get?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Amy pulls out an assortment of candy bars and junk food.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Junk food fiesta. Sno Balls, Yoo Hoo, Moon pies... can you believe they still make this stuff?

CUT TO:

Far below us, the Cherokee traces the empty highway. There are no buildings, no houses, no other vehicles.

:SC: INT. CHEROKEE - DRIVING - FEW MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff drives in silence. Amy stares out the window, bored. Looking for a distraction, she picks up a cellophane package of doughnuts and peruses the label.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to brighten the mood)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is crazy. Look at this. Says if you win this mail-in contest, you can choose either ninety thousand dollars or ninety thousand doughnuts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him a playful glance.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would you do with ninety thousand doughnuts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff shrugs, disinterested.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno... Sell 'em for thirty cents each and pay off this car.

</JEFF>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very funny.

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, what about ninety thousand dollars? What would you do with that?

</AMY>

Jeff stares out the window. He's not into this.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Look, Amy, I'm not --

Suddenly his eyes drop to the console between them --

<AMY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?

<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should we go back?

<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the use. He's probably halfway to Bumblefuck now, the bastard.

</JEFF>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, maybe if we call the cops --

Jeff is about to reply when suddenly the car bucks.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
The car gives another jolt.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. I --

A warning light flashes on the instrument panel. The brakes and steering lose power. The engine quits cold.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang on -- I can't steer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
The CAR bucks and SCREECHES. After a few HICCUPS, it jerks to a halt, just beyond a crest in the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, they sit there dazed, staring ahead at the empty road. Then Amy notices an object on the floor -- the Nikon. She picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(deadpan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Found your camera.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
He rolls his eyes. He yanks the hood release and gets out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steam pours from under the hood of the Cherokee. Amy gets out and looks around at the scorched wasteland. Jeff goes to the front of the car, gropes under the hood for the release latch. He yanks his hand away, burned by the hot metal.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ow!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine.

Amy moves to Jeff to examine the burn. She reaches out.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said I'm fine, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff lifts the hood, examines the engine. He tugs on a cable, checks the battery connection and radiator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to the passenger's side and takes a hand-held cellular phone from the glove box. He dials zero and hits "send." The PHONE BEEPS.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out of range?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff grunts, tosses the phone on the seat. It bounces and lands on the floor. Amy watches as he returns to the engine and begins unscrewing the radiator cap.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on, Jeff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's it look like? I'm trying to fix the car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not the car.

</AMY>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

</JEFF>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on with you?

</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff busies himself with the engine, not answering.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been a month since you got back. You can't keep shutting me out like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeff, I'm talking to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(flaring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I really don't want to go into this right now. I'm changing jobs, our finances are fucked, and we're stuck in the middle of nowhere. So could we maybe just fix the --

He stops in mid-sentence. There is a RUMBLE in the distance. They look down the road.

</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
JEFF'S POV - DODGE RAM PICKUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
approaching fast on the road. As it streaks past, Earl yells and launches a beer bottle from the window. The BOTTLE SHATTERS on the asphalt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO JEFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watching the Ram speed away.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Asshole...

</JEFF>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking down the road)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeff --
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
A quarter-mile away, the pickup is slowing. It pulls a U-turn and stops, facing the Cherokee. It just sits there, ENGINE IDLING.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's he doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff watches the pickup, frowning. Then, from the opposite direction, they hear a LOW RUMBLE. They turn and stare at --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MASSIVE TRACTOR-TRAILER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
coming over a crest in the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a huge eighteen-wheeler. A white 1988 Peterbilt. It grinds into low gear and slows, BRAKES CREAKING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TRUCK comes to a halt with a HISS of compressed air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWN HIGHWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the PICKUP STARTS UP again. It pulls another U-turn and drives away, melting into the desert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
breathes a sigh of relief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver dismounts from the cab, leaving the ENGINE IDLING. We recognize him as the Trucker in the mini- mart. He removes his cap, revealing a shock of prematurely white hair. He is well-shaven, his clothes immaculate. His name is Red.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
<DIRECTION>
(TRUCKER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You folks all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Our car broke down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RED>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I figured that much. You want a hand pushing it off the road?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, I'd appreciate it. Amy, you want to steer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Amy gets behind the wheel and puts the shift in neutral. Jeff and Red push the car to the shoulder. As they push, Jeff glances at the CB antenna on Red's cab.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think you could radio a tow truck for us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sure would if I could, mister, but my C.B. blew a fuse this morning. I'm waiting till I hit the truck stop on I-40 to get it fixed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How far is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About 60 miles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(disappointed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Red walks around to the front of the car and peers down at the exposed engine.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd offer to take a look, but it's hard to say with these new engines. Used to be, you could give 'em a kick and a holler and they'd start right up. Now it's all computers and chips.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a new car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That could be the problem. You been running it pretty fast?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
Amy gives Jeff a reprimanding look. It's subtle, but Red notices.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell you what. If you want a ride, there's a little diner up the road. Belle's. They got a pay phone. You could call a tow truck from there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff considers this, glances back to where the Dodge Ram was last seen.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice of you to offer. But we've got a lot of stuff in the car. I think we're better off waiting for a cop to come along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Amy rolls her eyes. Red sees the look, trying not to smile. He glances up at a small plane flying overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
<DIRECTION>
(casually)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suit yourself. Not many cops on this road, that's why the truckers use it. Maybe you'll get lucky.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(tipping his cap)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and heads back toward his truck. Amy looks at Jeff. She waits till the trucker is out of earshot.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you nuts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't know this guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's offering to help. It could be hours before anyone else comes along. It's 100 degrees. You really want to be stuck out here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amy, I've got my equipment in the car. All our stuff. What if those guys come back and we're not here?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns away,

	<DIALOGUE>
	quietly to

himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus... don't be stupid...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Amy hears this. She's had enough. Flares.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stupid is sitting out here waiting for a cop when we already have a ride.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
In the b.g., the TRUCK is THROTTLING UP. Then, mad and careless:
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stupid was letting you talk me into leaving Boston.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns away. The truck starts to pull out. She bites her lip, thinking, then steps into the road and flags the truck down. Red brakes.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me? Do you think you could drop me at that diner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<RED>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure thing. How about you, mister? I could take you both just as easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's okay. My husband wants to stay with the car. I'll just get my purse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to the passenger side of the Jeep for her purse. Jeff follows, lowering his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think you're doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to the diner. I'm going to call a tow truck. Then I'm going to order an iced tea and wait. Good-bye, Jeff.

</AMY>
<JEFF>

(firm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not riding with that guy. End of story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanted to be alone. Well... you're alone. Why don't you take the time to get your head together?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
She walks to the truck. Jeff stands there. She climbs into the cab. Red moves some papers out of the way.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch your step, ma'am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls the door shut. The TRUCK THROTTLES UP and pulls away. Jeff watches the truck dwindle in the distance, flashers blinking. After a beat, the flashers cease.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

:SC: EXT. ROADSIDE - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

<DIRECTION>
Beneath a blazing sun, Jeff paces restlessly in front of the Cherokee, checking his watch, wiping beads of sweat from his face. He looks down the highway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing in sight. Extremely bored, he wanders over to the raised hood and studies the engine again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a few moments, something catches his eye. Curious, he kneels down and peers under the chassis. He frowns.

JEFF'S POV - LOOSE WIRE

BACK TO JEFF
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh for Christ's sake...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls his Swiss Army knife from his pocket and slides under the car. Working with the screwdriver blade of the knife, he reconnects the plug to its socket. In the process, his hands and shirt become stained with grease.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff slides out from under the car, brushes himself off and gets behind the wheel. He tosses the Swiss Army knife on the center console and keys the ignition. The ENGINE ROARS to life.

<DIRECTION>
A weather-beaten structure with a gravel parking lot. A peeling sign on the roof: "Belle's: Beer & Food." There is a phone booth outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cherokee pulls in and parks. Jeff CHIRPS the ALARM, heads for the entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BELLE'S - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark and dingy. Formica tables, a bar. Chunky customers in K-Mart clothes sit at the bar, nursing beers and watching a football game on a big MUTED TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff enters and all conversation stops. The other patrons turn and stare. After a moment, they return to their beers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff glances around. No sign of Amy. No sign of Red.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bored-looking BARTENDER stands behind the counter, preparing a sandwich. Behind him, a blackboard menu. Jeff approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me.

The Bartender looks up, a cutting knife in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was supposed to meet my wife here.

</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
The Bartender shrugs, gives him a look: Yeah, so?

<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dark hair, slender, about five- five. Wearing a pale blue Benetton shirt.

</BARTENDER>
<JEFF>

	Hank! Your order's ready.

The Bartender thinks a moment, shakes his head.

	Don't ring a bell.

</BARTENDER>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure?

The Bartender leans over the counter, calls out:
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Man here's looking for his wife, dark hair, button-on shirt, travelin' with a guy in a baseball cap. Anybody see 'em?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff looks up and down the counter. Blank faces, a few disinterested shrugs, a few headshakes no.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A disheveled female barfly, FLO, grins up at him.
</DIRECTION>
<FLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like she got away from ya, cowboy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLO>
<DIRECTION>
A few of the regulars chuckle at this. Jeff ignores them, turns back to the Bartender.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could she have left a message with another one of your employees?

</JEFF>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't see how. I'm the only one who works here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>

Jeff scratches his head. This doesn't make any sense.

	I don't understand. Is there another Belle's Diner?

	<DIALOGUE>
	No siree. Definitely not.

Jeff clenches his jaw, takes another look around. An elderly couple sit at a rear table, watching him. They whisper to each other.

	Shit.

He turns and goes outside...

:SC: EXT. BELLE'S - DAY

Jeff squints in the bright sunlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maybe he got this place confused with a different diner. He peers up at the sign. It says "Belle's," all right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks to the phone booth, looks inside. The phone book is missing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up the receiver, listens for the dial tone... Phone works okay. He hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands there for a moment, scanning the horizon in all directions. There is nothing else out here, nowhere else she could have gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff marches back into the diner...

	<DIALOGUE>
	About twenty miles.

<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, if my wife comes in -- her name is Amy -- tell her I was here. Tell her to stay put till I get back, not to move. Would you do that, please?

<BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs, bored)
</DIRECTION>

Jeff regards the Bartender skeptically. He takes one last look around, then heads out.

Either the driver doesn't notice, or he's ignoring Jeff, but the truck does not slow down.

Jeff shifts into the oncoming lane and pulls alongside the cab. He HONKS again and waves, gesturing for the truck to pull over. But the Peterbilt maintains its speed.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Red, alright. But he's wearing a different cap. FROM this ANGLE, we can't see into the passenger side of the cab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Red peers down at Jeff, puzzled. Jeff shouts at him, waves:
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pull over! Pull over!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Red suddenly notices something ahead in the road, BLARES his HORN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff looks up, sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An RV camper approaching in the oncoming lane!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGHWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff swerves onto the far shoulder as the RV whooshes past in the opposite direction, HORN BLARING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHEROKEE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff is rattled, catching his breath. He swings back onto the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGHWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff slips in ahead of the Peterbilt, then starts weaving and braking, forcing the truck to slow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both vehicles pull to the side of the road and stop. Jeff leaps out of the Cherokee and runs over as Red climbs down from the empty cab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: Throughout this scene, various cars and trucks pass in either direction.)

<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, pal, what the hell you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was signaling you to stop. Didn't you see me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff reacts. How thick can this guy be?
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's my wife?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My wife. Where is she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Red gives him a puzzled look.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How should I know where your wife is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I checked at the diner. No one saw her there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister, I don't know what you're talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff stares -- is this guy nuts?
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gave her a ride. You were supposed to drop her at Belle's diner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Red searches his memory, trying to be as helpful as possible. He shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope. Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you not remember? It was just half an hour ago, for chrissakes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Red gives him a peculiar look.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister, I never seen you before in my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, there is a loud SQUAWK from inside the cab -- the CB RADIO.
</DIRECTION>
<CB_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (filtered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Breaker, breaker -- Iron Man, you copy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CB_VOICE>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(reacts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your radio works --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(locks eyes with Red)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you doing -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff freaks out, circling the truck, calling loudly:
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amy? Amy?! You in there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Red shrinks back, unnerved.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, mister, I don't know what you want, but --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want my fucking wife, is what I want! What have you done to her?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Red's eyes dart to something in the distance. Jeff catches this, turns...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHERIFF'S PATROL CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cruising toward them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff runs into the middle of the road and waves frantically. The patrol car switches on its flash bar and speeds up, pulling to a stop behind the Peterbilt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHERIFF BOYD, 50ish, climbs out, sizing up the situation. Jeff runs over.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Officer, I need your help!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, this guy has my wife!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Calm down, sir. Tell me what's going on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff catches his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what the hell's going on. Last time I saw her she was with this guy in his truck. Now he's saying he's never seen her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Officer, he's crazy -- I don't know what he's talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't lie, you son of a bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff unsnaps the safety strap on his holster... just a precaution.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right -- everybody just calm down.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jeff)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, you want to tell me what happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our car broke down. This guy stopped to help us, said he'd drive my wife to a pay phone. But she never showed up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to Red)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, officer. I'm driving along, suddenly this fella runs me off the road and starts hollering about his wife. I swear, I never seen the guy before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you didn't give his wife a ride?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's lying!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff takes a long look at both of them, unsure what to think. He turns back to Red.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, all right with you if I search your truck?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell yes, officer. Go right ahead. Name's Red, by the way. Red Barr.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pulls out his wallet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My permits are all current. You can check 'em out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That won't be necessary yet. Just stand back behind the line. Both of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<DIRECTION>
As Red closes his wallet, several credit cards fall to the ground. He bends to scoop them up. Jeff eyes this suspiciously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff climbs up into the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PETERBILT CAB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff pokes his head inside, looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pretty much what you'd expect in a long-haul big rig: a CB radio, a plastic Jesus, a map of the U.S. taped to the ceiling with hundreds of magic marker X's showing where the truck has been.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff looks into the sleeping area behind. A blanket is folded over a foam mattress. A stained pillow rests on top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PETERBILT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff and Red keep a careful eye on each other as the Sheriff climbs down from the cab, wiping his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
<DIRECTION>
(to both of them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, let's see your license and registration.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff and Red fish into their wallets and hand over I.D.'s. The Sheriff examines them, comparing faces to pictures and writing down names.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you hauling today, Mr. Barr?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing, empty load. I'm heading to Fresno for a pick up -- ball bearings or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
<DIRECTION>
(eyeing him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Long way to go empty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me about it. Too much competition nowadays. One horse guys like me gotta drive halfway 'cross the country just to get a payin' job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(to Sheriff, impatient)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are we gonna keep looking or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff hands back the I.D.'s.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, we are.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Red)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I'm gonna have to see everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem. I understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. REAR OF PETERBILT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff and the Sheriff observe as Red unlatches two heavy padlocks. Grunting, he raises the slatted METAL DOOR. It retracts along the ceiling with a noisy RATTLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cavernous interior is mostly empty, except for a few randomly strewn cardboard boxes, too small to contain a person.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
<DIRECTION>
(re: boxes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Personal stuff. Clothes and whatnot. You want to take a look?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff considers it, shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I think we're pretty much done here. You're free to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(reacts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa, whoa -- wait a sec. That's it? You're not going to question him anymore?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I searched the truck. There's no evidence of suspicious activity, no sign of struggle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Red has been looking on. He chimes in, trying to be helpful:
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I don't mean to butt in, but maybe you got my truck confused with someone else's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(lunges)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go to hell, you sonofabitch --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff grabs Jeff, holds him back.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Hey! You want to get arrested? Now the man has a point. This is a plain-looking, John Doe truck. Maybe you did get them mixed up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff stares at the Sheriff a beat, then bolts suddenly for the front of the truck. He yanks open the door and leaps up into the cab.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff jogs after him. Red walks to the cab, unconcerned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PETERBILT CAB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff searches the cab for signs of Amy. He tosses aside a jacket, rifles papers on the floor. There is nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CAB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheriff Boyd looks up sternly as Jeff continues searching the cab. Red watches calmly.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Taylor, either you come down from there or I'm going to have to arrest you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff gives up reluctantly. He looks lame and desperate and he knows it. He steps down from the cab, gritting his teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was him. It was this truck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh, I can see that. Did you get a license plate?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff stares at him, knows where this is going.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the information on the door panel. You recall any of that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't paying attention.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff studies him a beat, nods.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Taylor, did you by any chance have a beef with your wife today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does that have to do with anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, for starters, maybe she left you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've seen it a hundred times. Lovers, married couples, gay guys. You put two people in a car long enough, they'll go at it. Hell, I've even seen men dump their women on the side of the road, and vice versa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff stares at the cop. Emphatic:
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My wife did not leave me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RED>
<DIRECTION>
(cuts in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Officer, I'm sorry, I'd like to stay and help, but I really got to make it to Fresno...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand. Go ahead, sir. I appreciate your cooperation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is insane. You're just going to let him go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got his information. If we need to find him later, we'll know where to look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Much obliged.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jeff)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good luck findin' your wife, mister. No hard feelings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
Red climbs into the cab. Jeff watches helplessly, resigned to the fact there's nothing more he can do. The Sheriff goes to the cruiser and speaks on the radio. As the truck drives off, Jeff goes over to the cruiser.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I believe you that your wife is missing. Maybe you got confused about what truck she got into, maybe you had a fight -- you don't have to tell me. The point is I'm trying to help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<DIRECTION>
He hands Jeff a card with an address printed on it.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The town of Brackett's 31 miles that way. My deputy's name is Len Carver. He's a good man. He'll help you fill out the necessary forms if you want to report your wife missing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff clenches his jaw as the words sink in. The Sheriff softens, his tone sympathetic.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you want my opinion, your wife is probably around here. Lost or plenty pissed off and giving you a scare. Either way, she'll turn up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<DIRECTION>
As Jeff stares at the Sheriff, the police RADIO SQUAWKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DISPATCHER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (filtered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheriff, this is dispatch. Mrs. Gilbert's locked out of her trailer again. Can you respond?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DISPATCHER>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	10-4, dispatch. Tell her I'm on my way.

<DIRECTION>
He racks the mike.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want your name and badge number.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff looks up at Jeff, sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheriff Arthur Boyd. 226-93. This really isn't necessary --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell me what's necessary, goddamnit. I'm noting the exact time of this conversation. 10:52 A.M.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<SHERIFF_BOYD>
<DIRECTION>
(exhaling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suit yourself, Mr. Taylor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_BOYD>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff shifts into gear and drives away. Jeff is left standing on the side of the road, desert in all directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wall is covered with missing persons' notices. Photographs of men, women and children stare back at us. Names and dates are printed across the bottom of the notices.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to reveal Jeff staring at the gallery of faces. It's a creepy feeling. Several yards away, DEPUTY LEN CARVER, a young puffy-faced lawman, sits at a desk filling out a form. Jeff looks shaken.
</DIRECTION>
<DEPUTY_CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this a recent picture?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEPUTY_CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff glances over. Deputy Carver is holding up a wallet- sized photograph of Amy.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two months old.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DEPUTY_CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She still wear her hair like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEPUTY_CARVER>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
The Deputy resumes filling out the form. He clicks his tongue sympathetically.
</DIRECTION>
<DEPUTY_CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll certainly do our best, Mr. Taylor. There's over a hundred thousand people go missing in this country every year. Runaways, deadbeat dads, dropouts, folks hiding from the I.R.S. -- all vanishing without a trace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEPUTY_CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff stares at the faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DEPUTY_CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I'm not saying she's one of them. I sure hope not. But unless there's a ransom demand or evidence of forced abduction, believe me, the F.B.I. won't even look at your case till it's been 24 hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEPUTY_CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
Deputy Carver finishes the paperwork and staples the photograph to the form. He looks up at Jeff.
</DIRECTION>
<DEPUTY_CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nevertheless, we'll sure keep our eyes peeled. How's that sound?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEPUTY_CARVER>

Jeff clenches his jaw.

CUT TO:

From this high vantage point, we see Jeff's car approaching.

<DIRECTION>
The Cherokee pulls up to the side of the building. Jeff gets out and walks inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BELLE'S DINER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff enters, looks around. It's the same scene as before: same Bartender, a slightly different cast of characters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No sign of Amy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff advances to the Bartender, who stands at a sink rinsing beer mugs.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did she come in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
(looks up, uninterested)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't see her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't see her, or she didn't come in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buddy, I told you the last time. I'm busy. Maybe she came in, maybe she didn't. All I know is, I didn't see her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff looks around, not particularly trusting the Bartender's skills of observation. He grinds his jaw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other customers at the bar have been watching all this. One of them, an older grizzled BARFLY, looks up at Jeff.
</DIRECTION>
<BARFLY>
<DIRECTION>
(confidentially)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None of my business, mister. But if I was you I'd take a look in the ladies room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARFLY>
<DIRECTION>
The Barfly gives Jeff a wink and turns back to his beer. Snickers from some of his bar mates, who avert their eyes when Jeff glances at them. Jeff knows this is almost certainly a put-on, but he can't take a chance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While the Barflies watch, poker-faced, Jeff walks to the door of the ladies room, hesitates, then knocks. His knock is answered by a wordless sound, HALF-GROAN, HALF- GASP.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Jeff tries the door. It's locked. He rattles it. Another GROAN. Jeff puts his shoulder against the door, heaves inward. The door swings open, revealing --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flo, bent over the toilet, vomiting. She whirls around, a strand of spittle dangling from her lip.
</DIRECTION>
<FLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey -- what the hell you doing?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLO>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff backs away, yanks the door shut. The barflies chuckle among themselves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff strides angrily for the exit. He stops at the door, takes one last look around. No one seems to be paying him much attention. He turns to leave...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... but something stops him. He can't put his finger on it. There's something wrong here...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at the other customers. Why do they avoid eye contact? Are they hiding something?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He scrutinizes more closely...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is the gruff trucker, sitting at a nearby table shoveling food in his mouth. He's been averting his gaze ever since Jeff walked in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then there's the traveling salesman. Overweight, sweaty. Popping vitamins along with his coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Or what about the shirtless biker, reading a comic book at the bar? Probably an ex-con.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While Jeff is running these suspicions through his mind, a trucker approaches the counter to place an order. The Bartender jots it down on a pad, then tears off the carbon slip. He places one copy above the grill and another in a pile by the cash register.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff stares, an idea forming...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to see your order slips.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You write down the names. I want to see them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>

The Bartender stiffens, stares him straight in the eye:
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You calling me a liar?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
A tense beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Possessed by a sudden impulse, Jeff makes a grab for the receipts. Before he can reach them, the Bartender's hand clamps onto his.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister, I've had just about enough of you.

</BARTENDER>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me see the fucking slips.

</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
In one swift motion, Jeff overpowers the man and extracts the receipts. He starts going through them, fast, looking at names. TULLY, MARK, FLO, ANDY and...
</DIRECTION>

Jeff raises his eyes to face the unpleasant end of a Smith & Wesson revolver.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>

Jeff exits, breathing hard, and runs to the phone booth.

Billy is about to answer. In b.g., the Bartender sticks his head out of the diner. Billy backs away, spooked.

	Oh man. Never shoulda opened my damn mouth. Now I'm gonna git it.

Billy breaks into a loping run through the parking lot. Jeff hurries after him and catches up, cornering Billy between two cars, trying to calm him.

Billy laughs.

Jeff drives flat-out, his face grim. The speedometer reads 100 mph.

Keeping his eye on the road, he thumbs through the pages of a pocket address book. He picks up the handheld cellular phone and dials.
</DIRECTION>

:SC: EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

The highway intersects Route 7. The Cherokee slows just enough to take the corner without tipping over.

It flies past a sign: "Route 7 - North."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ROUTE 7 - DAY

The road ascends into the rocky hills above the desert plain. The route is narrow and windy, forcing Jeff to reduce his speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CHEROKEE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff drives, desperately searching for any sign of a truck. There are no other vehicles on the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He keeps pressing the "REDIAL" button. The "NO SERVICE" INDICATOR BEEPS over and over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The road curves through a tunnel, then climbs higher, past sharp cliffs and drop-offs. Jeff follows the signs for "Route 7."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CHEROKEE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something catches Jeff's eye on the cell phone. For the first time, the "SERVICE" indicator blinks green. Jeff immediately grabs the phone again and presses "REDIAL."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a burst of STATIC, then we hear a SCRATCHY RINGING. The call is going through.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

He waits for an answer.

More STATIC.

Jeff holds the phone tight to his ear.

<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I'm still here. No -- don't call back -- Steve?! Steve?!

</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
The SIGNAL CUTS OFF. Jeff slams the phone against the dash, furious.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddammit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
He punches redial, gets the "NO SERVICE" BEEPING, then glances up, sees a --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHAINLINK FENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
covered with high-visibility markers stretched across the road. The sign: "ROAD CLOSED."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO JEFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He mashes the brakes. The CHEROKEE SKIDS to a halt just short of the fence. Jeff stares at it.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
He grinds his teeth. Beyond the padlocked gate, the highway continues as an unpaved dirt road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He deliberates, then throws the Cherokee in reverse and does a three-point turn so he's facing back in the opposite direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up, sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DODGE RAM PICKUP TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has been hiding in the bushes off the road. It lurches forward and stops in the middle of the road, blocking Jeff's escape. Jeff's eyes widen in fear as he recognizes the vehicle and its driver: Earl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Earl gets out of the cab with a hunting rifle. He raises it to his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>

	<DIALOGUE>

swears, panicking.

<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said get out, dammit! Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff stares into the rifle, deliberating. His hand moves to the gearshift.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He jerks it into reverse and floors the gas!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHEROKEE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
peels out in reverse, snaking wildly side to side, aiming for the chainlink fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It BURSTS the FENCE! Poles and chain mesh go flying!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JEFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
cranks the wheel and brakes hard. The rear end of the Cherokee swings wide to the edge of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He throws the shift into drive and punches the throttle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EARL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
jumps in the Ram and takes off in pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JEFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUNS the ENGINE. The Cherokee bounces wildly on the rutted, storm-damaged road. He yanks the four-wheel- drive lever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DIRT ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The huge pickup streaks after the Cherokee, its 7.5-LITER V10 ROARING, oversized tires devouring the terrain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JEFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUNS the ENGINE on the washboard road surface, the vibration nearly shaking the suspension apart while --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
keeps pace in the dust from its wake. Inside the cab, Earl can be seen speaking on a CB transmitter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JEFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
throws the Cherokee into a sharp turn in the road. As the car rounds the bend, he looks up, reacting, as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IDLED BULLDOZER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
blocks the road at a construction site. More unattended earthmoving equipment fills the road beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JEFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
brakes wildly. To his right, a cliff goes straight up; on the left, a guardrail protects a steep ravine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He cuts the wheel left, CRASHES through the GUARDRAIL and plunges into the ravine!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHEROKEE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
bounces wildly as it hurtles down the slope, CRASHING through sagebrush and manzanita.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JEFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
clings to the wheel, tossed about violently, as suitcases and packing boxes go everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cherokee hits a bump on the steep slope and CRASHES through the upper branches of a willow grove.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the leaves part, we see... a river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHEROKEE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lands on the passenger side with a SPLASH and comes to rest half-submerged in the RUSHING WATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EARL

<DIRECTION>
jerks the Ram to a halt, leaps out and runs to the edge of the road to look down on the Cherokee in the river.
</DIRECTION>

He grabs the rifle and begins making his way down the slope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE CHEROKEE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The world is sideways. Water rushes into the car. Jeff is strapped into the driver's seat by the seatbelt. The AIRBAG DEFLATES with a HISS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff grimaces in pain. He looks around, blinking. The river is flowing right through the Cherokee!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luggage, styrofoam hamburger clamshells and empty Coke cans bob on the surface of the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff fumbles with the seatbelt release. The belt comes free and he drops suddenly into the water on the passenger side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets to his feet, reaches overhead to unlatch the driver's side door and pushes it open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hoists himself through the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RIVERBANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Earl sees Jeff emerging from the half-submerged Cherokee, levels the RIFLE and FIRES!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JEFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ducks back inside the Cherokee, freaking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The passenger side is on the river-bottom and if he tries to get out through the driver's side, he's a sitting duck!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff swears and looks around, seeing a metal camera case underwater in the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs the case and swings it at the windshield. The first three blows bounce off harmlessly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the WINDSHIELD SHATTERS with a CRASH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a deep breath, submerges and swims underwater through the broken windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Earl stiffens as he sees movement in the water. Several items of debris from the car are floating on the current.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck!

</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
He begins moving downstream along the bank, eyeing the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff breaststrokes for all he's worth. Sand swirls in the swift current. He pushes away from a boulder in his path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He swims until his lungs are bursting, then surfaces for air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Earl sees Jeff break the surface. He aims the RIFLE and FIRES! A BULLET SMACKS the WATER near Jeff's head.

Then Jeff is under again.

Jeff struggles to stay in control. The current is turning swifter. His shoulder glances painfully off a boulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Earl works his way through the brush at the river's edge. His foot lands between two rocks. He pulls it out, swearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND ROCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff surfaces and gulps in air, staying out of sight of Earl on the bank. Then he is down again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Earl works his way along the shore. Up ahead, the river runs over rapids before passing around a bend.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Earl hears an ENGINE and turns. A huge moving van has arrived on the dirt road overlooking the ravine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shouts to the DRIVER, pointing downriver.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's getting away!

<DIRECTION>
The Driver shouts something inaudible. Earl runs along the bank, ducking under low-hanging branches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN RAPIDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff is carried over the rocks by the fast-moving current. He slams into a boulder, letting out a cry and swallowing a mouthful of water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A downed tree hangs over the river. Jeff grabs desperately and takes hold of a branch. He's got it!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hanging on to the branch, he notices a familiar object floating past in the water: the "90,000 Donuts" pack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff tries to haul himself from the river. The BRANCH bends under his weight. Then it comes free with a CRACK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff is carried downstream on the rushing water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BANK
</DIRECTION>

Earl works his way along the shore. The unseen Driver of the van shouts to him from upriver.

<DIRECTION>
The river has turned slow again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff fights to his feet in the shallows and staggers to the bank. He drops to his knees, retching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clutching his ribs, he raises his head and looks upriver. For the moment, there is no sign of Earl. But he could appear anytime.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff gets to his feet, wincing. He looks up at the rocky canyon wall bordering the river. It's steep but scalable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He begins climbing.

DISSOLVE TO:

JEFF'S POV - RIVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men have given up their pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The moving van, a jumbo three-axle GMC, has turned around and backed up to the edge of the ravine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stocky man, AL (whom we recognize as Earl's passenger at the minimart), operates a gas-powered winch in the cargo door of the van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cable runs from the winch down to the Cherokee in the river.
</DIRECTION>

Standing knee-deep in the current, Earl signals to Al while the winch slowly tugs the Cherokee onto its wheels, then backwards out of the river.

Jeff can't believe it. The Cherokee is being pulled backwards up the slope toward the road.

The Cherokee is now back on the road.
</DIRECTION>

Operating the winch with precision efficiency, Earl and Al drag the Cherokee up a ramp into the rear of the moving van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once the vehicle is aboard, they stow the ramp and close the van doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO JEFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watching in amazement, straining to hear what Earl and Al are saying. Behind Jeff, a PEBBLE SKITTERS on the rock.

He turns, reacts.

<DIRECTION>
It's Billy -- the halfwit from the diner! Wielding a shotgun like a club, he swings the butt at Jeff's skull!

Jeff looks at him with loathing.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, I've got something you might want to buy. Can't show you the merchandise right now, but I can describe it for you. About five- five, hundred and fifteen pounds. I'd say three, maybe four of that is tits. Black curly hair upstairs and down. Interested?

He advances toward Red. Billy and Earl grab him from behind and tackle him to the ground. Billy drives a fist into his kidney. Jeff gasps in pain.

<DIRECTION>
Red nods impassively.

<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>

Earl and Billy hoist Jeff to his feet and propel him up the mound closer to Red.

From here, Jeff can see a small desert town spread out below, as well as the highway leading through it. Red gestures.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>

	Welcome to Brackett, Jeff. If ever there was a two-bit shithole in the middle of nowhere, this is it. One gas station, a half-dozen stores and a V.F.W. hall.

Jeff nods tightly.

<RED>

</RED>

Jeff nods.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ask for the money in cash. Small bills. Today's payday at the copper mine, so don't take any horsecock about how they haven't got it. If the manager gives you a hard time, that's your problem. It's your wife who's counting on you.

Jeff stares back.

<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Problem is, you can see this town for miles around. So ask yourself: How's the law gonna get here? They gonna fly in? Drive in? Either way, we'll see 'em. So let me be very clear: if we see one unmarked car, one plane, one human being who even smells like a cop -- this deal is dead.

The IMAGE SHIFTS, then STEADIES and FOCUSES ON a small building with a police cruiser out front and a barely legible sign: "BRACKETT SHERIFF." It's the police station where Jeff filed the missing persons' form earlier.

Deputy Carver comes out of the building gulping down a sandwich. He gets in the cruiser and pulls away, lights flashing.

He smiles at Jeff.

	See, that's why there's no risk to us in this thing. You do the legwork. We sit back, we watch, we listen to our scanners, we monitor you every step of the way. If at any moment we don't like something, we split. Period.

Jeff stumbles and nearly falls as he descends the loose rock at the foot of the mesa. He looks up at the ridge, but Red and his crew have pulled back out of view. Jeff starts across an open field toward the town, first jogging, then running.
</DIRECTION>

:SC: EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff hurries toward the bank. He looks back at the mesa again. The gang has disappeared.

Up ahead, a mud-streaked pickup cruises the main street. Jeff eyes it warily. Is it one of theirs? The truck pulls around a corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BANK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff pushes through the main doors. It's a typical small town operation. A guard stands near the entrance. Several customers wait in line for the woman teller.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff looks at the slow-moving line and swears softly. He doesn't have time to wait. He glances around, sees an older man sitting at a desk in the rear of the bank, the nameplate on the desk identifying him as Roger Calhoun. Jeff approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to see the manager. I need a wire transfer from my bank in Boston.

CALHOUN looks up from his paperwork, hesitates at Jeff's appearance.

<CALHOUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... sir. I'm the manager. Would you like to have a seat?

He takes a seat across the desk from the manager, reaches into his wallet and brings out several forms of identification.

	Here's my driver's license, credit card if you need it, my account number in Boston... How long is this going to take?

	My credit card. I've got a $6,000 limit. Can you advance me the whole $6,000?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Calhoun looks mystified.
</DIRECTION>
<CALHOUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I can't. For non-customers the limit is $500 a day. Sir, are you sure you're all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALHOUN>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I'm fine. Just... transfer the money, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Calhoun raises an eyebrow and begins filling out the transfer form. Jeff eyes him, decides he has to risk it. He leans toward the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>

	Look, I'm going to tell you something. Whatever happens, just keep filling out that form, okay?

Jeff enters and locks the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He startles at his reflection in the mirror. He is sunburned, dirty, lacerated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens a cabinet and rifles through the supplies, looking for anything that could be used as a weapon. He tosses aside detergents and air fresheners.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up the toilet plunger, pulls the wooden rod from the rubber base. He swings it into his palm a few times, testing it as a club. It's too bulky. He won't be able to conceal it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He checks his watch. Time is running out. He takes one last look around the bathroom, then exits.

:SC: INT. BANK - DAY

Jeff comes out of the rest room. The manager is behind the teller's counter. The cowboy is gone. In his place sits a middle-aged blue collar worker. He looks at Jeff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff takes a seat, glances at Calhoun's empty desk. There is a letter opener on the desk, several paper bands for wrapping currency.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Positioning his body so no one can see, Jeff takes the letter opener and slips it into his sleeve. He scoops up a handful of currency wrappers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff goes to the teller's window, scribbles something on the back of a deposit slip and hands it to the teller.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>

Jeff comes out of the bank with a manila envelope, glancing up and down the street. There's no sign of the men. He squints toward the mesa. No sign of them there either.

<DIRECTION>
He stands there. What's he supposed to do now? He checks his watch, growing anxious. Finally he is about to jog back in the direction he came, when... a PHONE RINGS.

Jeff turns. There's a pay PHONE down the street. It RINGS again. He approaches quickly, lifts the receiver.

Jeff continues walking, anxiously checking over his shoulder every few moments. His eyes narrow.

Jeff hesitates, then tosses the envelope on the seat. Earl opens it, reaches in and pulls out several packets of currency. They are wrapped with paper bands and appear to be stacks of fifties and hundreds. He replaces them and gestures at Jeff with the gun.

He manipulates the letter opener into position and begins cutting the duct tape that binds his wrists.

Steering with one hand, Earl reaches into the envelope, pulls out a packet of bills and waves it in Jeff's face. Jeff saws faster at the duct tape.

He seizes the roll of duct tape and binds Earl's wrists, then passes the tape under his legs so Earl is effectively hog-tied.

Earl struggles for breath. The duct tape is still tight around his neck. He strains against the tape binding his limbs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances in the side view mirror to see the Sheriff ordering Jeff down on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By wriggling and contorting his wrists, Earl is able to tear one hand free. Then he pulls away the rest of the duct tape from his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tape is still wrapped tightly around his neck, pinning him to the backrest. Earl claws at the tape, but it won't come free. Finally, with both hands, he reaches behind his head and yanks the read rest from the seat.

He reaches into his boot for something...

Earl sets one foot on the road. The headrest dangles against his back, still taped to his neck. Suddenly Earl whirls, holding a .22 snub-nose REVOLVER and FIRES!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sheriff stumbles away, blood spurting from his shoulder, the gun flying from his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff looks up in horror as the sheriff falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Earl comes around the pickup after Jeff, raising the gun to fire. Jeff scrambles to his feet and dives down the embankment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Earl runs to the edge of the embankment. Down below, Jeff is reaching for the automatic pistol the sheriff ordered him to drop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finds it... too late...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Earl is aiming at point-blank range from the top of the embankment. He is already squeezing the trigger when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM! Earl's chest erupts outward as a bullet passes through his body from behind!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Earl staggers and flops down the embankment. He comes to rest near Jeff, blood gurgling from a massive chest wound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff climbs the embankment. The sheriff is lying on the road, critically injured, gun lying nearby and still smoking from the shot that killed Earl.

Jeff bends over the Sheriff and examines his wound with a grimace. He is verging on unconsciousness. Jeff deliberates, torn. There is nothing he can do here.

Making up his mind, Jeff runs to the pickup. The hand- held cellular phone has spilled into the road. He scoops it up, jumps behind the wheel and LAYS RUBBER.

Jeff stands on a ridge overlooking a Texaco truck stop. Behind him, the Dodge Ram pickup lies hidden in a growth of scrub oak and tumbleweeds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff looks overwhelmed by what he sees spread out below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JEFF'S POV - TEXACO TRUCK STOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a giant truck stop. There are hundreds of big rigs parked in rows like silvery sardines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sign towers over the main building: "DIESEL $.99 GAL."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO JEFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks shaken. How will he ever find Red here? It seems impossible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He descends the bluff to the truck stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. TRUCK STOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff skids on his heels down the loose hillside and reaches the edge of the parking lot. There are trucks everywhere. Diesel MOTORS RUMBLE. Exhaust fills the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches the end of a row of big rigs, starts searching the grounds for the markings of Red's 18-wheeler.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's nowhere in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A high-pitched FEMININE SQUEAL from an adjacent truck's sleeping compartment startles Jeff.

A police car is arriving at the truck stop.

Staying out of sight, Jeff passes quickly to the rear of a tractor trailer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. TRUCK WASH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff peers out from behind a parked mini-van as trucks emerge wet and dripping from an immense truck wash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the way, trucks are filling up on diesel at the gas islands. Jeff's eyes narrow. Is that Red's Peterbilt among them?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He quickens his pace, then falls back, slumping. The rig's black driver is getting in the cab. Jeff glances to the side, frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An older vacationing couple is eyeing Jeff warily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff looks down, cops to it instantly. His clothes are ripped, caked with blood. He ducks between two parked cars, using a side-view mirror as he hastily wipes blood off his face. He checks to be sure no one is watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something catches his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BLUFF - JEFF'S POV

A highway patrol car with flashing lights is parked near the place where Jeff ditched the pickup. Beside it, a state trooper surveys the truck stop with binoculars.

Jeff's jaw tightens. He glances toward the road, sees two more highway patrol cars cruising the perimeter of the truck stop.
</DIRECTION>

Swearing, Jeff turns on his heels and walks away in the opposite direction, shielding his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. TRUCK STOP PARKING LOT - DAY

Jeff emerges from between two vehicles, glancing over his shoulder nervously. He keeps his head down, moving fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He scans the truck stop in all directions. The patrol car is still parked on the ridge, the patrolman peering through binoculars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff quickens his pace alongside the truck stop building, passing a row of pay phones. He looks up, stops dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Red is talking on a pay phone six feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff stares. Red is facing away, unaware of his presence. Jeff darts into an adjacent pay phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shields his face with the receiver and listens.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>

	Look, I'm getting out of here. Stay off the airwaves. Bring the girl and meet me at the barn... You got that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up. Jeff presses the phone against his face and turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he looks up, Red is walking toward his Peterbilt truck, parked in a row of big rigs. Jeff starts to follow, then freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several cops are fanning out on foot, questioning everyone they encounter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff sees Red getting into his truck. The ENGINE KICKS OVER. The BRAKES HISS and the truck begins pulling out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff whips around. The older vacationing couple are talking to a cop fifty yards away. The husband points toward the pay phones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff makes a sudden decision, doubles back behind a rolling farm truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
thanks the couple, calls out something to his fellow officers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JEFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
runs alongside the farm truck, using it as a shield. He overtakes the truck, cuts across its path. The farmer BLARES his HORN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff glances left. Red's tractor trailer is traveling across the crowded parking area, slowly gaining speed. Jeff sprints in front of a moving car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver jerks to a halt and HONKS, catching the attention of a nearby cop. Jeff quickly turns away, avoiding being seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Red's 18-wheeler turns toward the access road. Jeff looks around, panicked. More cops are spreading out on foot. They'll notice him any second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff crouches low and scurries underneath a slow-moving postal truck. The truck speeds up, nearly crushing him under the rear wheel assembly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff rolls out of the path of the giant wheels, gets to his feet on the other side and finds himself...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... in the path of another huge truck!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cop is standing only 20 feet away! Jeff goes underneath another trailer, crawling between the moving wheels. He springs to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Red's Peterbilt is pulling away!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff runs for all he's worth. His arms and legs pump furiously. He runs abreast of the truck...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and seizes the spare tire mount!

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. INTERSTATE - UNDER TRUCK - DAY

Jeff hangs on for dear life. His legs drag over the asphalt. He lets out a cry of pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck is joining the highway, accelerating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grimacing, Jeff swings his legs over the universal joint as the roadway races past below. The huge TIRES are a HOWLING blur.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly his grip falters on the grease. His back scrapes the rushing asphalt. Jeff gasps, makes a grab and holds firm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he hangs on, a station wagon overtakes the Peterbilt in the passing lane. A three-year-old boy sits in the rear compartment, staring out at Jeff, a puzzled expression on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff stares back. It's an odd moment between the two. The station wagon continues forward and EXITS FRAME.

The tires kick up a hail storm of loose gravel and dirt, pelting Jeff all over his body.

He realizes he can't stay where he is. Grunting with effort, he works his way hand over hand along the underside rigging toward the cab.
</DIRECTION>

He seizes the trailer hitch and hoists himself up.

Standing on the coupler, Jeff clutches his ribs and catches his breath. He's in pain. The road whips by below his feet.

The truck hits an uneven stretch of road and bounces violently. Jeff grabs the coiled brake line for support.
</DIRECTION>

The truck is doing 70 mph, exhaust racketing.

Several dozen "COMMERCIAL VEHICLE" license plates are scattered about -- Arkansas, Oregon, Texas, Iowa, South Dakota...

As Jeff stares, reeling, there is a RUMBLE outside.

:SC: EXT. BARN - NIGHT

Red looks up from toting a box of car stereos and snarled wiring as the moving van and Pontiac Firebird arrive at the barn.

He beckons for the vehicles to pull forward into...

Red grunts, unlatches the door to the moving van, lowers a ramp. The three men begin unloading boxes.

Jeff lies on his belly peering through a knothole.

JEFF'S POV THROUGH KNOTHOLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men unload Jeff and Amy's belongings -- luggage, photography equipment, miscellaneous items. Inside the moving van, the battered Jeep Cherokee is visible, partially covered with a tarp.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you we shoulda gotten rid of 'em like that couple up in Utah. Nice and clean.

	So it got a little fucked up -- so what? We stay out of the area for a while, things will cool off.

There is a HAMMERING noise, O.S. Red looks over, irritated.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit, Al, what the hell you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
Al sits at a workbench hammering precious stones out of Amy's jewelry. He looks over at Red.
</DIRECTION>
<AL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Figured I'd get started on the jewelry.

Jeff breathes in sharply, presses his eye against the knothole.

:SC: INT. BARN GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Red unlatches a hidden compartment under the chassis of the moving truck. He and Billy slide out a long metal box, similar to a drawer in a morgue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They lift the metal lid, revealing --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CANVAS SACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sack is stained and ripped. Red pokes at it. The sack doesn't move. Red shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>

	Must've died from the exhaust.

Billy and Al reach into the compartment, start to lift out the sack.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get some plastic. We'll bury her before it gets light out.

Suddenly the sack drives its legs into Al's belly.
</DIRECTION>
<AL>
<DIRECTION>
(startled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aagh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AL>
<DIRECTION>
Al falls backward, drops the sack on the floor. It tears open revealing Amy -- gagged with duct tape, her wrists and ankles taped. She squirms and kicks wildly, her screams muffled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BARN HAYLOFT KNOTHOLE - NIGHT

We see Jeff's eye in the knothole. It's all we need to see to gauge the effect on him of seeing Amy alive.

</RED>
<DIRECTION>
Red walks to a corner, moves aside a section of false flooring. He pulls up a hidden trap door, revealing a root cellar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
squirms on the hay-strewn floor. Her clothes are ripped, face bruised. She looks up, reacting: Jeff's eye is visible in the knothole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their gaze meets... and holds...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
returns and takes Amy by the legs. Al and Billy lift her by the arms. As they carry her to the root cellar, Red peers into her terrified face.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, honey. It's not as bad as it sounds. It'll take you about 10 minutes to suck the air out. Probably won't even feel it.

Amy reacts, writhing even more violently, but she's no match for the three men.

Jeff watches helplessly as...

<DIRECTION>
The men disappear with Amy into the cellar. We hear a METALLIC THUD, then a few moments later, the men reappear without her. Red closes the trap door, secures it with a heavy padlock, then slides the panel of false flooring over it.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
They turn, walk toward the door. Red opens it. Arleen is standing there. Al and Billy greet her politely:

The barn goes dark as the men leave. The barn door rolls shut. A LOCK CLICKS.

Jeff quickly climbs down a ladder in the pitch darkness. He crosses the room, bumping into a workbench. He swears, makes his way toward the...

Jeff drops to his hands and knees, feeling for the padlocked trap door. He finds it, speaks in an urgent whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amy? Amy, can you hear me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
No reply. Jeff cups his hands, presses his mouth to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(louder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Still no reply.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff swears, glances around the dark room. There is a tool bench across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang on, baby. They're in the house; I can't use the lights. I'm gonna get you out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to the tool bench, fumbling in the darkness. He knocks over a cardboard box -- a pile of car keys spill across the table. His hands run over an assortment of tools. He locates a hammer, takes it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Returning to the trap door, Jeff inserts the claw in the padlock and tries to pry it open. The lock won't give.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He strains, using all his strength. Suddenly the handle snaps! Jeff flies backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up, goes to the tool bench. His hands feel over and reject an assortment of small tools. He finds a crowbar, returns to the trap door and inserts it into the shackle, twisting with all his might. After several failed attempts, he swears.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not working. If I make any more noise, they'll hear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff mulls his options. He sets his jaw, exhales.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to get you out of there, Amy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
He swallows, emotional, clearly torn.

<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you.

:SC: INT. BARN - MOVING VAN CAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff opens the door. A weak dome light flickers on. He climbs up into the cab and tries turning on the CB radio, but no luck -- the keys are gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the glove compartment. There are maps, trip logs, truck stop receipts. He rifles through them quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff frowns, gets on the floor of the cab and gropes under the driver's seat. His eyes register a discovery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He brings out a big black semi-automatic pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff studies the base of the grip, clearly unfamiliar with guns. He fumbles with the clip, ejects it. The clip is full of bullets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He snaps the clip back in place.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>

Jeff climbs out of the window onto the broad overhanging eave. He steps to the edge of the roof and lowers himself onto the Peterbilt cab, then drops to the ground.

He looks around. Red's is the only house visible. A light flickers in the trees a mile away. It could be anything.

Jeff moves toward the house.

Jeff lets the door close silently. There are VOICES coming from a distant room. He passes a washing machine, a hamper full of dirty clothes, and moves silently down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
toward the voices. VIDEO GAME sound effects emanate from a room off the hall. Jeff flattens against the wall, peers into the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seated on the floor with his back to Jeff, Deke is playing Nintendo on a wide-screen television. Various items are scattered about: stereo speakers, a jukebox, a brand new Nordic Track. There is a rifle rack across the room.

Stepping past the doorway, Jeff continues down the hall toward...

Red is in the middle of telling a story. Arleen, Billy and Al sit around the table.

The plates are cleared away. They are drinking beer.

<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>

Red notices his audience is no longer paying attention. He turns in his chair, sees --

Standing in the doorway. Aiming the pistol. His clothes caked with blood and dirt. He sways slightly.

	Stick 'em up.

Jeff turns. Nine-year-old Deke is aiming a rifle at Jeff from the hallway. The rifle looks enormous in his hands. The boy's lip quivers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is silent. No one moves. Jeff keeps the pistol aimed at Red. He swallows, speaks slowly:

	He's lying, Deke. He can't get me. Just pull the trigger.

</JEFF>
<RED>

	Plug him, boy! Do what I tell you!

Deke looks at his father, fights back tears. His finger tightens on the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, boy. Do it. Don't worry about me.

Deke whimpers, squeezes the trigger...

Suddenly, Billy bolts from the table. The RIFLE FIRES! The recoil knocks Deke off his feet. The bullet rips into Al's shoulder!

	Oww -- goddammit, you little shit!

Red is out of his chair. Jeff dives first and seizes the rifle. He whirls, aims the pistol at Red.

	Don't fucking move!

Everyone freezes.

Jeff sidesteps to the window. Billy is running across the yard. Is he headed for the barn? Jeff swears, turns back.

	Deke? Deke? Get on your feet!

Deke rises, tears streaming down his face.

<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, kid. Go over there, stand next to your mother. Hurry up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Deke obeys. Clutching his shoulder wound, Al glares at the child as he passes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff deliberates. Where the hell was Billy going? He gnaws his lip, decides.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay... on your feet. Now, everybody!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Red, Arleen and Al get to their feet. Deke stays at his mother's side. Jeff aims the pistol at Red, holds the rifle with his other hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>

He herds them to the door. Arleen looks to Red nervously.

He glances right and left, wired. The rifle is strapped to his back. He keeps the handgun ready. He peers under the tractor-trailer, looking for any sign of Billy.
</DIRECTION>

They reach the trap door. Jeff circles it, constantly keeping an eye on Red and Al. He hands the keys to Deke.

<JEFF>

Deke looks at his father. He kneels, unlocks the padlock and heaves open the trap door, revealing a narrow staircase slanting into the cellar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deke looks down into the darkness and swallows.

<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, Deke. There's a freezer down there with a woman in it. I need you to let her out.

While Amy embraces him, Jeff keeps the gun on Red and the others. He gestures toward the cellar.

	Remember this moment, pretty boy. 'Cause whatever happens, no matter how far you run, I will hunt you down and kill you like a dog.

Jeff stares back. A beat, then:
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go to hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
He boots Red in the chest, sending him backward down the steps. He slams the trap door shut and locks the padlock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around, sees a massive tool chest. He tips it onto the trap door -- crash!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he takes Amy's hand, still keeping an eye out for Billy.

It's too much to explain. Jeff grabs her arm. As they take off running toward the light flickering in the distance.

<DIRECTION>
The morning sky is lighter now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rickety trailer surrounded by a chicken coop, junked appliances and a clothesline. There's an old utility pickup truck parked in front. Jeff and Amy arrive out of breath. Jeff pounds on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Hello? Anybody home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
There's no answer. Jeff puts his shoulder to the door and rams it open. The flimsy door gives way easily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. TRAILER - DAWN

<DIRECTION>
Jeff enters. The place is ramshackle -- torn vinyl furniture, empty beer bottles scattered about. A tattered flag hangs on the wall. There's no one around.

<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Anyone home?

<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, c'mon...

While he waits for an answer, Amy leans the rifle against the wall. She notices a set of car keys hanging by the door.

Suddenly, the ROAR is DEAFENING --

The rickety structure spins 360 degrees!
</DIRECTION>

Jeff goes flying. A TELEVISION somersaults across the room and EXPLODES. Amy slams into a wall.

The speeding Peterbilt shears away a section of the trailer home with a horrible RIPPING sound!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trailer home is suddenly open to the sky.

They stagger through the gaping hole in the trailer.

Jeff keys the ignition. The ENGINE SPUTTERS. Amy whips around to see the Peterbilt bearing down from the side.

The Ford shoots out of the Peterbilt's path!

The FORD PEELS OUT of the driveway and joins the road, spewing exhaust. It's an old vehicle that doesn't maneuver well.

Jeff mashes the gas pedal. The ENGINE STRAINS, BACKFIRING. Amy looks back, sees the Peterbilt joining the road.

A SHOTGUN BLAST SHATTERS the passenger WINDOW! Amy screams as glass showers the cab. Jeff swerves wildly.

</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
He swivels his head right, sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIREBIRD

kicking up a cloud of dust as it pulls alongside the Ford on the right-hand shoulder.

The driver, Billy, is levelling a shotgun through the window.

The Ford is sandwiched between the Cadillac and Firebird as they race down the highway with the Peterbilt in the rear.

Amy raises the rifle, thrusts the barrel awkwardly out the window and aims at Billy. She FIRES wildly -- BANG!

The BLAST hits the Ford's side-mounted toolbox. The door flies open. Tools scatter on the road!

veers away, swearing, as hammers and chisels and power tools hit the asphalt and bounce up into his path.

Billy swears and jerks the wheel, steering away. He glances up suddenly, sees Jeff aiming the pistol.

Billy slams backward against the headrest, hit in the face. There's blood everywhere. The car careens toward the shoulder.

Red swears and lets the truck fall back, swearing. Up ahead is a long, curving downgrade. He taps the brakes. There is a jolt as the trailer bumps the tractor.

They are flying into a hairy curve.

IN PETERBILT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Red struggles to stay in control. Every time he applies the brakes, the unchecked trailer jars the cab forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Peterbilt races into the curve.
</DIRECTION>

Red has no choice. He has to pump the brakes and risk jackknifing or the truck will fly off the road altogether.
</DIRECTION>

He hits the brakes!

Then, unexpectedly, the trailer disconnects from the cab!

IN CADILLAC

Flanking the Peterbilt, Al glances to the side and sees the trailer come untethered from the cab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the trailer is an unguided missile, weaving drunkenly back and forth across the blacktop.

<DIRECTION>
Al tries to swerve away. The trailer streaks toward him. Al SLAMS on the BRAKES, screaming!

The trailer piles into the Cadillac. There is a huge IMPACT as trailer and Cadillac are reduced to scrap metal!

And just as this is happening...

PETERBILT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
blasts into the rear of the Ford, jarring it forward with a CRUNCH of METAL and taillights!

The two vehicles are now locked together, gaining speed as they hurtle down the grade.

Red hits the brakes, but it's no use. The bumpers are meshed. The two vehicles plunge downhill, skidding sideways.

Up ahead, a concrete bridge spans a deep gorge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

The Peterbilt and Ford fly onto the bridge. The big truck glances off a railing. The vehicles suddenly come unlocked.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
The PETERBILT creams it from behind and caroms away, SKIDDING the length of the bridge before SMACKING the opposite railing!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE ROAD
</DIRECTION>

Jeff grimaces. In front of them, the concrete railing has broken away. Debris falls 300 feet to the bottom of the gorge. The Ford's right front tire hangs in the air.

Jeff looks at Amy. She looks wildly adrenalated, eyes wide.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You all right?

Amy looks back at him. She expels a long breath and nods.

Jeff forces his upper body through the driver's window and looks over the Ford's roof at the Peterbilt.
</DIRECTION>

JEFF'S POV - PETERBILT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's facing them, 50 yards away on the bridge. The engine is dead. STEAM HISSES from the crumpled radiator. One tire is shredded.

<DIRECTION>
There is blood on the broken windshield.

sitting in the driver's window. He squints toward the truck, searching for any sign of Red. There is none.

Behind Jeff on the bridge, a MOTOR KICKS OVER. He whirls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JEFF'S POV - PETERBILT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXHAUST BELCHES from the smokestacks. Red is behind the wheel. His face is covered with blood. He stares hatefully.
</DIRECTION>

With a RASP of GEARS, the Peterbilt lurches forward.

He pushes against the dashboard with life-or-death urgency.

Suddenly the passenger side door flies open and Jeff surges into the cab, landing on Red, clawing at his eyes!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They grapple in the cab. Red swings an elbow into Jeff's face -- crack. Jeff drives a fist to his jaw!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The steering wheel drifts counter-clockwise as the truck inches forward, ramming the Ford closer to the precipice.

Red gets his hands around Jeff's neck as the steering wheel continues to move counter-clockwise...

<DIRECTION>
IN PETERBILT

Jeff slams into the windshield. Red lands on top of him. Loose objects from the cab rain against the windshield.

They grapple. Red grabs Jeff's arm and twists sharply, forcing it at an impossible angle. Their faces are inches apart.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>

Jeff drops through the windshield opening. He clings to the center support column. His legs dangle over the hood.

Red slips through the opening, his hand locking on the steering wheel at the last instant.

The windshield sails away into the gorge.

Behind him, Red is working his way higher in the same manner. He grabs Jeff's foot, trying to pull him off the cab.

Jeff kicks free and climbs past the sleeping compartment. Red grabs the door handle. Jeff boots the door release button.

Jeff hauls himself onto the bridge with a final gasp of exertion. He runs to the passenger side of the Ford.

seems to fall forever... before landing with a huge EXPLOSION!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff and Amy fall backward on the road. Down below, secondary EXPLOSIONS rock the canyon. Jeff takes Amy in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't let me go, Jeff...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't, baby... I won't ever let you go...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
He looks into her eyes. Their lips meet in a kiss and we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. RED'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Police cars and official vehicles are parked outside the house. RADIOS CHATTER. Yellow crime tape holds back onlookers and news reporters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cops and evidence technicians work the scene. A criminalist photographs stolen property as it's carried out of the barn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A plainclothes FBI AGENT closes a cellphone and walks over to where Jeff and Amy are sitting at a picnic table. They are battered and bandaged.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's the sheriff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<FBI_AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out of surgery. It looks like he's gonna make it. As for the wife and kid, she's not talking, he's being turned over to Protective Services.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FBI_AGENT>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff nods soberly.
</DIRECTION>
<FBI_AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got I.D. on the dead suspects. Turns out they were all licensed truckers. One of 'em had a rap for check kiting. Otherwise they could've been model citizens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FBI_AGENT>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the leader?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<FBI_AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Same thing. His real name's Warren Claney. Three speeding tickets in five years -- apart from that, he's clean as a whistle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FBI_AGENT>
<DIRECTION>
Amy watches as cops stack windshields outside the barn.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(dazed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could they do it? How could they treat it like a... business?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<FBI_AGENT>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I've been doing this 15 years, I've never seen anything like it. It was simple, efficient and organized. They stayed on the move, spread it over a dozen states. As long as no witnesses survived, it's an untraceable crime.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were just a couple of the lucky ones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FBI_AGENT>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead, a television news helicopter is landing on the road. A cameraman, reporter and producer hurry over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff watches the news crew, a bemused expression. It seems like a million years ago...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FBI Agent shakes his head, disdainful.
</DIRECTION>
<FBI>
<DIRECTION>
(re: media)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon -- let's get you folks out of here before things really get hairy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FBI>
<DIRECTION>
He escorts them to a waiting sedan. As they climb in, Jeff looks back over his shoulder, surveying the scene one last time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets in and the car pulls away just as the frenzied news crew arrives, mikes and cameras at the ready, running alongside the departing sedan, shouting questions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the rear window, we see Jeff putting his arm around Amy, pulling her close as we hear:
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Promise me one thing...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Name it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next time... we fly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. HOUSE - AERIAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over this last line, the sedan drives away, and we CLIMB HIGHER and HIGHER AWAY FROM the bristling crime scene until the ranch house is just one in a town of modest houses and the pink desert floor spreads out endlessly in every direction. FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_END>
