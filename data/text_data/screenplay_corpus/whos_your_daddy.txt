Ted's Dad sits on the edge of his bed.

<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The lesson being?

</TED>
<DAD>

Ted and Charlie enter the terminal. Friends and family wait for loved ones. A few chauffeurs hold signs with names. One stands out. Tall. Blonde. Gorgeous. In a short skirt. A matching low cut jacket. And a cap. She's stunning. And she's holding a sign that reads: TED NELSON.

POP! The cork flies through the air. Bounces off the ceiling. And hits another switch. The sun roof glides open. Champagne overflows from the bottle. All over Charlie's crotch.

<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice. Is that in the limo etiquette handbook, too?
	</DIALOGUE>

EXT. LIMO - DAY - MOVING

Ted's head peeks out of the sun roof. Tentatively. Unsure. He takes in the sights as the limo cruises Sunset Boulevard. People stare at him. A beautiful BLONDE smiles and waves. He waves back, very timidly.

<DIRECTION>
Charlie sticks his head out, too. Sun on their faces. Wind in their hair.

</HEATHER>
<TOM>

	If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?

</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Ted looks guilty. This is too weird.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>

	We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.

INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - GAME ROOM - DAY

The epitome of every boy's dream arcade. Everything from classic pinball machines to the most high tech virtual reality game that has yet to hit the market. Charlie shakes his head in amazement.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A devastatingly PERFECT WOMAN, GINGER, "Miss April," emerges from the pool, wearing nothing but a g-string. Her skin shimmers from the reflection of the pool lights. Rivulets of water stream down her body. She reaches for a towel and pats her body dry. An incredible aura seems to surround her. Separating her from the other spectacular beauties we've seen already.

Ted lowers the binoculars. Entranced.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM CLOSET - "HEAVEN" MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Ted looks at the impressive collection of suits. Runs his hands along the fabrics. Picks a particularly stylish jacket and tries it on. It fits poorly. Too big in the chest and shoulders. Ted looks at himself in the full-length mirror. He's not half the man his father was.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there's a KNOCK on the door. Ted quickly takes off his father's jacket and puts on his own. He lets Uncle Billy in. LOUD PARTY SOUNDS momentarily pour into the room.

LONG DRAMATIC STAIRCASE

DANCE FLOOR - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie thinks he's Travolta. Dressed for disco. Twirling a Super Model. Ted dances among a dozen BEAUTIES. They steal kisses and hugs, here and there. A thousand Cinderellas, all after one Prince Charming. Ted's having the time of his life. Charlie dances up to him. Shouting in his ear...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ain't life amazing? A week ago, you couldn't get to second base! Now you OWN second base!

They high-five one another. An EXOTIC BEAUTY grabs Ted and starts dirty dancing. Rubbing herself against him. Ted's clueless. So he improvises. People cheer him on. He thrusts his pelvis. Feigns various sex acts. Hilarious, goofy, but it works.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JACUZZI - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The party's over. Ted relaxes in the Jacuzzi, sipping champagne. Thrilled, elated, blasted. Uncle Billy sits across from him. Two MASSEUSES tenderize their shoulders. But as the scene continues the women take an even greater interest in each other. Stealing a kiss here. A touch there. Ted attention is distracted as he chats with Uncle Billy.

Ted can barely nod. She unzips the back of her dress and lets it fall to her feet. The silhouette of her nude body is startlingly gorgeous in the moonlight. Ted watches as she descends, step by step, into the frothy water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted's paralyzed with desire and fear. Ginger descends deeper. A wash of foam caresses her breasts. She continues. Until she's completely submerged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted looks startled. The "Jaws" theme echoes through his ears. He starts to rise. Concerned. When suddenly, he feels something. Whoa! His swimming trunks land next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to rise out of the Jacuzzi, when suddenly he's sucked under. He thrashes. His hand grabs the edge of the Jacuzzi. But his fingers give out. And he slides under. Only to rise out of the water with Ginger. Attached to his lips. Kissing him passionately.

INT. NELSON DINING ROOM - DAY

A world class CHEF and his SOUS CHEF serve the Nelson's a filet mignon dinner. Mom, Dad, Jimmy, Ted, and Julie, sit at the table. Set with the finest china. The most elegant linens. A fresh floral arrangement. The best of everything.

Who chokes on his sausage. Clutches his throat. Signaling to his wife and daughter. "Help me!" Judy looks up, grossed out. Mrs. Merkin attempts the Heimlich Maneuver. Rather ineptly.

Hundreds of Xenia CITIZENS have gathered for this meeting. Principal Merkin stands in front of the five members of the city council who sit at a U-shaped table. He holds up "Heaven" magazine. Preaching with an evangelical passion...
</DIRECTION>
<PRINCIPAL_MERKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This, my friends, this is not "Heaven." This flesh rag is a one way ticket to hell! We must voice our outrage! To remain passive in the eye of the devil is like inviting him to a pot luck in your own backyard and asking him to bring the three-bean salad!

A bit of an UPROAR from the crowd. WOMEN eye their HUSBANDS suspiciously. Julie makes a point...

The stack of flyers FLOATS over the railing and onto the ground floor, just as a group of LOVELY YOUNG WOMEN enters the building lobby. They excitedly reach for the flyers.

EXT. DOWNTOWN BUILDING - XENIA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A line of BEAUTIFUL WOMEN - all shapes and sizes - snakes around the block and into a doorway. The women are dressed to impress, in very skimpy clothing. Ted pulls up in his convertible Ferrari. The women shout greetings as Ted heads for the door.

A YOUNG WOMAN sits with her back to the door.

The woman turns towards Ted, revealing herself to be Christy Malone. Ted is momentarily stunned.

INT. TED'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Highly modified since the last time we saw it. A large flat screen hangs on the wall. A high tech computer system for video conferences dominates the room. Ted speaks with Uncle Billy and Helen.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.

<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem, consider it done.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Uncle Billy)
</DIRECTION>

Ted laughs. Completely ignoring his dad. Who backs out of the room. Unnoticed. Neglected. Hurt.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE NELSON HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mom drives up to the house. She stares, aghast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are tall, beautiful, ANGELS everywhere. One cuts the grass. Another pulls weeds. Two others on the roof, cleaning gutters. Still others wash the car...with Jimmy handling the water hose. Drenching the women, more than the car. Shrieks and giggles all around. Neighbors gawk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted's dad guiltily enjoys the view, but quickly rushes to his wife. She gets out of her car and steadies herself on his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NELSON LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted stands on an ottoman as a TAILOR fits him for a prom tuxedo. He towers over his parents who try to talk to him. We feel for them. They've lost control of their kid.
</DIRECTION>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.

</MOM>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.

Ted looks down at them, literally.

</TED>
<DAD>

</DAD>
<DIRECTION>
Mom gives Dad a look. Stick to the script. Don't be swayed by presents.
</DIRECTION>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.

Dad glances at Mom, hesitant. She nods, giving him the courage to continue.

	Watch your tone, mister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>

	Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore.

Mom and Dad look stricken. Ted doesn't know when to stop...
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No wonder I was so bored. No wonder I hated this one-horse cow town. I come from talented people who took chances and dared to imagine a life without limits! I was never meant to be raised by...GROCERS.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Ted storms away, unintentionally CRASHING into a TREASURED FAMILY PHOTO on the end table. The frame shatters into smithereens. Breaking Mom and Dad's hearts. STUNNED SILENCE hangs heavy in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Prom night. Couples slow dance to a Marilyn Manson clone, singing a rock version of "Precious and Few."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Principal Merkin watches on the sidelines. Surprisingly calm. Suspiciously happy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted caresses Ginger's bare back as they dance together. His head nestled against her breasts. Not a care in the world. He spots Charlie on the dance floor. Making out with one of his dates, the IDENTICAL TAYLOR TRIPLETS, while the other two patiently wait their turn.
</DIRECTION>

Julie flashes the camera again. Capturing Ginger's panicked expression. We notice that Julie looks alluring in a deep purple strapless gown. Not so glamorous as Ginger, but far more appealing and natural.

Suddenly the music dies. Everyone turns to the stage where Principal Merkin stands proudly. Holding a power cord.
</DIRECTION>
<PRINCIPAL_MERKIN>

	I apologize for interrupting the festivities, but I have some good news. I've been reviewing the rules and regulations set forth by the superintendent of schools. And it seems quite clear...

Responses are mixed. Some cheer, some are undecided. Until the new band starts playing, "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree." And EVERYONE RUSHES for the exit, following Ted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A muzak version of "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree," continues. A PIZZA DELIVERY GUY watches the numbers rise to the penthouse. Suddenly the doors open to reveal...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All four penthouse suites have been rented by Ted. It's party central. Very wild. Quickly growing out of control. Kids dance, play drinking games, Spin the Bottle, and generally trash the place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pizza delivery guy wheels a dolly with a huge stack of pizzas into the party, only to be attacked by the prom-goers like starving beasts. Grabbing the pizzas. Devouring them hungrily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted, Charlie, the Taylor Triplets and several buddies lounge around, drunkenly watching THE HOME SHOPPING CHANNEL on Ted's big screen TV. A tacky CERAMIC GNOME rotates on the screen. Ted swigs Dom Perignon straight from the bottle. He shouts orders into his cell phone...

	You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOLIDAY INN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drunken teenagers pour out of the building. Dashing for their cars and limos. Ted's among them. Suddenly he's cut off by a Harley that stops right in front of him. It's Julie. Still in her purple strapless prom dress. With a black motorcycle jacket over it.

Dressed in a old fashioned barber costume, complete with a handle bar mustache, Principal Merkin sings as part of a BARBER SHOP QUARTET. The senior citizens clap enthusiastically.

Ted and Julie peek through a crack in the doorway. Disappointment on their faces.

EXT. XENIA - WATER TOWER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the golden light of sunset, MOLLY, a stunning "Xenia Girl," stands on the stairs that curve up around a huge water tower that overlooks the city. Her loose spring dress billows in the wind. Held on by only one button. Exposing in quick glimpses that she isn't wearing a bra.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ASSISTANT holds a portable strobe, attached to a reflector. Charlie shoots with his Nikon. Motor drive whirling.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a great idea. Let's lose the last button.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Molly grins. Then unbuttons. We hear a round of "oohs" from below. Ted glances down, where...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hundreds of binoculars, cameras, and camcorders are poised on the scene. Men of all ages are milling around, gawking, focusing their long lenses. Women are conspicuously absent. Except for the gaggle of hardcore FEMINISTS with their placards, denouncing "Heaven."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One Feminist approaches the Mayor.

<FEMINIST>

	The city tower belongs to the city, not to some pornographer.

	The library also belongs to the city. And guess what? It's going to have a new Ted Nelson wing with three thousand children's books.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Feminist tries to respond, but a helicopter swoops overhead, drowning out her words. The helicopter rises to the level of the photo shoot where the door slides open. And just when we think it must have been hired by some hard core fans who wanted a closer look, we find Principal Merkin frowning as he barks through a bullhorn.

	I'm sorry, Christy. I've been crazy about you forever, and this is definitely a page right out of my palm pilot, but I just can't go through with it.

<DIRECTION>
He turns away, but Christy presses her bare body against his back. Wrapping her hands around his waist. Caressing his chest, his stomach...

SMASH CUT TO:

Ted and Christy locked in a steamy embrace. Rolling on the floor. Hands, arms, lips, tongues, all in motion. As the shower drenches them.
</DIRECTION>

Suddenly, they roll into a pair of legs. Both look up. The steam clears to reveal Julie. Arms crossed. Hurt, but not surprised.
</DIRECTION>

</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ted corners her near a row of sinks.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please believe me. It was just a kiss for old time's sake. I've had a stupid crush on her since I was seven, but I never got closer to her than four feet and then there she was right in front of me, completely naked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Julie looks at him, pensively. She unzips the back of her summery dress. And lets it fall to the floor. She's completely naked and absolutely gorgeous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted gasps. He's been around dozens of naked women by now, but this one he can't just gawk at. This one he really cares about.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Being naked is no big deal. It has nothing to do with emotion, nothing to do with love. You can be around all the naked girls you want and you won't be even one step closer to anything meaningful in your life.

She puts on her dress, gracefully. As if nothing happened.

Grocery stores couldn't keep them in stock, they were so popular. And even though other canned fruits like pears, plums, and pineapples have come along, people still need to know they can get their canned peaches, on the same shelf, whenever they want them. It's comforting, you know? It fulfills their expectations.
