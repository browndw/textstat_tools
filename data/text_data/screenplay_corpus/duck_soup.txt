The story begins with an opening shot on the exterior of the executive mansion. It is a gala day. Soldiers are lined up in front of the entrance; expensive cars and carriages are arriving and depositing distinguished notables from the adjoining countries. Two trumpeters at the head of the stairs announce the arrival of each notable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the large reception hall, Mrs. Teasdale, wife of the late president, is greeting the newcomers. The room is filled with distinguished guests. At the moment we see Mrs. Teasdale, she is talking with a notable. In the near background is a group of distinguished men, members of her own cabinet. Her words to the notable are not lost on them, and as she begins to praise the new dictator, there is the exchange of disapproving glances.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_TEASDALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is so good of you to come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_TEASDALE>
<NOTABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An honor, Mrs. Teasdale... You must indeed have great faith in your new dictator to give him such a magnificent reception.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NOTABLE>
<MRS_TEASDALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel that Rufus T. Firefly is the only logical successor to my dear departed husband. He has the statesmanship of Gladstone, the humility of Lincoln, and the wisdom of Pericles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_TEASDALE>
<DIRECTION>
The notable kisses her hand once more and leaves the scene. As he does, the background group moves into Mrs. Teasdale. Their spokesman addresses Mrs. Teasdale.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_CABINET_MEMBER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Teasdale, as members of Freedonia's cabinet, we do not approve of your choice. Who is this Rufus T. Firefly?

</SECOND_CABINET_MEMBER>
<THIRD_CABINET_MEMBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reconsider, Mrs. Teasdale, before it is too late. The citizens of Freedonia want a President!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIRD_CABINET_MEMBER>
<MRS_TEASDALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As the widow of your last president, I have the right to choose -- and, Gentlemen, I refuse to discuss the matter any further.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_TEASDALE>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs Teasdale turns her back on them, leaving them to mumble among themselves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From off scene comes a servant's voice, announcing:
</DIRECTION>
<SERVANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His Excellency, Ambassador Verdi Trentino of Amnesia!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT>
<DIRECTION>
Cut... to the archway. We see Trentino enter with a beautiful brunette at his side. He is followed by two or three of his fellowmen. He moves across the reception hall to Mrs. Teasdale, bows most graciously and presses his lips to the back of her hand, then introduces his companion.
</DIRECTION>
<TRENTINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Teasdale... my niece, Vera.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRENTINO>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Teasdale shakes the girl's hand warmly.

<TRENTINO>
<DIRECTION>
(Persistent in his flattery)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRENTINO>
<DIRECTION>
Trentino attempts to take her hand. The latter is a bit confused, much to the amusement of Vera, who laughingly says:
</DIRECTION>
<VERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Teasdale, my uncle's hopeless -- you've been the only topic of conversation ever since we left Amnesia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERA>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Teasdale's confusion is happily interrupted by the announcement of a servant, off scene.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I must greet His Honor.

</MRS_TEASDALE>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Teasdale exits from the scene quickly. Vera and Trentino look after her, then Vera laughs softly, as their eyes meet.
</DIRECTION>
<VERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that's the one you want to marry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERA>
<TRENTINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He rubs his hands significantly)
</DIRECTION>
<VERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERA>
<TRENTINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's where you come in. I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.

Vera winks agreeingly.

	Mrs. Teasdale, I assure you there is nothing to worry about. Father is probably taking extra care in getting into his robes of state. I'll call him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<DIRECTION>
Bob goes over to a corner of the room and pulls a tapestried bell cord. This rings a fire bell in Groucho's room -- and Groucho is disclosed asleep in his canopied bed under a mosquito netting. He has an unlighted cigar in his mouth. The continued jangling of the fire bell awakens him from his slumber and he rises quickly. The cigar begins to emit smoke when he starts puffing. He hurries over to one corner of the room where his clothes are arranged in fireman fashion, gets into them, and then sides down a fireman's pole into the reception hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guests are singing the last two lines of the national anthem when he arrives.

<ALL>

	Hail, hail, Freedonia... Land of the brave and free.

</ALL>
<DIRECTION>
Groucho starts across the hall in the direction of Mrs. Teasdale. He passes several notables, one of whom is wearing an impressive looking medal. Groucho deprives him of it without stopping his forward movement, and pins it on himself. He pauses only when he is facing the principal group.

Groucho does a dance with Mrs. Teasdale who joins him reluctantly and registers embarrassment as dance continues. He might finish dance in her arms, looking tenderly at her as she beams down at him.

(Calling to servant off scene)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His Excellency's car!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<DIRECTION>
This is repeated by a servant's voice off scene...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A servant enters to Groucho, bearing his high silk hat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He bows low as he hands it to Groucho... Groucho takes hat, removes a white rabbit, hands it back to servant, dons his hat and with a swanky gesture exits... again we hear a servant's voice calling: "His Excellency's car"...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the trumpeters at the top of the steps of the mansion, outside, standing at attention... their trumpets at their sides...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From inside comes the voice of a servant calling "His Excellency's car"...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trumpeters click their heels, draw themselves erect, put the trumpets to their mouths and blow a fanfare to summon the car...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We cut to the Exterior of the Dictator's garage. This is a pretentious affair. In central foreground a wall, in the center of which is a large wrought-iron double gate. On each side of the gate is a crest or design in relief. Also two liveried guards stand erect before the gate. A trumpeter on the wall above. Through the gate we see the patio and suggestions of the garage. Two or three high-class cars in background identify the garage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the beginning of the scene, we hear finish of trumpeter's call. Instantly the two guards move to the center of the gates and call through the bars -
</DIRECTION>
<GUARDS>
<DIRECTION>
(In unison)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His Excellency's car!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARDS>
<DIRECTION>
Almost instantly there is a terrific roar of motors on the other side of the wall. The two guards open gates moving in military manner. Immediately the gates are wide open, Harpo appears on his motorcycle, that carries a side car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The motorcycle is decorated... perhaps a crest in relief on the side of the car... a thin staff, about four or five feet high is fastened to the handle bars... As Harpo rides along, he hoists the Freedonian flag to the staff. Further along the road he hits a man... he looks behind to see what damage he's done, but continues riding... A CUT BACK to the man shows that he is lying prostrate on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We CUT BACK to Harpo, who is just getting off motorcycle... he takes another look back at the man, lowers the flag to half-mast, takes bugle, which is hanging on his car and blows a few bars of taps... he mounts motorcycle again and starts off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO top of mansion steps as Groucho comes from mansion... the two guards standing stiffly erect, form a seat by crossing hands... Groucho sits on the seat made by their hands, puts his arms around their shoulders and they carry him down stairs... as fast as they can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO Harpo arriving in front of mansion just as Groucho, carried by the men, moves into the scene. Groucho gets into the side-car... and in Napoleonic manner says to Harpo:
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To the House of Representatives... ride like fury... Don't stop for any signals and don't wait for a corner to make a turn... see if you can break a record...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
Harpo takes a phonograph record and smashes it on the ground... there is a roar of the motor -- the motorcycle starts off but leaves the side-car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Groucho gets out of side-car... starts back to steps, stops and says:
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A fine thing -- leaving the head of the nation at the foot of the stairs...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
As he dashes up the stairs, we CUT TO Harpo... riding along...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A very attractive girl is coming along in the opposite direction. As she approaches Harpo, he toots his horn to attract her attention, she throws him a indignant look and continues on down the street. Harpo turns his motorcycle around and starts after her. She looks around, sees Harpo
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pursuing and breaks into a run... CUT BACK to Harpo following her, putting on speed... he lowers the Freedonian flag and simultaneously raises a pirate flag -- with skull and cross- bones on it, displayed prominently. A motorcycle cop is parked on the corner waiting for prospective violators... he sees Harpo chasing the girl and quickly starts his motor and follows in pursuit...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girl, as she reaches the executive mansion, rushes up the stairs in an effort to escape. Harpo comes into the scene and rides up the stairs after her... As Harpo gets about half way up the stairs the motorcycle cop is seen approaching the mansion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO reception room of mansion as the girl is running madly through the room... a moment later we see Harpo on his bike following... there is panic among the guests. Then we see the girl tearing up the stairs leading to the circular balcony...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK to Harpo. He looks behind him as he rides and sees the motorcycle cop following on his bike. On the balcony above, the girl is running, with an occasional glance over her shoulder as she runs out of scene... Harpo rides into scene. This time he is bent over his handle-bars in the manner of a six day bicycle rider... following closely behind him rides the motorcycle cop. They circle the mezzanine... Harpo in the lead, looking back now and then over his shoulder at his pursuer... this is done in imitation of a six day bicycle race... The motorcycle cop is closing in on Harpo... the latter approaching a large open door, rides through the opening, but the cop continues on around the balcony... as he gets to the opposite side of the circular balcony he passes another open doorway. Harpo comes riding out of it and is now in pursuit of the cop...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT down stairs to Groucho... One hand is upraised holding a gun. As he looks at a wrist watch, he fires gun, then addresses guests looking into CAMERA.
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That concludes the nine o'clock sprints... Next Saturday night the winner of the six day bicycle race will receive ten thousand dollars in gold... the following morning we go off the gold standard...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK to balcony... Harpo is passing the cop... He holds up his hand for the cop to stop... they both come to a halt... Harpo gets off his motorcycle, walks over angrily to cop, takes out his book, writes out a summons and hands it to the cop as we FADE OUT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END OF SEQUENCE "A"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: SEQUENCE "B"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN on interior of Freedonian House of Representatives. This interior although not a replica of our own House of Representatives, should be close enough technically to sell the idea... Each seat is occupied by an officious-looking dignitary. On the platform are a few desks... perhaps a pulpit which Groucho uses when he arrives... The one to the right is the court stenographer's desk, occupied by Bob Firefly. He takes notes as the meeting progresses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Throughout the House runs a ripple of excitement, which is stopped by the rapping of the gavel by the Speaker of the House.

Bob presses a button, either on desk or wall...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO - the corner of Groucho's bedroom, showing fireman's pole. The sound of the clanging bell is heard over scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Groucho hurries into scene, fully clad but for his coat which he has on his arm... without waiting to don his coat he slides down the pole. We pick him up finishing the slide down the pole into the House of Representatives. As he arrives the members are on their feet singing the last four bars of the national anthem.
</DIRECTION>
<MEMBERS>
<DIRECTION>
(Singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA Land of the brave and free...

Groucho hurries toward Speaker's desk, putting on his coat as he goes... Just as he reaches the desk the singing subsides. Groucho turns to the body of men and looks off in the direction of one of the representatives.

then raps the gavel.)

(Looking out and around at members)
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's to stop you from digging one... And after you dig a river, how're ya gonna cross it without a bridge...? We've got to have a bridge to stop people from going places -- then we've gotta stop them from coming back. If you're worried about the expense we can have a bridge with only one end -- and if that's a success we can do away with it altogether. I'm telling you that what this country needs is --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
Off scene we hear Chico's voice singing "P-E-A-N-U-T-S"... this is followed by the piping of a whistle playing the first strain of the PEANUT VENDOR...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Groucho listens, annoyed and then continues
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If there's one thing we don't need right now -- it's peanuts -- gentlemen, what good is a bridge if you haven't got ammunition to blow it up... ammunition was never cheaper... Right now, you can get two cannons for the price of one and shoot twice as far for half the money... With every five thousand dollar purchase we throw in a Big Bertha... If you don't like her, you can throw her right out again. I tell you no country can protect itself without --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
Again Chico's voice comes over scene singing "P-E-A-N-U-T- S"... The whistling of the first strain of song - the PEANUT VENDOR is heard again
</DIRECTION>
<SPEAKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry your Excellency, it is that infernal peanut vendor Chicolini... How can we accomplish anything with that constant annoyance?

	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
Singing even louder than before - Trentino smirks approvingly and exits - the whistling of the tune following as we CUT inside to Groucho - and the well-known vamp of the "Peanut Vendor" is heard coming over scene with orchestra accompaniment...

He walks determinedly in direction of window and breaks into a rhumba - with hands on hips - dipping to ground a la Spanish dancer... as he reaches window we CUT outside. Groucho is seen in the window - which is on the ground floor - Chico is by his peanut stand.

<DIRECTION>
Groucho exits towards door leading into his private office. CUT to inside of private office which has another door leading to a hallway, and among other articles of furniture, there is an impressive-looking desk on which is a telephone. Just as Groucho comes through the door into his office, Chico enters through the other door. He is wearing gauntlets, reaching half way up his arms. As they walk toward each other the telephone rings and the two men make a mad dash for the telephone on the desk. Chico beats Groucho to the phone, picks up the receiver.

	Oh no, I can't do it.

	You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?

	No, but I shot some ducks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license. Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<CHICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no -- nothing doing. I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.

<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, maybe he's still the vice- president. Now if I were to offer you --

Telephone bell rings. They both make a dash for the telephone, but Harpo rushes in through hallway door and reaches the phone first. Harpo picks up through telephone receiver, listens to conversation on the other end with an occasional nod and shake of the head. As he listens, he scribbles message on a piece of paper. He holds the written message up to the telephone receiver for a moment, then writes a few more words on the paper. During this, Chico and Groucho stand by, terribly worried. Finally Harpo hangs up the receiver and exits, tearing up the paper
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
(After a moment's glance at Harpo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I'd be lost without a telephone. Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War. The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<CHICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I get?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You get half mine and I get half yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<CHICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<CHICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, that's easy. You gotta insult somebody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
Groucho suddenly slaps Chico across the face with his gloves, then as quickly brings to light a card which he presents to Chico in the professional manner of an experienced duelist
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My card.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
(Laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a-no good. You gotta insult somebody from another country. Look --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Puts his large gloves on the desk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I come from one country. You come from another country. I say something you don't like. You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why wasn't I insulted?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<CHICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You was insulted, but you don't know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
(Indignantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I demand an apology!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<CHICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a-no good. If I apologize we no got a war. Look -- I send you a scrap of paper. You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?... Who do we owe money to?...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Enthusiastically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	AMBASSADOR TRENTINO! How about him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<CHICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's-a very easy to insult -- I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't his niece slap your face?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<CHICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you say to her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
Chico whispers in Groucho's ear -- Groucho gives him an indignant look
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<CHICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You told it to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
(Puzzled for a moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes, I remember -- and I should have slapped Mrs. Teasdale's face when she told it to me... I'm going right out and find Trentino. You go right out and get yourself an army.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
Chico turns to go - Groucho stops him
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<CHICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
At this point Chico is at the door and exits - Groucho slams the door right in his face - then he walks over to the desk and sees the larger gauntlets. He takes a swing with his own gloves, then takes a hefty swing with the gauntlet. He leaves his own gloves on the desk and exits with the gauntlets in is hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT outside. Harpo is just pulling up to the curb in front of the House of Representatives, in his motorcycle and side car. Groucho comes from the building wearing gauntlets, gets into the side car and with a dignified wave of his hand, says:
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To Mrs. Teasdale's residence!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
The motorcycle speeds out of the scene, leaving the side car behind.
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the fifth trip I've made today and I haven't been anywhere yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
And, as he gets out of the side car and starts to go back into the building, the scene
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADES OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END OF SEQUENCE "B"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: SEQUENCE "C"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN to garden party. This is an afternoon tea in the garden of the Teasdale estate. Spotted in the set-up are innumerable colorful umbrellas, under which are tea tables.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guests include the notables we saw in the mansion in the first sequence. The only two people absent are Ambassador Trentino and Mrs. Teasdale. Vera Trentino is seated at one of the tables and her presence is established there in the opening shot. Music is heard over the scene and should be continued through the scene as if being played by an orchestra on the premises. Suddenly the chatter ceases as the following announcement is heard coming over scene.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(From off scene)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His Excellency, Rufus T. Firefly!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
All eyes turn toward those off scene and everyone rises to sing the last four bars of the national anthem.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cut to the gateway leading into the garden... a servant on each side of the gate, as Groucho jauntily strides through the gate, swinging the unusually large gauntlets...
</DIRECTION>
<GUESTS>
<DIRECTION>
(Singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA Land of the brave and free...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUESTS>
<DIRECTION>
Groucho hands his high silk hat to one of the guards and starts down the walk among the guests. From his attitude it is evident that he is intent on finding Ambassador Trentino. Suddenly he stops, having seen something of interest off scene. The following dialogue comes over the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<TRENTINO_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't you see, Gloria, our marriage would not only unite two great families...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRENTINO_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO Trentino and Mrs. Teasdale in a quiet corner of the garden -- both are at a tea table. This shot leaves Groucho out.
</DIRECTION>
<TRENTINO>
<DIRECTION>
(Continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRENTINO>
<MRS_TEASDALE>

(Fluttering with excitement)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...

	<DIALOGUE>
	But you see - well - I --

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Then there his somebody else?

<MRS_TEASDALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well no -- not exactly -- but --

</MRS_TEASDALE>
<TRENTINO>

(Impatiently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gloria -- I've waited for years. I won't be put off! I love you! I want you!

(Taking her hand pleadingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't you see that I'm at your feet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRENTINO>
<DIRECTION>
Groucho enters the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
(To Trentino)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine. I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(To CAMERA)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Turns to Gloria)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gloria, I love you. I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<TRENTINO>
<DIRECTION>
(Furious, to Gloria)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRENTINO>
<GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
(To Mrs. Teasdale)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can this mug offer you? Wealth and family. I can't give you wealth...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Archly lifting his eyebrow)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...but we can have a little family of our own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<MRS_TEASDALE>
<DIRECTION>
(Coyly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Rufus!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_TEASDALE>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.

</GROUCHO>
<MRS_TEASDALE>

(Happily confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_TEASDALE>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Turning to Trentino)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you can suggest something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<TRENTINO>
<DIRECTION>
(Hotly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This has gone far enough! This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRENTINO>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<MRS_TEASDALE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

(Half addressing Mrs. Teasdale)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't come here to be insulted.

<GROUCHO>

(Holds his gauntlets
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	in his hand, ready at any moment to
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
strike)
</DIRECTION>
<TRENTINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You upstart!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRENTINO>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it! No man lives who can call a Firefly an upstart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
Without further ado, Groucho strikes Trentino across the face with his gauntlets. Then he quickly flashes his card and extends it to Trentino in the manner of a duelist.
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
(As he offers the card)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Touché.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
A sudden ripple of excitement as the guests, attracted by the rumpus begin to move into the scene. Prominent among these is Vera Trentino. Trentino refuses Groucho's card, white with rage.
</DIRECTION>
<TRENTINO>
<DIRECTION>
(Coldly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shall report this indignity the my President.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(To Mrs. Teasdale - polite but firm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Teasdale, I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.

	It is every woman's problem. Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands? Who...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.

</GROUCHO>
<VERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it.
	</DIALOGUE>

(She winks at Trentino)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will stay here in Freedonia.

</VERA>
<TRENTINO>

(As a faint smile of

<DIRECTION>
from his face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well then, if that's how you feel about it --

<DIRECTION>
(suggestive shrug of his shoulders)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My country has spoken.

He turns on his heel as if about to leave. Groucho stops him

</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
The above lies are spoken in meter and each line is punctuated by the staccato notes of the trumpet. Groucho makes a military exit from scene in time to the music, which goes into a military march. As Groucho reaches the gate, the guard hands him his high silk hat. Groucho takes the hat -- removes a white rabbit from it -- hands it to the guard -- as he exits through gate.

<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE.

END OF SEQUENCE "C"

<DIRECTION>
:SC: SEQUENCE "D"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT of newspaper. The newspaper moves up to CAMERA from background -- as it stops we read the following headlines:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"ARMIES MOBILIZE AS WAR CLOUDS GATHER!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through this insert we get the vague impression of war activity. We see the movement of soldiers' feet. From the background the second insert moves up to CAMERA...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first insert moves past CAMERA and the second insert comes from the background. The headline reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"AMNESIA HASTENS PREPARATIONS!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through this insert we see the heavy wheels of army wagons moving along. This is replaced by the the insert coming from the background. The headlines read -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"FREEDONIA'S LEADER MAINTAINS ATTITUDE OF DIGNIFIED SILENCE!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bombing planes move through this insert. The front page of the paper is turned and followed by a few other pages until we come to the classified ad section of the paper. We see the following advertisement:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WANTED: - A female spy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Must be young and attractive Apply to Office of Secretary of War.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above this ad we just see a few lines of another ad --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WANTED: -- A Chauffeur Below the war nurse ad we see part of another ad in which a cook is wanted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHOT (in movement) of a row of shapely legs, obviously those of very pretty girls. The CAMERA moves upward disclosing the faces of the girls, who are sitting in a row in the ante-room of the Secretary of War's office. On the door leading to the Secretary's private office, we see the lettering: PRIVATE. The CAMERA discloses only four or five of these girls, but we know there are more in the room. Bob appears in the doorway leading to the Secretary's office and addresses the first girl - nearest the door.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Secretary of War will see you next, Miss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<DIRECTION>
This girl is very pretty and has a very attractive form.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles at Bob, rises and exits into the Secretary's office. Bob closes the door behind her. The CAMERA now moves along the row of girls and the sixth or seventh girl in the row is Harpo, dressed as a girl. On the other side of him are more girls. A girl to the right of him turns to the girl beside her.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(To the girl at her right)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you hear the one about the woman taking a bath?... Well, she forgot to lock the door... A man came in and said, "I'm a doctor"... The woman said, "I'm not sick"... and the man said, "that's all right. I'm not a doctor."
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
All of the girls laugh heartily at at this remark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harpo is laughing also. He slaps the story-teller on the leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her laughter ceases instantly. She slaps him back, and gets another slap on the leg in return. A little squeal of pain from her and she raises her dress disclosing a bruise on her leg just above the knee.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(To Harpo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Harpo does so, then pulls up his own dress and points to his leg for her to look. On his leg is tattooed a picture of two hearts entwined with an arrow running through both. She gives Harpo dirty look and rises
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Private office of Secretary of War. The office is cluttered with war implements, maps, etc. The examination of the girl is in progress. She is turning around in the manner of a clothes model. Chico is looking her over.
</DIRECTION>
<CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
(To girl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look pretty good to me - but very still need a spy - Have you got any credentials?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
The girl nods and pulls her dress up above her knees revealing an attractive leg. She reaches into her stocking for a paper.
</DIRECTION>
<CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
(Taking a very good look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got credentials all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
The girl drops her skirt and hands the paper to Chico. Chico looks at the paper
</DIRECTION>
<CHICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is fine. Put it back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
Hands the girl the paper. She lifts her dress above her knees again and puts the paper back in her stocking, while Chico looks on. She drops her skirt.
</DIRECTION>
<CHICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I better take another look at that paper...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
She lifts the skirt again to get the paper, while Chico steals another glance. The girl drops her skirt and hands him the paper.
</DIRECTION>
<CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
(Looking at the paper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I look this over later -- now I look you over. If you want to be a spy, you gotta be in good condition. I better examine you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
He takes stethoscope from his pocket, applies it to her heart and listens.
</DIRECTION>
<CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
(Listening to girl's heart beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's something wrong -- I think I'm getting Whiteman's band.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
Puts stethoscope back in his pocket and takes watch from vest pocket. He feels her pulse while looking at the watch.
</DIRECTION>
<CHICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	According to my watch it's four o'clock.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Puts watch back in his pocket)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now look -- a woman spy is a-gotta make love to men. Come on -- let's see you make love...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
She walks over to him and lovingly strokes his hair, puts both arms around him, then suddenly becomes very amorous, bends him over and kisses him madly. She lets go after a little while and Chico comes up for air. He staggers around in a daze. Then he takes the watch from his vest pocket, hands it to her, extends his wrist and says:
</DIRECTION>
<CHICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you feel my pulse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the screaming of girls is heard coming from the anteroom, and we cut to the anteroom in the midst of confusion. The girls are running helter-skelter, one or two of them are standing on chairs with their skirts lifted above their knees. There is a little white mouse running about the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harpo is sitting innocently on the bench. The girl just interviewed by Chico comes from the office, sees the mouse, screams and joins in the general confusion. Groucho enters as the girls are running about - zig-zags among them and continues through the room into the private office of Chico - closing door behind him. The girls clear out of anteroom and Harpo is left all alone. He takes a small mouse trap from his large pocketbook, puts it on the floor, crouches down and whistles to the mouse in the manner of a man trying to call a dog. The mouse in answer to the whistle runs into the trap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Secretary of War's office. Chico at the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
(To phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Send in the next girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He hangs receiver up)
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<CHICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, we gotta have a spy. If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
At this point, Harpo makes his entrance through the door, carrying his unusually large pocketbook which is about the size of a carpetbag. He walks past Groucho in a seductive manner, swinging his bag and rolling his eyes flirtatiously. Groucho is delighted with this action and returns the ogling.
</DIRECTION>
<CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
(To Harpo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you got any credentials?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
Harpo lifts his dress and shows them the tattoo on his leg of the two hearts. Groucho examines it closely.
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't go in much for modern art. Have you got anything by one of the old masters?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
Harpo lifts his dress above the other leg and shows a picture of Gainsborough's "Blue Boy". Chico and Groucho arise from the examination.

<CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
(To Harpo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men. You know how to make love?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
Harpo walks over to Chico, throws his arms around him and starts to give him a big hug. He squeezes him very hard. In the midst of this there is a loud report.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A startled look from Groucho and Chico. We see that Harpo is minus one breast. He tries to affect an innocent look when suddenly there is a second loud report and his breasts are now as flat as a billiard table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as he turns to hide the sight from Chico and Groucho, a hissing sound is heard -- the air is leaking out of his bustle and the bustle is becoming deflated.)
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
(To Harpo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ought to carry a spare.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
Harpo goes to a corner of the room and keeps his back to CAMERA. He takes a tube out of his dress front and begins to blow. Chico and Groucho wear a puzzled look as they watch him - the bustle starts to expand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This inflation continues to gigantic proportions as they look on.
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
(Looking at Harpo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're certainly living in a marvelous age.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
There is a terrific explosion and all of Harpo's clothes are blown off him - leaving him in nothing but running pants and ladies' silk stockings. His body is literally covered with tattoos.
</DIRECTION>
<CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
(Laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's very funny... he certainly fooled me. He'll make a good spy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
Winks significantly at Harpo. Harpo returns the wink.
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
(Examining tattoos)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we can't use him as a spy, we can have him framed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
He and Chico continue further examination of the tattooed designs on Harpo's body.
</DIRECTION>
<CHICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, that's a nice collection. You oughta have a catalogue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
Harpo pulls a catalogue from under the belt of his trunks and hands it to Chico. Groucho and Chico look at the catalogue.
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's take a look at number eighteen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
Harpo reveals more of his back and shows a superb tattooed job of a beautiful girl's head.
</DIRECTION>
<CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
(Referring to picture of girl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, she's all right. You got-a her phone number?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
Harpo raises one arm and shows the phone number tattooed right under the arm pit. He holds this a moment, then turns and discloses a portion of the tattooing on his chest. Groucho and Chico's eyes shift from the telephone number to the tattooed picture on his chest. Harpo completes move and discloses the entire picture. It is a country back-house with a crescent over the door. Chico laughs uproariously.
</DIRECTION>
<CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
(Laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a funny one!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
He slaps Harpo an the back good-naturedly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRICK SHOT on HARPO'S CHEST. The door in the outhouse flies open. The head of a real man appears in the opening. He looks off in the direction of Chico and mumbles incoherencies under his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is terribly angry at being interrupted. He draws in his head, closing the door behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
(To Harpo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we can use you. Here's a spy glass... go ahead and do some spying...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
Harpo takes the glasses and goes directly toward the window. As he looks across street through binoculars, he is grinning all over and wiggling around like a happy kid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROOM ACROSS THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking into the open window of a bedroom as Harpo would see it through the binoculars. A beautiful girl is undressing, preparing to retire. After a moment of this shot CUT BACK to Harpo looking through the binoculars. Chico takes the binoculars from Harpo and pushes him out of the scene, proceeds to look himself. He registers the same satisfaction as Harpo and hands the binoculars to Groucho. As Groucho looks through the binoculars at the beautiful girl, Chico says:
</DIRECTION>
<CHICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
(Turning and looking at Chico)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not bad for any day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
Groucho takes a second look through the binoculars at the beautiful girl. This time he sees Harpo chasing the girl around the roam. This is shot through the binoculars as before. Groucho registers amazement as he looks through binoculars; perhaps squints his eyes once or twice and takes second look.
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
(To Chico)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe my eyes are bad - you take a look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
Chico takes the binoculars and looks at the room across the street. Binocular shot as before. The girl is in her underwear, tearing out of the room into the hall, pursued by Harpo. Chico is still looking through the binoculars.
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<CHICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO the front of the building occupied by the beautiful girl. She comes dashing madly out of the door and starts down the street, clad only in her underwear. Harpo appears in doorway, riding his motorcycle and starts down the street after her.

FADE IN to living room of Mrs. Teasdale's home... It is a smartly appointed room. Its main feature for our purposes is a winding stairway leading to bedrooms above.

In the absence of Mrs. Teasdale, Vera is seated by fireplace while Ambassador Trentino is excitedly pacing up and down...

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO corner of room (Mrs. Teasdale's living room), disclosing for the first time the fireman's pole... Groucho comes sliding down the pole in his nightgown, with a long box of crackers under his arm... stops about three feet from the floor, looks around the room and sees Trentino.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure you did the right thing?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. Who ever heard of calling off a war after ordering all the ammunition?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
By this tine Vera has descended the stairs and exited from scene. Groucho looks around the room furtively to make sure he is not being observed and takes a large envelope from his inside pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>

<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight... If the enemy gets those papers we're lost. If they don't get them, we're lost. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you? I love you... Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth. They don't come any better than you...

	Now -- er --

</MRS_TEASDALE>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better. The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again. I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...

Harpo acknowledges the applause as if it was in appreciation of his climb -- after a few quick bows he starts out of the box after the girl. As he is running out of box into the foyer he bumps into Ambassador Trentino.
</DIRECTION>
<TRENTINO>
<DIRECTION>
(Stopping him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute... Mrs. Teasdale is in the box below. The plans of war are in her purse -- you've got to get them -- I don't care how, but get them -- and when you do, bring them to 492 North Myrtle Road -- you'd better write that down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRENTINO>
<DIRECTION>
Harpo takes out a pencil with heavy lead and writes the address on the white and purple-edged silk band which is across Trentino's shirt bosom. Then he pushes Trentino's coat aside and from under his vest pulls the ribbon in the manner of a ticker tape -- tears it off -- and starts back to box.

Mrs. Teasdale laughs good-naturedly and puts the purse behind her between her back and the back of the chair... as we go to stage where the shooting of the apple in "William Tell" is being enacted. William Tell is just placing the apple on his son's head -- he turns his back on his son and walks toward opposite side of stage with bow and arrow.

UPPER BOX
</DIRECTION>

Harpo takes a look at apple on the boy's head -- reaches down in box and comes up with a bow and arrow. He takes a good aim and lets the arrow fly... It hits its mark and the apple falls to the ground. William Tell, having arrived at spot from which he's going to shoot, turns to take aim and sees that the apple is gone. He picks up another, at the base of an apple tree and starts in direction of his son.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO Harpo, who is watching William Tell. He reaches down into box and brings up another arrow -- takes aim and lets arrow fly. Again it hits its mark and the apple falls to ground. William Tell, reaching his place, turns to take aim and is bewildered at the sight of the second missing apple. The tree is bare and there are no more apples around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A whistle is heard coming over scene. William Tell turns in direction of the whistle and we CUT TO Harpo whistling with his fingers in his mouth. Reaching down into the box, he brings up a bag of apples and dumps all the apples onto the stage. CUT TO: Lower box.

Mrs. Teasdale looks at him disdainfully, turns to look at stage, and jumps again. She and Chico turn to look at each other. She, of course, is indignant, while Chico smiles -- his hand is coming from behind her. She takes the purse from its hiding place and places it on the ledge of the box out of Chico's reach. CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO box below - Chico is trying to reach for pocketbook on ledge but can't get it. He whistles up to Harpo. Harpo looks down and Chico pantomimes to him to get the pocketbook, pointing to it. The singing stops and aplause follows -- the orchestra starts a selection -- which continues through following routine without any singing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO box above. Harpo takes out a fishing pole with a reel on it -- he unwinds reel and the line descends

near box below and lands in a man's hair -- the man occupies an aisle seat in the orchestra -- near Teasdale box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO Harpo reeling in. CUT TO man on aisle seat -- The hook has caught onto his toupe and its being pulled off his head. CUT TO Harpo reeling in with great satisfaction in the belief that he has the purse -- on the end of the line comes the toupe. Harpo, astonished, looks down on the victim who, minus the toupe, now displays a shiny bald pate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harpo takes out his fountain pen and releases gadget. The ink pours down on the bald spot of the man below and spreads into the form of a toupe parted in the middle. CUT BACK to Harpo - he places the toupe on the bare back side of a figure of Cupid carved on the arch. He is now suddenly attracted by something on the stage -- it is a pool with a practical fountain in its center. Harpo digs into a decorative flower box set in a groove in the proscenium arch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He brings out a real live worm and baits his hook -- stands up and casts... the line swishes through the air and the hook lands in the pool on the stage. The line instantly tightens and a large carp fish is yanked out of the pool... as the line is drawn in the fish nearly hits Mrs. Teasdale.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She covers her face with her hands. Chico takes advantage of her action, grabs the line, removes the fish, and puts hook on handle of purse... then signals Harpo with a whistle and in the manner of a construction foreman, motions to him to start "hoisting". The line becomes taut and the purse is yanked out of view. Mrs. Teasdale uncovers her face and discovers that the purse is missing.

</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
He makes a grab at Chico -- Chico passes the plans to Harpo - Groucho goes after Harpo - the latter leans away over ledge of box and holds the plans out over the stage. As Groucho is trying to reach for the plans, Vera dances into scene, makes a graceful pirouette and with her outstretched hands takes the plans from Harpo. As she dances away she deposits the plans in her bodice...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vera's male dancing partner enters from the wings, walks out about four feet - stops and strikes a pose with uplifted hand. Vera is dancing on the opposite side with her back turned. CUT TO Groucho back stage - he sees the dancing partner - pulls a lever on switchboard marked "TRAP DOOR" - CUT TO stage as the dancer disappears through floor. CUT TO shot of Vera - preparing to turn to join her partner - she reacts as she sees -- CUT TO Groucho standing on her partner's former spot holding the same pose ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO full stage shot. Groucho and Vera are dancing together. During the dance Groucho tries to get the paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He bends her way over in an effort to make the paper drop out of her bodice. Harpo and Chico, watching the struggle, quickly tear off their capes and coats and leap from the box on to stage in their shirts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This develops into a four-cornered adagio dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hands the papers to Harpo over Groucho's shoulder as she dances with him... Groucho rushes to Harpo and they do a twirl together. Harpo hands the paper to Chico over Groucho's shoulder. Groucho rushes at Chico and twirls with him - Chico in trying to pass the papers to Vera drops them on the floor. They all make a dive for them. Groucho gets the papers and dashes with them to the lower box just as Mrs. Teasdale enters same.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN - Mrs. Teasdale's living room. Night. Subdued light. We begin with an EXTREME CLOSE CLOSE SHOT of a hand depositing the plans of war in a vault. This vault is about the height of a man, the door flush with wall. The CAMERA TRUCKS back and discloses that the one depositing the papers is Mrs. Teasdale -- she is in negligee. She closes the vault door, pulls a cord, closing a pair of drapes which hide the vault. The CAMERA PANS to the balcony above where Vera Trentino, also in negligee, is watching the action in the living room below. She tiptoes quietly from the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Downstairs, Mrs. Teasdale turns out the center table light and moves toward the stairway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO Vera Trentino's bedroom. Vera comes toward window, raises it quietly and waves a handkerchief, evidently signalling somebody below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO EXTERIOR of house. Chico and Harpo are waving back to signify that they have caught the signal. The boys try to raise the window which is located next to the main entrance, but it is locked and they can't budge it.

Chico goes over to the safe and draws the curtains, disclosing safe. Harpo follows and takes from his back pocket a rather large electrical drill with a cord and plug attached to it. Chico takes the cord and plugs it into the wall socket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harpo starts to drill the safe door, making a terrific noise -- the usual reaping whir-r-r of an electric drill. Chico grabs his hand and stops him from drilling.
</DIRECTION>

	Wait a minute... we make too much noise... Turn on the radio so they can't hear what we're doing.

CUT TO Vera's bedroom. It is a CLOSE SHOT showing Vera in bed, shot from side of bed. She is under the bedcovers desperately trying to keep them from being pulled off her... TRUCK back disclosing Harpo on the other end of the bedcovers, trying to pull them off her... for a moment following, a tug of war goes on, Harpo pulling the covers about a foot his way and Vera pulling them back... The sound of Chico's second whistle coming over scene attracts Harpo, who lets go of the covers and runs out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pick him up outside of the room on balcony. Without hesitation he slides down the bannisters to join Chico who is waiting at foot of stairs.

Harpo lights fuse... each stands on either side of safe door waiting for the explosion... after a slight pause, there is a terrific blast of sound... and the screen is masked with smoke.

This insert goes past the CAMERA as another newspaper comes from the background. The headline reads: -
</DIRECTION>

"ENEMY APPROACHING CAPITOL"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE to Groucho's office. Groucho is standing in front of his desk reading a newspaper, which is spread over his desk.

The headline is the same as in the second insert -

<DIRECTION>
With a grand gesture, Groucho exits out of scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harpo grips pommel of the saddle with both hands and in his attempt to make a flying mount, vaults clear over the horse landing on the other side. He lets down a rope ladder from under the saddle, climbs the ladder, mounts the horse and starts off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE to CLOSE UP of Harpo riding at breakneck speed. As he looks grimly ahead he reaches down out of scene and brings up a three-cornered colonial hat and puts it on his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE to a Moving Insert - Harpo bringing the horse to a stop in front of a farm house. He blows a blast on a regular army bugle... immediately a few old men rush out of the house in their nightgowns, carrying guns, and into the scene from all directions rush other men, answering the call, similarly attired. Harpo starts his horse and we DISSOLVE to him pulling up to another farm house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This house has a single door on the extreme end of it and a very large French window covering almost the rest of the house. Harpo stops and sounds the bugle call. This time there is no answer to his call. He waits a second, then turns his horse in the direction of the house and rides through the single door. After a short pause, the doors of the French window fly open and the horse runs out pulling a double bed which is on wheels. Harpo is standing at the foot of the bed, braced against the bedpost, holding the reins. There is an old couple, man and woman, fast asleep in the bed - (This couple might be the blase gentleman and young wife used by Peter Arno in his cartoons.) After riding a few feet Harpo leaps from the bed onto the horse's back and rides off leaving the bed and its occupants on the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE to Harpo pulling up to another farm house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops, sounds his bugle. A very pretty young girl, in her night clothes pokes her head out of the second story window. Harpo takes a good look at her, leaps off his horse and dashes into the house. A moment later he comes out of the house with a feed bag and puts it on the horse's head.... then he dashes back into the house again. Almost instantly he comes tearing out of the house, followed by an old geezer in his nightgown, who is chasing him, with rifle in hand...

DISSOLVE through the shooting of previous scene to STOCK SHOT of artillery fire on battle field - a profile SHOT with all the activity of an actual battle, but without an indication of falling men. DISSOLVE from this to interior of Groucho's headquarters behind the front - a wooden shack. The sound of a distant booming of guns is heard over this scene. On the wall is a large war map with colored thumb tacks indicating the positions of Groucho's men and the enemy.

The whining of an approaching shell is heard and a shell about three feet long comes sailing through the open window, speeds through the room and tears through the opposite wall, leaving a clean-cut hole. Groucho rushes to window and closes it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT of No Man's Land, with shells exploding in all directions. We see a head slowly appearing over the edge of shell-hole, looking through spy-glasses. It is Harpo...

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside of shell hole...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harpo registers that he has seen something of startling interest. He drops the glasses, scrambles out of shell-hole and runs out of scene. He rushes to his waiting motorcycle (without the side-car).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The staff with the flag flying from it is attached to the handle-bars. He leaps onto the motorcycle seat and starts off.

CUT TO:

A war nurse, attracted by the roar of the motorcycle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks back, sees Harpo approaching and breaks into a run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he closes in on her, she jumps into a trench to escape him. Harpo rides on a little further to the entrance of the trench and turns in, to continue his pursuit. A TRUCKING SHOT shows only the flag and staff, tearing along above the surface, with the accompanying roar of the motorcycle which is hidden from view. As it speeds along, soldiers are leaping up out of the trenches on every side to avoid being run down. This continues doing a zig-zag with abrupt turns...

<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO:

<DIRECTION>
Groucho's headquarters. Groucho is discovered there alone, stropping his sword on a razor strap attached to his desk.

Harpo enters, bent forward, tugging at a rope which tightens over his shoulder, in the manner of a Volga Boatman... at the end of the rope is a cannon, on two wheels

	<DIALOGUE>
	Load it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
Harpo pours a great quantity of powder into the cannon, then to make sure he has enough, he lights a match and looks into the hole. Groucho takes the lighted match from Harpo. He lights his own cigar, hands the match back to Harpo. Harpo pours in a little more powder, makes sure he has enough, then proceeds to ram the powder in the barrel with his horn. He rises and moves to wall toward which the cannon is pointed. He draws a target on the wall with a piece of chalk -- goes back to cannon. He picks up the firing string, and faces the target toward which the cannon is pointing. Chico puts his fingers into his ears. Groucho picks up a pencil from desk - taps it on desk - then raises both hands, in the manner of an orchestra leader. He holds this pose for a second - and on the down beat, Harpo jerks the string and there is a terrific explosion. The cannon fires out the back end instead of the front and blows a hole through the back wall. The two stare off in the direction of the hole. Groucho turns to Chico.

As Groucho walks away from window, he hears another explosion outside. He rushes back to the window, takes a package of small firecrackers out of his pocket, detaches one of the firecrackers, lights it from his cigar and throws it out of the window.

As the smoke clears away we see Groucho and Zeppo descending side by side in two parachutes against sky background.

<GROUCHO>

(To Zeppo)

<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To whom it may concern... Dear Gloria: The air has done me a world of good. I am five thousand feet above sea level speeding home to you. Can you arrange to meet me at twenty-five hundred feet? -- which is only asking you to meet me half way. Don't be surprised if I drop in on you any minute... Your fun- loving Dictator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
Groucho and Zeppo descend out of scene, as Harpo and Chico come into scene from above, both suspended from the ropes of their parachutes... They are in a sitting position, with a board across their knees, playing cards...

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Applause)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO door, as it is being opened by two pages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trentino and Vera enter. They both stop and bow in acknowledgment of the applause coming over scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they walk toward table and out of scene, Chico and Harpo enter. The latter is carrying a carpet runner, rolled up under his arm. He flips the carpet runner away from him on the floor, holding onto one end. It rolls out and Harpo strides majestically down its length toward the table with Chico following. Harpo pauses, brings to light a cuspidor from under his coat, puts it on the carpet and spits into it, and continues on, following Chico, who is now ahead of him. Harpo breaks into a run and he and Chico dash madly to the table. They take seats on either side of Groucho and without hesitating, start to eat the food in front of them. The guests are standing. Trentino and Vera arrive at their places and everyone sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harpo reaches for a large service plate with a pretty picture on it, pushes his plate away, breaks the service plate with a knife... it breaks into little pieces like a jig-saw puzzle. He mixes the pieces up, and then starts to put them together again ... Groucho watches him... then helps him...
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
(Stopping Harpo as he tries to fit a piece)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, this is the one...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Picking up a piece and placing it...)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A waiter places a dish of tasty food in front of Groucho... he is just about to dig into it with his knife and fork when Harpo turns the table toward himself. This brings Groucho's food to Harpo, and Chico's empty plate to Groucho...
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was awfully good, I think I'll have a second helping... waiter...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
Snapping his finger to waiter off scene. The waiter immediately appears placing a second dish in front of Groucho. He starts to dig his knife and fork into it again when Chico turns the table toward himself... This brings his food to Chico... Harpo lifts his plate up and puts it down again when the table stops turning... this time Groucho has nothing in front of him...
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I don't stop eating I'll get indigestion...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<A_WOMAN_GUEST>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICO>
<DIRECTION>
Harpo takes salt shaker from man to his right, places it in front of himself and gives the table a quick turn toward the woman next to Chico...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Groucho is still without food. He rises and looks about table... Sees a dish of food in front of Trentino, who is seated at opposite side of table... Trentino is eating.
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>

</AMBASSADOR_TRENTINO>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all I wanted to know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
He gives the table a quick turn and Trentino's plate disappears as it spins around toward Groucho...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as it gets to Harpo, he lifts up the plate... the table goes on a few feet more and when it stops, Harpo puts down his plate and starts to eat... again Groucho has nothing... Groucho picks up his napkin and wipes his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't eat another thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

The table starts to turn slowly... Groucho starts to walk in opposite direction... staying in same place.
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In union there is strength...

</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
The table moves a little faster... Groucho increases his pace accordingly... CUT TO Harpo and Chico now seated beside each other turning the table... CUT BACK to Groucho...

<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel that we are taking a step in the right direction, and that's what I call balling the Jack...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
Speed of table turning increases. Groucho keeping pace against it in tread-mill fashion...
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now is not the time for political temporizing, all interests must be sacrificed for the common weal...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUCHO>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO Harpo and Chico turning table... faster and faster... We CUT BACK to Groucho who is now galloping to keep his spot but he's not going any place
</DIRECTION>
<GROUCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All those who want to place their money on the wheel, step inside, faint heart never won fair lady... Money won't grow in your pocket like the hair on your head and now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their party.
