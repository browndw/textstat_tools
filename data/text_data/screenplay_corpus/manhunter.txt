EXT. MARATHON, FLORIDA, BEACH - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The highlit aqua water burns out sections of the two men imposed in front of it. The beach is white sand. JACK CRAWFORD -- mid-forties, large -- came down from Washington. His suitcoat over the driftwood log and his rolled-up white sleeves says City, not Florida Keys. WILL GRAHAM -- late thirties -- in a faded Hawaiian number and sun-bleached vio- let shorts, belongs. Graham smokes. Crawford drinks from a glass of iced tea. Then:

PICTURES

If we expected gory crime photos, these are not them. Two snapshots: a woman followed by three children and a duck carrying picnic items up a bank of a pond. A second family behind a birthday cake at a table. They're all smiling.

GRAHAM'S POV: MOLLY + KEVIN

<DIRECTION>
KEVIN -- lanky and tall at eleven -- hunkers down at the water's edge, 50 yards away examining something in the sand. MOLLY -- suntanned, blonde and sensuous at thirty stands watching the two men, her hand on her hip. Waves careen around her ankles. Her body language openly states hostility. It's towards Crawford.

Small poplars line the curb. It rained. The sidewalks are wet. They are drying in splotches. The street is deserted. The front walk vertically bisects the FRAME.

INT. LEEDS HOUSE, KITCHEN - WIDE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three big sliding glass doors. The center one has been re- placed with plywood. It's dark. A flashlight's beam starts playing through the bushes in the side yard, then the light appears and blasts IN the LENS. It lights lots of dishes in the sink. The dark kitchen looks like anybody's kitchen. The house feels occupied. The Leed's possessions have been undisturbed.

WIDER - GRAHAM moves into the room. The bloodstains are extensive. Half the walls look like a monochromatic Jackson Pollock. The mirrors are smashed. Taped outlines on the mattress indi- cate where the bodies had been found. Graham opens the file he carries containing autopsy, lab and crime reports.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVERHEAD ANGLE - GRAHAM

standing alone in the middle of the master bedroom. The crime scene -- the disarray, the big splashes of arterial blood on the walls, the smashed mirrors, taped outlines or bodies -- is a testament to a violence that is pornographic. Graham pulls out a tape recorder and starts dictating his own notes, thumbing through various reports for reference.

We are seeing a videotape transfer of the Leeds family home movie. Mr. Leeds and Mrs. Leeds are behind the table while the youngest boy is in the center. His brother sits next to him. The birthday cake has eleven candles on it. All are mouthing silently: "Happy Birthday to you, happy birth- day to you..." Mrs. Leeds has her arms crossed underneath her breasts. She's a young mother, sensual and warm. She's smiling. The camera must be on a tripod because Mr. Leeds runs into the frame tousles his son's hair and kisses his wife's cheek. He has thinning hair. He's a big man. He looks like a nice guy. He darts out of the frame back to the camera. They finish singing. The youngest Leeds boy blows out the candles. Mr. Leeds holds up for the camera a large yellow envelope that says: "Follow the ribbon." A big yellow ribbon is attached to the envelope.

<DIRECTION>
We hear three locks opening. The door opens. Graham enters. An attendant behind Graham closes the door and we hear the bolts lock again. As Graham is walking towards us, we WIDEN and TRACK IN. It makes the b.g. disorienting as we get closer to Graham's face. The CAMERA DROPS as Graham sits in a single chair. We haven't yet seen what Graham looks at. Now:
</DIRECTION>

GRAHAM'S POV: BARRED CELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A 6x10 cage. In the center of the bars separating Graham from the Occupant is a three-foot-square perspex sheet. The occupant can't get at someone sitting in front of him. In the perspex square is a letter -- passing drawer. In the cell -- laying on his bunk -- is DR. HANNIBAL LECKTOR. He appears to be asleep. His back is to Graham. He has not stirred. Then:

Graham does not answer, If anything happens, there is a tightening of the musculature repressing his reactions to Lecktor.

Another silence. Lecktor's eyes look as if they're drilling into Graham's head, trying to find out things. Trying to find a way to hurt Graham. He's very threatening. Then relaxes:

	Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.

Graham stops at the door before he knocks for the attendant. Then he folds the abridged file tightly into the sliding tray. Lecktor pulls it through.
</DIRECTION>

GRAHAM sits in the chair. He wants a cigarette. He doesn't take one. He waits. And he watches. What he sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRAHAM'S POV: EXTREME CLOSE PAN THROUGH CELL OP DR. LECKTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Toothbrush, mirror, sink, Sryrofoam cups, soft paper jour- nals, T-shirts, neatly stacked hospital pads, sneakers with- no shoelaces, the wall, seatless toilet bowl, etc, etc All the objects are brilliantly lit with sharp bluish light. Their edges are sharper and more defined than normal. The shadows of the bars make hard-edged stripes. It is a high resolution, highly brilliant sec of images. It feels like a hyper-perception of reality, a super-realism perceived by the mind of Graham. It is interrupted when:

<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<LECKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it. Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.

Mrs. Sherman has brown hair. She wears a bikini. She has a nice body. She's sensuous and tan in her thirties. She dives into the pool. The next shot: water. Out of the water surfaces Mrs. Sherman. She shakes her head and water sprays off her hair.

A couple drops hit the lens and diffuse a small area of the image. Mrs. Sherman puts her hands on the side of the pool and shoves down to hoist herself out. Her breasts are glis- tening.

It's the one Lounds took after Graham was slashed by Lecktor. It's a black-and-white square image of a sleeping man with a myriad of tubes running into his stomach and a temporary colostomy bag. A black square is imposed over his genitals. The caption reads: "Federal Manhunter Will Graham Recover- ing from Near-Fatal Slashing By Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecktor."

EXTREMELY CLOSE: SECOND IMAGE OF WILL GRAHAM in newsprint, the one Lounds took at the Chesapeake hospi- tal. The half-tone dots comorising the image are visible.

Dollarhyde crosses to the men's room. After placing the nozzle in the gas tank the ATTENDANT bangs open the hood, draws the dipstick, grabs a can of 10-40, jams the oil spout into the can and sticks the spout into the engine. As he starts to move around the van he sees something in the interior and stops. A smile dawns on his face. We don't know what he sees. He starts wiping the windshield. He wipes and wipes the same spot.
