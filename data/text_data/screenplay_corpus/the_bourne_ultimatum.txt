	Maybe he still will. Maybe he gave it to you because he wants to throw you in the opposite direction of his real plan. I don't know. I just know my number one rule is "the only way to stay safe is to assume the worst." As far as I'm concerned Bourne is a serious threat until proven otherwise.

BOURNE tailing him - trying to close the gap. Dipping down through another riad - through an alley. Up more stairs. Back up onto another roof. He's gained a few metres on DESH.

Desh goes up to the rooftops now. Bourne has him in sight - DESH is prepping his gun with a silencer.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bourne checks the rearview and sees two more agents pour from the elevator lobby, one carrying the serious firepower of an M-4 (an M-16 variant whose bullets can penetrate metal and concrete). They move into position to get a bead on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bourne assesses. But he doesn't move. The agents swarm toward him. What the hell is he doing? Why is he waiting?

EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The agents clear their obstructions and drop their barrels toward Bourne--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But before they can get a bead--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bourne slams the car into reverse again. Petal to the metal in reverse--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The agents open fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bourne ducks the lead slugs ripping through the windshield. But there's no dodging the shower of broken glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Bourne disappears below the dashboard, the CRI agent adjusts his fire into the car's grill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Virtually blind, Bourne races the hard-pressed vehicle backwards as the agent's fire decimates the car's driveline.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bourne slips the car into neutral and takes a quick peek behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steers still speeding but quickly dying car towards a small gap between two parked cars at the edge of the parking structure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bourne's car splits the gap between the parked cars, hits the base of a low angled wall that slams the back of his car up and over the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bourne is pounded as his car jounces onto the wall, a second later the front end seesaws over the top, the sudden angle change exposes for an instant the bottom of Bourne's car, to the shooters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several rounds rip through the floorboard and tear past Bourne's head just before his car drops upside down for 25 feet and slams onto a row of parked cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The impact rips Bourne from the seat and slams him hard against the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bourne struggles out of the car, knowing he has only a moment before the armed agents will fire down into his over- turned car.

<DIRECTION>
Two CRI cars race down from the roof to try to get to the level Bourne's on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- TWO LEVELS BELOW ROOFTOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bourne cuts off a guy cruising for a parking space and pulls him from his car and races away as the agent from the roof lands hard behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bourne's race to the exit is cut off as a 3rd CRI sedan slides into view and it's occupants open fire on Bourne in a head on charge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The just stolen vehicle takes heavy fire as Bourne reacts instantaneously; thumbing on the cruise control, shouldering his door open, and slamming the gas pedal to the floor as he dives out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The agents react as Bourne's sedan torpedoes them head on. Hit hard they're taken out of the fight as metal collapses, glass shatters, and airbags explode.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bourne tumbles to a stop at the rear of a parked car as his car implodes against the oncoming agents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly Bourne is on his feet, moving between the parked cars to engage another CRI sedan traveling parallel to the course of the wrecked one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The agents in this sedan are distracted by the still echoing crash and are caught off-guard as Bourne steps out and points his gun at the driver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver ducks and floors his gas pedal in a desperate effort to save his own life. As the sedan suddenly accelerates, Bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the sedan's front tire and fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and slams into a parked car, pitching the driver violently against the unyielding interior of the sedan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An instant later Bourne rips the radio off the dazed drivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the wreck still echoing through the garage Bourne has to deal with the arrival of the first NYPD sedan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the on edge cop climbs out of his car but Bourne's performance is cut short as the agent running from his drop from the roof, arrives and opens fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as Bourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The increasing volume of squealing tires alerts Bourne to a new threat, he pulls the officer into some cover and grabs the officer's radio.
</DIRECTION>
<BOURNE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pick him up as he jumps into the cops car and guns the engine and heads for the exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRI agents are confused for a second -- until they pick up the NYPD car exiting Port Authority on one of the ramps. But that's all the time Bourne needs--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CROSSTOWN STREET -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bourne turns on his lights and siren and speeds east, followed closely by a CRI sedan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As cars yield to Bourne's siren a taxi tries to jump into Bourne's wake but a CRI sedan punches the taxi back to the right. It ricochets off several parked cars before regaining control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CROSSTOWN STREET -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bourne struggles to keep his over-matched vehicle ahead of the more powerful CRI Sedan which tries to spin Bourne out by hitting his bumper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bourne tacks right quickly and barely avoids a stopped car. The CRI sedan flanking Bourne's slams into the rear of that car, spinning it 180 degrees into the path of the trailing CRI sedan which destroys itself in the resulting collision and blocks the path of the other CRI sedan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOURNE'S CAR -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bourne is home free. He looks around and spots a sign that indicates a right turn and says "To Holland Tunnel / US 95." Bourne turns right--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the window next to his head explodes as two more shots rip through his door to tear a jagged wound into the top of Bourne's leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVEAL Paz, his SUV racing along the curb lane. As Bourne's car crosses in front of a small car stopped at the intersection Paz swerves his car into that car and punches it into the side of Bourne's car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bourne's car is knocked spinning, Paz keeps charging forward and slams into the back of Bourne's car. With his front tires spinning wildly Bourne fights to straighten his car as another CRI sedan appears and tries to box Bourne's car by sliding into his path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANHATTAN STREET -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bourne just manages to punch his car into the right rear of the CRI Sedan and race down the Avenue with Paz and the slightly damaged sedan in pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paz gains on him and Bourne is forced to swerve violently to deny Paz the kill shot he is all too capable of.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just ahead of Bourne, two government SUVs slide into the intersection completely blocking his path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bourne instantly spins his car 180 degrees and continues on, barreling into the roadblock backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Bourne's car plows through the SUV's he whips the wheel and his car spins through a reverse 180 as Paz and the other sedan race through the wreckage in Bourne's wake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paz and the CRI sedan are all over Bourne as he slides a right hand turn onto South St. as Paz and the CRI sedan overwhelm Bourne's battered vehicle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOURNE'S CAR -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On his police radio, Bourne singles out an NYPD officer (call sign Alpha-2503) racing toward the intersection just ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bourne slows, then speeds up quickly to time it right:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CRI car almost hits his bumper, then has to accelerate through the upcoming intersection. As he does, the cop car Bourne was listening to on the radio slams broadside into the CRI sedan drafting the bumper of the mangled cop car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swerving wildly Paz avoids the pileup and slams his heavy SUV into the back of Bourne's car, pushing him into the oncoming traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several cars swerve left and right as Paz pushes Bourne sideways onto the ramped end of a K-Rail dividing the street ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nearly upended car grinds down the K-Rail until the rear of Bourne's car strikes an obstruction which punches it back into the lane as it slams against the front of Paz's SUV, knocking the SUV sideways, into a row of parked cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bourne's car hits parked cars on the other side of the road.
