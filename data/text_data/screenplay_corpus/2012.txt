Gordon gathers his courage and pulls the lever. The plane almost rockets into the air just as the ground beneath them gives way.

They hover for a moment, almost caught in mid-air as the widening crevasse beneath them fights to suck them into the bowels of the earth. Gordon fights to maintain control but they begin to be pulled down.

Like a roller coaster, Gordon manages to weave the little plane through the tumbling high rises.

They dive one last time to evade the plummeting US BANK TOWER, the tallest building on the west coast.

Jackson races the RV alongside the forming crack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spotting a narrow point in the crevasse, he makes a decision. Slamming the accelerator down, he races towards it at full speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moments later the RV is airborne!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate watches, too shocked to scream. A few drawn out seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the RV touches down, crashing 200 feet from the plane.

Kate runs towards the wreckage of the camper. Lilly jumps out, racing into her mom's arms. Jackson turns and sees the cloud approaching.

Back in the RV, Jackson is frantically going through the masses of books and papers on the shelves. Finally, a map. He unfolds it. But it's only of the London underground system.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He throws it to the ground and finds another. This time he's lucky! There are markings everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he races to the door, the ground gives way beneath the RV. Kate and the kids watch it disappear from sight.

The violent ASH CLOUD is hitting their tail rudder. The plane swerves wildly! Gordon gets it back under control.

The speedometer finally creeps towards 200 mph and the CLOUD slowly falls back. Everybody breathes a sigh of relief.

Panicked, Tamara turns and looks around. Down the corridor, in the distance, she sees Adrian, Laura and the rescue crew approaching.

But between them she spots the next chamber door rising quickly.

In a courageous move, Lilly grabs the little dog before he gets crushed and together they fall to the ground.

Back on the other side of the chamber door, Tamara looks around. She is trapped now as the water continues to rush in.

In the debris-filled, murky waters we see that the fuselage of Air Force One has slammed against the first of the ship's launch towers.

Slowly it begins to bend, finally giving way. The other launch towers follow like dominos.

Lin is being held up in the water by his brother and parents.

Back under water, Jackson is using the extension cord of the power drill to pull himself down to the tool cabinet.

To his surprise, a pair of young hands join his on the handle of the crowbar. Noah is alongside him now, helping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Working as father and son, they manage, little by little, to loosen it before finally the drill comes free.
</DIRECTION>

Adrian gives Noah the thumbs up and the boy heads back to the surface. Jackson goes to follow but in the last moment he spots the knapsack containing his laptop.
