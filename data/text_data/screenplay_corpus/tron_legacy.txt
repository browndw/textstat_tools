	It was a fluke. But Flynn worked for years, down here, trying to make it happen again. One day a test went bad. A plasma reaction destroyed this lab. Flynn was reduced to ash.

</SINCLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
Rush views the charred remains in the glass case. Photos of the destroyed lab. Spooky evidence of a hellish death scene.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was never told how he died. It was all just weird, you know, because Flynn's the guy who hired me. But he was strange, kept to himself, I didn't know what job I was supposed to be doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Sinclair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you came onboard, the company woke up, we had a direction. It was kind of pathetic, because by the time Flynn died, everybody was too busy to care.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSH>
<SINCLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was brilliant in his way, but genius without discipline leads to nothing. His reckless habits nearly ruined this company... And for sure got him killed.

<DIRECTION>
A last look at the charred remains of Flynn's machine.
</DIRECTION>
<MEG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That kind of accident can't happen again. We've upgraded the system in ways Flynn never could. The chips didn't exist until now.

</MEG>

She puts the rat in on her shoulder, feeds it a tidbit. Then she scrutinizes Rush.

Meg removes target stage, swings a custom TARGET CHAIR in place. Rush lowers in place. Meg buckles him in. Last chance for a private word:

<MEG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I promise I'll get you back safely by 9AM tomorrow. But you have to promise me something too -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEG>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a piece of work. You dumped me because you said I was too much about the company's needs and not enough about yours. Well here we are, the company needs their best guy, and you just can't admit how much to hurts to nominate me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSH>
<MEG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This bigger than us, Rush. Listen to me. I don't know what you're going to find in there, but whatever it is, promise you'll follow your heart and do the right thing.

Rush stares at here, in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>

Meg breaks away, retreating to the controls with Sinclair. Rush's trails her with his eyes - he can't stop looking.

Meg worries. Moves for the "abort" button.

<DIRECTION>
Shimmering bits morph into an awesome cyberscape.

Rush enters this bizarre world - CRASH/FLASH - stranger in a strange land. Data energy ZAPS off his body, interacting with the landscape circuitry around him. He fights it, tries to control it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush stands, beholds the place. Looks at his hands and arms, clad in circuitry. He finds he had landed outside:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fortress-like X-NET CENTRAL SERVER. ALARMS SOUNDING inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns, looks up a FIREWALL. Hundreds of X-Takk Troops hurry to look down. FIRING WEAPONS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FIGURE comes at him, down the wall, STREAKING RED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAMMO!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRON lands on a plateau above Rush, gazing down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They face each other, equally perplexed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush is no longer human, but not quite a program either. Energy zaps off his body, infusing the surrounding circuitry.

Tron stares, unblinking - Cyber-Ninja.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's YOU! The intruder!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSH>
<DIRECTION>
Rush's body circuits PULSE with anger - data surges out his feet, across floor circuitry, up to the plateau. Energy interacts with Tron's body circuits, siphoning off bits of code.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Code races across Rush's eyes. Identification data.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are... TRON?!?
	</DIALOGUE>

X-Takks hustle onto the scene.

Tron leaps off the plateau, cutting the data connection. He whips his disk off his back and THROWS.

Disk SLAMS Rush in the gut, knocks him flat.

Plexor activates memory banks. Accesses archive files of the original low-rez Tron: So harmless, so many years ago. Bears little resemblance to the upgraded Tron.

	You are in error. Zero match.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLEXOR>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. That's how he's getting past you. You don't see him for what he is. He's one of your own, gone bad. Tron was a crude security program from Encom's old days. Strictly low-rez, right? Archived and forgotten. But his source code contains all the architecture of every Encom system, including X-net. That's why some smart User dusted him off and upgraded him -

MASSIVE ROMBALL (data reformatting orb) hurtles around the I/O Port, ZAPPING all it touches, de-rezzing data structures into neutral gray "blank matter".

ROMBALL loops skyward.

ROMBALL misses them, but BLAZES DOWN two more I/O Ports. D- rezz retrieves ROMBALL, bears down on Mega and Krod.

Rush runs, LEAPS on D-Rezz's back. Like riding a gorilla -

D-Rezz flips Rush to the ground, pins him with one mighty hand, raises his ROMBALL for the kill.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm X-Net too!

Data flows from Rush's body, up D-Rezz's clamping arm. Radiant energy between predator and prey.

<DIRECTION>
Digits race in D-rezz's eyes. A code unlocks. He looks down, finally registering the X-Net markings on Rush's outfit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D-Rezz lets go of Rush, slumps back on his haunches. Lowers his head in shame.

EXT. GAME PORTAL OUTPOST

<DIRECTION>
Obsolete, abandoned computer game entry portal, guarding entry to the old game grid beyond. An electro-tech carnival zone gone dark. No life in sight... Then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beam of DATA ENERGY sling-shots at ground level, solidifying to become:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A slender, jumpy Program called I-BEEM. He wears the X-Net logo and a cracked disk on his back. He's highly unstable and way unplugged from the system (like one of those Japanese soldiers still fighting alone in the hills 10 years after WWII was over).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I-Beem sees something - he PANICS, zapping away in characteristic streaks of airborne data. He reassembles in a hiding place, skittish, observing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush, Mega, Krod and D-Rezz arrive. See GIANT PILE of GAME VEHICLE PARTS blocking access to the grid.

D-rezz retrieves Romball for another whack -

</KROD>
<DIRECTION>
D-Rezz raises his Romball to pulverize I-Beem.

I-Beem freaks, ZAPS away in his data beam as Romball crashes down. I-Beem reforms further way, then beside them - He snatches his pancake disk, the zaps away again, emerging then high on the pile of parts.

D-rezz cocks Romball. I-Beem freaks, sling-shots all over the place via his data beam, tossing his wobbly disk.

Rush catches I-Beem's disk. Holds off D-Rezz.

I-Beem stiffens, reflexively vigilant. He scans the four of them again, finally softening. He zaps to a wall near his giant barrier, then proudly pushes aside a thin panel. Beyond a corridor of game gear, view expanses to reveal:

Rush kneels, touches grid lines. Circuits energize, as his energy surges in all directions. He draws in data.

D-rezz grips Romball, grunts affirmation. He and I-beem head for the perimeter of the grid.

	If this is Tron's territory, he'll know we're here. He'll hide.

A nod between Rush and Rush - they TAKE OFF.

Mega screams and clutches Rush, throwing her body against his, clamping her arms around him.

Krod and Rush turn 90 degrees, rallying, passing each other, getting warmed up. It's familiar territory.

Light cycles race toward each other on the same line.

Mega holds Rush tight, eyes filling with terror.

<MEGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Resource conflict! Fatal crash imminent!

Glowing code numbers mark the end of each grid line.

D-rezz grunts, points. One lights up "Tr165444.018"

They follow the line off the grid, where it leads into a narrow rocky pass.

SPECK moves on the horizon, turns a corner, stays on the horizon. Another corner. It's a light cycle, making a huge box around them.

<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember the plan, Krod. Don't bail out until the last millisecond.

Approaching cycle comes at 90 degree angle, turns hard, closes the distance.

It's TRON. Heartless eyes, ruthless moves.

Rush turns quick, baiting Tron. Tron turns to follow, coming alongside.

Krod runs interference, cuts sharp in front of Tron.

It's a high-stakes speed-chase, narrowly missing side walls and rock outcroppings.

He zaps back to the edge, signals upward. D-rezz straddles the rock passage above, ready to hurl his Romball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GAME GRID

<DIRECTION>
Tron takes the lead in a three-way heat. Revs to breath- taking speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush and Krod gain, coming up on either side of Tron.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tron looks to each opponent. His eyes lock on Mega.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mega stares into Tron's cold eyes, almost like she's trying to signal him. But Tron returns his gaze forward, as the ROCKY EDGE looms closer.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wuss! You call that speed!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSH>
<DIRECTION>
Rush kicks in a hyper-burner, surging forward. Krod does the same. Tron responds with more speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush and Krod have Tron sandwiched, heading for the rock edge. Tron pulls ahead, aiming for the hidden crevasse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mega worries. Clings to Rush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EDGE OF GAME GRID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D-rezz, astride the crevasse, sees light cycles speeding his way. He's got the Rom-ball poised to intercept Tron.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I-beem de-rezzes into the grid, clearing the path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush and Krod taunt Tron into the trap...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But, out of nowhere, Mega reaches to Rush's handlebars and turns 90 degrees too soon.
</DIRECTION>
<KROD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, what are you - ??
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROD>
<DIRECTION>
Tron sees the bail-out, knows something's wrong. He looks ahead, sees D-rezz astride his crevasse escape root, rom- ball poised in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tron bails out 90 degrees, cutting behind Krod. Krod turns twice, ending up in Tron's lane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To the side, Rush's light cycle screams toward solid rock, vibrating out of control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush grabs Mega and JUMPS OFF. They slide on the grid, holding each other.

Krod's lightcycle heads for the rock escape passage.

</I_BEEM>
<DIRECTION>
D-rezz makes mental switch, hurls Romball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Romball bounces down solid rock, onto game grid, rolls with ferocious speed, DIAGONALLY across the grid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Romball curves to track Tron - like a great bowling shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Romball clips rear wheel of Tron's lightcycle. Lightcycle vaporizes. Tron skids and tumbles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I-beem zaps beside Rush and Mega. Krod and D-rezz join them.

<KROD>
	<DIALOGUE>

WHOOSH! Electro-fire Romball careens across grid, bearing down on them.

Krod turns to head home.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop. Listen to me. You might not believe there's a world outside of this one, but let's just say a guy named Sinclair is depending on me. If Tron got through here, then I can too. Who's with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSH>
<DIRECTION>
D-rezz steps forward, then I-Beem. Shamed, Krod joins them. Finally, Mega makes it unanimous.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. I-beem, take D-rezz, see what's up ahead. We'll guard this portal until you come back.
	</DIALOGUE>

I-beem and D-rezz buddy up and depart on a recon mission.

<KROD>
	<DIALOGUE>

</KROD>
<DIRECTION>
Rush pulls the disk off his own back. He throws - disk flies wild - he runs to retrieve it.
</DIRECTION>

Mega retreats to a side area, partially eroded by memory leakage. She finds the remnants of COM CIRCUITRY and stares data beams into its transducer.

<PLEXOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Random One has proven effective?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLEXOR>
<MEGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is all glitches and bad data. He virtually got us de-rezzed. I recommend we terminate this mission.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEGA>
<DIRECTION>
Rush listens, hurt and angry.
</DIRECTION>
<PLEXOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Proceed. If you keep Tron on the run, he cannot attack X-Net.

</PLEXOR>
<MEGA>

Circuits go dark. Mega turns, running smack into:

	I act as Plexor programs me.
	</DIALOGUE>

</MEGA>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First, you don't want to come with me, then you're all over me on the light cycle - so you can dump us over and blow the plan. We would have nailed Tron by now if it wasn't for you. What's your malfunction?

</RUSH>
<MEGA>

Angry silence. Eyes locked.

<MEGA>

</MEGA>
<DIRECTION>
She moves to exit past him. He snags her arm, pulls her back and KISSES HER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Energy ZAPS between them, racing through their body circuits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush downloads the spiky sensation. Mega remains cold and bewildered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, Krod tosses his disk, moving to track as it arcs through the air. He notices Rush and Mega kissing. Digs it vicariously.
</DIRECTION>
<KROD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ram hog!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROD>
<DIRECTION>
His disk clunks him on the head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mega breaks the kiss, backing off, conflicted. Arcs of energy stretch between them, then snap loose.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's what I'm programmed to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSH>
<DIRECTION>
Mega tries to ignore the kiss. She exits past the guys.
</DIRECTION>
<KROD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What were you doing with her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROD>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush, Mega, Krod follow I-beem along narrow paths of unaffected material.

<DIRECTION>
Krod trips, his LIGHT WAND tumbles and skates into memory leakage. It FRIES and de-rezzes, sucked into the molten silicon swamp.
</DIRECTION>
<D_REZZ>

	Akakakaka - Agggggggg -

</D_REZZ>
<DIRECTION>
Sounds like a modem, but it's a BATTLE-CRY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush comes to a point above - and cut off from - the fight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D-rezz advances along a narrow gantry, spinning his Romball, ready to hurl at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tron flips over memory leakage, gains position and throws his disk -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Disk HITS D-rezz. Plasma-ball GASH, but D-rezz is tough. He takes the damage, cocks his Romball -
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guys! Go around - behind Tron!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSH>
<DIRECTION>
Rush darts down to help D-rezz. Mega, Rush hurry ahead. I- beem zaps, zags and reforms, scared out of his mind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D-rezz hurls his Romball -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Romball pings off two walls, comes at Tron from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tron spins - milliseconds to spare - and flips clear. Retrieves his disk on the way down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Romball slams off a wall, heads back to D-rezz, but Tron's disk HITS IT, knocking it off course.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D-rezz dives for ROMBALL - but it falls into the memory leak and FRIES TO BITS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tron plants for a clear shot at D-rezz.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush JUMPS down from above, right in front of D-rezz.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ouch!

<DIRECTION>
His ankle. He straightens, standing in front of D-rezz.

Lays eyes on Tron.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Pick on somebody your own size!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSH>
<DIRECTION>
D-rezz is twice as big as either of them.

Tron's eyes are cold, lifeless, calculating. Scanning his new opponent without success.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got no data on me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSH>
<DIRECTION>
Rush pulls his disk off his back, poised for a duel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tron moves with calculation, grips his hyper-etched disk. Circling his prey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Throws again -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRRANGG -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush DUCKS -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tron's disk slams D-rezz. D-rezz tries to catch the disk, but he's just too slow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush throws his disk. Beginner's luck - it banks off a wall and nearly smacks Tron. Rush snags it on the way back, before it tumbles into memory leakage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tron jumps up two levels. Retrieves his disk.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	D-rezz, pull me up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSH>
<DIRECTION>
D-rezz hoists Rush up. Fingers grab upper deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tron jockeys for position. Throws disk -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Disk strikes D-rezz in the ribs. Blast damage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D-rezz loses footing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush grabs upper level.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D-rezz slips toward memory leakage.
</DIRECTION>

Rush grabs D-rezz's hand - he weighs a ton.

Mega, Krod and I-beem can't get here to help -
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>

	Hang on, man! HANG ON!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSH>
<DIRECTION>
But D-rezz's big hand slips out of Rush's.

D-rezz PLUMMETS into memory leakage, zapping away in a blaze of glory -
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NOOOO!

He comes to his feet, facing Tron. Determined.

</RUSH>
<DIRECTION>
Tron throws his disk.

Rush dodges. He sends waves of data energy through floor circuits, reaching into Tron's body.

<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>

Tron FLIPS away, breaking contact with floor. Data transfer stops. Tron steals away through a tunnel.

Rush sends data coursing into floor circuits. It radiates up walls, across bridges... And finds TRON in hiding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Data races into Tron's body. Six code numbers engage; he glitches. He LEAPS to breaks the contact, flinging his disk -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tron's disk SLAMS Rush. Rush tumbles off a ledge, dangling over a memory leak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tron pounces in. Snags his disk.

Tron steps on Rush's hand. Pain energy jolts Rush's circuits.

Tron throws his disk for a final time. It arcs wide, coming around directly at Rush.

Tron leans down, gazing into Rush's eyes.

<DIRECTION>
Burst of SEARING DATA surges off Rush's hands, radiating up circuitry, loading into Tron's body. All nine code numbers LOCK in.

Tron's body seizes. He fights the data intrusion, but his circuits sequentially SHUT DOWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tron's airborne disk wobbles and darkens.
</DIRECTION>

Tron tumbles off the edge, plummets past Rush.

	I hired Sinclair as Encom's business guy, so I could do the dreaming. Right off, he wanted to "capture the market" on data transmission. Had this plan called "X-Net", based on flawless efficiency, hyperlock security, encryption protocol uniformity. Blah blah. I was the boss, I told him to forget it. I knew it could go bad. But the guy had trouble taking no for an answer. He arranged for my lab to melt down. Sinclair took over my company and put X-Net on a fast-track. And here's where it's brought us.

Rush LEAPS at Plexor.

	Awesome, dude! Don't let go!

<DIRECTION>
Rush looks at his arms, astounded. His circuitry strobes in hues of brilliant red. Disk animates and unfolds, revealing infinite surface variations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush feels new power surging inside his body. His eyes harden, keen like Tron's. Rush LEAPS BACKWARD, goes airborne, lands on a ledge high above. Amazing balance.

Disk rockets across the landscape, a mile away and STRIKES an X-NET SURVEY POST, blasting it to bits. Disk arcs high, shoots back toward Rush.

Rush looks worried for a second, ready to duck -
</DIRECTION>
<FLYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't flinch, Rush! It's your disk now.

Disk snaps back into Rush's hand, painlessly. Throbbing with energy.

Rush pulls a new LIGHT WAND from a thigh bracket. It extends into a hundred-foot vaulting pole. Rush VAULTS across the canyon, lands with precision. Light pole retracts into the wand in a nanosecond.

Cybavor leaps like a hyena, bounds the length of the hall. DIVES at the Worker Drone...

Energy sparks fly, circuits zap, as the Cybavor digest the energy, GROWS LARGER, then SPLITS DOWN THE MIDDLE (like DNA), then regrows the missing halves.

X-Takk Soldier is grazed, stumbles into ENERGY COLUMN. RING rakes down and ZAPS him nasty - reducing him to bits, sucking his energy to the levels below.

Mega's disk crashes silicon, comes at Plexor - But his defense field repels it. He slams it aside and it's raked away by downward flowing energy rings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush DIVES at PLEXOR. He's like a statue. But this time RUSH holds him and infuses tron-energy, breaking down Plexor's defense field, eating into his body circuits. It's fractal zapping fireworks - evenly matched foes battling face-to- face.

<DIRECTION>
Rush ducks forward, SHOOTS his disk off his back, smacking Plexor in the throat. Mega falls clear -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush hurls Plexor against energy rings - Energy rakes down his body, but he fights the effects an DOES NOT MELT DOWN. He step away, shakes off the damage, retrieves his disk into a hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mega snags the hologon -
</DIRECTION>
<MEGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	RUSH!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEGA>
<DIRECTION>
She tosses it to Rush, who's already airborne -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush catches hologon, sails to the control unit -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jams hologon into its receptacle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plexor cocks his death disk, EYES FLASH ELECTRO-PSYCHOSIS -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hologon REACTS with CENTRAL CELL -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shockwaves RADIATE -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Energy rings go dim, then dark -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silicon shatters to ash -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
X-Takks power down. X-Net armor de-rezzes, leaving innocent civilian Programs. They shake off the mind-control and rise unshackled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Plexor, like all things X-Net, chatters and glitches. His code erodes, his bits darken, the fiber of his being erodes from inside.
</DIRECTION>
<MEGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now who's obsolete?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEGA>
<DIRECTION>
Rush executes a final leap, extending his feet for the final blow, straight at Plexor - CRASH - shattering him to bits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush finally breathes. Sees I-beem, Krod, Quantz, Boole, Code Monkeys.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSH>
<KROD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll never let you forget it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROD>
<DIRECTION>
Boole tosses Rush his tron-disk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CYBERSPACE VISTA POINT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush, Mega, Krod, I-beem, Fighters and liberated Programs stow disks and step to a high vantage point.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before them expands a vista of cyberspace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Power-down of X-Net radiates in all directions, leaving everything else intact. Beautiful, exotic old data networks instantly begin to regenerate into the open space.
</DIRECTION>
<MEGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're free. At last we're free.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEGA>

EXT. X-NET GRAND OPENING CEREMONY - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sinclair commands the podium:
</DIRECTION>
<SINCLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a world exposed to increasing data corruption, I hereby switch on the first global network offering 100% guaranteed data security. Flawless performance, zero downtime. The world works hard, the world deserves...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINCLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
He throws a switch. HUGE monitors blaze with X-Net logos and graphic portals. Countdown 3,2,1...
</DIRECTION>
<SINCLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	X-NET!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINCLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
CROWD CHEERS. MEDIA BUZZES...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
X-Net instantly CRASHES. All screens jam, glitch and DIE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crowd is stunned. Sinclair is mortified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CYBERSPACE VISTA POINT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Krod, I-beem, Boole, Quantz and Code Monkeys CHEER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mega embraces Rush. Energy sizzles between them.
</DIRECTION>
<MEGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I underestimated you. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEGA>
<DIRECTION>
She presses her lips to his. It's electric.
</DIRECTION>
<KROD>
<DIRECTION>
(to I-beem)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You knew she always liked him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROD>
<CODE_MONK_B3T>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she pinging his EPROM?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CODE_MONK_B3T>
<CODE_MONK_J2R>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't see from here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CODE_MONK_J2R>
<DIRECTION>
But out of triumph, a sudden concern -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush's body shoots DATA ENERGY into Mega, into ground circuits... Lightshow overload intensifies and spreads. Mega backs away in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa, ouch, what? Ahhhhh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSH>
<MEGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rush, what is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEGA>
<DIRECTION>
Rush's body DRAINS AWAY into the energized circuitry.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guys! Mega! NOOO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSH>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches a hand to Mega. PAIN ENERGY ZAPS her, but she clasps his hand anyway...
</DIRECTION>
<KROD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROD>
<DIRECTION>
Code Monkeys attempt desperate measures, but soon it's over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bits of Rush dissipate into surrounding circuitry, then BEAM SKYWARD in blazing curtain, like a quantum aurora borealis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mega is left with a handful of nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<QUANTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the way it should be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUANTZ>
<BOOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's going back to the place he belongs.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. CYBERSPACE TRANSITION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush's energy body hurls across cyberspace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bits streak, light bends -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ENCOM ADVANCED RESEARCH LAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush materializes in the target chair. Human flesh, real clothes. Same as the moment he left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He bolts up, realizes where he is. Looks at his hands. Sees Jo-jo the rat staring at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meg and Dewey hurry over to unstrap Rush. Meg holds his hands, checks the integrity of his body.
</DIRECTION>
<MEG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rush. You made it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEG>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like a bad cold, I'm always coming back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSH>
<VOICES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He made it! Rush! You okay?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICES>
<DIRECTION>
Rush looks around. Miles ("Krod") and a group of oddly- familiar Co-WORKERS. People who look just like I-beem, Quantz, Boole and the Code Monkeys.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>
<DIRECTION>
(double-takes on Meg)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I met a program you wrote. She's just as incredibly beautiful and confusing as you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSH>
<MEG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. Mega told me all about what you did in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEG>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She gave you my coordinates. That's how you uploaded me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSH>
<MEG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Your coordinates... and his.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEG>
<DIRECTION>
They look across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the control console stands a MAN with his back to us. He's curiously examining Meg's equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's done an amazing job here, Rush.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He turns. It's FLYNN. In the flesh. Leg healed.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flynn!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSH>
<FLYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you to trust the bigger plan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLYNN>
<MEG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd come to suspect Flynn was alive, inside. But I had no way to know for sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEG>
<FLYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You picked the right guy to send in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLYNN>
<MEG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Working down here, I became convinced someone tried to murder Flynn. But the only person I could confide in was the guy I suspected most.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEG>
<DIRECTION>
Elevator opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sinclair charges in, furious. Trailed by SECURITY MEN.
</DIRECTION>
<SINCLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you people doing down here!?! Get back to work! X-Net has CRASHED! We'll all be ruined!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINCLAIR>
<FLYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Speak for yourself, Sinclair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Sinclair wheels to see Flynn: Alive, standing in front of him. Trapped by the ugly truth, Sinclair turns rage on Meg.
</DIRECTION>
<SINCLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ordered you to destroy this equipment!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINCLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
Rush gets in Sinclair's face.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, jerk, she doesn't do your dirty work. Neither do I. Not anymore. You lied to me, to all of us. You want to deal with somebody? I'm the guy who crashed X-Net.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSH>
<DIRECTION>
Sinclair goes for Rush. Rush delivers a solid punch. Sinclair grabs his bloody nose.
</DIRECTION>
<SINCLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're fired, everybody get out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINCLAIR>
<FLYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Sinclair. I'm back. And I'm the boss again. You're fired. Not only are you fired, you're going to have a lot of explaining to do to the SEC, the Justice Department and the FBI.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to SECURITY MEN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold him until the police get here.

SECURITY MEN haul out Sinclair.

<DIRECTION>
Flynn addresses the group.
</DIRECTION>
<FLYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	X-Net is dead. But Encom lives. We're going to bring this company back to its place as the leader in finding the next big thing. I'll need to be free to do the dreaming. So, effective immediately, I'm appointing two bold, bright, courageous people to head worldwide operations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLYNN>
<DIRECTION>
He presents Rush and Meg. They're stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<FLYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You both earned it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLYNN>
<RUSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cool.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You get a division to run.

(to Phlegman)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does that mean a bigger cubicle?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Cheers all around. Flynn approaches Rush and Meg.
</DIRECTION>
<FLYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put on some coffee. You two are going to be putting in a lot of overtime together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Meg turns to Rush.
</DIRECTION>
<MEG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you remember how, along time ago, you used to give me a professional congratulatory peck on the cheek?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEG>
<DIRECTION>
Rush goes for the lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
