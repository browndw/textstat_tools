It's a bright, clear Los Angeles Saturday afternoon. Celeste and Jesse, now 30, both sing along to "Love Rhino," the song heard under the montage. Jesse drives while Celeste is on her Blackberry. Jesse, boyishly handsome, wears an old tee and a hooded sweatshirt. Celeste is wearing all black workout gear. She is always wearing all black.

</CELESTE>
<DIRECTION>
While Celeste is dictating, Jesse is getting bored. He starts looking through the middle console. He finds something. A melted tube of Chapstick. Ew. Ooh, a cigarette. Jesse lights the cigarette, takes a drag. Celeste looks at Jesse and signals to him, "Can I have a drag?"
</DIRECTION>
<CELESTE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Uhhh, things like Voodoo, casual wear and cookbooks will see a huge spike in the market.

Jesse is now checking out nose hairs in the visor mirror. He then looks at his teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does this tooth look dark?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Celeste just glares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Call me back if they need more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse looks at his tooth again in the rearview mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like a little darker than the rest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Celeste waves her hand to quiet Jesse.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't you just sit still for two minutes? And we talked about this, no more smoking!

	I think it's beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>

A beat passes. Then, Jesse pulls over.
</DIRECTION>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing? Why are you stopping?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, your appointment is not until noon and this is that place with the deadstock vintage Italian fabric. I thought it would be good for the guest room windows.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Celeste is truly touched by the gesture.
</DIRECTION>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh wow...you are so thoughtful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>

Jesse smiles, proud of himself.

Celeste sits quietly while Jesse is on his call.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? I just...don't know what to say. Thank you so much for calling me.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you get the job??
	</DIALOGUE>

Jesse signals with his finger, "one minute."
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sometimes things are just meant to work out.

</CELESTE>
<JESSE>

about the Slate job you interviewed for.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah. No. They haven't called
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
yet. But if they don't think I'm the right artist to illustrate the book, then it's not the right job for me. You know what I mean?
</DIRECTION>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I absolutely do, yes. You are a
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
wonderful artist. But at some point, you will show the world that one day...right?
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, can I drop you at home now?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Because I just missed a wave.

INT. LITTLE DOM'S-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Celeste and Jesse are on double date with BETH, 30, petite, and full of energy and TUCKER, 31, preppy in an indy way. These are their best friends from college. They're engaged.
</DIRECTION>
<TUCKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you end up going to see that band at Spaceland last week?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUCKER>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, The Injured Saint? Yeah, dude. They are real. You know what? They should be your wedding band. They're loud but they're affordable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They opened for Darcy Fudged His Knickers. Now, they're amazing. You'd be lucky to book them for your wedding. Or you should see if Emergency Breakthrough is available. The horn section is tight.

Celeste looks over the menu. Celeste and Jesse's next interaction is said with heavy, really bad German accents, which is hilarious--only to them.

<DIRECTION>
Celeste and Jesse giggle at their stupid inside joke for a little too long. Then, there is a deafening lull in the conversation. Beth is buttering a piece of bread. She loudly drops the knife on her plate and buries her head in her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do this. I just can't.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Celeste drives and Jesse is in the passenger seat. He has a tube of Vaseline Lip Therapy. He is stroking it rapidly as if it were a penis. This is not the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C, look...uhhhh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Celeste looks at him. She joins in. She reaches over and pushes in on the tube. Vaseline comes out of the top. This looks a lot like a penis ejaculating.
</DIRECTION>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahhhhh! Oh god!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<DIRECTION>
They both erupt in laughter. Even though this is the thousandth time they've done this stupid joke, it will always be funny. To them.

	No, of course not. You're my best friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah you too. I mean, we can't not hang out. The last time we didn't talk for longer than a week was in 10th grade when you went to Space Camp Canada.

INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE-MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Celeste's morning symphony is under way. She sits in front of a bowl of oatmeal, a bowl of berries, a cup of coffee, 4 neatly stacked newspapers, her laptop and the television tuned to CNN. She methodically eats, sips her coffee, reads the paper, watches TV, and surfs the internet. She is clearly a culture vulture. Jesse walks by outside his studio and does the "C and J" sign to Celeste. She does it back instinctively. Is it weird that we hang out so much? She shakes it off and titters. She's being ridiculous; it's fine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COFFEE BEAN- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Celeste walks in, dressed impeccably. Again, in all black. She is in a rush, on her Blackberry, bombarded with a hefty pre-work crowd. People are in some semblance of a line, waiting to order.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Celeste spots a man in a business suit, taking advantage of the confusion and cutting in front of a woman at the head of the line. He orders.
</DIRECTION>
<BUSINESS_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Large coffee, please.

Other people in line are now paying attention. Celeste wants to let it go, but she can't.

The studio is beautifully, magically chaotic. There are large canvasses everywhere, paint rags, spray cans, common household items turned into sculptures (buttons, clothespin, hangers) and mobiles. Celeste walks in. Jesse is on a mattress on the floor, he's clearly been sitting there for a while. He is fist-deep in a huge bag of Cheetos and he's watching the 2008 Beijing Olympics on Tivo. He is watching a short feature about Olympian Matthias Steiner, a gold medalist in weight lifting.

INT. CELESTE'S BEDROOM- NIGHT

Celeste is in bed on the computer. She hears noise from the outside. She listens more intently and hears Jesse... and a woman, giggling and talking loudly. Then, the studio door shuts. Is Yogurt Girl sleeping over? He wouldn't do that. Would he?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CELESTE'S GARDEN- NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again, with the morning symphony. Celeste drinks coffee, eats breakfast, surfs the internet and flips through magazines. This time, she's also listening to a song from Riley Banks' new album. It's exactly what she thought it would be. Overproduced, auto-tuned and meaningless. She nods her head, "yeah, I get it." She turns it off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Celeste can't stop herself from constantly looking over at the studio to see if Yogurt Girl is still in there. Finally, a sleeping Jesse stirs for a minute and changes position. He is alone. Phew.

Celeste and Jesse cuddle in a sleeping bag, fighting off the cold. Celeste and Jesse take cover in a torrential New York City rain. They stand under an awning and she smiles as she runs her hand through his wet hair. Celeste is abruptly shaken out of her memories by a giant Chewbacca hugging her before she has a chance to stop him.

	But the truth is, I would go anywhere for Beth. She's my best friend. And I'm so happy for her. Senior year of college, we had a tradition. Every Sunday, come rain or shine, Beth and Tucker would meet me and Jesse at the Bishop with a 12-pack of Miller High Life, the champagne of beers, and we would meet to talk about what was important in the world, you know, Heidegger's influence on hip-hop. Or the feminist duality on "Melrose Place." Life's big questions. Beth and Tucker were just friends then but there was always something there. Just an ease they had with each other. Jesse and I spent years trying to get them together, unsuccessfully. But we all remained friends and watched as Tucker dated the most slutty, vacuous and vile girls on the planet. For five long years.

Tucker flinches.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Um...Jesse and I are getting a divorce. So that's...yeah, our timing was not as good, I guess. Beth and Tucker, you are lucky to be best friends. Work hard and respect that. It doesn't come easily. Be patient, don't always think you're right. And if you are, it doesn't fucking matter anyway. Fight for it, everyday, I wish I had.

INSERT of Tucker dancing on the dance floor. It's unexplainable. It's shocking how terrible it is.

<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I actually found it digging through your trash.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ohhh, I see. All right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<DIRECTION>
They've broken the tension. But it's still silent. Then Jesse chortles. It sounds like a baby pig. It makes Celeste laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, both Celeste and Jesse are silently cracking up, doubled over as their lawyers sit there, watching them, perplexed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STEIN, WEINBERG, STEINBERG & JIMENEZ LAW FIRM - A LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Celeste and Jesse walk out of the building.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So...we're divorced!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
They high five. What are you supposed to do when you get divorced.
</DIRECTION>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We did it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna walk for a couple minutes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.

EXT. LACMA- SUNDOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Celeste and Jesse are now approaching the front of "Urban Light," the installation from the beginning of the movie. The street lamps are now illuminated. She takes a seat on a step. Jesse sits next to her. She refers to the lamps:
</DIRECTION>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you hated them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, I've never seen them at night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse looks at the lamps and takes them in. He looks pretty sad.
</DIRECTION>
<CELESTE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's up with you? I know we just got divorced but no one died, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just feeling like maybe you were right. I am a fuck up. I don't know what I'm doing. My girlfriend left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
There is a long pause.
</DIRECTION>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Veronica? Left where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Left me. She wanted me to tell her everything was gonna be okay and I couldn't. I don't know why but I just...couldn't. She wants to go back to Brussels.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Another monumental pause. Jesse's eyes start tearing up.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, you can say it now. You were right, I blew it. Just say it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey...don't do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are not a loser. You never were. You took a chance. I admire that and I believe in you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do. And I want to thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For never being the person I wanted you to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you're welcome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go get her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I don't know if everything is gonna be all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, who does? Do you love her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse looks at Celeste.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it's worth fighting for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Celeste smiles with tears in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, I finally understand why you fucking cry all the time. Shit is emotional.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<DIRECTION>
They share a laugh. Then, they sit in silence for a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<CELESTE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You deserve to be happy. And I wish that for you, always.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So...I guess we were right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Celeste makes the "C and J" hand gesture from the high school photo in the opening montage. Jesse makes it back. They smile.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her on the lips. For the last time. And then, he's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<DIRECTION>
Celeste sits awhile and looks up at the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CELESTE'S PRIUS- NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Celeste drives and dials a number on her bluetooth.
</DIRECTION>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. So, you're probably giving your card to some girl in yoga right now. But if that doesn't work out for you...I think I may be ready. To beat you in Scrabble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GAS STATION- A MOMENT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Celeste runs in to pay for gas. She is on her Blackberry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GAS STATION MART
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Celeste stands in line with some gum and water. A young man blatantly cuts in front of her with a gallon of water. Old Celeste returns for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<DIRECTION>
The young man turns around. Celeste realizes she's no longer this person. She restrains herself.
</DIRECTION>
<CELESTE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<DIRECTION>
Celeste takes in how she has changed. She smiles a little. The young man turns back to her.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I'm sorry for cutting. My dog's in the car and he's really thirsty. So, thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles again. The world feels bigger now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
