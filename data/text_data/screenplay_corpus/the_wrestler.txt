----"Oh, my! Ram hit with a devastating piledriver!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
----"I've never seen a guy get fired into a buckle that hard!"

Present day. Post-match. Randy, pushing 50, still with the same long, dyed-blond mane, sits on a bench in the boys locker room of a Wilmington, Delaware high school.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHYRON: 20 YEARS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls off his purple spandex wrestling tights. Lime-green ram's horns run up the sides. They're the same kind of tights as in the `80s pics----and may well be the actual same pair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Naked except for a jockstrap, Randy takes a breath. Achy, sweaty, saggy, exhausted. A battered warrior. Scars all over his body. Despite the rough shape he's in, it's clear he's just given it his all in the ring. He swigs down a few pills with a beer.

Randy nods, a bit uncomfortably. The two fans, muttering thanks, drift off into the Delaware night. Randy is left standing alone, still holding Fan #1's pen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over to a beat-up old CONVERSION VAN and climbs in. Turns on the engine. Music starts up on the stereo mid-song.

Psyched "Yeah!"s from the meatheads. Stephanie is pissed at the interruption. And, even more, Randy's embrace of it.

</MEATHEAD_1>
<RANDY>

The two meatheads flank Randy, their arms around his broad shoulders. Meathead #1 looks tentatively at Stephanie, holding up his DIGITAL CAMERA.

<MEATHEAD_1>

<DIRECTION>
She coldly takes it.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problemo.

</STEPHANIE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks into the camera. The meatheads stick their tongues out and throw up devil signs. Randy flexes theatrically, making his best "Aaargh!" wrestling face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephanie snaps a shot. Meathead #1 takes back his camera. He and his buddy pat Randy heartily on the back.

<MEATHEAD_1>

HARD CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE RING - SHORT TIME LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy SMASHING KID LOCO IN THE FACE with a flying drop-kick. Kid Loco falls to the canvas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy struts around the ring, exhorting the crowd, soaking up their cheers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Distracted, Randy doesn't notice Kid Loco peeling himself off the mat. Kid Loco sneaks up behind Randy and SMASHES HIM IN THE HEAD. Randy goes down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kid Loco lifts Randy up. They're both on their knees, chest- to-chest. Kid Loco steps to his feet, lifting Randy with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kid Loco tightens around Randy's arms, arches his back, presses out his chest and... WHAM!! He and Randy fly with a LATERAL DROP. Randy's head hits the canvas hard as he slams down on his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Randy writhes on the mat, Kid Loco HEADS FOR THE TURNBUCKLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RANDY'S POV: Kid Loco is untying the turnbuckle's padded cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy, clutching his back, discretely reaches into the waistband of his tights and pulls out a RAZOR BLADE. He tucks the blade between two fingers in his cupped palm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kid Loco heads back to Randy. He picks up him by the hair and drags him to the turnbuckle, throwing him HEAD-FIRST into the exposed metal post beneath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy, clutching his smashed head, discretely runs the blade along his hairline. No one sees it happen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLOOD STREAMS DOWN Randy's forehead. The crowd's ELECTRIFIED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kid Loco slams Randy's head into the metal post again. Again. Randy slumps over the corner ropes. Kid Loco cockily struts around the ring.
</DIRECTION>
<KID_LOCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at this loser! How pathetic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID_LOCO>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON Randy. The taunting stirs something in him. A look comes over him, like he's Bruce Banner about to become the Hulk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kid Loco saunters back over to Randy. He grabs his head for another post smash, but HE CAN'T. Randy's neck and arm muscles bulge. His neck veins pop like he's suddenly super- charged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A look of FEAR comes over Kid Loco. He knows the tide is about to turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy reaches over his shoulder and grabs Kid Loco by the hair. He pulls him in close.
</DIRECTION>
<RANDY>
<DIRECTION>
(under breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Randy juts his hips back and bends over, gaining the leverage he needs for a throw. Kid Loco shakes his head, begging no.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy straightens his legs, raises his lower back, and yanks down on Kid Loco's head. Kid Loco's feet fly off the canvas as his head gets BURIED INTO THE MAT. He gets stuck UPSIDE DOWN with his feet over the ropes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy, holding onto the top rope with both hands, thrusts his knee into Kid Loco's stomach. Again. Again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kid Loco somehow manages to untangle himself from the ropes. He scurries away. Randy goes after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy hits Kid Loco with everything he's got. Dropkicks. Elbows. Bodyslams. He pours it on, unstoppable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy drags Kid Loco into the middle of the ring. He looks out at the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RANDY'S POV: A trio of fans are chanting.
</DIRECTION>
<TRIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRIO>
<DIRECTION>
Randy cups his hand to his ear. The chant quickly spreads.

<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	RAM JAM! RAM JAM! RAM JAM!...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHOLE_CROWD>
<DIRECTION>
Randy "mulls" it over. He looks at his laid-out foe. He looks at the corner. He heads for the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy climbs to the top rope. He looks around at the crowd like he's still undecided.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RANDY'S POV: The fans are cheering, wild with anticipation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy bends his arms, pressing them against the side of his head like ram's horns. (Just like in the photo in the opening montage.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He LEAPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The leap is not terribly high or graceful. He crashes down onto Kid Loco horns-first. Kid Loco's whole body convulses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fans lose it. This is what they wanted. The Ram Jam. The money shot.

A TEENAGER in the crowd holds up a sign reading HELLBILLY CANNIBAL SUCKS A FAT DICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellbilly Cannibal climbs into the ring with his sack and a folding chair. He heads to the center of the ring, where Randy awaits.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellbilly Cannibal punches Randy. Randy punches Hellbilly Cannibal. They take turns punching each other, each shot a little harder than the last. It's like a violent game of "slaps".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a stretch of this, Hellbilly Cannibal reaches into his sack and pulls out a can of BUG SPRAY. He SPRAYS it in Randy's face. Randy falls off his chair. He staggers around the ring clutching his face, howling in agony.

Grabbing a folding chair, Hellbilly Cannibal charges toward Randy. He takes a flying leap, riding the chair like a boogie board. Just as he's about to crash down on Randy, Randy ROLLS OUT OF THE WAY. Hellbilly Cannibal's spine gets a violent jolt as the chair hits the mat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy reaches into his Dollar Tree bag and pulls out an aluminum COOKIE TRAY. He smacks Hellbilly Cannibal in the face with it. The tray makes an awesomely loud METALLIC CLANG. Randy hits him a bunch more times.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy is starting to get winded. His heart beats faster.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>

Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy by the hair and smashes his face into the corner post. He scoops him up and FLIPS HIM OVER THE TOP ROPE, out of the ring. Randy LANDS HARD on the concrete floor.

Randy shakes out the can's contents over Hellbilly Cannibal, showering him in trash. He shoves Hellbilly Cannibal's head into the can and falls on it, ass-first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy grabs the ladder resting along the base of the ring. He POUNDS THE GARBAGE CAN with it, making an UNHOLY RACKET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the can still over his head, Hellbilly Cannibal rises to his feet. He HEADBUTTS RANDY with the can. Randy, stumbling around, gets headbutted again. Hellbilly Cannibal throws off the can and drags Randy back to the ring by his hair, carrying the ladder in his other hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plopping Randy down on the mat, Hellbilly Cannibal sets up the ladder in the middle of the ring. He heads back out and grabs the folding table, setting it up by the ladder. He reaches into Randy's Dollar Tree bag and pulls out a BOX OF THUMBTACKS. He scatters the tacks all over the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy and pulls him up the ladder with him. They stand at the top, perched high above the table. Just as Hellbilly Cannibal is about to push off, Randy surprises him with a VICIOUS HEAD-BUTT. Hellbilly Cannibal is caught totally off guard. Randy headbutts him again. Randy grabs Hellbilly Cannibal and PUSHES OFF.

Randy pulls Hellbilly Cannibal off the mat. As he gears up for another dropkick, his KNEES BUCKLE. A look comes over his face. He DROPS TO HIS KNEES, one hand on the mat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy grabs his arm. He massages it. He FLOPS OVER, clutching his chest. He lies on his back gasping for breath, sucking at the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RANDY'S POV: The fans are unaware anything is wrong. They assume it's part of the act.

Hellbilly Cannibal sees a look of FEAR in Randy's eyes. He knows this is real. He looks out at the crowd.

Cyber-Randy drops The Ayatollah with a knee to the chest. And another. The Ayatollah GOES DOWN. Randy heads to a corner and CLIMBS TO THE TOP ROPE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his arms, sticking his elbows out, pressing his fists to the sides of his head to form a SET OF RAM'S HORNS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy JUMPS. He flies high in the air, soaring over the mat and crashing down on The Ayatollah horns-first. He pins The Ayatollah as the ref counts to three for the victory. The crowd goes wild.

Randy, standing in the middle of the trailer, does a JUMPING JACK. He does another. A few more.

Angry, bitter, frightened tears roll down his cheeks.

INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy lies on his bed, gazing off depressedly. On his chest is a well-worn DAY PLANNER, open to a marked-up page.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON page. Scribbled in marker in one of the boxes is RAHWAY AUTOGRAF SHOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RAHWAY RECREATION CENTER - GYMNASIUM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy, standing at a folding table in a gym, unzips a duffel bag. He pulls out a stack of 8x10 GLOSSIES of himself. It's a high-flying, mid-air Ram Jam photo from the height of his '80s glory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts them on the table. Looks around the gym.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RANDY'S POV: He's at an AUTOGRAPH SHOW that hasn't started yet. Around the perimeter of the gym, TEN FOLDING TABLES are set up. At each one, a BEAT-UP, WORN-OUT OLD WRESTLER is laying out his wares----8x10s, old match tapes, etc.

Brumberg walks off. Randy looks at the flyer again. A sour expression comes over his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The signing is underway. FIVE OR SO FANS mill about the room, drifting from table to table getting autographs and taking photos with the motley assortment of washed-up aging wrestlers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON RANDY:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy is sitting behind his table, signing one of his 8x10s for a FAN. He hands it to the guy, who hands Randy a $5 bill.

<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The fan walks off. Randy tucks the fiver into the FANNY PACK he's wearing. There's not much in there, just a meager few ones and fives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy zips up the fanny pack. He looks up, ready to sign more autographs----just as soon as somebody comes over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy sits at his table, bored. There are NO TAKERS. He looks around the room at the other wrestlers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RANDY'S POV: One is asleep. Another looks borderline homeless. Across from him is a 40-SOMETHING WRESTLER in a WHEELCHAIR. Attached to his calf is a URINE BAG. A feeble stream of urine trickles into the bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy looks down at the stack of Randy The Ram 8x10s on the table. He gazes numbly at the high-flying image of himself from 20 years earlier.

	<DIALOGUE>
	In 1982, the year I wrestled my first professional match, I was six- foot-one. By 1993, I was five-foot- eleven. Three back surgeries in 11 years knocked two full inches off my height. I may be down to five- eleven, but performing in front of you people has always made me feel 10 feet tall. And that's the way it's always gonna be.
