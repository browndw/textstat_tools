	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>

Jeffrey nods.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.

</JEFFREY>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay. Bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey gets out of the car and shuts the door. He looks in one more time at Sandy. They stare at each other silently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey can see her lips in the black darkness of the car. Sandy watches him cross the lawn and go into the apartment building. She slides over and sits in the driver's seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey hurries up the stairs to the Seventh Floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOMEONE comes out of an apartment just as Jeffrey gets to the Seventh Floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes up another flight of stairs to the Eighth Floor and waits until the man goes downstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey then goes back to the Seventh Floor and goes to Door 710. He takes out the key and looks around. No one. He inserts the key. It fits. He turns it. The door opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He quickly enters the very dark apartment and shuts the door. It takes a moment for his eyes to adjust to the darkness. Soon he finds his way around. He decides on the closet to hide in. However before he goes in to the closet he slowly surveys the apartment as well as he can in the darkness. He goes down the hallway to the back bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the hallway he opens another door and is surprised to find an empty child's room. In the child's room he sees a small pointed hat with a propeller on top. The kind that plays music when the propeller turns. The hat is sitting silently on the bed post. He quietly closes the door. He returns to the closet. Once inside, he checks out how much he can see. Through the slats he has a view of half the apartment. This is where he will stay. He moves around some to relax. He takes several deep breaths. He looks at his watch. It says "10:17."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sandy sits in the car, carefully watching the apartment building and street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the closet, Jeffrey shakes his shoulders and moves around some to stretch his muscles which are getting tired. Again, he takes several deep breaths. He looks at his watch - it says 12:45.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no, hurry up Dorothy. Come on! and I gotta pee. Great. it's now or never.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey sneaks out of the closet and makes his way across the bedroom to the door of the bathroom. His foot hits the door and it makes a loud noise. He freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves again into the bathroom. He starts to pee.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heineken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Sandy sits up alert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car drives up and a MAN helps Dorothy Vallens get out. They walk into the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey instinctively has flushed the toilet and because everything else is so quiet the water SOUNDS seem very loud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sandy begins to honk the horn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unable to hear the warning horn, Jeffrey nonchalantly leaves the bathroom as the tank is still filling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY, he hears something. a key going in the door. He bolts toward the closet. He flies inside it and is swinging the door shut as the front door opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as suddenly, the toilet tank gets full and the water shuts off - SILENCE, except for Dorothy Vallens at the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (we're watching Jeffrey trying to
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	control frightened breathing in
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
the dark closet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodnight now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
The front door shuts and the living room lights go on. Jeffrey can see Dorothy come toward him. She walks RIGHT UP, almost to his face, when the phone RINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns immediately and goes to answer it. Jeffrey almost passes out. He thought he'd had it. He overhears.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
(on the phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello. yes. yes sir, Frank. Let me talk to him. Please Frank, sir. I like to sing Blue Velvet. Don? It's okay. Don't worry. Don?? can you hear me? Is little Donny OK? Is he there? Don? You mean Meadow Lane? Frank?! What's the matter with him? I know. When? Okay. In an hour. I'll be sweet. Momma loves you. Okay Frank, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
She hangs up the phone hard and puts her head in her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
(to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank, you son of a bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
She goes and sits down and starts chewing a fingernail. She nervously gets up again and looks at a framed photograph for a moment then hides the photograph under a pillow on the couch. She puts on a record, "FOR YOUR PRECIOUS LOVE." She sits back down and chews her nail again, listening to the MUSIC; she starts to cry. She stops herself and takes the record off. She starts taking off her stocking. She then takes off her dress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Underneath, she has on a bra and panties. She crosses the living room, goes down the hallway into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey can't see her too well now. She takes off her panties in the bathroom. She is now naked. She looks at herself in the mirror. We see Jeffrey's face as he watches her. She disappears from view completely and we HEAR her start a SHOWER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey's face. He sees Dorothy - in a towel - come toward him again. He quickly moves back into the closet as far as he can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the door, reaches in and gets a blue velvet robe. She doesn't see Jeffrey even though he isn't well hidden. She closes the door. It CLICKS shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey is in almost total darkness. He listens. He can HEAR WALKING around, then silence. He hears the kitchen sink WATER RUNNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He HEARS her WALKING AGAIN. Now he can see her. She sits down on her bed. She looks up. Just as Jeffrey shifts his weight. She looks at the closet strangely, but then calmly picks up a book and thumbs through it. She slowly gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey doesn't know what is up. He looks but she walks out of view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY, he hears a DRAWER OPEN, and just as suddenly, the CLOSET DOOR FLIES OPEN, and there she is with a pistol pointed right at him. When she realizes that SOMEONE IS REALLY THERE, she SCREAMS ONCE, very loud.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
(crazy scream, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
Dorothy stares at Jeffrey studying him for some time thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<JEFFREY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly; feeling guilty)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never before this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
Dorothy moves to the kitchen counter and gets a knife. She goes to Jeffrey. Now she has a knife and a gun. He's scared.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get undressed. I want to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey begins to undress. First he takes off his shoes and socks, Then his shirt. He undoes his belt and unzips his pants and takes them off. Now he is only in his underwear.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	STAND UP.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
He does.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come closer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
Dorothy has a strange look on her face. She reaches out and pulls Jeffrey's underpants down to his knees. She looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want from me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly, getting very hot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I . I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
Dorothy is getting very DREAMY and begins to talk in a childlike voice. She opens her robe and pulls Jeffrey to her breasts.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move. don't look at me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey's eyes close with nervous ecstasy as Dorothy begins touching him.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to touch her.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move or I'll kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you like talk like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lie down on the bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
He lies down. He looks frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a KNOCK, KNOCK on the door. Dorothy looks VERY frightened. She quickly moves a finger to her lips in a "quiet" sign and whispers to Jeffrey.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers, frantic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up. Hurry! Go in the closet. Don't say anything or you'll get killed. I mean it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
KNOCKING is heard louder at the door. Jeffrey picks up all his clothes and gets in the closet. He's naked and hiding in the closet. Dorothy closes her robe and glides to the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey sees FRANK come in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank is medium height and stocky with a burr hair cut. He is wearing a tight blue t-shirt and an old black sports jacket. He's got on a pair of blue jeans and boots. He has a raw, mean sexuality - a "bomb about to go off" - presence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes into the room slowly, always looking at Dorothy. He sits on the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(annoyed, condescending)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, daddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(can't-you-remember- anything-attitude)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	my bourbon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dorothy goes into the kitchen to get Frank his drink. As she passes the closet, Jeffrey can see the fear in her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She returns with a small glass of bourbon and hands it to Frank. Frank sips on it.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	sit down. get your chair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dorothy brings a small chair over from the wall and sits down. She adjusts her robe.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(studying her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	spread your legs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dorothy slowly spreads her legs. She can see Jeffrey staring out of the darkness of the closet at her.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	wider.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
She opens her legs wider. Frank looks at her crotch and drinks his bourbon. He stares at the floor for a moment, then slowly looks back at Dorothy, her body - her crotch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dorothy looks up at the ceiling, waiting. Frank suddenly reaches to his belt, where he has a small canister and a mask. He opens a valve on the canister and places the mask over his nose and mouth. The canister is filled with helium, which makes Frank's voice very high and strange sounding. The result is frightening.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(high voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	mommy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dorothy jumps. She keeps looking at the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing, with high voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MOMMY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
(frightened)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	mommy's here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(high voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby wants to fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Then, Frank's voice goes to normal.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(normal voice, but loud - like an army order to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GET READY TO FUCK!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank goes to Dorothy and kneels down in front of her. He takes one more gasp of helium.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(high voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby wants blue velvet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dorothy opens her robe and gives a part of the robe to Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
Frank slowly moves
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank slowly moves his mouth to the robe and runs his lips along the texture of the velvet. His hands rub the velvet and feel Dorothy's body underneath. His hands start feeling her breasts as he sucks and bites the velvet robe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dorothy is very frightened but she is getting hot in spite of her fear. Then Frank, in a sort of sickening way, pulls Dorothy down to rug. He warns her.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't look at me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He begins stuffing part of the robe into her mouth. Then, he pushes her arms back and she keeps them back, letting Frank have his way. Frank sucks and bites the velvet coming out of her mouth, while he pinches and feels her breasts in a strange, compulsive, timidly sickening way. Dorothy is moaning. Frank is breathing very heavily. He feels her crotch.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't look at me!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(heavy breathing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy's home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He starts stuffing the robe in his mouth now and he gets on top of Dorothy. He starts humping her and pulling her nude body up and down him. Faster and faster, then he has a climax in his pants. Dorothy's head is falling back. She can see Jeffrey blurred in the distance - in the closet. Cautiously, she looks sideways at Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't look at me!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He slugs her in the face. His nose is running and he's stifling sobs from deep within him. On his hands and knees, he moves away. The robe pulls out of his mouth. His breathing is even heavier now. He stands and begins to move around the apartment. He goes to a wall, turns off the lights, then turns and walks into the bathroom, all the while breathing big, heavy breaths, trying to stop the crying. Dorothy moans softly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It gets very quiet and still for a moment. Then, Jeffrey hears Frank with his high helium voice talking to himself in the bathroom. The high, strange sound reverberates in the distance. Jeffrey can't make it out - soon, he hears Frank's high laughing. Frank comes back into the living room. The mask is around his face. All his breathing - every sound is high . He laughs a little and crosses the darkened room to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay alive baby. See you next Christmas!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank leaves and shuts the door. The apartment is silent except for Dorothy's moans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey is stunned. He doesn't move. He watches Dorothy in the half-light. She rolls over and starts crying. The crying is deep and genuine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, Jeffrey emerges from the closet and goes to her. He bends down and touches her. She flinches and turns to see him. She turns back sobbing. He tries to get her up.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you come lie down. Come on, I'll help you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
She struggles up with Jeffrey's help and he takes her over to the bed. She falls down on her side, turned toward the wall. He covers her with the sheet.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to the sheet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like that. What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Are you alright?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure I'm alright.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she starts crying again)
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to put on his underwear. They're inside out. He tries to turn them around.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

</JEFFREY>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey turns to her. He studies her. He reaches out and takes her shoulders. He moves down and holds her.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
They lie together for a long silent moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you like the way I feel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
(hesitates)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See my breasts? See?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey looks.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DOROTHY>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</JEFFREY>
<DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can kiss them if you want. Feel them They're getting hard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>

Frank is totally captivated by Dorothy's singing and is very serious- looking. He looks right up to her eyes. In his hand he works a small piece of blue velvet cloth with his fingers. Again her first number, "BLUE MOON," segues into "BLUE VELVET." This song she sings mainly to Frank. When it is over Frank continues watching Dorothy and everyone else applauds loudly.

Jeffrey gets out of his car and walks up the deserted street. He reaches Frank's car which is making popping and clicking NOISES as it cools down. He looks at the license plates - walks a few paces ahead and then writes it down in his notebook. He continues on to the apartment building.

Now Dorothy's apartment building at night. A very low angle looking up to the roof. Suddenly a pinpoint of red appears coming toward us from the roof.

Standing in the middle of Dorothy's apartment is T.R. Gordon, the Yellow Man. He is in an extreme state of shock. He is bleeding badly from a huge wound at the top left of his head. His eyes focused on something only his twisted inner mind see. Sitting in one of Dorothy's chairs is a dead man with no ears. only half-healed bloody wounds at each side of his

EXT. TREE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
A songbird SINGS in a tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are in a beautiful park. Slowly we move down and a little hat with a propeller comes into view. The hat is on the head of a small child who is dancing slowly toward Dorothy. She is laughing. When the boy gets within arms reach they embrace. We move close to Dorothy's smiling face. Tears of happiness come into her eyes, but there is still a distant look as we hear Bobby Vinton sing the last lines of his song.

"and I still can see Blue Velvet through my tears."
