FADE IN: BEGIN TITLES

In murky light, a piece of paper sinks in a shallow tin tub. By degrees, faces and forms appear on the page: a swooning woman, (circa 1940) a cop who tries to catch her, a crowd of onlookers standing in the shadows of a tenement house in the aftermath of a murder. Before the photograph has completely developed, it seems to fade in a dreamy

INT. STAIRWELL - 236 THOMPSON

The Cops move stealthfully up the dim stairwell, guns drawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the third-floor landing, a door is ajar. Light spills out onto the floorboards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they ascend, the Cops can see the corpse of a smartly dressed young man inside:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It lies face down, its features rudely pressed and bloody against the floor. A freshly-blocked hat lies a few feet from the dead man; he was shot as he came home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the landing, the Cops move carefully to the door, hugging the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They hear someone moving inside the apartment. They freeze, barely breathing.

The older Cop cocks his gun, crosses himself, wraps his hand around the doorframe. He jumps into

BERNZY (whose real name is Leon Bernstein and whose professional name is "The Great Bernzini") inserts a new bulb in the giant chrome flash attachment of his Speed Graphic press camera. A cigar is planted in the corner of his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy cuts a curious figure: He wears an oddly oversized suit that has capacious pockets to accommodate camera lenses, film plates and flashbulbs. His thick-soled shoes are sensible to a fault. He wears a hat but no tie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face is alert and ironic, his movements rapid and purposeful.

<BERNZY>

He reaches into his jacket to extract a new 4 x 5 glass film plate (from a bag of plates hung over his shoulder) with a well-practised, unhurried speed.

The older cop, O'BRIEN, is annoyed; his comment sounds like an accusation.

Another Photographer is arriving. He crosses the street, lugging a press camera.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy, in the alley alongside the building, is hunched over the open trunk of his sedan on a camp stool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car trunk has been turned into a darkroom. The truck lamp has been replaced with a darkroom bulb. A drying line is suspended over a shallow tub. (Also in the trunk are two dozen boxes of Wabash super-flash photo lamps, an open box of cigars, a pot of glue, various cameras and lenses, and a tiny, battered typewriter.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy looks up into the apartment window as the explosion of a flashbulb-fills the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy unpins four nearly dry photos on the line, fans them in the air, lays them face down on the trunk floor, and stamps their backs with his identifying imprint:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deco lettering is surround by the stamped outline of an eye, like something on an optometrist's sign. Around the upper and lower lids of the eye it says "CREDIT PHOTO TO - THE GREAT BERNZINI". In the center of the eye it says "THE PUBLIC EYE"

Bernzy drives, his eyes intently scanning the nighttime street.

A steady, low hiss is emitted from a police radio, that is gerry-rigged under his dusty dashboard, swaying on its wires. A metal plate on the radio says FOR POLICE VEHICLES ONLY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy's Speed Graphic, with flash, sits on the seat next to him.

As Bernzy reads every shadow and doorway for potential pictures,

INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the landing of the stairwell, a young Puerto Rican Woman wails hysterically as two Cops try to calm her down. She's in her nightgown. A flashbulb fires over her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The narrow stairway is packed with Policemen and Puerto Rican neighbors in their T-shirts, pajamas and robes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A COP leads two Ambulance Attendants, with a stretcher, up the stairs shouting as he goes.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clear the way, get back, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon --

Now he passes Bernzy, near the top of the stairs --
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bernzy, clear outta here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy is taken aback --
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I hear this guy's walkin' around with a meat cleaver in his head -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
-- as if it's every man's God-given right to photograph such a rare sight.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the Hell out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DIRECTION>
As the Cop heads into the Woman's apartment, he speaks to the ambulance Attendants, but looks at Bernzy as he does so.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Throw a sheet over him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DIRECTION>
The Cop is suspiciously keen to thwart Bernzy: Bernzy smells something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to a Puerto Rican MAN, the next door neighbor, who watches in his T-shirt and boxers.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is this guy, anyway?

</BERNZY>
<MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(Puerto Rican accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Working for the Mayor. Visits at night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy sizes up the elements of the tragedy as the Orderlies bring the victim out of the apartment. He looks at the hysterical mistress and then at her victim/paramour, who is covered with a sheet, but moving (with a comically high protrusion where the meat cleaver is lodged).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy -- his eyes as keen as a fox's -- takes a last look at the covered stretcher -- not a good picture -- then heads quickly down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TENEMENT HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy opens the cavernous trunk of his car. He sorts through a cigar box containing various tools of the photographer's trade, including a scissors he uses to crop prints. He picks up the scissors.

He strips off his coat.

One of the Attendants climbs in back, the other gets in the front, next to the Driver.

The ambulance pulls out. Siren.

INT. AMBULANCE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy sits in the back of the ambulance. He has cut a square in the back of his jacket collar, then put the jacket on backwards, to simulate a clerical collar.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Attendant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better uncover him, son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
The Attendant complies. We don't see the corpse, but the handle of the meat cleaver juts up ludicrously into the frame and it moves back and forth as the victim moans. Even Bernzy is taken aback.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
Not the thing a priest would say; he crosses himself to cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy begins to mutter piously, indecipherably, over the ailing man. He waves something over the man, like a bottle of Holy Water when the last rites are administered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see what he's waving: a light meter. Still muttering, Bernzy reads the meter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Attendant looks perplexed -- a dawning realization.
</DIRECTION>
<ATTENDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Wait a second.

From his oversized pocket, Bernzy withdraws a 35 mm camera. He gets his shot fast, before the Attendant can react.

A Man in a hat watches as the ambulance comes to an abrupt halt. The Man watches as The back doors open and a "priest" spills out -- half leaping, half pushed. The "priest" lands on his ass in the street (careful to protect his camera) as the Attendant slams the ambulance doors.

The ambulance takes off again.

The "priest," unfazed, dusts himself off as he hails a cab with a cheerful serious determination.

At normal speed, in color, we see Bernzy, sitting at a booth near the counter of the drugstore, staring at the young couple. He has a cup of coffee, a plate of eggs and his camera on the table.

Bernzy, caught staring, looks up at the WOMAN.

The police radio continues to hiss, O.S., without interruption, as we pan Bernzy, asleep on top of his bed. He's curled up in his clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still panning, we see the apartment. It's exceedingly cluttered -- as unkempt and eccentric as its occupant. The shades are drawn against daylight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the crowded table Bernzy uses for a desk, there is a payroll check from Time, Inc.:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO MURDERS. . . . . .$35.00.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinned to the bulletin board over the desk, there are covers from the New York Daily News, Mirror, World-Telegram, Post, Sun and Journal-American, all featuring Bernzy's photos of classic tabloid subjects: fires, corpses, handcuffed hoods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Piled against a wall are two four-foot-tall stacks of cigar boxes with masking tape labels across their front flaps. These are marked with laundry pencil: "Vagrants," "Drunks," "Strippers," "Rich & Poor," "Coney Island," "Gangsters - Dead," "Miscellaneous Crowds," "Bowery - Night," "Gangsters - Live."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still panning, we see a series of photos clothes-pinned to a laundry line. They show the Bum, sleeping in the box: he seems isolated and diminished in the high contrast of the Speed Graphic photo -- a bright island in a sea of blackness.

<DIRECTION>
Pulling back from the photo we see the photos of the curled up bum in the foreground and Bernzy curled up on his bed in the near distance, the police radio on his nightstand.

On the sidewalk outside the polished revolving doors, there is a crush of out-of-towners who wait to enter, dressed in their best. But they'll never be let in.

The big band plays on a bandstand, raised and set back from the tables. A black SINGER is performing, whose double entendres and risque stage manner lend a cultivated air of the illicit to things.

<DIRECTION>
In Cafe Society, as in The Stork Club or El Morocco, the seating arrangements clearly denote the "importance" of guests:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dreaded Outer Circle belongs to rich but garrulous businessmen with flashy dates or wives in furs. The Middle Circle is for show biz types, pretty women, professionals, the up-and-coming. The coveted Inner Circles comprises the well-born and the famous, e.g., Social Register types, stars of Broadway, prize-fighters and movie stars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every table has a white cloth, a red rose and a ceramic ashtray that says LOU LEVITZ'S CAFE SOCIETY. Those who eat eat steaks or chops. Everyone drinks champagne or Scotch. Everyone smokes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy's eyes drink in the rich atmosphere. They seem to be taking photographs without benefit of a camera: DOYENNE WITH GIGOLO, FAT MAN OGLING CIGARETTE GIRL, ACTRESS IN SUNGLASSES, etc., again through the black and white of Bernzy's trained eye, overcranked.

She charms them all with some witty remark. As they laugh, the Maitre d' points out Bernzy.

The back wall of the office has a big curtained window that looks down on the nightclub. Memorabilia lines the other walls.

Bernzy is studying a photo-portrait of Kay -- a professional glamour shot from her show business days. He looks at a framed photo of Kay with the late Lou Levitz -- squat, bald, nattily dressed.

As she looks out the window, staring at Portifino, she bites her lip, fretfully -- nothing like the cool elegant hostess she was on the floor of the club. This unnerves Bernzy. If she's just acting (vulnerable) she's doing a good job.

Bernzy hurries up the street, fidgeting with his tie.

He is greeted by TOM HAYWARD, 30, a man in a seersucker suit with a wry manner and an Ivy League air. He holds a furled newspaper under his arm.

INT. GARAGE - SAME

Now we see that the cars are queuing for gasoline. In the filling station of the garage's ground floor, a posted sign reads:

He drags a finger through the dust atop Bernzy's sedan.

As Bernzy thinks about it, Hayward pulls a silver whisky flask from his jacket, unstops it, drinks.

<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright. Call Greenport. Find out when the D.A.'s in court. Find out when the arresting officer's in the station house. In a two-bit town like this, he might even work the desk. When the cop's in and the D.A.'s out, gimme a call.

Rineman leads Bernzy into his book-lined office: all dark wood and rich leather.
</DIRECTION>
<RINEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now does one call you Mr. Bernstein or Mr. Bernzini? Or is it just Bernzini?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINEMAN>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was born Leon Bernstein. But I got the name 'The Great Bernzini' from the gals at World-wide, the big photo agency? They said I had t'be a magician to get to so many disasters so fast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<RINEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's marvelous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He shows Bernzy to a chair in front of his desk, speaking as he takes his own seat, behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<RINEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know my son spoke to you optimistically about publishing your book. That's why he wanted me -- why I wanted to speak to you rather than tossing it back into the mail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy's eyes narrow almost imperceptibly but with a kind of anger: he's suffered this particular humiliation before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy's book is on Rineman's desk. It's a "dummy book" -- a manuscript made up of stiff pieces of paper onto which photographs, printed on good paper, have been glued, along with captions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The book lies open to a photograph of a black man with an agonized expression, a fire-truck behind him, his face lighted by the unseen flames of his tenement afire.
</DIRECTION>
<RINEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, from a technical point of view, this is fine work, fine work. It's simply that we don't publish books of this type.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINEMAN>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Mr. Rineman, please don't hand me that -- please -- 'cause everybody knows Rineman & Sons publishes more photograph books than anybody else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<RINEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(ever gracious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sir, we publish books of photography. And to my mind, this is instead a most admirable picture book about New York. Not an inferior genre, just different.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINEMAN>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You're wrong. This is a book of photography.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<RINEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I may explain --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINEMAN>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you mean. Still lifes, naked women gettin' out of bath-tubs, fruit on a plate -- it's a photo, but let's pretend it's a painting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
We now see a row of tasteful framed photos on the wall behind Rineman, in precisely the style Bernzy describes. They include a woman getting out of her bath and fruit on a plate.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know how to do that, too. I really do. But let's face it, you publish enough of them books already. Everybody does. C'mon, Mr. Rineman: show those other guys. This is the book.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy winks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rineman is appalled by Bernzy's boastfulness, but hides it.
</DIRECTION>
<RINEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I say you're not being fair to the photographers we do publish -- Dick Arlen, Harold Briley, Val Armbruster.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINEMAN>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure they're nice guys, but those arty-farty shots are easy to get compared to something like this

</BERNZY>
<RINEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really, I don't doubt the difficulties you must've faced... You're technically superb.

<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<RINEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(hiding his distaste again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what I see here is a batch of pictures that's too -- sensational and too -- vulgar to justify printing a fine book of photography, which is an expensive thing to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINEMAN>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's vulgar, exactly? This guy? or the fire?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<RINEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since you obviously have great talent, I'd like to suggest that you apply it to a subject matter that --

	<DIALOGUE>
	Please listen, Mr. Bernstein -- !

</RINEMAN>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you think I heard this advice before? I just happen to be right about all this, see? Don't you think I'd rather be shooting flowers or beautiful dames than campin' out with corpses?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<RINEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you should ask yourself. Sensationalism has its allure. It's potent. It can desensitize a man to the beauty of flowers -- or women.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINEMAN>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you, a shrink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<RINEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hardly. But the men who do what you do don't usually feel the need to rationalize it like you -- much less be celebrated for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINEMAN>
<BERNZY>

	Nobody does what I do.

Bernzy takes up the book as Rineman watches.

He moves to the door, seizes the knob, but pauses.

The Hood, his face still shielded, kicks blindly in front of him, clearing the way. He is led toward the booking post.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERNZY, meantime, is perched on a Sergeant's desk, as the Sergeant reads over a file. Bernzy watches the commotion with the young Hood with interest but no urgency.
</DIRECTION>
<SERGEANT>

	There's two guys called Portifino with records. But nobody that age or description.

As Bernzy gets up, he gives a few cigars to the Sergeant.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta go take this kid's picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
The Sergeant scoops the cigars into his desk drawer. He looks over at the snarling, defiant Hood.

Bernzy approaches the Hood, whose handcuffs have been removed so that he may be fingerprinted. He still covers his face.

The Hood takes the pen and signs the form, still careful to keep his face concealed.

Bernzy looks over to make sure the other Photographers have given up.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're over there, smoking.

</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
The Hood uncovers his face. The police have worked him over. He has a mean cut under one eye. He gives Bernzy his fiercest, most defiant post.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy squeezes the shutter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the flash fires, all the other Photographers look over quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the Hood has covered his face, again.

<DIRECTION>
In his parked car, Bernzy reads Portifino's gilt business card under the dashboard light, then looks out at Portifino's residence:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A high-priced building with a Moderne facade and a Doorman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy gets out, tosses his cigar away, stows his camera in the trunk, crosses and enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUILDING LOBBY - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We watch from outside the glass as Bernzy speaks to the Doorman, bribes him, is directed to the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy comes off the elevator, heads down the hallway to APT 7G. The door is barely ajar; a sliver of light falls through the crack, onto the hallway carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy rings the bell. No response. He rings again. Waiting he glances downward casually --
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoops.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
A shimmering dark ribbon of blood seeps under the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy pushes the door open a few inches before it hits something solid. He forces the door another few inches, and pulls himself through the opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PORTIFINO'S APT. - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The luxury apartment has a few pieces of furniture and some unopened boxes in it; Portifino has just moved in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But it is Porfitino who lies dead by the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is tangled in piano wire. The wire was rigged around the still-living Portifino so that any movement caused it to dig more deeply into him. He killed himself by dragging himself to the door to seek help.

Bernzy goes to the telephone, dials a number.

Bernzy, having ignored Conklin's request, stands over the corpse, taking a picture. He smokes a cigar.

Bernzy is in front of the desk in Chadwick's clean, non- descript office. One one side of him, a Young Agent takes notes; on the other side of him an Older Agent (gray-haired) says nothing, merely observes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chadwick stands behind his desk, in front of two steel filing cabinets. He interrogates Bernzy in the humorless G-Man style.
</DIRECTION>
<CHADWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was your business with Portifino?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHADWICK>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you. I was just calling on him as a favor to a friend.

	Right. What did you say your friend's name was?

	This is the stupidest interrogation I've ever seen. You're telling me more than I'm telling you. Already I know this guy got rich quick doing something the Feds don't like. Already I can see you're tryin' to keep it quiet, and when you bring up Russia, I figure it's something treasonous.

Chadwick begins to speak, but the Older Agent -- alarmed by Bernzy's perspicacity -- takes over.

	Mr. Bernstein, thanks for your cooperation. We're sorry if we've taken you away from your work. This is a time of war, and we hope you'll keep your conjectures about Mr. Portifino to yourself. Fact is, we know nothing about the man, and hoped perhaps you did.

Bernzy doesn't believe the last part, but keeps it to himself.

Across the street, a car starts up as Bernzy heads up the block. It begins to follow him, keeping a discreet distance.

As Bernzy moves along the dark sidewalk, he realizes the car is following him. He picks up his pace, but the car follows suit. Almost reflexively he begins to load a film plate into his camera, but the car accelerates, and overtakes him on the sidewalk. Two MEN get out -- thick-featured and thuggish -- while a third Man stays behind the wheel.
</DIRECTION>

The Men close in around Bernzy. Each takes one of his arms. The camera falls to the ground; the lens shatters. They drag Bernzy gruffly into the car.

Annoyed, Farinelli turns to his lieutenants, speaks in Italian. After a brief tirade, he turns back to Bernzy.

	Okay, so you didn't call the Feds, we was misinformed by a police stooge. I'd still like to know how you knew Portifino.

Bernzy studies Farinelli a beat before answering. He can see how agitated Farinelli is about all of this.

<BERNZY>

	I met him the other night. At Cafe Society. He said he needed somebody to take his picture. He offered good money.

Bernzy nods; he watches as Farinelli moves next to his seat, looms over him, smiling. But his face turns fierce as Farinelli kicks the chair out from under Bernzy, who flops onto his back and hits his head on the tiles.
</DIRECTION>

Bernzy lies on the floor, more stunned and humiliated than hurt, and looks up at the half-circle formed around him by Farinelli and his thugs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy stares up at Farinelli. He raises his right hand to God.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a long beat, Farinelli extends his hand, to help him up.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Bernzy. As it is, I gotta trust you. You never crossed nobody, got no interest in dough, do nothin' but take pictures, noon and night.

He circles his arm around Bernzy, and walks him to the door.

INT. CAFE SOCIETY - SAME

Bernzy is looking upward, toward the windowed office as he crosses the club. He is therefore taken unawares when a Man at a good table catches him by the sleeve --
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Surprised they let you in here, Bernstein. I'll complain to the management.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy sees ARTHUR NABLER, a likable man, 57-years-old, overweight, seemingly unaccustomed to the dinner clothes he's wearing. At the moment, he's drunk.

A Woman is with him at the table, much younger than he is, attractive in flashy way.

Eager to escape, Bernzy tries to wrest his hand away. But Nabler clings to it: he's as deadly earnest as a dying man.
</DIRECTION>
<NABLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me, Bernzy, listen to one who knows: Nobody could love you. No woman could ever love a shabby little guy who sleeps in his clothes and eats outta cans and cozies up to corpses so much he starts to stink like one.

Bernzy, sucker-punched, attempts to remove his hand.

Bernzy pulls his hand away, but Nabler is not in control, blubbering and shouting, melancholy and drunk.

He draws attention: it sounds like he's shouting epithets.

We move with Bernzy, who is stoical and swift, past the glittering crowd. Nabler is blubbering and shouting under the music but Bernzy isn't hearing him.

We see what he sees, but this time it's in color -- it's life, untransmogrified:

Bernzy comes off the elevator, onto a long hall with offices on either side. Some doors are open; we can hear the vacuum cleaner of a janitor.

Bernzy comes quickly down to the hallway, to the office at the head of it -- Chadwick's. A pail and mop stand outside, but when Bernzy peeks into the open door, the office is empty. He enters.

Bernzy hurries behind the desk, to a steel filing cabinet, one of two. It is locked. He studies the lock. His only light comes from the hallway, through the frosted glass. He jiggles the lock. It won't budge. He searches for the key in the desk drawers. Can't find it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at the other filing cabinet. It has no lock, but is marked "UNCLASSIFIED MATERIAL." This seems less than promising but Bernzy unrolls the top drawer, anyway.

The waving lighter flame excites a sense of evil as we come close to these sinister sounding words -- "BLACK GAS."

Bernzy knits his brow -- but has no time to wonder: the silhouettes of Chadwick et. al. are on the frosted glass.

As he digs into the file cabinet to re-insert the goods, we watch the silhouettes growing nearer and nearer on the glass.

Chadwick looks at Bernzy suspiciously. He plunges his hand into his pants pocket, extracts a ring of keys, moves swiftly to the locked file cabinet, opens it.

He pulls out Bernzy's plates (in a pouch), spreads them on the desk, counts them. Then he puts them back in the pouch, back in the file, and locks it.

<DIRECTION>
Bernzy walks in shadow, on a self-important Long Island street of mock-Tudor houses and stone villas behind low walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy climbs a six-foot wall, legs waving maladroitly. At the top, he peers over, manges to pull himself flat onto the wall, then swiftly drops down into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GARDEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where he almost breaks his neck: the property drops off steeply inside the wall, where a storm drain is covered in old ivy. Bernzy squats among the shrubs which are set two feet inside the wall. He looks:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stone house is guarded by a few men in suits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the bushes, Bernzy extracts a camera from one of his pants pockets and a long lens from the other. He begins to screw the lens onto the camera body, but freezes when he hears a Guard's footsteps crunching on the gravel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy's POV: the Guard swings a flashlight back and forth over the path, onto the shrubs, up along the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the Guard has passed, Bernzy screws on the lens. He aims the camera at the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEWFINDER POV: The silhouettes of two men are visible behind curtains in a front room, but the laughter of many men can be heard. Panning, we see the stone arched entranceway to the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Guard sits on a stone bench on the front porch. He sits beneath a tile plaque that says VILLA SPOLETO, illuminated by a tiny bulb. This is the only illumination on the porch; the rest of it is in near-darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front door opens, the Guard stands. It's too dark to see the faces of the two men who exit, but Bernzy takes a shot anyway -- "blind." The Men then veer camera left to the driveway, crossing an area of total darkness.

He looks at his watch: 11:28.

Bernzy consults his watch, again. 2:12. He hears noises from the house, seizes the camera.

VIEWFINDER POV: The door opens. This time, several men exit, alone or in groups of two or three: the meeting is breaking up. Bernzy can see no faces, shoots blind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They all veer off into the darkness of the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He clicks the camera, advances the film -- click, click, click.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE PATH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
two Guards on their rounds hear the soft clicking in the shrubs. They move nearer, carefully. The 1st Guard takes the gun from his holster, cocks it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BUSH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy hears their footfalls, freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE PATH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the Guards hear a soft rustling in the bush. The 1st Guard takes the gun from his shoulder holster. The two Guards advance slowly, shining their lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The 2nd Guard moves to the bush where Bernzy is hiding while his partner covers him, gun cocked and aimed. In a swift, decisive move, he parts leaves and branches of the bush, exposing the ground behind it. REVERSE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy is not to be seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The 2nd Guard shines his beam into the bush, then up along the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shooting low from the other side of the bushes, we see the dirty, ivy-covered storm drain cut into the drop-off at the edge of the property. Only Bernzy's white-knuckled hands can be seen as he holds on from inside the drain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The 2nd Guard drops to his knees, shines his light along the base of the wall, under the bushes: he is right over Bernzy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see into the drain, where Bernzy is having a hard time holding on. The Guard is painstakingly thorough in his examination of the area behind the bushes. After an eternity:
</DIRECTION>

Bernzy works feverishly in his darkroom. He coaxes a print to life by agitating a tub. In fact, he has two tubs, and he moves from one to the next in his zeal to see the pictures. We see into one of the tubs:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lighter parts of the picture have appeared -- the stone bench, the plaque which says VILLA SPOLETO... Now slowly the faces of two men come into view, i.e., what was invisible to the naked eye is visible to the infra-red.

Now a face comes slowly into view, on the dark part of the porch. It is SAL, the lean-faced lieutenant who was sitting on the couch in Farinelli's office when Farinelli grilled Bernzy. He is on Spoleto's arm in the picture.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sal, you beautiful jerk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
He lifts the photo out of the tub, triumphantly. But then his eye catches sight of the photo now coming to life in the second tub:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Man in a conservative blue suit -- a WASPY gray eminence -- is coming out of Spoleto's front door.

Bernzy, at his desk, takes up a finished print of Sal. He puts it in an envelope. He writes on it in grease-pencil: FARINELLI.

INT. CAFE SOCIETY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON the palm of the Italian Maitre d' as a Man slips a bill into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN, in a dinner jacket, has a stern but florid face; his Wife has a supercilious bearing. As they move:

<MAN>

	Table No. 7, Fredo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<MAITRE_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid Mrs. Levitz is at No. 7 this evening, Mr. Brown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAITRE_D>
<DIRECTION>
The Man looks across the room as they move. He sees Kay sitting across from Bernzy; they speak intently.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(not concealing his distaste)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's the gentleman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<MAITRE_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe he's a poet who recently escaped Mr. Hitler.

</MAITRE_D>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's still no excuse, is it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<MAITRE_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir... Exactly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAITRE_D>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls out a chair for the Wife with an old-world flourish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BERNZY and KAY. Bernzy slides the envelope marked Farinelli across the table cloth.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is an incriminating picture of the informer, Sal Minetto.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
Kay takes the envelope. They sit in a banquette, the music playing across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a safe or something? At home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
She nods.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I wind up dead, you give the picture to Frank Farinelli; but I'm giving you the picture, which guarantees I ain't gonna wind up dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
She slides the letter into a beaded pocketbook, lying on the table, next to an open bottle of expensive Scotch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy looks around him -- the beautiful nightclub, its well- dressed patrons, the polished musicians.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father's been in this country 27 years, it's like he never left Russia. Sittin' here, I know just what he must feel like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Means you need another drink.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's how they all get the impression they belong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all it takes, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
She nods. They drink. A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's startin' to work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles. The music plays, something lush and evocative. For a long, exquisite moment he really does believe he belongs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then a dapper Man in dinner clothes leans over Kay, drapes his arm over her.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kay!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Henry, how are you?
	</DIALOGUE>

(she comes to her feet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please meet my friend Leon Bernstein. Bernzy, this is Henry Haddock, Jr.

<HADDOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Bernstein.

(turning instantly to Kay)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've half the M.G.M. brass over there, dying to meet you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HADDOCK>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns back to Bernzy.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	G'ahead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
She scoops up the bag with the letter, nods soberly to Bernzy (i.E., she let's him know she won't let go of it) and walks off with Haddock, who circles his arm around her. He whispers in her ear and she laughs musically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hold on Bernzy, alone at the table, watching Kay -- ever- charming, ever-beautiful, meeting half a dozen men in dinner jackets. Bernzy is suffering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up abruptly, heads for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hold for a moment on the glittering club, as the music swells and people laugh, and then abruptly we

EXT. QUEENS APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy stands in a dreary silent street in Queens. The club could be a million miles away.

He holds a page from the phone book. A name, address and phone number are underlined -- those of SALVATORE MINETTO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Woman holds the door partly ajar to speak to Bernzy.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on. I'll get him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy waits. We can hear a comedy program on somebody's radio echoing down the hall. Now Sal comes to the door, in an undershirt.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Bernzy. The photographer --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know who you are.

</SAL>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to come in.

</BERNZY>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What for?

</SAL>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It has t'd do with Mr. Farinelli.

	And Mr. Spoleto.

<DIRECTION>
Sal opens the door. Bernzy enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He follows Sal through a foyer, into a salon, with high dark furniture and worn doilies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sal's wife, listening to "Amos 'n' Andy" on the radio, watches them pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sal closes the door behind them, hooks the latch. Bernzy, meantime, takes an envelope marked "SAL" from his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got your nerve comin' here, little man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy gives the envelope to Sal.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
Sal stares at Bernzy angrily for a beat. He takes up a steak knife from the counter, lets it rest ominously in his palm. But then he uses to knife to slice open the envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing the picture of himself with Spoleto, he merely stares.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's three others just like it, in sealed envelopes marked 'Farinelli.' I gave 'em to people I trust. Anything happens to me, they get sent to Farinelli.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
Sal continues to stare at the photo.
</DIRECTION>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have no money.

Bernzy paces, listening keenly.

Sal sits at the plain wood table, with a bottle of beer, running through the story quickly, in the present tense.
</DIRECTION>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Portifino's just a stupid punk in D.C. but he's fronting for somebody willing to sell him the stamps from inside the A.P.O.

</SAL>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O.P.A.

</SAL>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Office of Price Administration.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, right. But then he can't figure how to unload 'em. Knows nobody. The heads of the Five Families won't touch 'em on account of their gettin' amnesty from the Feds to work with the Italian mobs against Mussolini. Then he hears Lou Levitz on some radio show: Friend to the Stars, one- time bootlegger, Mr. New York... He figures maybe an old-timer like Levitz knows how to unload hot coupons. Levitz is interested, alright: he's got a hot young wife to support --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy looks up keenly --
</DIRECTION>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and he sees there's maybe millions in it. He don't have to lift a finger: he just turns the stamps over to Spoleto for a fat percentage. Would you siddown, please?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
(he doesn't siddown)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Levitz' wife knew about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did she?

</BERNZY>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How should I know.

</SAL>
<BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
(pacing again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on.

</BERNZY>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then Levitz dies.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sniggering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess the old Jew was makin' so much he figured he was in Heaven already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy stops pacing; Sal realizes his "gaffe," which seems intentional.
</DIRECTION>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoops... Anyway, Portifino's such a half-wit he figures with the middle- man dead he's free to sell the stamps to somebody else. By this time, he's met Farinelli, so he goes to him. Never mentions Spoleto. The asshole. He signed his death warrant. End of story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<DIRECTION>
He throws up his hands with finality, gets out of the chair.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a second. Didn't they lose the source? The inside man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They tortured him first, got the name of the source.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's they? Who killed him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who knows. Everybody was after this guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who killed him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Farinelli.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy paces, cogitates.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Farinelli gets the name and kills him. Which means Spoleto doesn't know the name till you tell him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
Sal goes to the ice-box. He blinks nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I guess so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<BERNZY>

	Gee, Sal: isn't Farinelli gonna be upset about that?

<SAL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Who knows?

</SAL>

Bernzy reaches into his pocket, takes another print of Sal, tosses it into the drawer.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Who knows'? You're not stupid. What's Spoleto gonna do to protect you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
Sal snatches the picture from the drawer, stuffs it in his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy takes out another print, wedges it between the salt and pepper shakers.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's Spoleto gonna do?

</BERNZY>
<SAL>
<DIRECTION>
(snatching up the photo)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you stop?! I told you what I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy drops a print to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sal is about to retrieve it, but sees it's futile. Bernzy is already holding another print.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Spoleto gonna assassinate Farinelli? Is that it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<SAL>

(softly, resigned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It's worse. Much worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me, Sal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
Sal sinks back into the kitchen chair, drops his face into his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy flips another print; it flutters to the floor, lands at Sal's feet, where he stares down, head in hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sal mutters two words into his hands. We don't hear them, they're lost...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Bernzy seems to hear them. His face grows keen.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
Sal looks up angrily, filled with self-disgust.
</DIRECTION>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A massacre, you son of a bitch, a massacre! Spoleto's gonna wipe out Farinelli's whole gang -- all my paesan -- and I'm gonna tell him where and when.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy stares at Sal with astonishment as he slowly takes a seat across from him. He is silent. This is more than he bargained for. Eventually he speaks, quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to know where and when too, Sal. You're gonna tell me where and when too, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<SAL>
<DIRECTION>
(disbelieving)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whaddo you wanna know for? If you're thinkin of goin' to the Feds, they just wanna cover this up.

</SAL>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy is thinking. Sal shouts.
</DIRECTION>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whadda you wanna know for?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>

Bernzy looks up. A beat. Then:

Bernzy is hunched over his portable typewriter, pecking away.
</DIRECTION>

He pulls the page out of the matchine -- a single-spaced letter -- and reads it, mumbling and pacing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits back at the desk, signs the letter, takes up an envelope (beneath which Kay's photo still lies on the desk), puts the letter inside, and seals it. On the envelope he writes: MR. ARTHUR NABLER, BEEKMAN APARTMENTS, then TO BE OPENED IN THE --

He backs her deeper into the foyer, back toward the imposing staircase.

<KAY>

	He was here with three men... thugs... and he kept asking --

</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
He eases her onto the stairs, where they sit --

<KAY>

Bernzy draws up short when he realizes what he's saying, what boundary he's crossed. A beat. He clear his throat.

Bernzy sits alone in the giant movie house -- but he looks anxiously up the aisle -- expecting somebody.

The newsreel concludes with a fervent pitch for fuel conservation: "Remember, every gallon you save could mean the life of a boy Over There."

<BERNZY>

	Really? Think that'd stop it? You been spendin' too much time at Cafe Society. It's a war, Arty, these guys aren't gonna lay off. They're gonna do it fast or they're gonna do it slow, but they're gonna do it... Why don't you tell them photographers in Europe to stop the War?

</NABLER>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy looks at Nabler a beat -- incensed by his glib certitude -- then grabs one of his cigar box files and empties its contents onto the desk: the photos rain down in abundance, covering the desk and spilling onto the floor. They all show fires: buildings ablaze, people running from blazes, firemen carrying children from blazes. As the camera plays over this fantastic display, Bernzy goes to grab another file.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here it is, Arty: the whole history of New York here with me in this dump, and it ain't because I went around interferin' -- hosing down fires or tellin' people to behave nice --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy unloads an equally plentiful load of dead gangsters onto the desk and floor -- growing more and more passionate in his own defense --
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They pay people to do that stuff -- cops, firemen... I'm an artist -- you're fuckin' right, I am -- and I let people do whatever the hell they're gonna do 'cause that's the only way I can do it right!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
Nabler grabs Bernzy's arm just as he's about to unload a third file.
</DIRECTION>
<NABLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it!... Jesus, Bernzy, I may be the only one in New York who thinks you are an artist instead of some kind of animal -- and even I'm not so sure about this thing. It has a stink to it...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still, if I thought you were doing it for some kind of crazy fame or glory, I wouldn't say a word. I know how much it hurts to be ignored -- not even reviled, just ignored. But if you're doing it for her, you're risking your life for nothing. For less than nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NABLER>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gettin' me and you mixed up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<NABLER>

<BERNZY>

(dismissing this)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's just like everybody else in New York, makin' the best of what she has.

</BERNZY>
<NABLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... Maybe I have been spending too much time at Cafe Society -- just like you've been on the street too long... You give your whole life to something nobody could love and you wind up a sitting duck. You know everything about everything, except what other people take for granted.

	That's enough, Arty.

</BERNZY>
<NABLER>

</NABLER>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy, incensed, grabs Nabler by the collar --
</DIRECTION>
<NABLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't hit people, Bernzy. You can stare at things that'd make a brute squeamish. But you don't hit people. That's not what we do, people like us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NABLER>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy looks at Nabler. He knows he's right. He lets go of him, walks to the door, opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	G'night, Arty. Thanks for the apology.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
Nabler puts his hat on. He moves to the door. He speaks with sincerity.
</DIRECTION>
<NABLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do me a favor, Bernzy. Tell her what you're gonna do. Tell her you're gonna attend a shootout. If she has any feelings at all for you, she'll try and stop you.

Bernzy stands near the entrance, holding his book of photographs. He stares across the room to a far table where KAY sits with a large group of well-dressed Men and Women. They're drinking champagne and martinis. A Man is telling a story. Everyone -- Kay included -- laughs riotously.

Bernzy turns to the Italian Maitre d' at his side.

A toothless WOMAN sings the last line of a ribald bar song in a filthy place with sawdust on the floor. Those drunks who are still conscious (many lie with their heads on the tables) applaud haphazardly.

Bernzy takes a flash shot and the Woman raises her glass to him. He finds his own glass and raises it to her. He's in his element, here.

INT. CAFE SOCIETY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON Bernzy's book. A female hand turns the pages. As we see one vivid, ironic or profound vignette after another (a cleaning woman mopping the floor in Grand Central, her human scale diminished by the overspreading dome; Puerto Rican teenagers sleeping on a fire escape; an old man carrying all his possessions from his burning tenement) we begin to understand the power of the book as a book: it's a complete world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some of the pictures have captions, e.g.: a picture of a corpse -- THE STAR ATTRACTION -- alongside a picture of the excited crowd which has gathered: FIRST NIGHTERS.

They're cleaning up the club around Kay; chairs are overturned on tables. She picks up the book, and heads for the door.

Bernzy is sleeping. The police radio hisses. He stirs.

<KAY>

	Why're you giving this to me?

Bernzy clears his throat as he pulls a pair of trousers from a chair next to the bed, drags them on, gets out of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shouldn't be here, Kay. This is really no place f'r you t'be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
Disconcerted by her presence here, he drags the cover over the bed, makes a rushed and futile attempt to tidy the place up. (The photos he dumped onto the desk and floor still lie on the desk and floor.)
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't -- didn't that maitre d' tell you? I just wanted you to hold onto this, that's all. Just till after --

<DIRECTION>
He trails off.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After what, Bernzy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her. Nabler's advice is ringing in his head.

<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's somethin' nobody ever got pictures of before. Nobody else ever will.

She starts to leave; he grabs her hand.

He brings her face to his almost urgently and kisses her on the mouth.

She walks to the police radio, still crackling, and switches it off. We hold on the radio as she steps out of frame.

OPEN ON the day-date calendar on Bernzy's desk. It's torn to FRIDAY. Panning, we find Bernzy's hands, rummaging on the desk for something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amid two or three open boxes of INFRA-RED film, and two roll- loading cameras, Bernzy finds a ball of string. He is holding a doorstop (a graded piece of wood).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the string, he deftly ties the camera piggyback to the doorstop, sets the timer, puts the camera on the floor. The lens is angled up toward body level.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shutter kicks down toward zero, making a distinct sound, ki-ki-ki-ki-ki. But it stuck around five seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>

He picks it up, finds an oil can, puts a drop of oil on the timer, sets it again. Ki-ki-ki, etc. This time it ticks down to zero, and the shutter clicks.

Bernzy moves briskly to a chair with a pair of trousers draped over its back. He goes through the pockets, unfolding scraps of paper and old flashbulbs, till he finds what he wants: the page of the phone book with Sal's name, address and phone number.

Then into the bathroom. Now he sees Bernzy's silhouette, behind the shower curtain, cowering in the stall. He aims his gun at it, then swiftly draws back the curtain.

d'Angelo's is a simple storefront building with a plate glass window, filmy curtains, a plainly-lettered sign. A neon clock in the window says TIME TO EAT.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERNZY stands across the street from d'Angelo's. He has his camera around his neck, the time release camera in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the filmy curtains he can see that no one is eating inside, i.e., no one from Farinelli's gang has arrived yet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One door down from d'Angelo's, he sees a gap between the buildings which leads to a rear alley. He looks both ways before crossing the street quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND D'ANGELO'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the screen door, Bernzy can see a black Scullion in an apron. He scrapes potato peelings into a metal can by the door. Beyond him, we can see d'ANGELO and MRS. d'ANGELO, the middle-aged couple who run the place. They are preparing food at the stove.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy gestures to the Scullion, trying to lure him out into the alley with bills he waves in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Scullion looks at his boss, back at Bernzy. He picks up the metal can, and walks it back into the alley.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, whaddo they pay you here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
The Scullion empties the trash into the dumpster.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two-fifty? Three bucks a week?

</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
The Scullion just stares.

<DIRECTION>
Four square tables have been pushed together to create a single rectangular table in the center of the restaurant. The cafe's other tables have been pushed to the outside walls, for tonight's private party.

Bernzy stands pressed against the front door, looking at his watch. It's 8 o'clock. He watches the street nervously as A DARK SEDAN turns the corner onto the street, up the block.

INT. D'ANGELO'S HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy is moving one of the tables pushed to the side of the restaurant closer to the hallway. Through the curtained window, he sees FARINELLI getting out of his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy ducks down beneath the level of the windows. He adjusts the table cloth of the table he just moved, bringing it closer to the floor on the dining room side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Scullion opens the door of a closet in the hallway, and beckons Bernzy to come.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy looks behind him, to the door, as he scurries, low, toward the closet door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CLOSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is ridiculously cramped -- filled with mops, brooms, buckets, lightbulbs. Just as FARINELLI opens the cafe's front door The Scullion lifts a broom in the closet and Bernzy ducks under it.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Farinelli sees the Scullion replacing a broom in a closet, and closing the closet door.

The Chef hurries down the hallway, past the Scullion, to greet Farinelli and his Men. There is a great deal of obsequiousness and hand-kissing. Everyone speaks in Italian.

Another car pulls up, and four more of Farinelli's men get out of it.

Bernzy, impossibly cramped in the dim closet, gingerly lifts a roll loaded camera on a strap out of his oversized jacket pocket. He can hear the Italian voices. A bucket wobbles and he has to freeze. He secures the bucket, and lifts the camera strap over his head and onto his shoulders.

Bernzy looks at his watch. It's ten past eight. He's soaked in sweat and very cramped. He can hear the muffled voices of Farinelli and his men. We can feel the heat, the darkness, the anxiety of this claustrophobic eternity.

INT. DINING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spoleto's men are arrayed (weapons aimed) on either side of the table, i.e., looking across the table, not toward the kitchen and not toward the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Farinelli's men stand, ostensibly obedient, some dive, some upend furniture for cover, others go for their weapons. One races for the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spoleto's Men open fire, even as Bernzy rushes to the edge of the dining room, already taking his first shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
[N.B.: The sudden, brutish violence of the scene has the paradoxical effect of making it feel longer, in the inexplicable way a car wreck seems prolonged for the drivers. A series of inter-locking cuts -- hand on gun, shells on floor, splattering of tablecloth, flare from gun, hand on camera, etc. -- extenuates time like a slowed-down nightmare in which the dreamer tries to flee something menacing.]
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy kneels behind the table set against the wall outside next to the hallway -- the one he moved earlier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy kicks the time-release camera: it slides out toward the side wall, aimed upward at the killers and ticking down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scene is sensational, nearly surreal, with bright lights flaring in every direction... spent shells bouncing off the ground... food, wine and blood spattering onto the white table-cloths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy stands for his second shot as The Assassin opens fire on Farinelli's bodyguard, who has managed to pull his gun. Then he spots Bernzy. Bernzy's camera is aimed at the Assassin even as the Assassin turns to kill him. Brazenly, Bernzy continues to shoot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through Bernzy's viewfinder, we see what he's seeing: his own murder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just before the Assassin pulls the trigger, one of Farinelli's Men, who has managed to pull his gun, shoots him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy, seemingly impervious (or possessed) is already advancing the film.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy is only partly hidden by the table and its overhanging cloth: his feet show, he must stand half-erect every time he takes a picture. We feel is protected not by the table as much as by his single-mindedness: he is an appendage of the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bullet tears into the lip or leg of the table Bernzy uses for cover. There is a violent shudder. He is not sure, and we are not sure, if he has been hit by a bullet, or stung by the table itself. He just keeps shooting pictures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By now there is a horrible litter of wood, cloth, food, blood and corpses on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON the time-release camera, next to a corpse: it is stuck, at five seconds, as it was at Bernzy's apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lead Assassin gives the signal. The shooting ends as abruptly as it began. Farinelli and all his men are dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They leave by the front door. But the last Gunman to leave looks curiously over his shoulder, as if he thinks he saw something. Then he hurries off, to catch up with the others.
</DIRECTION>

The Assassins' car is parked in the street. The last Gunman approaches it but still seems dissatisfied. Sirens are heard, growing closer.

INT. DINING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy rises unsteadily to his feet. He winces, but whether he is wounded, or merely reacting to the devastation around him, we still don't know. He cocks his ear as he judges how far off the sirens are, i.e., how much time does he have.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to take pictures of the massacre's aftermath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hearing someone crunch over glass, he looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The curious Gunman has returned. As the sirens draw nearer, the Gunman raises a pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A distinctive noise is heard from the side of the room: ki- ki-ki-ki-ki-click.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Gunman swings around, thinking it is one of Farinelli's men, wounded but not dead. As he fires into a corpse --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy makes a run for the back hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Gunman whirls around again, to fire at Bernzy, but Bernzy's gone.

As the sirens draw very close now, the Gunman flees by the front door.

As they hit the table, and various people seize them eagerly, we cut from tabloid cover to tabloid cover.

All of them carry full size front page photos of the shooting. The pictures are grainy, owing to the infra-red film, but this gives them an even more nightmarish aspect.
</DIRECTION>

The rigidly set faces of the killers are plainly visible. The bullets flaring from the gun barrels are seen like streaks of light.

One tabloid shows a mesmerizing shot of the murdered Assassin staring straight at the camera, when he had a bead on Bernzy. Others show the staggered, falling, or crumpled bodies of the victims.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At least two tabloid have the fortuitous shot (taken by the late-functioning timer camera) of the Curious Gunman shooting Bernzy: the Gunman is in the foreground, with his back to us, his shooting arm extended, his hand and gun plainly visible; Bernzy is in the background as he waits for the trigger to be pulled.

The shot with Bernzy in it is headlined -- THE GREAT BERNZINI!

Another tabloid splits the page between two photos -- Thatcher White -- HE SOLD OUT G.I. JOE -- and Bernzy -- HE SAVED HIM!

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy's position and Kay's are reversed, i.e.: he's the one in the hospital bed, she sits over him, trying to get his attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This hospital room -- the real one -- is harshly lit; there are no flowers. Bernzy is hooked up to an I.V., attached, at the other end, to a dripping bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same stern Nurse stands over the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bernzy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
As Bernzy comes to he sees Kay, her face close to his, speaking quietly. He seems utterly disoriented -- not ready to leave his dream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kay looks to the Nurse who nods and goes out.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bullet went in and out. You lost two pints of blood before they brought you in, lousy bastards.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
Kay smiles sweetly, but Bernzy is cold and unresponsive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at her face. She wonders what's wrong with him.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bernzy? You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You made a deal with Spoleto... You told him about Sal and me so I wouldn't get the pictures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd he give you? He got the Black Gas and he gave you the club in exchange for no pictures?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said he wouldn't hurt you, that was part of it, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy knew it was true but didn't want to believe it.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bernzy?

</KAY>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why'd you do it?

</BERNZY>
<KAY>

	I was afraid you'd get hurt --

	Answer me.

</BERNZY>
<KAY>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't take the chance of losing the club. It's like you with your pictures. You'd do anything for your pictures, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
She wants him to absolve her.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
<DIRECTION>

	...Please say yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Right...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy turns his face away from her, to the wall.

<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bernzy?

</KAY>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you just ask me not to take the damn pictures?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing would've stopped you from getting those pictures. You're a fanatic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd be surprised what I'd of done for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>

(in pain)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you should thank me. You got your pictures. Now you're gonna be rich and famous.

<BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
(dryly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Kay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. He can't look at her.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The minute I heard Sal was dead. Why else would Spoleto take the chance of killing him just before the big event?... So, you see: I knew goin' in, Kay. You don't have t'feel guilty. I didn't do it for you... I did f'r me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted you to do it for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
He won't look at her; he can't.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If just once you'd said to me, 'I'm doing it for you, Kay,' I never would of called him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really figure I'm a complete sucker, even now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I kept trying to get you to say it. I tried so hard. How many times did I ask?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
We hold on him, his face to the wall. He doesn't want to believe it. It's too painful.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything they say about me is true, I guess. If I loved Lou at all it was for what he could give me, I don't mean just money. And everything they say about you, too: you'd run over your grandmother to get the right picture. But this was different. It was different, Bernzy. You didn't know there were gonna be any pictures when you started to help me. And for once I was talking to someone who didn't want a better seat, or an introduction. You didn't know enough to bribe the maitre d' -- much less judge me. The night we sat there and had a drink I knew they were all watching. I knew they were whispering. For once I didn't give a damn. You sat there in your lousy suit and you were the only one who wasn't a climber or a schemer or a snob, and for once I didn't feel like one, either...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she touches him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was different, Bernzy. Wasn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(vulnerable; she needs to know its true)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wasn't it, Bernzy?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy, facing the wall, closes his eyes, the pain is so great.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why'd didn't you ask me, Kay? Why didn't you just ask.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The same reason you couldn't tell me, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
She gets up and goes to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't hate me too much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
She goes out the door. He stares at the wall, speaks quietly to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish I could.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
He closes his eyes to hold back the pain.

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERY CLOSE ON a Middle-Aged Woman who shouts almost ecstatically, her mouth rimmed with too much red lipstick.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Around her, a kind of pandemonium breaks loose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Bernzy, with Nabler on one side of him and Hayward, the Ivy League, alcoholic reporter on the other, comes out the door, The crowd -- as big as a mob -- presses in. There are dozens upon dozens of Reporters and Photographers. The Reporters shout for Bernzy's attention and the Photographers take a never-ending series of flash shots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Autograph seekers thrust tabloid covers and pens at Bernzy, or autograph books, or copies of Life Magazine. Grinning Teenagers and Mothers of G.I.'s just want to touch him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy, in his street clothes and ostensibly recovered, is emotionally muted, without his usual quick eyes, purposeful movements, rapid steps. He offers an occasional wave, or a tepid smile, but he seems totally overwhelmed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they descend the crowded stairs, a 60ish, well-dressed, Man in the crowd is more or less pulled into their immediate orbit by Nabler.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nabler shouts; he has to.
</DIRECTION>
<NABLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bernzy, meet my publisher, the eminent Albert Gerard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NABLER>
<GERARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Bernstein, I've followed your work for years --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERARD>
<NABLER>
<DIRECTION>
(cutting off the bullshit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says if I write an intro for your book -- what's it called? --
	</DIALOGUE>
</NABLER>
<BERNZY>

(looking out at the crowd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'The Public Eye' --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<POLICEMEN>
<DIRECTION>
(B.G.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hiya, Bernzy!/Congratulations!
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICEMEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy smiles at them as they pass -- but the smile is fleeting.
</DIRECTION>
<NABLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With an Arthur Nabler introduction for 'Public Eye' he'll guarantee a double-sized first printing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Gerard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was the advance you mentioned?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NABLER>
<DIRECTION>
Gerard quotes the figure as they pass through a particularly loud section of the crowd, a particular dense thicket of flash-bulbs.
</DIRECTION>
<NABLER>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling, never missing a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smile everybody, Time Magazine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NABLER>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy moves along automatically, buffeted along by the crowd: people extend their hands, poke their smiling faces in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<NABLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So -- can we agree to this deal in principle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NABLER>
<GERARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have the greatest enthusiasm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERARD>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<GERARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERARD>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't like to have my picture took.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<NABLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Gerard's on the Board at the Modern Museum. He says there's real interest there, as well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NABLER>
<GERARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to keep mum on the matter -- conflict of interest -- but there's more than enough support already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERARD>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.

</BERNZY>
<GERARD>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he okay?

</GERARD>
<NABLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's this crowd... We'll speak to you tomorrow, Albert.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he steers Bernzy through the crowd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Car's over there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NABLER>
<DIRECTION>
As Bernzy continues to be photographed, and shouted at, to have autograph books and tabloid covers thrust at him by people with pens and pencils, he and Nabler and Hayward make their way to the curb, where Bernzy's sedan is parked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nabler gives Hayward the car keys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they get in the car, the crowd presses in: they're desperate to make contact with Bernzy.
</DIRECTION>
<NABLER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Bernzy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This'll blow over before your bandages're off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NABLER>
<DIRECTION>
Bernzy and Nabler get in back; Hayward takes the wheel, turns back to Bernzy.
</DIRECTION>
<HAYWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You allowed to drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAYWARD>
<NABLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He can have a short one. I asked inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NABLER>
<DIRECTION>
When Hayward starts the car, the police radio crackles to life.
</DIRECTION>
<HAYWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your town, Bernzy: what'll it be? Cafe Society?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAYWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Even in Bernzy's distracted state, this is like a slap in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
Nabler takes him by the shoulders and speaks to him, low and intent.
</DIRECTION>
<NABLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamit, Bernzy: let it go. This is what you've been waiting for your whole life. Whatever it took, it's worth it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NABLER>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let it go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
Somebody pounds on the window.
</DIRECTION>
<NABLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let it go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NABLER>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<NABLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Nobody does. Welcome to the real world. You're just like everybody else now. Only you're gonna get fawned over by a lot of jerks when our book gets published.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NABLER>
<BERNZY>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my book. I'm writin' the introduction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<NABLER>
<DIRECTION>
(secretly pleased)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to Hayward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go to the Stork Club.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NABLER>
<DIRECTION>
Hayward begins to ease the car away from the curb, but it's hard with the mob outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He points to the police radio, crackling, an added distraction he doesn't need.
</DIRECTION>
<HAYWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How d'you turn this damn thing off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAYWARD>
<DIRECTION>
He looks for the switch.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<HAYWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAYWARD>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't turn it off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<HAYWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's the switch, right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAYWARD>
<BERNZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said you can't turn it off!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNZY>
<HAYWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like I say: it's your town, Bernzy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAYWARD>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the car in gear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When we cut outside it is to black and white. We don't hear the mob: we hear the police short-wave hissing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Photographers run alongside the car to poke their cameras at the windows, as teenagers chase after the car, as the grim-faced Policemen try to guide the car through the morass of humanity, as an Older Woman begins to cry, it is a series of Bernzy-like tableaux, the silent images filled in only with the hiss of the radio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car gets free of the crowd and continues up the street. We crane up to watch it, as it disappears into the New York night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
