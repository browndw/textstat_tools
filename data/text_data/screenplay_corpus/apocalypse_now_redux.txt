EXT. A SIMPLE IMAGE OF TREES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coconut trees being VIEWED through the veil of time or a dream. Occasionally colored smoke wafts through the FRAME, yellow and then violet. MUSIC begins quietly, suggestive of 1968-69. Perhaps "The End" by the Doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now MOVING through the FRAME are skids of helicopters, not that we could make them out as that though; rather, hard shapes that glide by at random. Then a phantom helicopter in FULL VIEW floats by the trees -- suddenly without warning, the jungle BURSTS into a bright red-orange glob of napalm flame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VIEW MOVES ACROSS the burning trees as the smoke ghostly helicopters come and go.

INT. SAIGON HOTEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CLOSE SHOT, upside down of the stubble-covered face of a young man. His EYES OPEN... this is B.L. WILLARD. Intense and dissipated. The CAMERA MOVES around to a side view as he continues to look up at a ROTATING FAN on the ceiling.

The CAMERA MOVES slowly across the room... and we SEE WILLARD, a young army captain. He looks out the window to the busy Saigon street.

	Saigon... shit. I'm only in Saigon. Every time, I think I'm gonna wake up back in the jungle.

He moves back to the bed, lies down. He's unshaven, exhausted, probably drunk. We SEE alcohol bottles, photos, documents scattered on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLARD>

	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was home after my first tour, it was worse. I'd wake up and there'd be nothing. I hardly said a word to my wife until I said yes to a divorce. When I was here, I wanted to be there. When I was there... all I could think of was getting back into the jungle. I'm here a week now. Waiting for a mission. Getting softer. Every minute I stay in this room, I get weaker. And every minute Charlie squats in the bush... he gets stronger. Each time I looked around... the walls moved in a little tighter.

He's up now, naked, going into a frenzy, drinking, doing some sort of martial arts, eventually collapsing onto the floor.

EXT. MILITARY COMPOUND - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A darkly painted Huey lands in a guarded military compound somewhere in Nah Trang. The two enlisted men jump out of the helicopter, leading Willard, who seems in much better shape. As he gets out he sees a platoon of new men drilling in the hot hazy sun. They are clean and pale.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It was no accident that I got to be the caretaker of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz's memory, any more that being back in Saigon was an accident. There was no way to tell his story without telling my own. And if his story is really a confession, then so is mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLARD>
<DIRECTION>
They approach a civilian-type luxury trailer. It is surrounded by concertina wire, and its windows have grenade protection, but it still seems out of place in this austere military base.

He stands before the door for a moment, as the M.P.s guarding the trailer check his papers.

There is a pause as the colonel lights his cigarette, then moves to the sofa. He bends down and picks up a dossier, looks at it.

	Walter Kurtz was one of the most outstanding officers this country's ever produced. He was brilliant. He was outstanding in every way. And he was a good man, too. A humanitarian man.

</GENERAL>
<COLONEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now he's crossed into Cambodia with this Montagnard army of his, that worship the man like a god, and follow him every order, however ridiculous. Well, I have some other shocking news to tell you. Colonel Kurtz was about to be arrested for murder.

</COLONEL>
<GENERAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you see, Willard, in this war, things get confused out there. Power, ideals, the old morality, and practical military necessity. But out there with these natives, it must be a temptation to be God. Because the rational and the irrational, between good and evil. And good does not always triumph. Sometimes, the dark side overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature. Every man has got a breaking point. You have and I have them. Walter Kurtz has reached his. And, very obviously, he has gone insane.

	At first, I thought they handed me the wrong dossier. I couldn't believe they wanted this man dead. Third- generation West Point, top of his class... Korea, Airborne, about a thousand decorations, etc., etc. I'd head his voice on the tape and it really put the hook in me, but I couldn't connect up that voice with this man. Like they said, he had an impressive career. Maybe too impressive. I mean, perfect. He was being groomed for one of the top slots in the corporation. General, chief of staff, anything. In 1964, he returned from a tour with Advisory Command in Vietnam, and things started to slip. His report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Lyndon Johnson was restricted. Seems they didn't dig what he had to tell them. During the next few months, he made three requests... for transfer to Airborne training, Fort Benning, Georgia... and was finally accepted. Airborne? He was thirty-eight years old. Why the fuck would he do that? 1966... joins Special Forces, returns to Vietnam.

	First of the Ninth was an old cavalry division that had cashed in its horses for choppers, and gone tear-assni' around Nam looking for shit. They'd given Charlie a few surprises in their time here. What they were mopping up now hadn't even happened yet an hour ago.

He moves through the shell-pocked field of devastation, soldiers gathering around him. As he comes to each V.C. corpse, he drops a card on it, carefully picking out which card he uses.

EXT. AREA BY DESTROYED VILLAGE - NIGHT

The area is illuminated by large cans filled with sand and jet fuel, bonfires, and the burning village in the background. There are maybe fifteen to twenty helicopters secured against the wind, in orderly patterns. Men are grouped around the fires, eating steaks, hot dogs, hamburgers, drinking beer. It has the bizarre resemblance of some sort of barbarian beach party.

Kilgore considers this.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirty-eight fucking years old. If you joined the green berets, there was no way you'd ever get above colonel. Kurtz knew what he was giving up. The more I read and began to understand, the more I admired him. His family and friends couldn't understand it. And they couldn't talk him out of it. He had to apply three times, and he put up with a ton of shit, but when he threatened to resign, they gave it to him. The next youngest guy in his class was half his age. They must've thought he was some far-out man humping it over the course. I did it when I was nineteen, it damn near wasted me. A tough motherfucker. He finished it. He could've gone for general, but he went for himself instead.

	<DIALOGUE>
	October, 1967. On special assignment, Kontoom Province, Two-Corps... Kurtz staged Operation Archangel with combined local forces. Rated a major success. He received no official clearance. He just thought it up and did it. What balls. They were going to nail his ass to the floorboards for that one. But after the press got a hold of it, they promoted him to full colonel instead. Oh, man, the bullshit piled up so fast in Vietnam, you needed wings to stay above it.

Suddenly, from around a bend, the boat is illuminated by a strange artificial light. Lance and Chief are awakened. Willard reacts as he looks out toward the light. It becomes brighter and brighter as they move closer.

EXT. STAGE - FULL SHOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire area around the stage and right up to the barbed wire is mobbed with hundreds of seething American men. Some of these boys have just gotten here, others have been in the jungle for months. It's the Vietnam military version of a happening. Guys from all walks of life, from the cities, guys with flowers in their hair and peace signs around their necks, other guys with their short-time sticks and war medallions around their necks. Black G.I.s congregate together with their clenched-fist black power medallions. There are signs and posters and graffiti everywhere. Some guys have guitars, everyone seems to have a camera. Rummaging, sitting, waiting expectantly, before the enormous stage, which is protected by rings of concertina wire, a moat, and M.P.s every three feet at riot control positions. Many joints and pipes are being passed around. Snapshots are being taken. It has a strong resemblance to a love-in or even Woodstock. Except that they're all in various degrees of combat fatigues, and they're all men.

CHEF, CLEAN, LANCE, WILLARD AND THE CHIEF move down an aisle to their seats. It is through WILLARD'S EYES that we see this spectacle, bad every so often we will see an enthusiastic Lance, Chef, and Clean. The Chief remains noncommittal, and somewhat bored. To the others, it's a wonder of wonders.

The Playboy copter descends onto the stage. The door of the Huey slides open and TWO YOUNG GREEN BERETS step out with their M16s to varied CATCALLS. When this abates, a young and extremely well-dressed man emerges. He is the epitome of the Hollywood agent. He's informal, high-strung, and good at what he does. His presence causes some stirring and occasional shouts of "ripoff" from the men. He gets a microphone from the stage, then walks to the front and addresses the men.

Lance is kneeling next to Carrie, starting to make his move. He opens her blouse, exposing her breasts.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a way we had over here of living with ourselves. We'd cut them in half with a machine gun, and give them a Band-Aid. It was a lie. And the more I saw of them, the more I hated liars.

</WILLARD>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DO LUNG BRIDGE - THE PBR - RIVER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boat edges in toward a wrecked bridge in the distance. Along the banks are sandbagged fortifications with the U.S. soldiers. There is a bright fire burning uncontrolled in the distance -- in fact there are several-flame and sparks from welding on the bridge momentarily light up the night. There is sporadic gunfire at O.S. snipers, and flares arc through the sky above the bridge.
</DIRECTION>

ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chief powers the boat forward, as Willard and Clean watch in awe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everywhere are wrecked boats, parts of jeeps sticking out of the water-a smashed helicopter on the banks. The bridge is in a state of siege. Mortars and rockets arc through the night indiscriminately and rip through the nearby jungle. Light automatic WEAPON FIRE is HEAD occasionally. The entire scene is lit by Parachute flares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the PBR edges forward, SOLDIERS run up through the water, trying to get aboard. One soldier is carrying some luggage and an M16. He splashes into the water, in a mad dash for freedom.

He and the others are left behind as the PBR continues forward. Willard sees a young LIEUTENANT kneeling on a platform that juts out into the water. He is holding a small strobe light, trying to signal the PBR down. He is holding a large mail bag and a pouch in the other hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willard motions toward the shore. The Chief turns the boat towards the Lieutenant.

He salutes, then turns and moves away. Willard hops off the side of the boat into the mud, moving up toward the shore.

EXT. SHORE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Willard and Lance walk across an open area, they are lit by the battle in the background. Lance looks up and around the embankment and along a barbed wire on the edge of the road. SHELLS SCREAM overhead. Lance just stands looking down on the phantasmagoric strings of lights, the smoke, the fires.
</DIRECTION>

Willard jumps down into a trench. We SEE a SOLDIER crouched, holding his buddy, who is crying uncontrollably.

Willard turns and moves away from the two soldiers. Lance follows.

We SEE more French and Cambodian soldiers as they step out of the fog onto the dock. They move forward cautiously. It is strange. It is like meeting up with a group of soldiers from the French Indo-Chinese War. It's as though they've stepped into 1954. The soldiers are still wearing parts of the red berets of their particular unit that fought against the Viet Minh. There are also Vietnamese who serve the French and who fought with the French. They all bear older automatic weapons and suspicion in their eyes.

So when you ask me why we want to stay here, Captain, we want to stay here because it's ours, it belongs to us. It keeps out family together. We fight for that! While you Americans, you are fighting for the biggest nothing in history. I'm sorry Captain. I will see if your men needs any help to repair your boat, so that you can go on with your war.

Amazed... immediately he knows they're harmless, done more to frighten than to injure. But still, he's never seen anything like this in all his time in Vietnam, and he knows in his gut that it is still another message from Kurtz. He moves to Chef, tries to make him stop firing.

NEW ANGLE - FULL VIEW BEHIND THE PBR AS IT PROCEEDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scale of this thing is enormous. Great enigmatic Cambodian faces carved out of stone from thousands of years ago. The fortress reaches out across the river where part of its ruins still stand on the opposite side nod on a small island. It's as though the river flowed into the great rams of the sphinx- like temple. Aligning the fortifications are concertina wire, automatic weapons emplacements. There is even wreckage of Hueys as armed machine gun nests. It is a strange combination of the very modern and the very primitive. In this installation, WE SEE LIVING families, fires, nomadic dwellings, several HUNDRED of the most primitive MOTAGNARDS that ever existed. Some carry spears, occasionally other emerge from the jungle, scurrying around with the activity that the arrival of a stranger brings. The air is heavy with the weight of hundreds of AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. A think greasy smoke hangs from fires that burn and around the fort. Fresh shell craters indicate a recent battle. Near the dock, and everywhere else, there are tangled piles of corpses, half- submerged in the water, piles of bodies of the dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the PBR moves up, a HEAD suddenly is thrust into VIEW. The heads is that of a particularly wild, long-haired, stubble- faced MAN. He has three or four camera bodies around his neck; a large bag stuffed with lenses and film. He is dressed in rags and tatters. He shouts out.

	I remember when I was with Special Forces. Seems a thousand centuries ago. We went into a camp to inoculate some children. We'd left the camp after we had inoculated the children for polio. And this old man came running after us, and he was crying. He couldn't say. We went back there, and they had come and hacked off every inoculated arm. They they were, in a pile. A pile of little arms. And, I remember, I cried, I wept like some grandmother. I wanted to tear my teeth out. I didn't know what I wanted to do. And I want to remember it. I never want to forget it. I never want to forget it. And then I realized, like I was shot, like I was shot with a diamond bullet through my forehead. And I thought, My God, the genius of that! The genius. The will to do that. Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure. And then I realized, they were stronger than we. Because they could stand it. These were not monsters. These were men, strained cadres. These men who fought with their hearts, who have families, who have children, who are filled with love... that they had the strength, the strength to do that. If I had ten divisions of those men, then our troubles here would be over very quickly. You have to have men who are moral, and at the same time, who are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill without feeling, without passion. Without judgment. Without Judgment. Because it's judgment that defeats us.
