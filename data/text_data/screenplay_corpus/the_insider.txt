INT. A JEEP, LEBANON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we're in a speeding SOVIET JEEP... Two men in front, shouldering assault rifles. HEZBOLLAH SOLDIERS... And there are three MEN in the back. A middle-aged Man wearing a tired suit and tinted sunglasses trying to hold on. And on either side of him, two Men, blindfolded. The man on one side is in his forties, hands pressed in the pockets of a well-travelled black-leather jacket... A stocky man, with the edge of a J.D. Salinger character, he's seen everything at least once. But even he has lost some of his self-confidence, here, turning his head, sensing the wind, a blast of Arabic music that disappears behind him... He's LOWELL BERGMAN. On the other side of the man in the tired suit is a lanky Man with a voltmeter around his neck, NORMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BEQA'A VALLEY, BAALBEK, LEBANON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Jeep races up narrow winding streets of a Lebanese village. It's shadowed by a Jeep in front, and in back, each carrying personnel armed with AK's and a few RPG's... And in the third Jeep are two blindfolded, not very threatening Lebanese soldiers. And as the speeding convoy passes a captured Israeli Armored Personnel Carrier covered with Arabic graffiti, looking down on them from huge murals are the stern visages of the Ayatollah Khomeini, and a Hezbollah religious leader, the Sheikh Fadlallah... And, suddenly the convoy skids to a stop... And blindfolded Lowell and Norman are roughly taken out, and pushed, stumbling, through the cloud of dust without sight... The lanky cameraman is stopped, told to wait, while Lowell is pushed past armed men guarding a small stone house, and inside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A HOUSE IN LEBANON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A round-faced Man in his mid-forties, with large-framed glasses, black hair and a grey-black beard, wearing a dullbend, a turban, sits informally at a kitchen table... It's the Sheikh Fadlallah whose face stares out at us from walls. A Gunman cradling an AK-47 sits in an incongruous purple armchair in a corner. A torn poster of the Seychelles is on one wall. Another Gunman stands by a window. Lowell is sat down in a chair at the kitchen table...

The Sheikh smiles. And the smile passes as quickly as it came. A steaming cup of coffee in a small Arabic demitasse is put down.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_SHEIKH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please to explain, why I should agree to interview...with pro-Zionist American media?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_SHEIKH>
<LOWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.

The Sheikh quietly looks out his glasses at him, studying him. And Lowell "closes":

	<DIALOGUE>
	So. Mr. Wallace. Should he get on a plane or not?

Silence. He hesitates, starts to lift his blindfold... He lifts it. And he sees the Sheikh, and his gunmen, are gone. The house empty. Only his Cameraman, the lanky man, left there, standing by the door still in his blindfold...

INT. A LABORATORY, BROWN & WILLIAMSON, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're in a SCIENCE LABORATORY... OUT OF FOCUS LAB TECHNICIANS, in white lab coats, celebrating a heavyset Black woman's birthday... Half her presents are opened. Balloons, incongruous, floating above the lab... And there's a sense that somebody is watching... And from the waist up, a disembodied figure comes into FOCUS behind a glass partition, as if quarantined, isolated, an expressionless MAN in his late forties, watching them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFFREY WIGAND'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The office soundproofed, he watches the people laughing, their lips moving. His hair not yet settled on grey, his face is changing, always interesting. Born in the Bronx, educated in Upstate New York, he retains little of the accent and much of the directness. He's JEFFREY WIGAND. He turns to resume gathering things from his desk...some technical books, a medical text on asthma...putting them in his briefcase. And as he leaves the office, the silent party like a bizarre mime behind him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY, BROWN & WILLIAMSON BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Briefcase in hand, Jeffrey appears from the elevator from ABOVE, from WIDE and in FRONT, his eyes, frozen pools... And like a bad dream, a broad-shouldered Man, leaning against the wall near the reception island in a suit he's not comfortable in, wearing an earphone, saying something into a lapel microphone after Jeffrey's passed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WIGAND'S CAR, LOUSIVILLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Light mottled through trees reflects off the car window... Jeffrey's face goes in and out of the tunnel of light and shadow...down this tasteful, suburban Louisville street of neat houses and manicured lawns... He pulls into driveway behind a 3 series BMW. It's a grey French provincial replica...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, FOYER - DAY

Jeffrey comes in and a young Girl, six, is watching television in the den...BARBARA.

He looks outside. A Woman is sitting on the back porch drinking wine, reading a paperback book, drinking wine. There's something like a Hockney painting about her against the manicured lawns. Right now the Woman comes in. She's pretty, tall, languid, reserved, somebody it would be nice to wear on your arm. LIANE WIGAND. She has an odd delay between a thought and her speech...
</DIRECTION>
<LIANE>

	Oh, I didn't know you were home... It's early... Isn't it?

INT. WIGAND'S HOUSE - DEBORAH'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And a little girl, eight, sitting on the floor in a ballet leotard, her head back, wheezing, her neck muscles contracting and bulging, her face pale, lips white, and her eyes filled with fear as rapid, shallow breathing induces a sense of suffocation. DEBORAH WIGAND is having a severe asthmatic attack...

	Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.

</BARBARA>

Jeffrey sits her on the side of her bed next to which is a Nebulizer, an air compressor to deliver medication via a tube into a circular mouthpiece.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The compressor whirs. Deborah breathes in the medication. Jeffrey brushes the hair back from her face and wipes perspiration from her forehead as...
</DIRECTION>
<WIGAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Breathe deep. Breathe deep. Slow down, honey. Slow down. Slow down.

Liane rushes in with rolled-up towels, kneels in front of Deborah, smiling to mask anxiety, and goes into the bathroom with the towels and turns on full blast the bathtub's hot water. We don't know why yet...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deborah's chest heaves. She's scared. Jeffrey gets in front of her and talks to her to arrest her attention.

	Pooh's dusty, sweetheart...he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay? So what's - what's happening to you now is... cells called mast cells told your lungs "don't breathe any more of that dust in."

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and the airways in your lungs are like branches. And when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack. And, we give you medicine, and you get better. Huh? Okay? You're better already, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIGAND>
<DIRECTION>
And the medication's taking effect and she's calmer.
</DIRECTION>

Liane, hands clutched in her lap, smiles at Deborah. Now she takes Deborah's hand and exchanges a look with Jeffrey. Jeffrey's a good father, a natural caregiver.

A handle turns. Mail truck door opens. Mailman, carrying a box, going through the gate. Doorstep. Box is deposited there. It's quiet again. The BOX sitting nakedly by the front door...

The pair of tasseled loafers walking by again... And Lowell looks up...

We're in a luxurious office with a view of Louisville. Jeffrey is waiting in a chair. Sandefur is Brown & Williamson's CEO. Two LAWYERS, their briefcases, like weapons, close at hand, sit on a couch. Their jackets are off. They wear expensive shirts.

</WIGAND>
<THOMAS_SANDEFUR>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.

</WIGAND>
<THOMAS_SANDEFUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection...we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.

And there's a seriousness that weighs heavily on the room...
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS_SANDEFUR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we've drafted a supplement to your agreement...it broadly defines and expands in more detail what is "confidential." Nobody will be able to say, "Well, hell's bells, Margaret, I didn't know that was a secret..."

Jeffrey slowly turns to face the attorney. And we see on his face the true nature of this man.
</DIRECTION>
<WIGAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what you are saying is: it isn't enough that you fired me. For no good reason! Now you question my integrity? On top of the humiliation of being fired? You threaten me?! You threaten my family?!

EXT. A GOLF DRIVING RANGE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a brightly lit, golf driving range, empty, the wet grass under the lights vibrant, emerald green... A caged cart, with one big yellow headlight, like some kind of strange insect, drives across the range, picking up golf balls. And we see Jeffrey hitting golf balls, driving one after another, after another... His swing is powerful, angry, a lone golfer, trying to chill out. He pauses, spent. Settling down, he exhales. Then, he looks down the way... And he slows... He sees in the far distance, spot-lit, one other lone golfer, a Stocky Man, incongruously in a suit and tie, watching him... And the Man in the suit right then, with great power and a tremendous follow through drives a golf ball... The ball slamming into the steel net. And the lights SUDDENLY go out. The range closing for the night. The "insect" comes to a stop. And it's quiet, dark. Jeffrey gathers up his clubs. He crosses, his golf shoes, the metal cleats, clicking on the pavement, toward the PARKING LOT. And there's the sound of the clicking of golf shoes behind him. He turns. And the stocky Man in the suit, carrying a golf bag walking some distance behind him, staring at him. Jeffrey comes to the parking lot. It's empty. Just Jeffrey's car, and despite all the empty spaces, another car, purposely or otherwise, parked right next to his. He crosses to his car, getting in...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WIGAND'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drops the three clubs in the rear seat and settles behind the wheel. He turns. And he sees the Man in the suit has gotten in the car next to his. They look at each other. The Man, in no hurry, lights a cigarette, relaxes. It's malevolent as hell. And Jeffrey, suddenly, grabbing a golf club, jumps out of his car...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE PARKING LOT, DRIVING RANGE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Golf club in hand at the driver side window...

(motioning with the club, threatening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay away from me! You stay away from me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIGAND>
<DIRECTION>
The Man starts his car, and drives off nonplussed. It's still. And as Jeffrey with the golf club stands in the empty parking lot, not knowing what's threatening him, something real, something imaginary...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE WIGAND HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - WIDE SHOT: WIGANDS' HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A violent rain's falling. And we see Jeffrey coming out of the house holding an umbrella over his little Girls. They start towards the car. There's the sound of a car door shutting. Liane, carrying lunch boxes, comes after them...
</DIRECTION>
<LIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeffrey, you forgot their lunches --

She slows, seeing someone. Jeffrey turns: it's Lowell. He's surprised.

<DIRECTION>
It starts to rain harder. They look at each other. Jeffrey, without saying a word, gets in the Car. He backs out. Lowell, left standing in the driveway with Liane in the rain. Liane goes back into the house. And Lowell starts back across the street to his car. There's a sound. He turns. Jeffrey's car, having gone around the corner, has come back and stopped in the street.

We see unpacked boxes in the small 1970's kitchen. Country- western music is playing on a radio. And we see Liane busily putting things away in a cabinet. And, then, stops and looks out the window. She tightens a knob on a cabinet. There's a moment of domestic peace for her as she sees...

Jeffrey with the Girls in a part of the backyard, kneeling in the dirt, planting a vegetable garden, putting in some small tomato trellises. We see the house, now. It's a small, one story.

Jeffrey goes into a corner of the basement, around the corner from the furnace, where his "office" is now. Unpacked boxes are on the floor. He fumbles with the combination lock on a small gun safe, lifts the lid, taking out a hand gun. Barbara followed him.
</DIRECTION>
<WIGAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit at Daddy's desk, okay? Why don't you just sit up at the desk. Get out some paper and draw me a picture, okay? What are you gonna draw me, baby? An animal, something like that? You stay down here until Daddy gets back...alright, Barbara? You stay down here.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIGAND>
<DIRECTION>
Lowell's reaction. Jeffrey's statements are stunning and powerful revelations...and dangerous ones to make.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE_WALLACE>

	All of us did. There was this whole line of people...whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE_WALLACE>
<WIGAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated...what is common language within the company...we are in the nicotine delivery business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIGAND>
<MIKE_WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's what cigarettes are for...?

<WIGAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A delivery device for nicotine.
	</DIALOGUE>

	A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...

<WIGAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gonna get your fix...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIGAND>
<MIKE_WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE_WALLACE>
<WIGAND>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIGAND>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE STUDIO, CBS - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<WIGAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIGAND>
<MIKE_WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE_WALLACE>
<WIGAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIGAND>
<MIKE_WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE_WALLACE>
<WIGAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most certainly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIGAND>
<MIKE_WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE_WALLACE>
<WIGAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor communication skills.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIGAND>
<MIKE_WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE_WALLACE>
<WIGAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't done it. There are times I feel compelled to do it. If you asked me would I do it again? Do I think it's worth it? Yeah, I think it's worth it.

INT. THE KITCHEN, THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
We see out the window a Security Guard, incongruous, walking by. And we see Liane, finished with the dinner dishes, silently wiping off the sink. There's a pall you could cut with a knife. A moment, and Jeffrey comes in the kitchen door from the garden... He stops to wash his hands in the sink.

EXT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - LATE NIGHT

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BASEMENT, THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we see Jeffrey, unable to sleep, sitting at his desk, alone in the basement, listening to classical music. He instinctively turns. And he sees Liane, in her bathrobe, has come down to sit on the basement stairs. He looks over at her. And he thinks she's come down to make up. And all she really wants him to do is say, "I need you..." But he can't... And like ships that pass in the night, nothing's said. It's quiet. She puts her hands protectively in her robe pockets. And she starts to cry...
</DIRECTION>
<LIANE>

	I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...

We see Jeffrey and his Security Man. He passes a small Filipino Woman in a nurse's uniform and a Man in clerical garb, who hands him a small American Flag, asking for donations. And, now, he passes through the metal detector. He nods thanks and walks towards us, relaxing, looking behind every so often to see if anybody is following him. As he passes Gate 3, he HEARS over his shoulder...

INT. RICHARD SCRUGGS' KITCHEN - 7:00 A.M.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey is sitting with Scruggs and Motley in Scruggs' kitchen around a semi-circular counter. Coffee and sweet rolls. It's casual. No one's dressed for court. Scruggs has been looking through the sheaf of subpoenas. About Motley, we sense power held in reserve.
</DIRECTION>

	Now, what this one is, is a temporary restraining order, a gag order, issued by a Kentucky court.

</WIGAND>
<MICHAEL_MOORE>

You're assaulted financially, which is its own special kind of violence. Because it's directed at your kids...what school can you afford... How will that affect their lives. You're asking yourself: Will that limit what they may become? You feel your whole family's future's compromised...held hostage...

A white, traditional, Southern house, with a veranda and gables...a large front lawn with weeping willows. And we see Lowell, hands in his pockets, not an insider or an outsider, waiting alone on the expansive lawn. The front door opens. A Mississippi State Trooper, putting on his round brimmed hat comes out and crosses the driveway. Then Jeffrey coming out with Motley. Motley talks to him on the veranda for a moment and then heads towards his car. Meanwhile, Jeffrey comes down over to Lowell on the lawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Jeffrey looks off, across the street from the house, at the Gulf. And we see the street is blockaded by Mississippi State Police cars. An armed camp. Other men in suits, Lawyers and state officials, wait. Ron Motley gets in his car and drives away.

Motley's car parks, and he and an Assistant are approached by a flurry of media from the parking lot behind us, crossing Canty Street to intercept him. And we SEE the lot is jammed with Mercedes-Benzes, Town Cars and limousines belonging to the 150-200 Big Tobacco, Wall Street lawyers. Some hang out by their cars, killing time. It's a tailgate party. Beyond them are trucks and vans with satellite dishes supporting the media circus. They're all here for Jeff's deposition.

Then. it's the three men, standing on the lawn. Time seems to slow...all of them aware it's a critical decision, personally and historically...
</DIRECTION>
<WIGAND>
<DIRECTION>

And there's a sudden flurry of activity. Jeffrey and Scruggs walk to a Mississippi State Police car. Lowell gets into his car and drives away, separately. Police, State Officials, run to their cars. Cars starting, lights flashing, Wigand's car pulls into position.

INT. SCRUGGS' CAR - JEFFREY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in the back seat with Scruggs. The driver's a State Policeman. Jeffrey watches the small town of empty lots, old buildings, a 1930's Deco school pass by. It's all heightened, especially vivid to his eyes somehow. And he exhales heavily to calm himself, to focus...
</DIRECTION>

EXT. THE COURTHOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some of the Tobacco Lawyers, their jackets off, still hanging across Canty Street by their cars. And now they see the police lights turning, coming around a corner, moving towards the courthouse. The caravan stops. First, Scruggs gets out. A moment, then Jeffrey appears. And the Reporters pounce on Jeffrey, cameras flashing...Mississippi Police leading him through the crowd... Moore appears at courtroom door (already there). And as he's whisked away into the courtroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE COURTROOM, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

Lowell stands on the porch looking out at the rain. There's a slight sound. He turns. And Jeffrey's come outside. He stands leaning on the porch railing, looking out at the rain and windswept trees. They're quiet. They share a look. They nod to each other. The smallest nod of accomplishment. And they're there on the porch, alone, outside the house in Pascagoula, Mississippi.
</DIRECTION>

INT. CBS EDITING ROOM, NEW YORK - AFTERNOON

We see Lowell, unusually buoyant in the same clothes as yesterday. He's working with Tony Baldo on a cut of the show, the net result of his architecture of events, his combination of persuasion and integrity...

We see on the Avid monitor a single of Jeffrey...

Baldo now runs Lowell's edit of the above sequence. And we SEE THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sandefur in CLOSE-UP states "I believe that nicotine is not addictive." Wigand in matching CLOSE-UP states "I believe he perjured himself." Then all seven CEOs of Big Tobacco stand up and raise their hands and take an oath in front of Congress to tell the truth while Wallace says "...the whole line of people, the whole line of CEO's up there, all swearing that." And Wigand says off-screen with great emphasis "Part of the reason I'm here is I FELT"...and it cuts to Wigand for a pause that makes the word "FELT" resound and, then, he goes on to say on-camera "that their representation clearly misstated what they commonly knew. We're a nicotine delivery business." We see the combination of art and truth woven into impact that has an audacity that's stirring and beautiful...

It's Jeffrey in the front seat, driven by one of his security men. He's coming home under the cover of darkness. They pass a FLAMING CAR on the freeway shoulder. Jeffrey turns to stare at it. They turn off onto city streets and stop at a light. Jeffrey's nervous. Jeffrey instinctively turns. A Police Car stops alongside. The Policeman looks at him. Eyes meet. Jeffrey looks away. The signal takes forever. It changes. And as the Police Car moves off...

The car's stopped at the curb. Jeffrey gets out. He starts up the walk, and the Second Security Guard quickly crosses the lawn to intercept him...

The house is quiet, dark. Too quiet. Too dark. Something isn't right. He crosses to one of the children's rooms...the master bedroom. The lights are on. Both rooms are empty. He goes into the kitchen and sees a note that's been left for him... He opens it. He sits heavily in a chair, reading the note. The Security Guard peers... And as Jeffrey sits in the silent house, the hero come home...

	I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.

No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!

<LOWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I got it. 500 pages of it. They looked in every corner of this guy's life...from a spousal abuse charge, to shoplifting, to a traffic ticket he got once for running a red light. It's Terry Lenzner's outfit, IGI. Jack, listen to me. Their strategy: discredit this guy, ruin his reputation in The Wall Street Journal, and then nobody will ever listen to what he's got to say about tobacco. He's dead. Unless I can get this thing knocked down.

And as we DOLLY AROUND Wigand, more walls MORPH into the side yard, and, turning slowly, he sees Barbara and Deborah in the emerald-green grass. They stop and smile, then they stare at us, at their father. And he looks at his children, at an idyll lost... The chair, the man are the only real objects left in the view from inside his head...

	No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?

</LOWELL>
<MIKE_WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE_WALLACE>
<LOWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOWELL>
<MIKE_WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? "In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?" What "future"? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone.

He trails off. They look at each other.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, along the way I suppose I made some minor impact.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did Iran-Gate and the Ayatollah, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Saddam, Sadat, etcetera, etcetera. I showed them thieves in suits.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've spent a lifetime building all that. But history only remembers most what you did last. And should that be fronting a segment that allowed a tobacco giant to crash this network?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does it give someone at my time of life pause?

<DIRECTION>
(simply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE_WALLACE>
<DIRECTION>
And the look on Wallace's face is "It did. Whether it should or should not...what difference does that make? It did." And we realize only now that he has not come to argue.

Lowell looks down at the page. The headline is "'60 MINUTES' ORDERED TO PULL INTERVIEW IN TOBACCO REPORT."

	And in the editorial... It accuses us...of betraying the legacy of Edward R. Murrow.

Turning, he walks out and down the hallway. Lowell looks at the newspaper.

INT. THE COMMUTER HELICOPTER - MORNING

The helicopter approaching Manhattan. John Scanlon sitting with Hewitt, both of them reading The Wall Street Journal Wigand article.

</DON_HEWITT>
<LOWELL>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti- capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else...do you need?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOWELL>

And Hewitt, looking around.

<DON_HEWITT>

INT. LAX - ECU: LOWELL - NIGHT

Tired, his suitcase at his feet. We don't know if he's coming or going. He's at a pay phone in the more-deserted- than-not airport.
</DIRECTION>
<LOWELL>

</LOWELL>

He hangs up and ambles over to a lounge with a few travellers sitting in it.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE_WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"CBS Management wouldn't let us broadcast our original story and our interview with Wigand because they were worried about the possibility of a multi-billion dollar lawsuit against us for tortious interference... But now things have changed."

INT. JEFFREY WIGAND'S APARTMENT, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small apartment. Jeffrey dishes out second helpings of pasta primavera into two pasta plates and brings them into the kitchenette to his girls, Deborah and Barbara. And now we SEE AND HEAR the small television on the table playing "60 Minutes" and...
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL_MOORE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	"...in my opinion, is an industry that has perpetrated the biggest fraud on the American public in history."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
Deborah looks proudly at her father.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wigand's gotten up and gone out of the kitchenette. He has stopped for a moment around the corner in the hallway. His kids can't see him. We can. And he watches them and his eyes get shiny and start to tear. And as he stands there, watching his girls at the kitchen table witnessing their father's hard-earned "truth" on television, we realize that of all the audiences, his girls are the one he cares about most...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRPORT LOUNGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Lowell in his moment of victory is watching his "60 Minutes" double segment on a departure lounge television with his feet resting on his suitcase, next to a Chicano woman with two kids and her mother and an older man with a beard and cane. An airport cleaner stops to watch, too. Lowell glances at him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unbeknownst to these viewers, arrested by the content on the television screen, is that the man who made it sits casually among them, watching his work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, BERKELEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sharon sits at the kitchen table. She watches in a far corner a small countertop television. It's "60 Minutes," the full show entitled "Jeffrey Wigand, Ph.D." and on the top right, "PRODUCED BY LOWELL BERGMAN." As Sharon continues watching the television playing on the counter, the emotional currents within her remaining unrevealed...

<BILL_ROBERTSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I promised you a three-hour heads- up...well, here it is. Have a camera crew standing by in Helena, Montana on Tuesday and I'll give you a three-hour head start. Alright? By the way, that was a hell of a good show tonight...

And he quietly hangs up. And it's still. Sharon's laid down, closing her eyes. They lie close together. After some moments, she opens her eyes and lets us know what she's been thinking...

There's an odd look on his face, not the look of a victor. He shuts off the light. And as they lie close together in the dark in each other's arms...

WE'RE LOOKING AT THE FAMILIAR CBS EYE ON A TELEVISION SCREEN. AND THEN THE WORDS: "SPECIAL REPORT."

INT. MASTER CONTROL ROOM, CBS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lowell, entering through machine rooms, into a state-of-the- art Master Control Room. On a wall are fifty or more monitors, in the humidity-and-temperature-controlled nexus of CBS operations. And it's jammed with people, witnessing a fast-breaking, major news event. Mike Wallace stands near Felling. Lowell crosses past Felling and stands next to Mike Wallace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we see footage of a handcuffed, bearded, barefoot Man...THEODORE KACZYNSKI, the UNABOMBER, being taken in by the FBI. A director counts down. Dan Rather launches...

<DAN_RATHER>
