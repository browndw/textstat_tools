<DIRECTION>
EARTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rolls into FRAME. A bauble of green and blue and white swirls of cloud cover. The eerie clip and whistle of cosmic rays is drowned out by static and someone singing 'MY WAY' - in Russian.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING INTO FRAME - A SOVIET CAPSULE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gleaming white. Black letters on its side, CCCP. A Russian COSMONAUGHT in his space suit is outside, repairing radio antenna. He's the one singing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE CAPSULE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three COSMONAUGHTS, two men and a woman, in gym shorts and red T-shirts, are busy floating to their stations. The CAPTAIN, teases his space walker.

A piece of spare debris! The discarded chunk of a failed satellite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE CAPSULE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The COSMONAUGHTS notice the debris on its deadly course toward the COSMONAUGHT outside. Looks of consternation are exchanged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The COSMONAUGHT sees the debris moving toward him. He tries to react, moving first right then left.

</COSMONAUGHT>

Tumbles helplessly out of orbit, head over heels, out of control. The door hatch is clearly damaged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE - THE CREW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trying desperately to regain control of the ship. They are tossed about like clothes in a spin dryer.

The spinning stops! The COSMONAUGHTS exchange startled looks.

The SPACE SHIP moves slowly through the FRAME, now upright and in control, gliding through space.

<DIRECTION>
Carrying the SHIP gently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON SUPERMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face shines with the same familiar resolve, the same steady strength, the same calm in the heat of crisis the world expects. He turns and sees the lost COSMONAUGHT moving away in space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flies off towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The COSMONAUGHT is losing consciousness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. - MOVING TO THE COSMONAUGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something overtakes him. He stops tumbling! Through his helmet, we can see his surprise. SUPERMAN carries the COSMONAUGHT to the capsule. He maneuvers the COSMONAUGHT to the airlock. Eases him through the hatch, then repairs the damaged door.

THE EARTH BELOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The warm sunlight highlights recognizable landmasses. This is home. Africa rolls slowly by. Then we see SUPERMAN float above Europe. Over the Atlantic, the ocean sparkles in shades of blue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The continental states appear as precisely detailed as every map in every school room in America. SUPERMAN hovers for a moment as if to admire the view. He arcs TOWARD us and then disappears below.

Fresh wildflowers adorn the graves.

Shares a silent moment with the good people who raised him. Hands in his old jeans. Sleeves rolled up on his workshirt. He's for now just an orphan boy from the Midwest.

CLARK'S X-RAY VISION P.O.V. - FAR DOWN THE ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can see the dirt cloud of a car heading his way. CLARK turns and hurries toward the barn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BARN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the middle of the barn, CLARK has excavated a deep hole. He jumps out and hurries under the hayloft, reaching for...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HAY-COVERED TARP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK brushes off the hay, removes the canvas cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUSH IN TO REVEAL - KAL-EL'S ROCKET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The metallic carcass of the space vessel that carried the young KAL-EL from KRYPTON to Earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK DRAGS THE SHELL ACROSS THE BARN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He maneuvers it deep into its new hiding place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP CLARK'S HAND BRUSHES INTERIOR OF THE SHIP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A soot-covered CONTROL PANEL begins to glow with a soft GREEN LIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Startled, CLARK crouches inside the space vessel. A VOICE, at first distorted, is familiar.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
Now we HEAR what is an old message from JOR-EL.
</DIRECTION>
<JOR_EL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	by now Kal-El you are entering the atmosphere of the planet known as earth ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOR_EL>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK is overwhelmed by JOR-EL'S voice.
</DIRECTION>
<JOR_EL>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I pray you have made a safe journey. The yellow sun of your new home will give you great physical powers ... but it cannot console your spirit. Placed aboard this vessel is an energy module ... all that remains of a once powerful civilisation -- Krypton, your mother planet. It is my last gift to you. Once removed, the ship will grow cold and silent, and you will be finally alone. The power in the module can be used but once. Use it wisely . . . my son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOR_EL>
<DIRECTION>
The message whirrs slowly down and is finally drowned in static. For a moment the vessel glows then fades out. CLARK reaches under the "dashboard'. and carefully retrieves the module.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WHIRLWIND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Small, but strong, starts to envelop CLARK as he climbs from the ship. His hair blows as the wind and dust increase in intensity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE PIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK reaches the top as the whir1wind peaks and then, as quickly as it appeared, it's gone. All is silent and calm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BARN FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the last of the dust settles' we see the pit has been filled in. CLARK, carefully crad1inq the module, stares, saying a final, silent farewell to his past, his childhood, his innocence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE BARN - A CAR HORN BLARES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK quickly stashes the module under a tarp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BARN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big OLDS is parked by the barn door. LEVON HORNSBY, a grey-haired banker, is about to enter the barn.
</DIRECTION>
<HORNSBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clark! You in there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORNSBY>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK pops out of the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Mr. Hornsby. It's been a long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
HORNSBY tries to peer over CLARK'S shoulder into barn. CLARK distracts him with a handshake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK(Cont.) (smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've just been tidying up for when you show the place.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HORNSBY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't I mention that there was an offer to buy ... sight unseen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORNSBY>
<CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
(politely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, but I don't want to sell the farm to a big developer. Whoever buys it has to want to keep a working farm. I don't think we need another shopping center.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
HORNSBY frowns like he's heard it too many times.
</DIRECTION>
<HORNSBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darn it, Clark Kent, why are you so stubborn? Today nobody wants a farm. Blink your eye and they'll all be gone. That's progress!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORNSBY>
<DIRECTION>
HORNSBY catches CLARK off-guard and the barn. strolls into the barn.

	<DIALOGUE>
	My, oh my! Look at this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORNSBY>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK is relieved to see it's not the module, which barely protrudes from under the tarp but a baby's CRIB off to the side. Its wooden headboard has been cracked perfectly in two.
</DIRECTION>
<HORNSBY>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont.) (laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a joker old George Kent was.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(fingering the crack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I asked your dad what happened to the baby's crib.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Oh, Clark must have kicked it."
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORNSBY>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad liked a good joke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
HORNSBY indulges himself with a laugh. CLARK chuckles politely. But changes the subject. CLARK grabs an old mitt, a ball and a bat.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe your grandchildren would like these, Mr. Hornsby.
	</DIALOGUE>

<HORNSBY>
<DIRECTION>
(taking them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, thanks, Clark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORNSBY>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK ushers MR HORNSBY out of the barn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK OUTSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HORNSBY rolls the ball in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<HORNSBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Batter up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORNSBY>
<DIRECTION>
He tosses CLARK the bat, then jogs several yards away. He makes a dramatic wind-up. CLARK sights, then assumes a batter's position. HORNSBY throws. For a minute CLARK looks like he'd love to take a mighty cut. Instead he misses completely.
</DIRECTION>
<HORNSBY>
<DIRECTION>
(remembering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah, you never could hit a curve ball.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORNSBY>
<CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
(polite, but resolute)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'll hold out for a real farmer, Mr. Hornsby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<HORNSBY>
<DIRECTION>
(walking back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . and you were just as obstinate as your father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORNSBY>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK walks HORNSBY back to his car. HOLDS the door for him.
</DIRECTION>
<HORNSBY>
<DIRECTION>
(after he starts it up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be careful in that big City, Clark. You're a long, long way from where you were born.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORNSBY>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never forget that, Sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
HORNSBY guns his car and disappears down the road. CLARK smiles and picks up the ball and bat. A naughty young boy's smile creeps over his face. He throws up the ball, takes an easy swing. CRACK! The ball sails endlessly way, way, up into the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A YOUNG CHILD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swaddled in red and blue cloth is carried through a smoky hall. Explosions thunder outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHILD'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VOICES are distorted, the noises terrifying. The child is placed lovingly into a cradle-like capsule. Around him, bright flashes of fire. A glass canopy is gently lowered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PLANET KRYPTON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Against the blackness of space. Silent for a moment. The planet erupts in fire. Exploding in a hellish apocalypse. A streak of white escaping from the dying planet marks the child's rocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLARK KENT'S APARTMENT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ringing of the telephone blends with the roar of the dream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ANSWERING MACHINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clicks on. CLARK'S voice on the tape. He was clearly uncomfortable when he recorded the message.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARK>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, Hi, this is Clark ... Kent. Please leave a message at the beep.

	Clark ... it's Lois. I hope you're up. Perry wants us in the office on time. Something big is going on. . . Au Revoir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOIS>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK Jumps up and reaches for the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Lois. I'm up. Gee, I wonder what Perry's got in mind ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
It takes a moment for CLARK to realise that he is talking to himself. LOIS has clicked off and all that's left is the dial tone.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh well, bye Lois.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
BREAKFAST TABLE - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK rushes to pour a bowl of Wheaties, but realises too late the milk has turned sour. Now he scrambles for his briefcase. The radio is on.
</DIRECTION>
<D_J>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O. )
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And ... in the news, we have word that the East-West arms control talks have broken down. The President is scheduled to address the nation later ... and that is the good news - just kidding ...

INT. SUBWAY STATION MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK patiently filing slowly follows a long line of commuters through the turnstiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE PLATFORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A train has appeared. LOIS steps on board just as CLARK arrives on the platform. He calls after her.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lois!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
She turns just as the doors close behind her. She points to her watch and gives CLARK a disapproving look through the glass. The train pulls out, leaving CLARK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON CLARK - X-RAY P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK squints slightly and follows the train into the tunnel, peering through the walls to see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LEAD CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An elderly ENGINEER sits before computerised controls. Suddenly, he clutches his heart.
</DIRECTION>
<ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, please. . .no. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
He pitches forward unconscious. The train gathers speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE PASSENGER CARS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK continues to scan with his X-RAY VISION. He sees LOIS, reading "FRENCH PHRASES FOR TRAVELLERS", unmindful, as are the other passengers, of the impending disaster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK ON THE PLATFORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Realising a disaster in the making, he moves out of sight and slips off his glasses. This is a job for ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's off in a flash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN'S P. O. V. - INTO THE TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Skimming just above the tracks, Superman tries to overtake the train.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIDE ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As SUPERMAN begins to fly past the cars, "startled PASSENGERS spot him out the window. The relative speed of the train makes SUPERMAN seem to move in slow motion. LOIS looks up from her reading just in time to see SUPERMAN fly by. She runs to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<LOIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Superman!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOIS>
<DIRECTION>
He turns his head just long enough to acknowledge her with a half-smile. He speeds ahead to meet the speeding subway. He stands calmly right in its path. The headlights grow larger and larger, bearing down on SUPERMAN! He takes one step back and purposely kicks his foot into the third rail!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON SUPERMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As an electric current roars through him. A blinding white-hot penumbra glows about him. He has become a human sun! Sparks shoot off like fireworks. The lights flash and go out. The electric current is shorted. One by one the green signal lights flash off. The out-of-control train is cut off from its energy source. In the ENGINEER'S booth the control lights flicker off. Inside the cars, the passengers stand in darkness as their train loses speed. Now SUPERMAN leaps behind the last car and, pulling gently, helps ease the train to a stop. In a flash, he's at the ENGINEER'S booth and flies the unconscious man onto the platform where a RESCUE SQUAD is just arriving.

EXT. QUARRY -DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stone quarry - a white scar on the landscape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PRISON CHAIN GANG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knee-deep in ooze, they shovel out debris near a track into the quarry. Overseeing the forlorn rednecks are TWO ~FEDERAL MARSHALS, toting rifles. A dumpy farm truck is parked on the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN DOWN THE LINE OF CONVICTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Most are shirtless in the heat, dripping sweat. A sunburnt inmate with Elvis sideburns is wailing a country lament. Most of the other MEN hum along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE END OF THE LINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly we HEAR what sounds like classical music being whistled just loud enough to bother a CHUBBY CON. The con turns to the last man on the chain.
</DIRECTION>
<CON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is that god-awful noise you're makin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CON>
<DIRECTION>
THE LAST MAN ON THE CHAIN -- LEX LUTHOR !

The only man whose work clothes are still clean, still pressed, still fashionably accented with a tie. He merely leans on his shovel.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>

	Mozart, my low-forehead friend. Even this wretched pit can't diminish the spirit of true genius ...I while you've been bending your back in this foul slime, I've been inspired! Life itself began in a murky pool much like this. And a genius such as myself learns to seize the moment. You are the first to know that I now have a plan to recreate life itself!

LUTHOR expects awe. Instead, all he gets is a vacant stare as the CON squishes a huge mosquito.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
62. A CADILLAC CONVERTIBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driving down the middle of the track, screeches to a halt by the WORK CREW. Music blaring: from a: state-of-the-art wall-to-wall stereo system.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUT OF THE CAR - A TEENAGE KID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reeking of snotty sarcasm and bratty insults. He's dressed in a careful distillation of the worst effects of punk and heavy metal. A Walkman permanently about his neck.

His smile disappears. He steps back. He slips his WALKMAN from around his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE WALKMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the KID turns it over to REVEAL a REMOTE CONTROL UNIT. He quickly punches in orders. . .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE CADILLAC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The top quickly closes down and locks. Startled, the TWO MARSHALS are frozen by confusion. The car door locks click shut. Engine starts. Windows up. All in a flash.

THE CADILLAC ROARS OFF

<DIRECTION>
Under its own control. The MARSHALS stare hopelessly as the WHEEL TURNS ITSELF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARSHALS' P. O.V. - STRAIGHT AHEAD - OVER THE EDGE
</DIRECTION>

A sheer drop to the quarry floor. The KID increases the speed and OVER THE EDGE INTO THE QUARRY and EXPLODES. The KID turns and scrambles until he finds LUTHOR.

INT. ELEVATOR - DAILY PLANET BUILDING - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors open and CLARK rushes off. It's odd, but the hallway is surprisingly empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CITY ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cavernous sprawl of desks and word processors. CLARK runs in and freezes. Every desk is empty. Not a soul is stirring. Not even a copy boy.

<PERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're late, Kent!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PERRY>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK turns around in time to see PERRY WHITE march past the door. The editor-in-chief stops just long enough to scowl at CLARK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWN THE HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK catches up with PERRY.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, sir. I promise it won't happen again.

Now PERRY WHITE stops dead in his tracks. Face to face with CLARK.

<PERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha!

PERRY shakes his head and disappears into the conference room.

</CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
INTO THE CONFERENCE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . everybody?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody is crammed at one end of the long table in the newspaper's strategy chamber. JIMMYOLSEN and LOIS LANE flank PERRY WHITE as he sits. All the other REPORTERS, EDITORS and STAFF are there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE - DAVID WARFIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Impeccably dressed with a folded pocket handkerchief, the aristocratic tycoon slips contemptuously through the morning edition of THE DAILY PLANET. Behind him are a few unctuous CRONIES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STYLISH YOUNG WOMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sits on WARFIELD'S RIGHT. She's in her mid-20's with a natural beauty carefully moulded to fit VOGUE.

WARFIELD and PERRY WHITE are squared off like two frontier gamblers.

	Don't tell me. You only read the pictures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PERRY>
<WARFIELD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In fact, Mr. White, I only read the ledger. A ledger which the previous owners paid so little attention to that I was able to buy the paper out from under them. The Daily Planet hasn't made money in three years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARFIELD>
<DIRECTION>
Now the lovely girl smiles. She speaks with a clenched-teeth, upper-crust intonation.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the name of the game is making money.

</GIRL>
<WARFIELD>

As his politeness dictates, CLARK steps forward.

LACY just stares at CLARK'S outstretched hand. He pushes his glasses up, smiles and steps back.

	Once upon a time The Daily Planet was a nice paper. Now it's ... fatigued. I've brought with me mock copies of our new layout.

</LACY>
<DIRECTION>
She holds up a tabloid-sized paper with a giant headline screaming: 'SUMMIT KAPUT! IS WORLD AT BRINK?' Underneath is a picture of a model in a bikini with her hands folded in prayer.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, the world isn't really at the brink. Isn't that headline, a bit irresponsible?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<WARFIELD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe. But it's a hell of a circulation booster.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARFIELD>
<DIRECTION>
PERRY'S face turns various shades of magenta. He rises slowly.

<PERRY>

<CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
(building to a crescendo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Warfield, I think I speak for all of us when I say we'll do our best to co-operate. But a reporter's first allegiance is to the truth. The people in this city depend on us. And we can't let them down! . . . Thank you.

CLARK shakes her hand and leaves the room. LOIS folds her arms with a look to LACY that says 'He told you.'

	Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout

<DIRECTION>
(salutes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.

For a moment LACY seems genuinely hurt. But she covers it up quickly.

General laughter at Jeremy's expense. The TEACHER sighs. She didn't expect much. JEREMY, the dreamer, blushes. Now he's thinking.

JEREMY looks out the window to the blue sky. Then he stands up. Surprised at himself.

THE SUPERMAN EXHIBIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TOUR GROUP forms a semicircle around the statue. At the back of the GROUP -- what seems to be a FATHER and SON -- both wear dark glasses and baseball caps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON - A GLOBE OF THE EARTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Made out of solid steel. Branded on it is its weight: lOOO lbs. It hangs suspended by a long thin strand of what seems to be black wire, attached to a crossbeam. All protected by a glass case.
</DIRECTION>
<GUIDE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing it out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Superman has graciously donated a strand of His hair to the museum. So we all could have the fun of seeing how strong he really is. Here you can see a 1000-pound globe easily suspended by his single hair.

Oohs and aahs from the GROUP.

<DIRECTION>
THE GROUP LEAVES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But not the 'father' and 'son.' Once the pitter patter of feet on the linoleum floor fades, the 'father' takes off his hat and glasses. We see his bald pate. It's LEX LUTHOR. He saddles right up to the statue.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
<DIRECTION>
(addressing the statue)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess who! . . . Of course it's me! Your old buddy! Lex Luthor . . . Hey, you don't look too bad yourself. 'Course I've put on a few pounds, but what the hey! They feed you a lot of starch when you've in prison.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(his Jokey tone becomes more deadly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was 'prison' . . . as in where you put me, Mr. Clean. Say, we should get together soon. Over lunch, over dinner, or ... over your dead body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
ON LENNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's standing by the glass case containing SUPERMAN'S hair. He slips an iron MALLET out of his jacket. Throws off his baseball cap to REVEAL his buzzcut hair with purple highlights.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
<DIRECTION>
(to LENNY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<LENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(thinking hard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A toupee that flies?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LENNY>
<LEX>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<LENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But why the hair?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LENNY>
<LEX>
<DIRECTION>
(gazes into the case)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
LEX nods at LENNY. LENNY raises the iron mallet above the case. CRASH. Alarms SOUND all over the museum. As LEX reaches for the hair, LENNY lights several SMOKE BOMBS and tosses them down the wind. In moments the SMOKE begins to bellow, creating a shroud around LEX and LENNY.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>

	'. . . I don't care if everybody thinks I'm a space cadet. Once you've destroyed all the nuclear missiles in the world, they'll see I was right. Superman can make sure we don't blow ourselves up. Quick and easy. Thanks a lot. I know you'll come through. Your friend, Jeremy.

Before LOIS can leave, LACY snatches the letter.

	An angle?

JFK HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The American flag is buffeted by the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CLASSROOM - JEREMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still daydreaming, eyes fixed outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JEREMY'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, SUPERMAN seems to be hovering in the air just outside the window. He smiles at JEREMY.
</DIRECTION>
<JEREMY>
<DIRECTION>
(leaping to his feet)

	Whoa!

</JEREMY>
<TEACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeremy! Do you have a question?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEACHER>

JEREMY looks outside, SUPERMAN is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought ... I ...I was just daydreaming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<DIRECTION>
The CLASS laughs. JEREMY slumps down. A beat, then there's a KNOCK at the door. All heads turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTO THE ROOM - SUPERMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's carrying JEREMY'S letter. Walks down the aisle.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to the TEACHER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry to interrupt your lesson, but I wanted to answer Jeremy in person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Heads turn to JEREMY. Ridicule replaced by awe.
</DIRECTION>
<TEACHER>
<DIRECTION>
(finding her tongue)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Class ... we have a guest speaker. A friend of . . . Jeremy's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEACHER>
<DIRECTION>
JEREMY is beaming. New-found friends slap "five" with him.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the most important letter I've ever received, Jeremy. But I'm afraid what you're asking is . . . impossible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
JEREMY is stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Impossible? Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<SUPERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERMAN>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away? What good was my letter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<SUPERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.

Twenty confused faces. JEREMY looks crushed.

	I'm sure we all want to thank Superman for taking the time to visit us.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. We understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEACHER>

SUPERMAN takes a long walk back down the aisle.
</DIRECTION>
<JEREMY>

(just before SUPERMAN is at the door)
</DIRECTION>

</JEREMY>
<SUPERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.

SUPERMAN turns. JEREMY looks right at him. His eyes are the color of disappointment. One of his classmates sniggers at JEREMY.

INT. LEX'S LAIR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One wall of LEX'S laboratory is a COMPUTER BANK marked by digital readouts and heat calibrations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NUCLEAR CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A translucent glass door, much like a PRISM, glowing as it turns through all the colors of the light spectrum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTREME CLOSEUP - LEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A look on his face we've never seen before. He has even amazed himself.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am ... smarter than I thought. It's working!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns to LENNY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quick, Lenny. Prepare the Nuclear Chamber . . . Lenny?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no answer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lenny! . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(screams)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LEONARD!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
THE LAB - LENNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With his WALKMAN over his ears, he's beating against the air with two drumsticks. LEX scowls and FLICKS LENNY'S earphones. LENNY yowls.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
<DIRECTION>
(threatening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the radiation suits!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
LENNY brings out two WHITE WORK SUITS. He and LEX dress quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIGHTS GO DOWN IN THE LABORATORY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only the prismatic glow from the chamber illuminates the room in blues, golds and greens. LEX carries a glass petri dish. His hands protected by aluminum gloves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON THE DISH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A seething dash of protoplasm seems to grow right before our eyes. LEX slides the dish into the chamber. Closes the door. Locks it tight.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every day the earth is bombarded by radioactive cosmic rays. Over millions of years, the radiation made single cells evolve into . . . us. Now, Leonard, your Uncle Lex, using this protoplasm I've grown from Superman's cells, will duplicate Creation itself in a matter of seconds!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON LEX'S HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it hits a sequence of computer commands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUSH IN SLOWLY - TO THE NUCLEAR CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The reaction begins. The lights flash, building and building until. . . a monstrous ROAR! An almost human voice screams. LEX shuts off the reaction. He and LENNY tear off their protective headgear.
</DIRECTION>
<LENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(scared)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LENNY>
<DIRECTION>
LEX reacts. Listens.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's . . . alive!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
Another ROAR from the bowels of the chambers. LEX punches the door lock. The door slides open.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now . . . watch how he obeys my commands . . .

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . Come on, big boy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - THE OPEN DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR the sound of heavy FOOTSTEPS. LENNY glues himself behind LEX, peeking around his uncle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: CRASH! THROUGH THE LAB WALL - THE NUCLEAR MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Concrete and debris fall everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<LENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LENNY>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON - THE NUCLEAR MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LEX'S monster appears to be a huge young man with long arms and a long neck. The beast spots LEX and slowly reaches its arms toward him. Opens his mouth. The sound that comes out is hideous and barely comprehensible.
</DIRECTION>
<NUCLEAR_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	F-f-f-f-faaather. . . !
	</DIALOGUE>
</NUCLEAR_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
LENNY steps around LEX, walks up to the beast.
</DIRECTION>
<LENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He called you father. What a . . . moron! He needs something to wear too, Uncle Lex. Unless you want to let him out looking like this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LENNY>
<DIRECTION>
LEX looks over to NUCLEAR MAN and realizes he's naked. LEX grabs a pair of workmen's coveralls from a hook on the wall and tosses it to NUCLEAR MAN. NUCLEAR MAN grabs it, confused.
</DIRECTION>
<NUCLEAR_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I need this for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NUCLEAR_MAN>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
LEX picks up a solid IRON INGOT. He hands it to the MONSTER.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now break it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
The NUCLEAR MAN hesitates, then he SNAPS the ingot in two.
</DIRECTION>
<LENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</LENNY>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
Now LEX takes a MACHINE GUN out and aims it at the BEAST.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stand back, Lenny!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
LEX FIRES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bullets smack into the NUCLEAR MAN. He seems confused. But he hardly flinches.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
<DIRECTION>
(a big grin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good. Now. . . the final test . . . let's see if he can fly. . . I command you to rise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
The NUCLEAR MAN turns his head in confusion, wrinkles his brow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he rises ... too quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE CRASHES INTO THE CEILING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And plummets in a heap to the floor. Plaster and sprinkles down. LEX and LENNY run to lift him up.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay, he needs a little coaching.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
An idea dawns on LEX.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lenny, hand me the Daily Planet. It's time for Metropolis to get a taste of my Nuclear Man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
LENNY gives LEX the paper. He flips through it.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't 'know what this country's coming to. This used to be a fine paper -- Aha, here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - THE NEWSPAPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A picture of a new night club. Headline reads: GRAND OPENING OF CHIC NIGHT SPOT TONIGHT! A WHO'S WHO OF METROPOLIS TO ATTEND!
</DIRECTION>
<LENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LENNY>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
LEX walks up to his creation. Stands face to face. The expression on the beast's face is something in between confusion and fury. The coverall hangs awkwardly from his frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LEX holds up a PHOTO OF SUPERMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I created you for one reason only ... to destroy this man.

CLOSE ON THE NUCLEAR MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles as best as his wretched muscles will allow. It's almost a childlike smile.

	Yes . . . f-f-faaather. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</NUCLEAR_MAN>

BEAMS OF SEARCH LIGHTS

Criss-crossed in a basked weave against the Metropolis night. For a moment, we see a quick flash of SUPERMAN, then he disappears.

An endless line of supplicants wait humbly to see if they'll be admitted into the latest court of chic.

THE METRO CLUB - FRONT DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two beefy BOUNCERS stand side by side,. barring the way. A young COUPLE, hand-in- hand, are trying to peek inside.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, it's our honeymoon and we just wanted to have one dance here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_GUY>
<YOUNG_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I can tell everyone back home. Please? One dance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK and LACY are behind them. The BOUNCER spots LACY and pushes the COUPLE out of the way.
</DIRECTION>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, Miss Warfield.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
He scowls at CLARK.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm with . . . her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
He hurries inside after LUCY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. METRO CLUB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loud, packed, glitzy -- sensory overload.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO CLARK AND LACY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She guides him through the frenzy. They have to talk loudly to hear each other.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
(being polite)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never been in a place like this before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<LACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LACY>
<DIRECTION>
Forcing their way onto the dance floor, they start dancing. But it's so crowded, CLARK is bumped and jostled incessantly. As is everyone else. But CLARK is the only one who stops and says, 'Excuse me' every single time.
</DIRECTION>
<LACY>
<DIRECTION>
(finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clark!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he stops dancing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They get the idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LACY>
<DIRECTION>
Now a Don Johnson surrogate cuts in on CLARK. CLARK backs away sheepishly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. METRO CLUB - FRONT DOORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK squeezes between the TWO BOUNCERS.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be right back. Need some fresh air.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
The BOUNCERS just shrug. CLARK looks up and down the block. He spots the young COUPLE standing forlornly at the end of the long line. CLARK walks calmly the other way until he turns the corner. Takes a deep breath ... and then ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EFFECTS: ZOOM! ONE LONG BLUR AS WE TRACK CLARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Around the block, speeding beyond human perception.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END OF THE LINE - THE YOUNG COUPLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are there. And then they are not.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. METRO CLUB - FRONT DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TWO BOUNCERS lean against either side. They only feel a sudden shot of air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. METRO CLUB - ON THE DANCE FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The YOUNG COUPLE suddenly find themselves right in the middle of their dream. They're too stunned to move. CLARK acts as if he was just passing by. He leans over.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe you're supposed to dance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
The nod and start dancing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LACY Obviously unhappy with the Don Johnson clone. Now the music changes. It's romantic and bluesy. The floor empties out except for a few couples. Including the out-of- towners.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK CUTS BACK IN
</DIRECTION>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK takes her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think this goes here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
He puts her hand on his shoulder. They dance in the ballroom position.
</DIRECTION>
<LACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LACY>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK and LACY dance the old-fashioned way.
</DIRECTION>
<LACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LACY>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<LACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LACY>
<DIRECTION>
The out-of-town YOUNG COUPLE is dancing with their eyes closed. They BUMP into CLARK, shoving him closer to LACY. A moment of intimacy, then . . .
</DIRECTION>
<LACY>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet you have some freckle-faced, pig-tailed girl named Billy Jean waiting for you in Smallville.

	Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<LACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LACY>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<LACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LACY>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sounds kind of pessimistic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<LACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LACY>
<DIRECTION>
She is sincere and CLARK is obviously touched by her sadness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - GROUND LEVEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK and LACY, toe to toe, a forest of dancing feet around them. And then, ever so slightly, LACY'S shoes LEAVE THE GROUND WITH CLARK. Just an inch above -- but they are nevertheless dancing on air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON LACY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Closes eyes for a moment. Then shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<LACY>

EXT. FRONT DOOR - THE TWO BOUNCERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing at the door is the NUCLEAR MAN. He's dressed in what can only be called a psychotic version of hip. His hair has been stood up on end.
</DIRECTION>
<ONE_BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a pass, Mister?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ONE_BOUNCER>
<NUCLEAR_MAN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	N-n-n-no . . .

</NUCLEAR_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The other BOUNCER gives him a little shove.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then scram, before you scare away the customers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_BOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
The NUCLEAR MAN looks down at where the BOUNCER shoved him. Then he reaches out and lifts both BOUNCERS by their necks. We can HEAR the cracking of bones. With ease, the MONSTER THROWS THE BOUNCERS . . . WHOOSH! The two BODIES crash land in a dumpster behind the club.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE METRO CLUB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LEX'S CREATURE is dazzled by the lights. The CLUB DJ hits the STROBE LIGHTS turning all the guests into pulsing images. The NUCLEAR MAN bumps into dancers, knocks over drinks, collides with waitresses, upending their trays. A walking disaster zone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HIP GUY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrying two drinks has them knocked out of his hands by the MONSTER. He turns and throws a punch at the BEAST. The NUCLEAR MAN catches his fist. CRUNCH! He crushes it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BY A PILLAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The NUCLEAR MAN holds on and switches to his X-RAY VISION.

<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, cutie, let's boogie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The NUCLEAR MAN turns to see an over-the-hill WOMAN, completely sauced, squeezed into spandex pants, flirting.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like the rugged type.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She slips her arm around him. Whispers in his ear.

Thoroughly confused, he watches as she takes his big hand and pulls him out of the club.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE METRO CLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The NUCLEAR MAN and the drunken woman weave through the CROWD. She yanks him along into the alleyway that runs beside the club.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOVERS in silhouette. She stumbles up against him and undoes his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HIS CHEST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thoroughly repulsive, crackling and smoking. The WOMAN screams.

WARFIELD expects a big reaction. But LACY is staring out the window, something else' on her mind. Mumbles aloud.

INT. CITY ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY, LOIS, and CLARK are staring at the latest edition. CLARK is heartbroken. PERRY charges through. He looks more well turned-out than we have ever seen him double-breasted pinstripe suit. He carries the papers under his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<PERRY>

	I'm through taking it lying down.

	Clark, there's nothing any of us can do. It's Superman's decision. I'm sure he knows what he's doing.

JEREMY approaches CLARK.

</CLARK>

	Just tell him I didn't mean to cause him trouble. Tell him not to listen to what all these papers are saying. I just want him to do what he thinks is right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK is moved. He puts an arm on JEREMY'S shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. I'm sure Superman cares a lot more about what's in one boy's heart than all the editorials.

<DIRECTION>
The blue-white world of frozen seas and perpetual daylight. SUPERMAN glides toward what seems to be glacial mountains, dazzling in reflected light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN LANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands for a moment at the base of icy peaks. His thoughts racing. Finally, he stamp his foot against the frozen tundra. The ground shakes and shivers rumble through the ice. Thunderous echoes resound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Respond to the pounding tremors. Snow begins to shake loose, snowing down, revealing the glimmering surfaces of THE FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE.

<DIRECTION>
INT. FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE - DAY

SUPERMAN stands in the centre of the great cavern. Smooth glazed walls surround him. The green crystals containing the history of KRYPTON give off emerald lights that dance about the ice palace.

<DIRECTION>
He touches and activates the crystals.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PLANET KRYPTON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From outer space as the cataclysm overwhelms it. One small ROCKET escapes this fiery apocalypse. The planet explodes. Disintegrating before our eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN'S REACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the terrible fate of his natural home plays once more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - SUPERMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wondering if his decision now might have the same effect. Around the cavern, the lights and voices soften until they are no more than a polyphony of sighs and a fantasy of colors.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know I have been forbidden to act, but now the Earth awaits a fate as terrible as Krypton's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, and then . . . the great cavern erupts in thunderous cacophony. Sonic vibrations send SUPERMAN falling to his knees. Another image appears before him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PLANET EARTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A celestial garden across the universe from KRYPTON. The voices of the ELDERS that once argued with JOR-EL now assault his son.
</DIRECTION>
<ONE_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The earth is too primitive. You can flee to new worlds where war is long forgotten.

	<DIALOGUE>
	If you teach the world to put its fate in any one man -- even yourself -- you are teaching them to be betrayed . . .

The word 'betrayed' echoes as the image disappears. The bright sunlight of the northern world floods into the Fortress.

They stride forward along the busy Metropolis street. In their wake a hundred double-takes, astonished glances. JIMMY runs along, taking pictures. A few curious onlookers begin to follow SUPERMAN. He never varies his pace. Eyes forward. Across a busy intersection. Horns blare in recognition. The crowd swells behind him. He looks up.

<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN'S P.O.V. - A HUNDRED FLAGPOLES - AT THE U.N.
</DIRECTION>

The flags of the nations. Every colour and every pattern imaginable. They lead in a straight row along the river. SUPERMAN quickens his step. JEREMY keeps up. The crowd now spills over into the street. POLICE are rushing in to control the excited throng. A Volkswagen car forces its way through. LOIS is driving.

Jump out of the car. Start to push their way through the crowd.

A Soviet missile launcher flanked by CREW on foot and with its attendant control moves into view and comes to a halt.

MISSILE LAUNCHER MEMBERS VEHICLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CREW prepares for the launch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RISING FROM THE LAUNCHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A nuclear MISSILE. It trembles, almost like slow motion.

<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT - LAUNCHER

<DIRECTION>
A fiery burst and then the dreaded contrail arcs across the sky over the frozen landscape.

SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN rides the deadly Soviet missile, guiding it out of the atmosphere. The first step of his long peace mission.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOOKING DOWN FROM THE STRATOSPHERE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can see the outline of Russia on the curve of the Earth's horizon. A white dot grows larger rapidly until we identify SUPERMAN and his heavy load.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPACE AND GIANT STEEL NET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN guides the missile into a vast net constructed of steel hawsers which is floating in space and filled to capacity with the world's nuclear missiles. He dumps the missile with the others and closes the net.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING INTO FRAME - THE SUN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The yellow star in the sky source of life on Earth, is actually a tremendous concoction of nuclear fusion. Great tentacles of fire roar off its surface. Storms of a billion megaton force bubble in its core.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a great effort SUPERMAN whirls the huge net around and around and unleashes it. The net grows smaller and smaller on its path to the sun. We lose sight of it for a beat. Then, one vibrant orange explosion tells us it has been destroyed. SUPERMAN hovers for a Moment, and then turns for home.

SUPERMAN TURNS TO LEAVE

A beat, then the SUN FLARES behind him. In the deathly silence of the chemical chain reaction, LUTHOR'S experiment erupts.

SUPERMAN'S P.O.V.

He gazes back toward the sun. Nothing seems amiss. He circles the Earth and heads for Metropolis.

As it falls it sheds its gaseous cocoon, finally exploding apart. It is born . . .

We examine it as it examines itself. Its rippling sinews glow with the heat of atomic fusion. On his chiseled face is a demonic scowl.

The creature is magnificent! Illuminous. And much more frightening than the original creature.

They suddenly glow bright red, like two searing hot coals embedded in flesh. Then they cool down and return to normal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE: THE NUCLEAR MAN'S P.O.V. - THE EARTH

He circles wildly as if angered by something or someone. Then he shoots for earth with a ROAR that he breathes out in waves of fire.

INT. METRO SPORT CLUB - DAY

A state of the art fitness centre for the young and affluent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN AEROBICS CLASS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE the mirrored reflection of rows and rows of young men and women doing bouncy calisthenics to a disco trash beat. MOVING DOWN THE ROWS we spot LACY in happy sync with the class. NEXT TO HER we pick up CLARK KENT -- in a baggy sweatsuit that both obscures his physique and, with his glasses, makes him look more appropriate for remedial education. He's perpetually one beat behind. Suddenly the whole class turns to the right. CLARK turns left. Then CLARK turns right and they turn left.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARK>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I should sit this one out.

NAUTILUS ROOM - LATER

LACY and CLARK and lots of lithe bodies on the weight machines. LACY sits down at an Overhead Pull Bar and counts off a quick 10.

	<DIALOGUE>
	If you say so. Here goes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to pull at the bar. Straining he gets it halfway down. Then he loses his grip. It acts like a catapult sending CLARK off his chair and onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Need some help?
	</DIALOGUE>

Standing over CLARK is PAUL a blow-dried denizen of the club. Tall, well-pumped and proud as a peacock. PAUL gives CLARK a hand up. Speaks to LACY.

</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
PAUL walks away to continue his workout while LACY helps CLARK up.

PAUL comes over to have another joke at CLARK'S expense. He tests the largest barbell. It won't budge. Then taps CLARK.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>

LACY waves and runs into the girl's locker room. PAUL nudges CLARK again.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well . . .!

Distracted, CLARK easily tosses the heavy weight to PAUL who flips over backwards with it. Crashing into the floor, pinning PAUL beneath it.

<LENNY>

Their P.O.V.

NUCLEAR MAN has stopped in mid-step. He has stepped out of the shaft of sunlight into the shade. He is still immobile. LEX and LENNY move back to him, LEX reaches out and touches him.

She leaves and CLARK wanders into the dining room where LOIS is placing a vase of roses on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<LOIS>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hi, Clark. Can you believe it! Warfield gave me a list of questions to ask Superman.

She hands a typed piece of paper to CLARK.

<CLARK>

	<DIALOGUE>
	'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<LOIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOIS>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Politely?

(to LACY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . Um, hey! Neat dress.

LOIS rolls her eyes. CLARK never gets the romance right.

<LACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LACY>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>

He leaves and the door is closed. SOUND: WHOOSH. A beat and LACY re-opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CORRIDOR

A flash of SUPERMAN'S red and blue turns the corner as LACY'S head comes around the door.
</DIRECTION>
<LACY>

<SUPERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Lois. It's been a long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON LOIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes sparkle. And once again we're reminded that no matter how tough, no matter how caustic, LOIS LANE is at heart a romantic. And her heart will forever hold only one word - SUPERMAN!
</DIRECTION>
<LOIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too long.

	Very nice to meet you. That's a lovely dress you're wearing.

	Something smells wonderful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERMAN>

She sits next to SUPERMAN on the sofa. Very close.

<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN looks into the kitchen, through the oven, where the dish cooking. Using his X-RAY VISION , we SEE the food glow for a few seconds. He's cooking it quickly. It's his only chance to get LOIS out of the room. He smiles at LOIS.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERMAN>

<LOIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>

</LACY>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.

She takes his arm as they cross the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<LACY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can one man be so square and so delicious. Very well. We'll go back up and make chit-chat. But if I have to face Superman, so do you.

CLARK blanches as they reach . . .

<SUPERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes it does. Very beautiful. Our whole world is beautiful.

LOIS' voice trembles lightly.

THE NUCLEAR MAN

His eyes and skin start to glow then actually turn molten . . . and thereby elastic.

HE FLARES TO TWICE HIS SIZE

His proportions distend horribly, as his body radiates a foul cloud of heat. Flexing his fiery sinews he returns to a normal human size. A display meant for SUPERMAN.

Trailing light. An eerie grin on his face, he starts to circle through the churning storm . . . at impossible speeds . . . churning and turning the storm into . . .

That descends as a TORNADO into the town.

The town will surely be destroyed if he doesn't act.

The tornado begins to lift the house off its foundation. SUPERMAN flies into the eye of the tornado. He circles in the opposite direction of the twister -- faster and faster until he's Just a red blur. The tornado slows its rotation gradually.

Watches as the tornado dissipates into a soft mist. The sun breaks through -- its warm light bathes the family.

SUPERMAN STEPS OUT OF THE HOUSE

Carrying two-year-old JENNY, he hands the child to her parents. On a distant hill stands the NUCLEAR MAN -- he seems to be taunting SUPERMAN .

SUPERMAN FLIES OFF

Panic and scatter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flies toward the scene. The NUCLEAR MAN sees him and starts a barrage of stones and bricks in the direction of SUPERMAN. He hurls hundreds of them, at super-speed, into SUPERMAN'S path. SUPERMAN knocks them aside and heads for the WALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TOURIST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Running from the scene, slips and falls off the edge of the WALL. SUPERMAN flies in, catches her, and returns her safely to her husband.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLUR OF MOTION

As SUPERMAN, re-assembles the WALL. In a moment, every brick and stone is back in place. He looks up to see NUCLEAR MAN flying away. He takes off to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN catches up with NUCLEAR MAN. They struggle and NUCLEAR MAN tries to scratch SUPERMAN with his GLOWING FINGERNAILS. SUPERMAN recoils, allowing his adversary to escape earthwards where he appears:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER A VOLCANO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Which towers by a peaceful seaside town. NUCLEAR MAN sees the volcano and smiles. First his eyes, then his entire being, glows red.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE DIVES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Straight into the volcano's mouth. A BEAT, then suddenly, a tremendous explosion - NUCLEAR MAN comes roaring out of the belching smoke, the deadly river of molten lava following.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TOWN BELOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As church bells start ringing, sounding the general alarm, TOWNSPEOPLE look up to see the lava moving down the slopes towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flies into view. He spies another mountain sitting peacefully nearby. At SUPER-SPEED he flies around and into it, as if his very body were a buzz saw, cutting the top off and flies it to the volcano.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIKE A CORK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drops the mountain top, inverted, onto the volcano, stopping the flow of lava.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TOWNSPEOPLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cower in fear, as the lava, which did escape makes its inexorable way down the mountainside.

Blows his SUPER-BREATH into the lava flow, freezing it in, place and takes off once more in pursuit of NUCLEAR MAN.

<DIRECTION>
Recoi1s as his hands freeze. Now he, in his turn, blows ice-cold breath at SUPERMAN who instantly starts to freeze into:

A BLOCK OF ICE

<DIRECTION>
Which slowly tumbles away into space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN ENCASED IN THE BLOCK OF ICE

He eventually smashes free.

Intercepts NUCLEAR MAN who drops the Statue so that it falls towards the crowded city streets. SUPERMAN dives and catches the statue before it can hit the ground.

SUPERMAN flies the Statue above the city back to its rightful place, when, SUDDENLY:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON STATUE OF LIBERTY AND SUPERMAN

NUCLEAR MAN appears through the observation door in the torch. SUPERMAN is helpless, burdened by the Statue, as NUCLEAR MAN closes with him and pierces his skin with his claws.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON NUCLEAR MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He breaks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SUPERMAN
</DIRECTION>

Instantly weakened by the intense radiation, and in agony, SUPERMAN just finds the strength to replace the Statue before tumbling to the ground at the base of the Statue.

CLOSEUP: SUPERMAN

Each time his face is illuminated it seems to be aging! It is a subtle but melancholy effect. But mortality is raging through CLARK'S body. With his last bit of strength he places the module on the ledge. He reaches out to switch it on.

The doors close on SUPERMAN. NUCLEAR MAN unleashes a raging torrent of flame which engulfs the elevator doors. Then looks up and:

NUCLEAR MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Takes off, straight up, without thought and crashes up through the ceiling of the lobby.

He moves up, through every floor, crashing through as startled EXECUTIVES, SECRETARIES, CLEANERS etc. look on.
