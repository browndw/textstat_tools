INT. CAR DRIVING DOWN COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIRSTY GOODING looks out the passenger window as the trees go whizzing past. She's attractive, late twenties, warmly sophisticated. Something makes her smile. She turns to the driver and thinks real hard as she says this.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Cubic root of nine thousand two hundred and sixty one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRSTY>
<DIRECTION>
TREVOR is her husband, late twenties as well. God gave him brains and beauty. He has used them both prodigiously.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?

<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eighty four.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Kirsty takes a calculator out of her purse and double checks the math.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You win! Okay pull over.

</KIRSTY>
<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But... I thought...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<KIRSTY>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick-tock...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRSTY>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor waits a moment to see if she's kidding.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRSTY>
<DIRECTION>
(through clenched teeth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PULL OVER NOW.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRSTY>
<DIRECTION>
Then pulls over to the side of the road. Kirsty reaches over, quickly unzips his pants immediately goes down on Trevor OUT OF FRAME. He reacts accordingly. A little pleasure, utter shock.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRSTY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(from BELOW FRAME)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey what's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRSTY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Kirsty rises INTO FRAME once again.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<KIRSTY>
<DIRECTION>
(self-conscious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRSTY>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry honey the present situation isn't exactly fodder for an erection. Shouldn't we be getting to the hospital?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
FULL ON Kirsty. For the first time WE SEE her big pregnant belly sticking out. She looks at Trevor innocently.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was going to keep breathing you know. You think I'm an amateur or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRSTY>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor stuffs himself back in his pants, puts the car in gear and presses the accelerator.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<KIRSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been cheating on me haven't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRSTY>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<KIRSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRSTY>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would never cheat on you. Not while you're pregnant now you know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<KIRSTY>
<DIRECTION>
(features tightening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay... uh oh here comes another one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRSTY>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Share the pain Kirsty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
She takes Trevor's hand and squeezes as hard as she can. IN CLOSE UP WE SEE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SOLVED RUBIC'S CUBE sitting between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Do we need this vision of the solved rubics cube?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car is approaching a bridge.
</DIRECTION>

INT. CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Trevor takes his hand off the wheel to look at his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One fifteen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<KIRSTY>
<DIRECTION>
(in dire pain)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God...... Trevor, I think my water just broke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRSTY>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor grabs the wheel again. Kirsty GASPS.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRSTY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God. It's coming out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRSTY>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>

</TREVOR>
<KIRSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THE BABY IS COMING OUT! I CAN FEEL IT! SONOFABITCH IT HURTS!! AAAGGGGHHH!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRSTY>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor looks at her, trying to stay calm.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay Kirsty don't panic. Just keep breathing! DON'T PANIC! Put the seat back and hold on to something. Were almost there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Kristy's hand moves down the along side the seat between the door and she plunges back with the seat. She looks at Trevor wide eyed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shes about to give birth in a Chevrolet.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(breathing heavily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRSTY>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't happening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Kristy starts to convulse with pain. She begins to tremble and her arms flail about in an attempt to ease her discomfort. She grabs Trevors arm for support.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, take it easy. Your gonna be alright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Kristy becomes more violent, kicking her legs up onto the dashboard. She starts grabbing Trevors arm a little more violently, causing Trevors to weave a bit on the road as he recoils.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAR DRIVING DOWN COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car lunges to the side of the road and weaves a bit in the gravel. Up ahead a bridge approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor regains control of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kristy! Take it easy. everythings gonna be alright. Com'on, start the breathing, with me... come on. One, two-three, and blow..
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor starts the lamanns method alone, as Kristy appears to have passed out from the pain. She has her head leaned away from him and is limp in the passengers seat.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Krist. Honey. Kristy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Kristy doesn't answer. Trevors puts his arm on her and shakes her. She doesn't react.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kristy! Honey wake up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Trevors attention is now on his unconscious wife rather than the two lane road which stretches across the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, wake up. Please wake up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
And with that Kristy's does exactly that. She lunges toward him in a violent spasm and scares the shit out of him (and us) which causes Trevor to now completely lose control of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rest is a blur...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Trevor loses control of the steering wheel... Kirsty SCREAMS... Their car skids from one side of the bridge to the other-careening toward the guardrail- SMASH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car is plummeting toward the river below. Trevor and Kirsty brace themselves. The car hits the surface...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RIVER, UNDERWATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor flounders through a disoriented flurry of bubbles. He breaks the surface and gasps for air. Getting his bearings he see the car bobbing on the surface, the current is separating him from his wife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treading water, he looks out at the car and there she is trapped inside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirsty
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still belted to her seat. Her eyes are wide with desperation, breath quickening, sinking fast... Kristy pounds the window with her hands, trying to get out. She's trapped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Apparently giving in, she presses a hand against the windshield just before the car disappears under the surface...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor paddles hard to the shore. Exhausted, he crawls onto the shore underneath the bridge they just jumped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor stands trying to process what just happened in the last fifteen seconds. He screams out for his wife, and to what has just happened.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kristy! Kristy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor drops to his knee's in distress.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God, Kristy! Please Kristy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(frantically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so sorry, Kristy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
He hears something from above and looks up. A chunk of the bashed-up guardrail from the bridge has just snapped off and is sailing right down toward him-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TREVOR BLACKS OUT JUST AS THE THING HITS HIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHITE LIGHT FLOODS HIS VISION...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor's eyes blink open, darting left and right. He is on a bed, his head bandaged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ANGULAR NURSE ENTERS the room, walking up to Trevor's bed.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is she...? Where's Kirsty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Nurse grabs Trevor's right arm and straps it to the side of the bed. She isn't exactly one of God's gentler creatures.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, what are you-
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
She moves to Trevor's legs, strapping them down as well, then his other arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By now SEVERAL SURGEONS ENTER the room, features obscured by surgical masks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Nurse fastens a clamp around Trevor's head, attaches it to the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor is completely discombobulated. The surgeons gather behind Trevor's bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON TREVOR'S FACE as he struggles to see what's happening back there but it's useless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He cannot move a muscle. He hears a sickening SAWING noise and his eyes bulge in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE as the doctors calmly lift Trevor's freshly sawed cranium from his head exposing his brain. The CHIEF SURGEON- a large unshaven man with magnifying lens alreaday in place make his eyes enormous and his face grotesquely distorted. He walks up, presented with a tray full of evenly arranged pins. He cranks up the magnification of his lenes which make his eyes appear even larger. Though no one speaks his name his name tag reads Dr. Barker.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you people doing?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Chief Surgeon takes one of the pins and gently pushes into a Trevor's frontal lobe.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's happening to-!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor's eyes glaze over and his jaw relaxes. The chief surgeon speaks in an english accent.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_SURGEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you can see I just accessed the speech center, temporarily shutting down all verbal ability.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF_SURGEON>
<DIRECTION>
As the Chief Surgeon continues he takes several more pins off the tray.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_SURGEON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The goal is find the exact point in the brain where moral decisions are made, the place where right and wrong is distinguished. In exploring this Morality Center I will most likely be triggering memories, disrupting the unconscious. Our patient may experience some distress during the proceedings but they are not due to pain. It is merely our patient- recalling his past...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF_SURGEON>
<DIRECTION>
Chief Surgeon slips another pin into Trevors exposed brain.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_SURGEON>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As he was thrown into the lake, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF_SURGEON>
<DIRECTION>
The Chief Surgeon voice lowers and his eyes turn black. The eye magification no at a hideous level, showing jet black eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_SURGEON>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where you will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(rev.20:10)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor looks at the frowning nurse who is watching over him. Chief Surgeon sticks a needle into another spot on Trevor's brain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TREVOR'S POV: The nurse is suddenly a pale gargoyle with blackened eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor opens his mouth to scream and-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-IN A BURST OF WHITE LIGHT, AN ANGELIC WOMAN is now standing before him. She is bathed in a haze of white light.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELIC_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well? What do say Trevor? Que pasa?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELIC_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor relaxes. His bindings are gone. The gargoyle nurse is gone. The surgeons are gone. And his brain is sitting safely within his inviolated skull, upon which now sit a few electrodes. The bandage is no longer there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But from his pain wracked expression we know the pain in his head is still very real. He reaches for his head, makes sure its all intact.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where do I start?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<ANGELIC_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's the old noggin? Any change in the intensity?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELIC_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She touches him gently.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELIC_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you describe the pains?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELIC_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor looks up. The angelic woman smiles back at him. She's in scrubs, a stethoscope dangling from her neck. Trevor winces.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure. How about a jackhammer in the Occipital lobe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up a pad and scribbles something on it. Trevor notices she's wearing a nameplate. Dr. ALLISON DORMERE.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you a dream too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<ALLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLISON>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<ALLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLISON>
<DIRECTION>
Terevors quickly recalls the accident. Fearing the worst.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<ALLISON>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your wife...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLISON>
<DIRECTION>
AN OLDER DOCTOR walks in. AMBROSE. He gives Trevor an icy look, then looks at Trevor's chart.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLISON>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ambrose)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still a little hazy. He's still in pain too, even after the morphine. I recommend we admit him. At least for another day...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(leaning in, sotto)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He just asked for his wife...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLISON>
<AMBROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I can't find any abnormalities. I think we're ready for discharge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBROSE>
<ALLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, Dr. Ambrose-
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLISON>
<AMBROSE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking up at Trevor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's time to ween you off these painkillers too. Wouldn't want you to develop a dependency to them. You might do things like come to the hospital for no reason other than to get a fix, wouldn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Ambrose gives Trevor a fatherly smile then EXITS, not even looking at Allison. Allison watches him go, then turns back to Trevor... then smiles perkily.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well looks like you're going home! Hope you brought your bus pass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLISON>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor starts nodding out. The bus is practically empty. TWO BLACK CHILDREN a boy and a girl sit across from Trevor. A CREEPY OLD WOMAN sits further back, knitting something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CHURCH BELL RINGING causes Trevor to wake again up, wincing at the sound. As the church passes the BELL becomes louder and louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor hears LAUGHTER and looks up at the children. The girl and her brother seem to be play-fighting over a toy they hold between them. Trevor looks at the toy getting stretched this way and that.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you kids mind keeping it down?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
The creepy old woman speaks up.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aww let them be. They're only kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor notices what the Old Woman is knitting is a baby's bootie. As the children continue to laugh at him Trevor stares at the bootie tears welling up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor lives in a dingy place, one step up from poverty- level. Funny thing is this used to be a nicer place. We see remnants of a feminine touch long since past. Dirty dishes sit in the sink. A cockroach skitters across the kitchenette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor sits at his TV playing an extremely violent videogame. We're talking heads getting blown off, bodies exploding, limbs being severed. As the end ends a DEMONIC VOICE chuckles from the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DEMONIC_VOICE_FROM_TV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU LOSE...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEMONIC_VOICE_FROM_TV>
<DIRECTION>
The screen flashes TRY AGAIN? Trevor takes a swig of beer and sits back in the easy chair looking at something atop the TV. A picture of Kirsty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TREVOR'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor looks through an old photo album. Pictures of him and Kirsty. Some pictures of him. A lot of pictures of Kirsty. Smiles, smiles, smiles...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops at one close up of them mugging at a camera they've pointed on themselves. All we see is their faces, the rest is dark and blurry, except for one thing. A small shadowy object Kirsty is holding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CUBIC ROUTE ACTUARIAL RESEARCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dressed in a button down shirt and tie, Trevor walks up to the pale utilitarian box-like structure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CUBIC ROUTE, BULLPEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a maze of cubicles iced by harsh fluorescence. It is a mill of data research, where the TAPPING of fingers on computer keypads never ends...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TREVOR'S CUBICLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... no thanks to Trevor, who has already resumed his head-in- hands position at his desk. He rubs his eyes, seemingly blinded by the screen staring back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN Trevor's age rolls up on his office chair beside Trevor, banging into the desk. BRET. Trevor's co-worker and cubicle mate.
</DIRECTION>
<BRET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRET>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<BRET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. It was made by your ass. You've been dragging it all fucking week. What happened to you yesterday?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRET>
<DIRECTION>
Bret eyes Trevor suspiciously. Then smiling...
</DIRECTION>
<BRET>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never came back after lunch. Did you get a piece o'ass, you bastard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRET>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<BRET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRET>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<BRET>
<DIRECTION>
(getting uncomfortable)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRET>
<DIRECTION>
Bret casually gestures to a surveillance camera overhead that sweeps across the room like a prison spotlight.
</DIRECTION>
<BRET>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just looking out for ya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRET>
<DIRECTION>
Bret slides back over to his work station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor puts his hands on the computer keys and starts to type. A jolt of pain rips through his cranium forcing him to stop. Bret stops typing and breathes an exasperated SIGH.
</DIRECTION>
<BRET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sixty five point three percent of all headaches are due to low sugar levels in the bloodstream Trevor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRET>
<DIRECTION>
A light bulb seems to go off over Trevor's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BREAK ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the narrow room blasted in fluorescent light, Trevor eyes a vending machine, examining its wares. He peruses the sundry sugary snacks, looking for just the right fix.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's so quiet in here we can almost hear his head pounding in pain. He shuts his eyes. A couple of the fluorescent bulbs over his head wink out and the rest flicker weakly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Trevor opens his eyes again he notices the room has gotten considerably darker. He looks up at the weakening lights and grunts in disgust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light is just dim enough now so that he can't see what's in the vending machine. He goes right up to the glass and peers into the machine, using his hand as a visor. This strain on his eyes intensifies his headache.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's still pretty murky inside the glass case. Trevor squints and just when he thinks he can read a wrapper on... what is it? A candy bar?-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PALE HAND suddenly presses against the glass from inside the machine. Trevor jolts backwards. The hand is gone. But in the reflection of the glass Trevor notices someone has been standing behind him. He whirls around-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-and is face to face with our worst nightmare: PINHEAD.
</DIRECTION>
<PINHEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's too late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINHEAD>
<DIRECTION>
Pinhead lashes out at Trevor striking his face with a clawed hand the rips his face clean off. The lights are back up as Trevor slams against the machine and grabs his face. It's still there!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where Pinhead was standing is THE WOMAN who just slapped him.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SNAP OUT OF IT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She is attractive and studious. Her sensible business attire can't hide a very curvaceous body. This is Trevor's supervisor GWEN.
</DIRECTION>
<GWEN>

FLASHBACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK FLASHES of Kirsty's hand pounding on the windshield, the car sinking into the lake, a quick cut of a dark figure with a bright ring, and shots of two naked bodies slamming against each other in climax course through Trevor's mind. Finally, over the images of erotica we hear Gwens voice as one of the characters.

INT. TREVOR'S CUBICLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor relentlessly crunches numbers at his computer. He pauses a moment to stretch and rubs his eyes. A PING from his computer announces he has an INTEROFFICE MEMO- FILE ATTACHED. Trevor goes to the mailbox on his screen, clicks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up comes a jpeg slideshow. Each picture is of Gwen dressed in a piece of sexy lingerie. The caption underneath reads WORK HARDER. Looking around his cubicle, he then takes another look at the jpeg. Trevor stands up in the cubicle and we see him peer the outer office looking for Gwen. He sits back down. Embarrassed Trevor closes the memo at least for now.

It is a dank crumbling room. A place where sunlight is not welcome. DETECTIVE LANGE, a handsome graying gentleman who's plagued with a chronic case of post nasal drip, sits at his desk.

	For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.

INT. TREVOR'S CAR - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Kirsty's eyes are closed. She is motionless. Trevor tries to look at her while watching the road at the same time.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kirsty. Jesus, wake up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
This time she doesn't wake up.

EXT. ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car fishtails. Trevor loses control and the car skids from one side of the bridge to the other- careening toward the guardrail- SMASH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car is plummeting toward the river below... The car hits the surface...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERWATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor flounders through a disoriented flurry of bubbles. He swims up to the passenger door and tries the handle. It won't give. Unable to breathe Trevor finally swims up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He breaks the surface and crawls onto the shore...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks out at the car to where she should be trapped inside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevors eyes are wide with desperation, breath quickening, The car is sinking fast...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at the car and calls out, but there is no Kristy insight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car disappears under the surface...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor hears something from above and looks up. A chunk of the bashed-up guardrail is sailing right down toward him-

TREVOR BLACKS OUT JUST AS THE THING HITS HIM

	Uhh. Yes detective, sorry. Just trying to recollect, you know?

Lange nods.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. From what I remember now, maybe my wife was thrown from the car when it hit the water. Maybe she wasn't trapped inside.

Lange checks the report again. He believes Trevor...or does he?
</DIRECTION>
<LANGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a start. I'll tell the people trawling the river maybe it makes a difference maybe not. Thanks for your help Trevor. If we have any more questions you'll get a call from myself or my partner Detective Givens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGE_S_VOICE>

Lange stands up and backs up awkwardly to a file behind his desk. Trevor stares at him suspiciously.

Trevor exits, both men maintain eye contact as the door closes between him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUS STOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bus pulls up to the curb. Trevor climbs out and starts walking down the empty street. As soon as the bus pulls away, the only sound heard is Trevor's footsteps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV BEHIND TREVOR: We see Trevor's back from a slight distance. Someone is following him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sensing this, Trevor looks behind him. Nothing but an empty sidewalk. Trevor hurries his pace, almost there at his apartment building. He glances behind him again. Nope, nobody there... then suddenly-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-A DARK FIGURE passes under a streetlight on the opposite side of the street. Trevor turns a corner no picking up the pace a little. The DARK FIGURE follows, it picks up it's pace as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevors walks an d approaches a small alley way. Should he take this home?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A enraged Pitbull nearly rips his nose off as it Barks and lunges to the end of a heavy chain leash. Trevor (and us) about piss our pant's. The dog continues barking, Trevor regains his composure. Suddenly the dogs attention moves toward the direction of the DARK FIGURE. Amazingly, it stops barking and actually cowers back into the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooked, Trevor rushes up to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hurries up to his apartment building and lets himself in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks out on the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure is walking up the building opposite his. It's features are shrouded in shadow, but it is definitely staring at Trevor, who slams the apartment door behind him. He peers out at the street from inside the front hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevors looks around the apartment. He opens the fridge, it lights up the darkened room. He grabs one of the three items sitting on the wire racks. About to twist off the cap off a cold beer, when a light out his window urges him to investigate. He draws the curtain open and GASPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV OUT WINDOW: Staring back at him, from a dimly lit window in the apartment building across the street, is the SHADOWY MAN that followed Trevor home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man's face is shrouded in shadows but Trevor can see he's holding something bundled up in a blanket. The light in the window winks out, rendering it dark again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor can almost still see the figure somewhere in the darkness still gazing at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor looks a little sick all of a sudden, like he can't breathe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BELL FROM A DISTANT CATHEDRAL begins to peel. BONG... BONG... BONG...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor opens his mouth to draw in a breath but instead spits out a massive amount of water!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BONG... BONG... BONG...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor falls to the ground, arms and legs thrashing, heaving up mouthfuls of water. Trevor is drowning...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BONG... BONG... BONG...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the puddles of water, we see bits of debris: leaves, pebbles, etc. Finally, a hideous eel-like creature's head pokes out of Trevor's gaping mouth- it escapes and slithers across the floor, up the window sill and out into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-the ringing bell stops abruptly and he takes in a humongous lungful of sweet oxygen. He then notices he is completely dry. Stunned, he looks about him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor is now laying on the easychair, nursing a beer. His videogame is flashing PLAY AGAIN? Whoa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BING-BONG! of his doorbell startles him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor gets the door to find a striking young GOTHIC WOMAN on the other side. Black hair, lipstick, fingernails. She smiles (too brightly for someone with such somber appointments) then summarily lifts her shirt to just below her breasts for Trevor.
</DIRECTION>
<GOTHIC_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here it is, what do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOTHIC_WOMAN>

Trevor looks down at her stomach, the lower half of which contains tattoos which just break the surface of her jeans. At its center is a navel pierced with a studded black pearl, which Gothic Woman then plays with. Trevor looks a little confused.

Trevor paces in his living room. Looks at watch. Then the door. Still no sign of Gwen.

INT. TREVOR'S APT. - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Trevor rummages through a closet. Reaching up to a shelf above him, he tugs at a big cardboard box and pulls. The entire box comes crashing down and out spill about fifty VHS tapes, all hand-labeled: KIRSTY & TREVOR, then the date.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts one in the VCR, hits play...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's his wedding video. Trevor watches the festivity of the wedding ON THE SCREEN, he smiles for the first time.

The wedding portion of the tape ends and a not-so-clean edit takes us into the honeymoon.

SMASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A VIDEOCAMERA ON A TRIPOD TAPING GWEN KISSING TREVOR ON THE EASY CHAIR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cable from the camera runs all the way to the TV where WE SEE what's happening as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's intense. Gwen is on top. Gwen aggressively pulls Trevor's shirt off then goes for his belt. Trevor suddenly grabs her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<GWEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're kidding me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GWEN>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry Gwen. I just can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Gwen climbs off the chair and throws her jacket back on.
</DIRECTION>
<GWEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have definitely got a screw loose, Trevor. Goodbye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GWEN>
<DIRECTION>
Stuffing her feet in her shoes, Gwen's out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor SIGHS, relieved the attack is finally over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About to turn the TV off and stow away his camera. He looks at the TV and freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE IMAGE ON THE TV shows that Gwen is still there, undressing Trevor. Only video Trevor is giving in, kissing her back, pulling her clothes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor looks at the camera. The red "record" light is flashing. Trevor turns back to the TV walking closer and closer to the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
He waves a hand in front of the camera and his hand actually appears on the TV in front of the sex image.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TREVOR WATCHES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor and Gwen make love in video. Video Trevor turns to the the camera (to Trevor) and gives a menacing smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Video Trevor looks back up at Gwen, who smiles down at him carnivorously. She licks her lips.
</DIRECTION>
<VIDEO_GWEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's one thing I should have told you right from the beginning Trevor.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like it pretty rough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIDEO_GWEN>
<DIRECTION>
To Trevor's shock Gwen suddenly drags the knife right across his throat. Blood shoots up at Gwen's grinning face. Blood pours out of Trevor's mouth and down his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM THE COLOR SCREEN Trevor, having just seen himself get murdered, shouts:

<DIRECTION>
Allison stands above him Bic razor in her gloved hand. The bottom half of Trevor's face is covered with shaving cream.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry I thought you were going to stay under longer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLISON>
<DIRECTION>
His face is clean shaven, a little shaving cream remains around his chin. He now has several electrodes attached to his cranium. They're connected to an EEG which BEEPS LOUDLY. The noise bothers Trevor. His eyes dart this way and that. He focuses on the Bic razor.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's happening to me? What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<ALLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>

(interupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.

</ALLISON>
<TREVOR>

Allison gives him a wink, disarming Trevor.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My wife said that exact same sentence to me the day we got married. She even winked too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>

Allison smiles and puts her hand on his.

Allison wipes his face clean with a towel.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There. Just like a baby's butt.

</ALLISON>
<DIRECTION>
Allison gets up, grabs a clipboard starts filling out a report. Trevor stares at her.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?

<ALLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLISON>
<TREVOR>

	No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...

	You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(scribbling in the chart)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLISON>
<DIRECTION>
Allison looks up and notices Trevor's body has slackened, his eyes empty. She drops the clipboard and starts snapping her fingers over his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trevor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLISON>
<DIRECTION>
He is unconscious. A LOUD STEADY BUZZ sounds from one of the machines behind her as blood begins to leak out of Trevor's ear. Allison jumps up and hits call button above Trevor's bed.

<DIRECTION>
INT. TREVOR'S APT. - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-Trevor sits bolt upright in his bed. His alarm clock is making that same BUZZING noise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor is completely disoriented. He sees a note laying next to him on the bed. It says ìYou're an animal baby... you-know- who...î He finally looks at the clock. Seven forty five.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>

	Shit, I'm gonna be late!

INT. TREVOR'S CUBICLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor is on his computer typing madly. ON THE SCREEN WE SEE he has accessed the local newspaper. He calls up an article reading: ACCIDENT LEAVES ONE HOSPITALIZED ANOTHER MISSING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at a newspaper picture of the bridge, which is humming with rescue activity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor's head is pounding. He goes into his desk drawer and pulls out a bottle of aspirin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor empties the last of the bottle's six tablets into his hand, downs them, chases them with what's left of an economy sized bottle of Mylanta. Trevor can't seem to even look at his computer screen. He hears a DING-DING and looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has an instant office message waiting. Trevor clicks OK. The instant message reads: ìIT'S TOO LATE.î Trevor rapidly types up. ìWHO IS THIS.î The same message is repeated. ìIT'S TOO LATE. IT'S TOO LATE. IT'S TOO LATE.î
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor stands up and looks around mazelike structure of cubicles as far as he can see. All of his co-workers are slaving away on their keypads. Trevor sits back down and cancels the instant message. He ruminates for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From behind Bret's fingers TAPPING on the keyboard seem to get louder, more frustrated. They finally stop and Bret stretches momentarily.
</DIRECTION>
<BRET>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>

Trevor stops and looks at Bret.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<BRET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me? This is your sick joke man. Gwen was murdered here six months ago. The security guard found her all over her office. Her head was in the waste paper basket. Her stomach was in the filing cabinet. Her ass was on the copy machine...

</BRET>

Trevor is speechless.

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BRET>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor still can't speak. He goes into his computer mailbox and re-opens the file he'd received from ìYou Know Who.î
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stifles a scream when he sees the jpegs have changed. Sure they're still of Gwen. Pieces of her swimming in puddles of her own blood. Where it once said ìWork harderî it now says ìPolice File.î
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>

Trevor looks behind him to make sure Bret hasn't seen any of this. He's facing his own computer typing away.
</DIRECTION>
<BRET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man are you ever out of the loop. Either that or you've got the worst sense of humor this side of Jeffrey Dahmer. What is your problem anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRET>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor quickly deletes the entire file. Finally...
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honestly Bret? I think I lost my mind. And now I'm finding pieces of it, like pieces of a wrecked car, scattered on the side of the road.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>

A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<BRET>

<DIRECTION>
Bret wheels across the cubicle on his chair and hands something to Trevor. It's an oddly designed postcard bearing some sort of voodoo mask. The font is faux-Oriental, the kind they use for Chinese take-out menus. He looks closer. It's an appointment card for an acupuncturist. Sage.

INT. SAGE'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A chart of all the puncture points on the human body is tacked to the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor lies on the table. SAGE, a gorgeous ethereal Indian woman is at the far end, hovering over the soles of his feet, sticking pins into the appropriate places. She looks up at him slyly.
</DIRECTION>
<SAGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These headaches you've been getting. Do they happen in conjunction with the hallucinations?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAGE>
<DIRECTION>
Sage walks over to one of the cabinets, gathering more acupuncture needles. Trevor can't help but notice her shapely body, her feline gait. Sage throws a sultry glance over her shoulder at him, prompting him to finally answer her question.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
(unsure of himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sort of. My head's been in constant pain since the... accident. And the pain increases whenever I, uh... slip into another, I don't know what to call them...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Sage comes back to him, several needles in one hand. She looks into his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SAGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dreams?

</SAGE>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.

</TREVOR>
<SAGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life.

Sage begins applying the needles fluidly to his upper body now.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>

	-it's like I was never wherever I was to begin with I was really somewhere else entirely.

Sage puts the last needle in. For the first time Trevor actually feels a releief of pressure in his head.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok, whatever that was...do it again. That just set me free of the worlds longest head ache. Is this making any sense?

<DIRECTION>
Trevor watches Sage EXIT the office. He lies there a moment, bathing in warm sunshine. He is relaxed, pain free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him, an acupuncture anatomy chart on the wall. Which begins to change its shape. It morphs (or economically changes) into PINHEAD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor is oblivious as PINHEAD approaches, doll eyes betraying no feeling whatsoever. Then, Pinhead reaches up to his head and begins pulling out one of those infamous pins. It takes a while to come out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Because it is a foot long. Once out, the needle drips with black ooze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor hears a noise and believes its Sage who's reentered the room.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm thinking this might just be what I needed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Pinhead speaks but in Sages voice. As he pushes on of the pins into the tip Trevors skin in his back .
</DIRECTION>
<PINHEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No matter what happens just remember...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINHEAD>
<DIRECTION>
Before Trevor can react, Pinhead suddenly jabs the pin down into Trevor's back, pinning him to the table! It sears his skin. In Pinheads recognizable voice...
</DIRECTION>
<PINHEAD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're all here for you Trevor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINHEAD>
<DIRECTION>
As Trevor reels in terror, Pinhead pulls another foot long needle from his head and thrusts this one into his neck! WE SEE the needle come right out the other side, nailing itself into the table. Trevor can't believe he's still alive!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinhead pulls one more out, aims this one at Trevor's arm, and swings down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
quick cuts:

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

INT. DARKENED ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TREVOR'S POV: Buried in the murky shadow, all that can be seen are his hands, lit by a shaft of sunlight beaming through a blinded window. A ring on the man's left pinky finger glimmers eerily, almost too much. We saw this man in an earlier FLASHBACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's holding something. The cube. He speaks in an ECHOED and DISTORTED VOICE.

Givens pushes his phone toward Trevor, who takes it and dials furiously. Givens remains poker-faced. Trevor dials a number.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I need LARRY ELLIS' office please.

INT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT

Trevor plays his videogame with venom. The cries of his kills emanate from the TV, building to a crescendo. Finally we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE come from the TV.

INT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT

The TV is on. Trevor flips through the channels. He stops on the Nature Channel. A goat is casually munching on some nuts and berries.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNNOUNCER_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(from TV)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-at the dawning of the agrarian age goat's milk would be considered a suitable substitute for a mother's breast milk. And the sacrifice of a goat would appease an angry god and ensure a bountiful harvest. But in time the ritual would become associated with less hallowed purposes.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Goat's blood is said to hold supernatural properties linked to black magic. In conjunction with the pentangle- the five pointed star- the spilling of goat's blood is considered to be either an aphrodisiac that can be used in demonic orgies, or a means by which a high priest may summon Satan himself.

</ANNNOUNCER_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes hurting too much to watch any more, Trevor turns the TV off. Out of sheer instinct he suddenly turns to look-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-OUT HIS WINDOW:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The apartment across the street is lit. A STRANGE FIGURE is standing in the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor jumps up and rushes over to his window. He looks OUT at that same shadowy man he saw earlier. The man's face is still obscured and is still holding something in a blanket. Squinting Trevor is able to make out what it is:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SLEEPING BABY. The stranger pulls the baby's blanket over the baby's angelic face. Then the light in that apartment goes out abruptly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor stares at the darkened window breathing heavily. Is the stranger still in there, watching Trevor in the dark? Trevor cannot tell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SUDDEN KNOCKING AT THE DOOR makes him flinch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor goes to the door, opens it to find:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TAWNY. Only now she's dressed in a skintight black rubber dress. She smiles accentuating a fresh coat of black lipstick.
</DIRECTION>
<TAWNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Can I borrow something?
	</DIALOGUE>

<TREVOR>

Tawny grabs the back of his neck, pulling him to her as she kisses him deeply. She grabs his collar and pulls him out to the hallway.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

She turns around, leading Trevor through the hall like a horse. A very confused horse.

</TREVOR>
<TAWNY>

<DIRECTION>
Trevor eyes her gorgeous body and decides not to resist quite so much.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TAWNY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor leans against the counter, sipping at a glass of wine nervously. Right next to him, Tawny's at the stove, stirring a pot of something dark and bubbly. She looks up at him, smiling seductively. But Trevor's still a few lengths behind.
</DIRECTION>
<TAWNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAWNY>
<TREVOR>

Keeping a hand below his waist Trevor leans toward the spoon, tastes, licks his lips. Then squints.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<TAWNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
	</DIALOGUE>

<TREVOR>

Tawny summarily unzips her rubber dress and whips it off.

<TAWNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well now there's a compliment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAWNY>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor grabs his stomach, lurching over. He can't breath. Trevor looks up at Tawny. But it is no longer her. Tawny has changed into something else entirely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CENOBITE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cenobite rips Trevor's shirt open, and we can see movement within his abdomen. Like a baby kicking. Whatever's in their shoots up expanding Trevor's chest cavity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cenobite pins Trevor to the wall and hovers in his face as if about to kiss him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before Trevor can scream he is choking. The Cenobite watches with glee as something begins to move up into Trevor's throat, expanding his neck, forcing his jaws open and finally...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... a BLACK EEL pokes its head out of Trevor's mouth. The Cenobite opens its own mouth and the eel starts to crawl inside it. Meanwhile Trevor's about to pass out from asphyxiation when-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-he takes a deep grateful breath through an oxygen mask. The various pieces of monitoring equipment around him are BEEPING and PINGING like slot machines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Allison walks around the room pressing buttons that silent each machine one by one, then walks up to the bed, looking surprisingly calm.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about that. There was a blockage in your oxygen hose. Won't happen again, promise.

	Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLISON>
<TREVOR>

<ALLISON>

	If you need to cry, go ahead. I won't tell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLISON>
<DIRECTION>
Holding her hand to his face, Trevor closes his eyes, squeezing out a tear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON TREVOR'S FACE. WE start to NOTICE subtle differences about Allison's hand. It is very pale, the fingernails black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor opens his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TAWNY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is now lying on Tawny's bed, which is surrounded by unlit candles. Sunlight streams through her open window. It is her hand he is holding to his face. The rest of her is sitting under the sheet, covered head propped against the headboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor drops her hand and it falls lifelessly to the bed beside him. Breathing quickening he reaches up to the black silk sheet covering her head. He yanks it back and covers his mouth in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's been bound to the bed and gagged with a white cloth that is soaked with blood. A deep vertical incision has been made in her neck, collarbone to chin and her tongue is pulled through the wound so it sticks out the bottom of her jaw. And that's just for starters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Trevor looks down he gags when he sees her ribcage has been opened like a set of French doors and her insides sitting in her lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The coup de grace? Trevor now sees he is covered with blood. HERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TREVOR'S APT., BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor splashes his face with cold water, trying to get his composure back. He stares at the water rushing down the drain for a moment. His breathing stabilizes He finally looks up at his reflection in the mirror...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... to see PINHEAD staring back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor jolts backward in shock and does a double take. It's him now, looking completely unhinged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside the PHONE RINGS. The answering machine picks up with a BEEP.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGE_S_VOICE>

INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cleaned up now Trevor carefully makes his way back to Tawny's apartment. He tries the door. It's locked. This can't be right. He jiggles the door knob violently, then finally KICKS the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-TAWNY answers the door, looking utterly pissed off. Though still in Goth mode, she's dressed much more conservatively now.
</DIRECTION>
<TAWNY>

</TAWNY>

<TAWNY>
<DIRECTION>
(utterly shocked)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHAT?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAWNY>
<DIRECTION>
A VERY DEEP VOICE comes from somewhere behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the fuck is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<TAWNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's that guy from down the hall. He thinks we did something with him last night.

Tawny looks aghast.
</DIRECTION>
<TAWNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you cracking up or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAWNY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly an enormous BRUTE of a MAN, wide as he is tall ENTERS the doorway. He's wearing a black tee, black jeans and, Trevor can't help notice, black nail polish... on fingers and toes. Obviously Tawny's significant other.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can we do for you, chief?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTE>
<TREVOR>

Brute takes a sideward step through the doorway, forcing Trevor back two steps.

<BRUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Much.

Trevor turns and hurries off. Brute turns to Tawny who shrugs and makes a twirly motion at her temple. The two go back into her apartment.

INT. TREVOR'S APT. - DAY

Trevor paces in his apartment telephone to his ear. He lets out a heavy breath and looks at his watch. Finally:
</DIRECTION>

	City police main switchboard how may I direct your call?

	</DIALOGUE>
</OPERATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor sits at the front of the bus agitated. He folds and unfolds Detective Lange's business card in his hands like some frustrated Origami artist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SIREN from a passing ambulance drills his ears. The irritating sound eventually fades away but the pain in his head is still there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BONGING of a distant cathedral's bell makes him pause. He looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Toward the rear and sees a familiar old lady knitting a baby's bootie. He looks again. The bootie is bright red and dripping... blood? Trevor follows the strand of bright red wool down to their source:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DYING GOAT laying under the seat. It's insides have been ripped out. Its veins and tendons are serving as the old lady's yarn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor's eyes bolt back up to the old woman. She continues HUMMING sweetly, her lap speckled with goat's blood. Trevor pulls the wire and an OBNOXIOUS BUZZING goes off. Trevor hurries up to the bus driver as the bus pulls over.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just open the doors I'll jump off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<BUS_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not while the bus is moving, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUS_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor clutches his head in pain and waits for the bus to stop. The doors open. He jumps off, knees nearly buckling from the pain. He looks up as the bus speeds off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE REAR WINDOW the little black girl seen earlier pops up. She's holding her little doll. She pushes a clothespin into its head. Blood drips from the puncture. At the same time Trevor feels an incredible pain sear through his head. He squints at the bus again. The little girl is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LANGE'S OFFICE - DAY

Lange is at his desk eating a sandwich. Trevor comes in angrier than a hornet in a beehive.

INT. LARRY ELLIS' OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LARRY ELLIS is a somber but handsome young attorney. At present he at his desk poring through several books on child custody law. He makes notes on a pad beside him as he talks.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(not looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Basically they know where your wife's body is and they're not telling you as a tactic to get you to confess? Yet neither of them has come out and told you that you're a suspect. Is that what you're trying to say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor sits on the other side of the humongous office in a chair so big it practically swallows him whole.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little? Try unbelievably.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<TREVOR>

	I swear these guys are like playing mindgames with me. I think they got a hold of my e-mail address at work too.

Larry is not buying this for a nanosecond. He trims some brown leaves off a small plant as he speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(concentrating on his notes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?

Larry sighs and walks over to his desk. He presses a button on his intercom.

	Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BELOW BRIDGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Police tape FLAPS between the trees. Other than that there is no sign of an investigation. Trevor walks out of the woods on the shore, through the police tape and to the water's edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to walk the shore looking out at the still water. He scans the area where the water meets the land, trying to remember.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something on the surface few feet away catches his eye. It's a rock sticking up. No it's something else. Trevor walks right up to the water and puts his feet on a couple of large rocks breaking the surface. He bends down and looks at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CORNER OF A BLACK CUBE. He quickly reaches down, tries to pick it up. It seems to be stuck just below the surface. Trevor pulls harder and finally it gives. Trevor slowly lifts the black cube out of the water and GASPS when he sees-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-A WHITE WATERLOGGED HAND CLUTCHING IT FROM BELOW!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor GASPS and lets go. And just as the cube (along with its owner) SPLASH under the surface-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-ANOTHER WHITE HAND breaks the surface grabbing Trevor's wrist!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Trevor Struggles he looks up to see the dark figure standing above him holding a rock over his head. Just as he swings down towards Trevors head-

<ALLISON>

	Jesus I wish you would stop doing that.

Trevor looks down at himself. He's on an examination table in his normal clothes not a hospital johnnie. That's a good sign.

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. What we're going to do is up the Topomax to two per day instead of one, see if that takes care of these hallucinatory seizures you've been having. The extra Topomax won't interfere with the painkillers either but... You're going to be thrilled to hear this part but we have been told by some patients it affects the memory somewhat...

<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
(weary)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Does it affect the memory?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Allison looks concerned. Then her features soften.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLISON>

<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.

Trevor in the car in the water. Thrashing about, he bleeding from his head in the flashback as well. Where's Kristy? He looks in the passenger seat. She's gone.

Someone approaches. Trevor zips up, pulls Kristy up out of his lap. Its a cenobite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor screams and opens the door of the car to make a frantic exit. He dive out onto the pavement and looks back. All is quiet. He's alone a quiet road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands up and into an eerie world of slow motion . Trevor looks up the road and back to find-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful vision of Allison walking toward him. Walking gracefully, she approaches Trevor. Raises her hand to his face. Trevor smiles, then slowly looks back towards the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the car he see's Kristy playing with the puzzle box. Trevors calls out to her.

<TREVOR>

Trevor SLAMS the phone down and touches his head again. He looks at his hand. The blood is gone. But the headache is back. Its crippling at this point. He's at his wits end. He reaches into his pocket and finds Pages card. Maybe as a last resort?

	It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly?

<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined.

	Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little time. For starters I was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child. That was so I could collect her eight million dollar estate. I think I killed several women I was having mindless sex with behind her back. But I did those murders just for the hell of it. Finally... I think I made some kind of deal with the devil and now he's come to collect my soul. Only he's decided to mess with my head first. How many Hail Marys do you recommend for that one father?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trevor I'm sure you killed no one. You are very distraught over your wife's death and rightfully so. You did the right thing by confessing to me here tonight. And you should keep praying for the wisdom that will set your soul at ease. That being said, you are still in a highly emotional state right now. It might do you some good to get some professional help. Confess to them the way you confessed to me. In time you'll probably find that the real killer has already been caught. Or better yet... that these murders never happened at all.
	</DIALOGUE>

<PRIEST>

	All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?

Trevor rushes toward the window, opens it and leaps out onto the fire escape.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. APT. BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor's about to climb down the fire escape when he is bathed in the flashlight's beam from inside. Trevor looks down and sees a garbage dumpster full of trash bags below. He jumps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor sails down three stories and lands in the dumpster. He climbs out and runs to the street as fast as he can. He races down the sidewalk trying to get his bearings at the same time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hearing footsteps from behind Trevor turns to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Stranger in the Window not half a block behind Trevor, keeping Trevor's pace. Then... Trevor stops. And turns.

The Stranger stops as well. This has never happened before. Trevor shouts down the empty street.

The Stranger stands there. Trevor begins walking toward him, blood in his eyes. The Stranger backs away.

Trevor bolts into a run and the Stranger takes off running the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stranger darts into an alley.
</DIRECTION>

INT. ALLEY - NIGHT

Trevor runs into the alley, seeing no signs of the stranger. The end of the alley is pitch black.

<BRET>

	I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. Ten o'clock fall asleep in front of the TV. She did that every day I followed her. Every single day. While you were out fucking your concubines. Every day I felt more and more bad for her, man. And hated you more and more.

Trevor is absolutely speechless.

Bret presses the blade against Trevor's neck a little harder, drawing a rivulet of blood.

<DIRECTION>
Bret then puts the knife to his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Bret drags the knife across his own jugulars slicing them open. Blood pours out of his smiling mouth. Then something really weird happens. Cuts begin to open up all over Bret's face and his hands. Blood pouring to the ground in buckets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bret lifelessly falls into the pool of blood... Before he can process what's just happened, Trevor hears a NOISE behind him and turns to see... several of those slithering sewer monsters coming toward him, surrounding him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And behind them, SEVERAL SILHOUETTED FIGURES walking slowly toward him. We don't need three guesses to figure out who they are... CENOBITES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Panicking Trevor reaches down and grabs the knife out of Bret's hand and readies himself for the inevitable attack when-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-the BLINDING LIGHT FROM A POLICE car illuminates the alley. First Trevor notices the sewer monsters are gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the figures we thought were Cenobites are actually LANGE and several police officers. Lange looks disappointed.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay Trevor. Put the knife down.

Trevor's nose has been bleeding. His eye is black and blue his lip cut. Trevor looks out the window. The streets are deserted, foreign.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor looks at the rear view mirror. The cop staring back at him averts his gaze. Trevor thinks he sees something crawl into the cop's eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lange sits next to the cop, staring back at Trevor. He takes out his antihistamine and sprays some up his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE STATION LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors burst open and the two cops, Lange escorts Trevor IN.
</DIRECTION>

INT. LINE UP ANTEROOM - NIGHT

Trevor looks at the cops in the sunglasses. One of them takes his pair off. His eye sockets are empty. We can see brain.
</DIRECTION>

The cop cleans his shades then his mouth smiles at Trevor before he puts the sunglasses back on.

Finally the doors open. Lange unlocks Trevor's handcuffs and the cops push him out the door into a dark corridor.

One of the cops waves bye-bye to him. And with that the elevator doors shut.

Trevor turns around and faces the long corridor. He begins his hike towards its end where an ominous set of double doors awaits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He arrives at them and pushes them open.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MORGUE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As soon as the doors open fluorescent lights flicker overhead illuminating two walls of metal drawers and between them: a large slab of marble upon which rests a human form covered with a sheet. Trevor ENTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He makes his way toward the body and stares at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A low WHEEZING noise coming from a dark corner just beyond the slab distracts him. Trevor looks and freezes when he sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GOAT laying on the floor in a pool of blood. It's still breathing. One of the goat's slatted eyes is staring at Trevor as if begging for mercy. A STRANGE RIPPING NOISE is heard. The goat MEWLS in pain then its eye rolls up. Dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The animal's body begins to quiver as a tiny wound on its back widens spitting out streams of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor begins to back away as the wound stretches open, giving birth to a rising form...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PINHEAD. He rises completely from the goat, stepping out of the wound. He is red with blood for a second. Then his skin and robe absorb the blood like a sponge. Pinhead approaches Trevor blocking him from the body on the slab.

<SAGE>

(looking at Trevor's corpse)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's simple, Dr. Ambrose. What if there is no afterlife? What happens when we die? Do we just stay stuck inside your bodies for eternity watching ourselves decompose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAGE>
<AMBROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not following this...

</DIRECTION>
<KIRSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRSTY>
<LANGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well you made it down here that's the important part. Thank you for your patience Mrs. Gooding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGE>

</DIRECTION>
<LANGE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One last thing... When they found him he was holding something. Not to get too graphic but they had to wrench it from his hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGE>
<DIRECTION>
Lange reaches under his desk then stands revealing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CUBE inside a ziploc bag. Lange and Kirsty exchange a knowing glance.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>

Kirsty walks toward the exit. On her way she passes a trash can. She discretely tosses the cube into it and rubs her hands together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The birds are chirping. The sun is shining. Kirsty Gooding walks out the door and takes a breath of fresh air. She skips down the steps of the police station toward the street. She stops in the middle of the sidewalk looking both ways.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHADOW COMES up behind her. It's the STRANGER Trevor had seen out his window. He grabs her shoulder startling Kirsty. She turns to see LARRY ELLIS, shit-eating grin on his face. He's holding an eight month old BABY. The one he was drawing.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looking for someone, Kirsty?

	</DIALOGUE>
</NANNY>
<KIRSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you in a couple of weeks. You've got my cell number right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRSTY>
<DIRECTION>
The Nanny pushes the stroller away, nodding, waving good-bye. Larry smiles as he watches the baby go.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Kirsty smiles to herself.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Counselor can we not mention HIM anymore. Can we just start spending HIS money instead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRSTY>
<DIRECTION>
They walk slowly toward the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've always wanted to go to Madagascar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<KIRSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRSTY>
<DIRECTION>
Larry sees a cab and rushes out to hail it.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	TAXI!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Something out the corner of her eye scares Kirsty. She turns to see Lange standing there.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You forgot something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGE>
<DIRECTION>
Lange holds up the cube she tossed out. Kirsty's expression falls. But... how...?
</DIRECTION>
<KIRSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRSTY>
<DIRECTION>
Kirsty takes the cube.

</DIRECTION>
<GIVENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank YOU.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIVENS>
<DIRECTION>
Givens smiles at her then walks away. She slowly walks toward the cab where Larry has opened the door for her.

INT. CAB - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Kirsty slides into the cab looking at the cube in despair. Larry slides in after her.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(to the cabbie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Airport please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>

<LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Larry looks down at the cube. It has magically risen from her palms and begun to rearrange itself in that way we've come to know and love so well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cabbie, looking back at the sight, slowly slides the window between the driver and passenger compartments shut.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time, Larry. Time's up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRSTY>
