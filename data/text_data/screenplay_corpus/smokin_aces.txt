Several seconds pass. Then the car door opens and The Tremor Brothers, like circus clowns, clamber out in a cloud of gun and reefer smoke. LESTER TREMOR, the dandruff-caked, pockmarked middle brother is the first out. He shakes off the cold, yawning, stretching, revealing all manner of tattoo.

The Tremors' youngest brother, the Baby-Huey sized JEEVES TREMOR bumbles out, pulling at his crotch. He unzips & rips, baptizing the Cuda's tire with a truly prodigious piss.

The figure stands. In the bathroom behind him, we see a body, male, late-50's, trussed up, hung by his feet over the tub and bled out. The figure walks in, takes a Polaroid, turns it upside down near the man's face and fires off a photo.

<DIRECTION>
Bullshit, but it sounds good. The Supervisor starts for the ringing hotline.
</DIRECTION>
<SECURITY_SUPERVISOR>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A surprised grunt from the man as blood begins to pour from his punctured sternum. The blade retracts. The phone sits trembling in the Supervisor's hand, --a voice-- Carruther's, tinny and barely audible, warbles from the other end-

<SECURITY_SUPERVISOR>
	<DIALOGUE>

Darwin bird-dogs both his brothers, monitoring their movement, using hand signals and some bizarre inbred semaphore to communicate with them. They pass through and punch in, signing time sheets.

EXT. LAKE --DAY

Elmore sits up in the sub-zero shallows of Lake Tahoe with a start, stripped naked, shaking uncontrollably, his skin a deep bruised blue. Dull pain quickly defines-- pinpoints, bores in, bone deep...Death can't hurt this much.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets his breathing under control, the onset of hypothermia turning his fingertips black-- his left hand, lighter three digits-- he looks, comprehension sparks but can't catch-- he stares impassively at the ragged space, for the moment, he doesn't seem to mind their absence. He gropes the side of his head, bullet-graze, blood congealed by the cold, the concussion he suffered has left a massive migraine behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crawls from the water, muscles cramping, knotting up. He reaches the sand, unable to pull himself up any further. He turns back, sees the bodies of Deeks and Dupree, face down, the lazy lake tide gently lifting and lowering them...

Then Beanie hears the small metallic warble of something rolling around on the floor behind him, gradually settling. A sensation overtakes him...and he grows very still with it.

He looks down at his hand for the first time...sees blood there, reaches up with that same hand and finds the tattered hole right above the base of his spine-- small wisps of smoke drifting up out of the wound...He turns, numb...and sees what looks like a spent shell casing, just ejected, coming to rest on the tile...The phone continues to ring.

MUSTACHE -- Sensing grave danger, his gun being drawn. His men following suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IVY -- Pulling away from his captors, looking for cover.

<DIRECTION>
DARWIN TREMOR -- Stepping from the elevator, strapped with a sawed-off pump shotgun in one hand, a vintage elephant gun in the other, looking for lives to end.

<DIRECTION>
LESTER TREMOR -- Chainsaw snarling, spewing oil, psycho smile spreading viral across a pockmarked face.

JEEVES TREMOR -- Sledgehammer in a scabbard on his back, holding WWII era German "Potato-Masher" grenades, gripped like drumsticks, pins pulled. He hurls them.

<DIRECTION>
SYKES -- Pulling extra clips from her handbag, securing them under her garter belt, dumping her heels in favor of hose.

ACOSTA -- Pant leg lifted, moving panther-quiet, tortoise- slow, unfastening the snap on his ankle-holster.
</DIRECTION>

CARRUTHERS -- Near death, eyes locked on Acosta, his mortal combatant, trying desperately to reach his own ankle holster.

Another round tears in after it, exploding a gilded ceiling stanchion, sparking off the rebar, tripping the sprinkler system, dousing the corridor-- everybody runs for cover.

Messner, a few feet from the car containing Sykes. More sniper fire rakes the hallway. Another elevator arrives, opens...call girls inside. They snuck up somehow, past security... The gunplay gets them spooked, scared-- they scramble from the car-- cops and feds try to stuff them back inside the elevator as rounds continue to rain down.

One of the girls catches a hard ricochet, wig leaping off her head as a bounced bullet punches through her skull-- she crumbles, instant casualty. Messner hardly notices, moving instead toward the other elevator car.

Acosta raises his aim to her head, about to deliver the coup de grace-- Messner appears now, sees Acosta, sights him when--

Acosta's chest explodes, he slumps, the gun sliding away-- Messner swings wide on the car to reveal:

Carruthers, smoking gun, trembling aim, exposed ankle holster...empty. Sykes, kevlar burning, smashed round still hot, she tries to pull her vest off, finds her newly paralyzed arm uncooperative. Messner, advancing now, keeping an eye on his partner as he moves toward the car.

Plaster and debris everywhere, sprinklers tripped, most of Mustache's team shot, shredded or burnt to a crisp. Pieces of building and bodies either waterlogged or fully ablaze. Mustache and Darwin play duck and cover, exchanging fire. Jeeves, out of grenades, sledgehammer swinging, crushing wall studs, scattering remaining security team members.

Ivy, sheltered, having survived the opening salvos, gets ahold of a gun from a chainsaw-shorn former security member; Lester sees Ivy arming himself, blitzes him-- chainsaw snarling, revved out, sending fantails of gristle and chipped bone everywhere. Less than fifteen feet separate them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ivy fires, shots deflected off the blade's teeth, seconds from getting gutted-- he adjusts his aim high, emptying the gun into Lester's chest, bullets blazing haywire, blowing out between Lester's shoulders, stopping a hard charge cold.

Lester, lopsided, bullet-dazed, drools blood...then dies. Ivy dumps his clip, searches for another-- the chainsaw falls, stalls.

Ivy, finds a clip, slams it in the stock, points, pulls-- trigger-stick, hammer-jam. He falls to his back, scurrying away, trouble finding traction, soles slipping-- he keeps pulling the trigger. Jeeves straddles him from above, raises the saw like a great wooden stake, about to bring it down--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--BAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ivy's automatic discharges. The round splits the saw's gas tank, spritzing fuel, dousing Jeeves-- A beat before the tank suddenly arcs, exploding, lighting Jeeves up like a four-hundred pound bonfire, bouncing him off the walls; a human Hindenberg, fully engulfed. He flails, burns, howls, falls...molten fat melts off his body like lard butter...

Watters lowers the gun, wipes tears, the area around her is littered with spent .50 caliber shells. The fourteenth floor of the Nomad is now empty. Sirens wail in the distance.

And she's alive and being carried by a man, a big gorgeous black man that she's gazing upon with utter love and longing. A boulder-sized lump takes shape in Watters throat; betrayed, backbit-- tears come to fast to contain, too many to control.

Numbed...the sensation leaving her fingers, she finds herself racking the bolt on the Barrett and gazing through crosshairs...taking aim on Ivy's head. Behind her, the elevator arrives, an a dozen armed cops, hoo-rah from it, hustling the length of the hall, descending down on her--

Messne exits the stairwell. Droves of Feds and justice department types crowd the third floor hallway, around the I.C.U. The mood is subdued. The Swede exits a per-op suite, dressed in scrubs and a surgical gown, talking with Dr. Gill, who is also dressed for surgery.

Messner searches the hall for a familiar face...finds it...Locke, far end, talking with an aide.

A gun is in Locke's side now-- against his ribs-- he looks down, stunned...Now it's Messner who's leading him away.

<MESSNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to tell me why no call was made to inform us that the Israel situation had been "altered." Why I-- and my friend and partner, whose body is going into a furnace tomorrow, were not sufficiently apprised of Bureau movement on this matter.

</MESSNER>
<LOCKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. The actual contract went to Lazlo Soot, the man that plunged to his death from the Penthouse yesterday. He was to neutralize Israel's entourage and prep for the removal of his heart. Ingstrom was to handle the surgery itself on-site with the assistance of Dr. Gregory Gill, Israel's personal physician, who was also on the Sparazza payroll.

Jersey Turnpike. The past: A '51 Ford Fairlane, flush with an embankment, bullet perforated, dead-body draped. A top- coated man stalks the vehicle's sole survivor, FREEMAN HELLER, shooting him in the back. He rolls over and is shot point blank in the face. THE CAMERA TILTS UP to the top-coated gunman, who returns the pistol to its holster, revealing...

	Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
