Oh, just before you go -- when I tell your wife about you and Angela Heaney at the Blackpool conference...would email be better? Or a phone call?

	We'd like a dual horse-shoe formation for the meeting set-up - an enclave for Ms Clark, an enclave for the Pentagon delegation. First names acceptable to all parties and politely we request the presence of both carbonated and non- carbonated waters.

INT. FOREIGN OFFICE GRAND MEETING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chad's dual horse-shoe is packed with people. The room's pretty much full.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAREN CLARK from the State Department is surrounded by ten or so aides and functionaries, security people and assistants. (Including Chad and LIZA one of Karen's senior aides.) Then there is Bob Adriano's gang of advisors, smaller but sitting separately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next to them is a Pentagon delegation, including uniformed members of all three services.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lots of hubbub.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUZY leads SIMON, TOBY and JUDY in, and shows them to their seats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're as far away from the US delegation as it's possible to be, and Simon's seat is actually behind a pillar. Suzy goes off to join Michael and the Foreign Office delegation near the front. Suzy looks over to Toby, uses her hands to make mock binoculars, as if to say, 'you're very far away, look how close and therefore important I am'.
</DIRECTION>

	No-one will hear me if I say anything. How's your view? Can we swap?

<DIRECTION>
The meeting is now underway. We're with Karen Clark.
</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>

	We all agree this is a very tough time, but I don't want a consensus to form around the premise that conflict is necessarily the primary option at this point.
	</DIALOGUE>

Back with Simon, Judy and Toby. Simon still straining to see.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>

Back with Karen. She's holding up a paper in a red folder.

	<DIALOGUE>
	This paper, authored by one of my aides, Liza Weld. You don't mind me fore- grounding this do you Liza?

</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>
