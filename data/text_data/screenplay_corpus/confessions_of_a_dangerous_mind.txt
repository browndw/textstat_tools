<DIRECTION>
EXT. NYC STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUBTITLE: NEW YORK CITY, FALL 1981
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's raining. A cab speeds down a dark, bumpy side-street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking in his rearview mirror, the cab driver checks out his passenger: a sweaty young man in a gold blazer with a "P" insignia over his breast pocket. Several paper bags on the back seat hedge him in. The young man is immersed in the scrawled list he clutches in his hand. A passing street light momentarily illuminates the list and we glimpse a few of the entries: double-coated waterproof fuse (500 feet); .38 ammo (hollowpoint configuration); potato chips (Lays).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GONG SHOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An excerpt from The Gong Show (reenacted). The video image fills the screen. We watch a fat man recite Hamlet, punctuating his soliloquy with loud belching noises. The audience is booing. Eventually the man gets gonged. Chuck Barris, age 50, hat pulled over his eyes, dances out from the wings to comfort the agitated performer.
</DIRECTION>
<PERFORMER>

	Why'd they do that? I wasn't done.

<JAYE_P_MORGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not to be. That is the answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAYE_P_MORGAN>
<DIRECTION>
The studio audience laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cab sloshes to a stop in front of a liquor store. The young man gets out, jogs through the rain toward the fluorescent storefront. The cab driver waits, listens to staticky reports in a foreign language on his radio. The meter is running. The back seat is piled high with bags.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GONG SHOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck Barris spastically dances on the screen along with Gene Gene the Dancing Machine. Barris turns to the camera, points at it.
</DIRECTION>
<BARRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll be right back with more stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARRIS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The back of the cab is filled with even more bags and boxes. The cab stops. The young man gets out and confers with a shady looking guy on the corner. The young man pulls out a big wad of cash. Money and a small package change hands. The meter in the cab is at thirty-five dollars and change.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GONG SHOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck Barris is being sniffed in the crotch by a large dog. The audience howls with glee. Suddenly the video image explodes. Slow motion sparks and shards of glass shoot toward the camera. We pull back to reveal we're in a darkened, messy hotel room. We pan across the walls, past taped-up, yellowed newspaper clippings with headlines like "Gong Show a New Low in Television", "The Dumbing of America", and "Chuck Barris is the Decline of Western Civilization." We come to rest on a naked middle-aged man crouching in the shadows in the corner, holding a gun. This is Chuck Barris. The television continues to sputter, spark, and smoke. There is a knock at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<BARRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(mumbly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck. Shit. Piss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Naked Barris, still holding the gun, seems panicked. He hesitates, trying to determine his options. Should he answer the door? Should he climb out onto the window ledge? Finally, he creeps to the door and peeks out the peephole for a long moment. He unlocks the door, opens it. The sweaty, young man, a bellhop, stands there with his many bags.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to appear casual as takes in the sight: a naked Chuck Barris holding a gun, an exploded, smoking tv set in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<BARRIS>

	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Barris trails off, gives a quick glance both ways down the hall, then motions for the bellhop to enter. The bellhop places the bags on a table, fishes in his pocket and pulls out some bills.
</DIRECTION>

Barris trails off. There is a pause. The bellhop attempts to make conversation.

(re: exploded tv)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, another Gong Show rerun, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>

The naked Barris approaches the bellhop, drapes his arm over the young man's shoulder and walks with him.
</DIRECTION>
<BARRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(conspiratorially)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I'd do? -- And don't tell anybody -- I'd rub... I'd rub Alpo brand dog food on my dick so the dogs would stick their noses into my... dick. Guaranteed big laugh, right? That was my trick, my great contribution to the world. How wouldn't I degrade myself, I ask you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARRIS>
<DIRECTION>
There is a silence.

<BELLHOP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... I... I don't know, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Barris punches himself in the head, flops down on the unmade bed. The bellhop glances at Barris's bare ass, looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<BELLHOP>

	<DIALOGUE>

</BARRIS>
<BELLHOP>
	<DIALOGUE>

<BARRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still? Complaints? I specifically used the silencer this time! Specifically!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARRIS>
<BELLHOP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, the people in 917 found a bullet lodged in their wall. And while we want to accommodate you -- we certainly value your patronage -- there is an issue of customer safety.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLHOP>
<DIRECTION>
Barris lets this sink in.
</DIRECTION>
<BARRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Barris finds his pants draped over a chair, pulls out his wallet, holds some more money out to the bellhop.
</DIRECTION>
<BARRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My apologies. Buy -- 917, is it? -- buy them a magnum of your finest champagne. And... and your finest spackle. Oh, and get me a bag of plastic army men while you're out. I forgot to tell you before.
	</DIALOGUE>

The bellhop sighs, takes the money.

<BELLHOP>

The bellhop exists.

	And some black socks! Seven black socks, you rascule!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Barris locks the door, dumps the contents of the bags onto the floor, fishes through the mess for a cigar, puts the cigar in his mouth, studies himself in a full length mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<BARRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Bellhop Johnson was clearly repulsed by the sight of me. And why not? I'm wrinkled...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... like a prune. Covered in liver spots...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(searches for simile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... like an old guy. My hair is falling out in clumps, leaving exposed patches of white, sickly scalp. A flabby inner-tube of fat hangs from my waist, practically obscuring my bedraggled prick -- dark and shriveled and dead. Still leaking urine even though I left the toilet ages ago. My asshole itches. Hemorrhoids abound. George Orwell said every man has the face he deserves by fifty. Does every man have the asshole he deserves by fifty, as well? Does every fifty year old asshole have the asshole he deserves?

EXT. TERRACE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This feels real, verite. The actual Chuck Barris, smoking a cigar, is being interviewed. He stands outside his villa in St. Tropez, older than the middle-aged Barris depicted in the hotel room, and talks to someone off-camera.
</DIRECTION>
<ACTUAL_BARRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was 1981. I had holed myself up in this New York hotel. Parker Hotel. Terrified of everything. Ashamed of my life.

Barris walks through a small vegetable garden as he talks, occasionally adjusting a stake or pulling out a weed.

<ACTUAL_BARRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you're young, your potential is infinite. You might do anything, really. You might be great. You might be Einstein. You might be Goethe. Then you get to an age where what you might be gives way to what you have been. You weren't Einstein. You weren't anything. That's a bad moment. But I remembered something Carlyle wrote: "... there is no life of a man, faithfully recorded, but is a heroic poem of its sort, rhymed or unrhymed." I realized my salvation might be in recording my wasted life, unflinchingly. Maybe it would serve as a cautionary tale. Maybe it would help me understand why.

Barris enters carrying an overnight bag and some mail. He flips on the hall light and stares at himself in a mirror.

	I had changed. I could see it in my eyes. Something dark.

Barris notices a fleck on the side of his nose. It's dried blood. He distractedly rubs at it.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

Renda's contorted face in close-up as he is shot. Blood spurting. Echoey church bells chime.

INT. APARTMENT - EVENING

Barris puts down his bag, pulls the Spanish-English dictionary from his pocket, and tries to translate what Renda said. It takes him a while but he does.

	"Don't kill me. I am three babies." I am three babies? What the fuck does that mean?

Barris drops to the floor and throws up into a trash can. Out of the corner of his eye, he catches a movement in the living room. He lurches backwards, knocks over the can. Vomit spills onto the carpet.

In the dim light from the hallway, Barris spots Penny lying on the couch. She is dressed as a hippy. A backpack and a duffel lie on the floor next to her.

	Jesus Christ, Penny. You scared the shit out of me. What are you doing here?

<DIRECTION>
Penny shrieks excitedly as she runs to the record player. She turns it on, plugs in a strobe light. "Sunshine Superman" starts up. Penny sings and dances along, directing the lyrics at Barris. Barris looks around at his strobing apartment. He sees Penny's mess: pot paraphenalia, anti-war posters, a gold dove painted on the wall with a phone number underneath.

INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Leonard Goldberg, a bunch of network executives, and Barris sit around a conference table and watch a tv. On it is The Dating Game. A black bachelor is responding to the trombone question. He simulates the receiving of a blow job, moaning and writhing in his seat as the studio audience howls. Barris has his head in his hands. Goldberg signals an assistant, who switches off the television. The executives look quite grim.

	Chuck, quite frankly these episodes are unairable.

INT. BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Barris is drunk and brooding. He picks a fight with a big man who has unintentionally knocked into him at the bar. Barris is brutal and effective, utilizing the techniques he learned from one of the scary instructors at training camp. This gives him an idea.

	Thank you, Mr. Barris. I don't know if any of you are aware of this, but it's a federal offense to make licentious remarks on a network television broadcoast. The penalty for this disgusting, un-American behavior is one year in prison or a ten thousand dollar fine or both. Anyone making a sick, subversive remark tonight will be arrested immediately. I will then personally escort the offender to federal prison for booking under edict number 364 of the Broadcast Act of 1963. And it's a long drive to that prison. Just you and me. No other witnesses --

SUBTITLE: BARRIS PRODUCTIONS, LOS ANGELES, 1967
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is the sixties and the office is crazily appointed. Street signs, funny posters, faux Tiffany lamps, mobiles, lava lamps, an inflatable sex doll, etc. Barris, 36, is behind his desk, feet up and on the phone. He wears a t- shirt and jeans and loafers. This is a new Barris, confident and successful and hip and relaxed and slovenly. Outside in the bullpen area we hear the hustle and bustle, laughing and screaming of a busy but casual office.

	Terrific, Rod! Yeah, I'll get back to you on Monday. Great. Thanks. Bye.

INT. DATING GAME SET - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barris paces on the darkened set. He is trying to think. A shadowy figure appears at the top of the bleachers and creeps down the aisle. Barris is deep in thought and doesn't hear. The man appears behind Barris and locks his arm around Barris's neck. Barris is startled, choking and flailing trying to remove the arm. He can't. Finally the man releases Barris and tweaks his crotch. Barris turns wildly around. It is Jim Byrd.

</BARRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Byrd shrugs, unconvinced. He sips his drink.
</DIRECTION>
<BYRD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think of it as a hobby. An avocation. Something you do to relax. You can be an assassination enthusiast, a murder bug.

</BARRIS>
<BYRD>

	I'm telling ya. And... And sometimes you can be the chaperone, Chuckie. Let's say we have a job for you in Austria. You, a successful tv producer, above suspicion, chaperones the young couple, and while you're there, blam! you take care of some Company business. It's the perfect cover. TV producer by day, CIA operative by night.

	Chuck, when I said you fit our profile, very little of that had to do with you needing the money. Some of it, but very little. You liked it with Renda, Chuck. I saw it in your eyes. You liked it but you botched it. Don't you want to get really good at something, Chuck?

The director calls the shots. Barris stands in the back watching the show in progress. On the stage is a pretty blonde bachelorette in a short black dress and three bachelors. Bachelors two and three are attractive and stylishly dressed and groomed. Bachelor one is a fat, not- too-bright looking guy in a yellow-ochre leisure suit. His slow, unfocused delivery contrasts with the fast, sharp chatter in the booth.

It's all mod and colorful. Chuck Barris shuffles along, taking in the sights with the Dating Game couple. The blonde bachelorette did indeed pick the fat guy. But it's clear she thinks she made a mistake and pays him no attention whatsoever, walking about twenty feet in front of him and Barris. Barris seems bored.

The Englishman's eyes are wide with terror. Barris pulls the trigger three times. The back of the Englishman's head explodes. Blood and hair and brain are spattered against the church wall. The Englishman slumps to the ground. Barris reaches into the man's jacket, pulls out the envelope of money, pockets it, and makes his way toward the churchyard gate. There stands the fat bachelor, watching, confused. After the initial shock, Barris smiles warmly.

A middle-aged man stands in his underwear at a mirror and shaves. The stall shower pushes away from the wall revealing a hole. Barris steps through it, covered in dust. He nods at the shaving man. He nods back, hands Barris a gun and a change of clothes, and continues shaving.

INT. PARKED CAR - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barris and Keeler wait in the car. Colbert emerges from his house, alone, and walks toward the car. A drained Barris sighs a sigh of relief, then suddenly and with unexpected force, Keeler swings open the passenger door. The door hits a stunned Colbert and sends him flying. Keeler races around the car, grabs Colbert, throws him into the back seat, and jumps on top of him. Barris watches, surprised at the dramatic personality shift in Keeler. Keeler is strangling Colbert. A cigarettes is dangling casually from his lips as he does this. Keeler turns Colbert over so he's facing him, so he can watch him die.

Barris looks around. The place is a disaster. Food wrappers, crumpled papers, liquor bottles, strewn clothing, plastic army men set up for battle. He gets up, puts on a hotel bathrobe and his hat, grabs his gun, checks the peephole for a long moment, and answers the door. The housekeeper is plump and kind-looking.

EXT. EAST BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING

A hollow-eyed Barris approaches the building that conceals the tunnel entrance. Suddenly there's a commotion on the quiet street. The shaving man is being led handcuffed out of the building by two trench-coated men. They shove him into a car. Barris continues to walk by, betraying no interest. He glances casually into the entranceway of the apartment building. Another trenchcoated man waits inside the shadows.

The car drives away. Barris stops at the end of the block, stares at the imposing wall.

An assistant opens the door and a middle-aged woman in pale blue polyester pants and Joan Crawford painted on eyebrows enters with a guitar.

Under "Pros" he writes "Become National Celebrity", "Get More Attention from Stewardesses", "Even more women will want to have sex with me". Under "Cons" he writes: "Easier target for KGB." He gets up, paces. Suddenly, a shot rings out. It comes through the window and shatters the mirror. Barris dives to the floor. More shots, crazy relentless shooting. Barris crawls on his belly to the window, carefully reaches up and lowers the venetian blinds just as another shot whizzes through. The blinds explode. The shooting stops He waits on the floor, shaking like a leaf. He pulls the list off his desk and writes under "Pro": "I need another hit before I die."

Big Nose leaps onto stage. He is skinny, wearing a flowered shirt and a sarong, and playing a toy flute while dancing in ladies platform shoes. Suddenly he drops his flute, rips off his sarong, revealing polka-dotted boxer shorts and a yellow leotard. He rushes to a steamer trunk, opens it, and begins crazily pulling out endless amounts of old newspapers.

Barris waits on his mark for the taping to again begin. He watches the commotion around him with eagle eyes: technicians and stagehands running around, the audience chanting "Chuckie Baby", the celebrity panel joking with each other, the guys in the booth smoking, the guys in the band laughing. Barris turns around and around on his mark, trying to catch every movement, looking for a gun, a suspicious character. The chanting continues, louder and more distorted. The faces in the audience turn grotesque. Barris sweats profusely, his breathing becomes more and more shallow. Suddenly his eyes roll back in his head and he drops to the stage floor, unconscious.

	During the second world war, I had the pleasure of killing. Yes, pleasure. I found it exhilirating. Afterwards, I could find nothing else to fill me so much with life. So I became what I am today. I wanted the exhiliration again... of death.

Barris hurries away from the fat bachelor. He begins to spot others converging on him: the corpses of those he killed, bloody and disfigured. Crazy, angry-looking gonged Gong Show contestants appear in the crowd with weapons. KGB agents in trench coats and sunglasses wield guns, Day of the Dead skeletons dance after him. Barris breaks into a run. Suddenly confetti and balloons pour down on him out of the L.A. night sky. Barris dashes across the street, almost getting hit by a car. He ducks down an alley to catch his breath. As he leans against the wall and heaves, a middle- aged woman appears, somewhat backlit by the street light.

Something in her hand glints in the light. Barris reflexively grabs her arm. It's an ice pick. The two wrestle for it. The woman is extremely strong. Barris jams the palm of his hand up into the woman's nose. She staggers back, but doesn't drop the ice pick. Barris leaps at her. The two roll on the ground. The woman pins Barris. She straddles him and is about to stab him through the air. Barris reaches under her skirt and grabs her crotch. The middle-aged woman is a man. He screams in a distinctly male voice. Barris takes the moment of distraction to grab the ice pick and jam it up through the assailant's chin and into his brain. The assailant slumps over.

Barris pushes the body off himself, kneels beside it, and pulls off the wig. He gets up, shaking and heaving. He looks at the body one more time, kicks it in the head with all his might.

	Insane asylums are filled with people who think they're Jesus or Satan. Very few have delusions of being the guy down the block who works at an insurance company. Wonder what that means.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Y'know, I wanted to be a writer once. I wanted to write something that someday some lesser person would quote. But I never did. I'm the lesser person, Treesh. I never said anything meaningful that wasn't said by somebody else first. I am disposable. I disposed of people and I am disposable.
