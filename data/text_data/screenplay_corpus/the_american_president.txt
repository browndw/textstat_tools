JANIE starts to make a note.

SHEPHERD and JANIE enter the elevator. As the doors close...

<JANIE>

	Mr. Rothschild asked to have a moment with you this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANIE>
<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he upset about the speech last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEPHERD>
<JANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He seemed concerned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANIE>
<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it wouldn't be a Monday morning unless Lewis was concerned about something I did Sunday night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEPHERD>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator doors open, revealing LEWIS ROTHSCHILD. At 32, LEWIS is the President's chief domestic policy advisor. It would appear that he averages about two hours sleep a night, though that doesn't seem to slow him down.
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You skipped the whole paragraph.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<SHEPHERD>
<DIRECTION>
(to Janie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Monday morning it is.

LEWIS falls into the pace as the three of them head for the double doors leading to the South Lawn.
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"American can no longer afford to pretend that they live in a great society"...and then nothing. You dumped the whole handguns paragraph.

<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a time for prudence, Lewis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEPHERD>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was the kick-ass section.

<DIRECTION>
The three of them are now OUTSIDE and making their way down the COVERED WALKWAY that runs from the East Wing to the West Wing.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought what with being the President and all...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEPHERD>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, of course I didn't mean to imply--
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you'd be turning cartwheels this morning, Lewis -- 63 percent job approval.

</SHEPHERD>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's great news, sir, but...

They walk past a GROUNDKEEPER who's at work at a patch of grass.

<GROUNDKEEPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Morning, Mr. President.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUNDKEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
Before he's even completed the last syllable of the greeting, JANIE quickly and quietly said--
</DIRECTION>
<JANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANIE>
<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Morning, Charlie.

</SHEPHERD>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, the press is gonna need an explanation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?

SHEPHERD, LEWIS and JANIE walk through the door being held open by an AGENT. The conversation continues as they make their way through the corridors of

They walk quickly down a hallway teeming with STAFFERS, AIDES AND OFFICE WORKERS.
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you dropped the whole kick-ass section, now we've got this thing hanging out there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a thing hanging out there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEPHERD>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Americans can no longer afford to pretend that they live in a great society." Then ...nothing. No explanation. No context. So now it's just this thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it's hanging out there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEPHERD>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<DIRECTION>
SHEPHERD stops at an open doorway, calls to a STAFFER--

<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maria--

</SHEPHERD>
<STAFFER>
<DIRECTION>
(MARIA)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, sir.

</STAFFER>
<SHEPHERD>

	Did they tell you I'm gonna need--

</STAFFER>
<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>

SHEPHERD moves on. LEWIS and JANIE stay with him.
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President, I really feel we need to focus on...

</LEWIS>
<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lewis, however much coffee you drink in the morning, I want you to reduce it by half.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEPHERD>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't drink coffee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<SHEPHERD>

	Then hit yourself over the head with a baseball bat, would you please?

Another STAFFER crosses their path--

Once out of earshot--

<SHEPHERD>
<DIRECTION>
(to JANIE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should send her some flowers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEPHERD>
<JANIE>

And, with that, they walk through a doorway and into

:SC: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the OUTER OFFICE, MRS. CHAPIL, the President's secretary, is hard at work on a word processor. She stands as SHEPHERD walks in--
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CHAPIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, Mr. President.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHAPIL>
<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How're you, Mrs. Chapil?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEPHERD>
<MRS_CHAPIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine, thank you, sir. Mr. Kodak left the detailed breakdown of the approval poll for you. He seemed to indicate that it was very good news.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHAPIL>
<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sixty-three percent of it, at any rate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEPHERD>
<DIRECTION>
And by now they're in the OVAL OFFICE itself. SHEPHERD has gone to his desk and is looking over the various overnight briefing memos that have been left for him. As someone used to doing six things at once, he has no trouble reading, listening, and talking at the same time.

<MRS_CHAPIL>

	Lucy called just a moment ago. You forgot to sign her permission slip for her class--

This from ROBIN McCALL, a strikingly tall black woman and the President's press secretary, as she strides into the room.

	Not a great society, sir?

	Well, with you out of the country, it wasn't, Robin. Now that you're back, we're great again.

</SHEPHERD>

This is said to A. J. MACINERNEY as he walks through a separate entrance on the left side of the room. In addition to being the President's Chief of Staff and closest advisor, he's the President's closest and oldest friend.

<A_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that the letter from Solomon at the GDC?

	It would appear to be a letter from the entire environmental community. These people are outta control.

</SHEPHERD>
<A_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think they're just frustrated, Mr. President.
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_J>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are they blaming the President for global warming?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<A_J>

	Well, they don't think he caused it, if that's what you mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_J>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; to SHEPHERD)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I'm on the phone with these people twice a week. I honestly don't know what they want at this point.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What they want is a 20 percent reduction in fossil fuel emissions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<A_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It won't pass at 20 percent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_J>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We haven't really tried.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<A_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lewis, McSorley, McCluskey and Shane hold too many markers. If we try to push this through and lose, there will be a very loud thud when we hit the ground, and that's not what you want in an election year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_J>
<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talk to the GDC again, A.J. Tell them the President resents the implication that he's turned his back on the environment. Tell them I'll send 455 to the floor. But we're gonna ask for a 10 percent reduction. If they want to pull their support, fine. At 63 percent job approval rating. I don't need their help getting a bill passed. We gotta get going-- where's Leon?

LEON KODAK comes into the oval office. The White House pollster is a likable, if clumsy, numbers whiz. He, along with A.J., LEWIS, and ROBIN, are regarded as the President's Starting Team. The people in this room have grown very close over the past few years.

<KODAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. Good morning, Mr. President.

	<DIALOGUE>
	We're all here, Mr. President.
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_J>
<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. First, I wanted to say congratulations. Three years ago, we were elected to the White House by one of the narrowest margins in history, and today Kodak tells us 63 percent of registered voters think we're doing a good job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEPHERD>
<KODAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a second. You wanted me to poll registered voters?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KODAK>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone LAUGHS... even SHEPHERD smiles...
</DIRECTION>
<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the poll also tells us what we already knew: We don't get this crime bill of ours through Congress and these numbers are gonna be a memory. So, starting today, we're shifting it into gear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEPHERD>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I tell my morning press gaggle that gun control--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<A_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Crime control, Robin. Gun control means we're wimps and we're soft on crime.

	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't take it out for a spin, Lewis. We need it to get re-elected. For reasons passing understanding, people do not relate guns to gun-related crime.

Leon Kodak is as good as it gets when it comes to electoral strategy, and I'm certain he's told the President exactly what I'd tell him: Nail down Michigan and California, where they make cars and airplanes -- and burn plenty of fossil fuel. But if I had read these eight hundred pages, I would have discovered that it's the burning of fossil fuels that's been mostly responsible for global warming and that the 20 percent reduction recommended by the GDC is a necessary first step toward arresting the catastrophic greenhouse effect that has gone unchecked by this administration...

</SHEPHERD>
<SYDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President, what you saw in there was nothing more than vanity run amok. I was showing off for a colleague who doesn't think very much of me. It'd be a real injustice for you to hold the GDC accountable for my behavior today. On top of which, I'm monumentally sorry for having insulted you like that.

	</DIALOGUE>
</SYDNEY>
<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sydney, at 20 percent, we are 34 votes shy in the House. It can't be done. But I tell you what. I'll make you a deal with you. If you can get 24 votes, I'll get you the last 10.

	Twenty-four votes?

	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEPHERD>
<SYDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I'm a little intimidated by my surroundings, and yes, I've gotten off to a rocky and somewhat stilted beginning, but don't let that diminish the weight of my message: The GDC has been at every president for the last decade and a half that global warming is a calamity, the effects of which will be second only to nuclear war. The best scientists in the world have given you every reason to take the GDC seriously. But I'm gonna give you one more. If you don't live up to the deal you just made, come New Hampshire, we're gonna go shopping for a new candidate.

<A_J>

But this relationship had better go all the way, because with the leader of the free world there is no halfway.

<SYDNEY>

	If I were on your staff, I would tell you that the absolute worst thing you can do coming into an election year is to open yourself up to character attacks, and the fastest way to do that is to prance around like the playboy of the Western world.

<SYDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sex and nervousness is my problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYDNEY>
<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Last night when we were looking at the different place settings in the dish room, I realized that those place settings were provided by the First Ladies. And I'll bet none of those First Ladies were nervous about having sex with their President husbands. And you know why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEPHERD>
<SYDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, but I'm sure you'll explain it to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYDNEY>
<SHEPHERD>

	I will. Because they weren't presidents when they met them. Not the case here.

</DIRECTION>
<SHEPHERD>
<DIRECTION>
(speaking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. You're attracted to me, but the idea of physical intimacy is uncomfortable because you only know me as the President. It's not always gonna be that way, and the reason I know that is because there was a moment last night when you were with me and not the President, and I know what a big step that was for you. So, Sydney, I'm in no rush. Here's my plan: We're gonna slow down. When you're comfortable, that's when it'll happen.

<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. My nervousness exists on several levels. Number 1 -- and this is in no particular order -- I haven't done this in a pretty long time. Number 2: Any expectations you might have, due to the fact that I'm, you know...

	The most powerful man in the world?

	You'll call him? You mean you'll call him yourself? Personally? It'll come from the President? That's a great idea. I think you should call Leo and make a deal. He hires me back for, say, 72 days. I go around scaring the hell out of Congress, making them think that the President's about to drive through a very damaging and costly bill. They'll believe me, right, 'cause I'm the President's Friday Night Girl. Now I don't know if you can dip into this well twice, especially since I've lost all credibility in politics, but you never know, I might just be able to pull it off again. I might be able to give you just the leverage you need to pass some ground-breaking piece of crime legislation -- like a mandatory three-day waiting period before a five-year-old can buy an Uzi. Fuck the sweater -- she'll have to learn to live with disappointment.

<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Okay. Yes. Sometimes, I mean, I'm not sure. You know a lot more than I do -- but still, I have these feelings, and I don't think they're wrong. Like, okay, for instance, I'm not so sure it's all right to burn a flag. I mean, it really bothers a lot of people, and I don't know why you think it's okay. I hear Senator Rumson talk, and some of the things he says sounds right to me, and I think, "God, am I like Bob Rumson?! I mean, Dad thinks he's a jerk. Dad hates this guy! Why am I agreeing with him" And then I think, "Well, maybe I'm not really like Bob Rumson, but maybe I'm not like Dad either." But the point is I'm the President's kid, and people pay attention to what I say, and if I say something different from what you say, it'll be embarrassing for you. So I can't just get up in social studies class and say whatever I want.

You want to claim this land as the land of the free, then the symbol of your country can't just be a flag; the symbol also has to be one of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest." Show me that, defend that, celebrate that in your classrooms. Then you can stand up and sing about the land of the free. I've known Bob Rumson for years. I've been operating under the assumption that the reason Bob devotes so much time and energy to shouting at the rain was that he simply didn't get it. Well, I was wrong.

	This is a country made up of people with hard jobs that they're terrified of losing. The roots of freedom are of little or no interest to them at the moment. We are a nation afraid to go out at night. We're a society that has assigned low priority to education and has looked the other way while our public schools have been decimated. We have serious problems to solve, and we need serious men to solve them. And whatever your particular problem is, friend, I promise you, Bob Rumson is not the least bit interested in solving it. He is interested in two things and two things only: Making you afraid of it and telling you who's to blame for it. That, ladies and gentlemen, is how you win elections. You gather a group of middle-aged, middle-class, middle- income voters who remember with longing an easier time, and you talk to them about family and American values and personal character. Then you have an old photo of the President's girlfriend. You scream about patriotism and you tell them she's to blame for their lot in life, you go on television and you call her a whore. Sydney Ellen Wade has done nothing to you, Bob. She has done nothing but put herself through law school, prosecute criminals for five years, represent the interests of public school teachers for two years, and lobby for the safety of our natural resources.

	Tomorrow morning the White House is sending a bill to Congress for its consideration. It's White House Resolution 455, an energy bill requiring a 20 percent reduction of the emission of fossil fuels over the next ten years. It is by far the most aggressive stride ever taken in the fight to reverse the effects of global warming. The other piece of legislation is the crime bill. As of today it no longer exists. I'm throwing it out. I'm throwing it out and writing a law that makes sense. You cannot address crime prevention without getting rid of assault weapons and handguns. I consider them a threat to national security, and I will go door to door if I have to, but I'm gonna convince Americans that I'm right, and I'm gonna get the guns. We've got serous problems, and we need serious men, and if you want to talk about character, Bob, you'd better come at me with more than a burning flag and a membership card. If you want to talk about character and American values, fine. Just tell me where and when, and I'll show up. This is a time for serious men, Bob, and your fifteen minutes are up.

	That's kind of you, sir, but I realize I've been a little insensitive about some personal...
