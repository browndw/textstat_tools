The wail of a siren grows out of the distance and very faintly through the fog we see the headlights and flashing blue rack lights of a police car coming toward us. It drops into a dip, reappears almost immediately, hurtling down the center of the deserted highway. It gets closer and closer until the lights and siren fill our senses then zooms past us.

The police car passes a road perpendicular to the one it is on. A couple of houses down that road a faint glow spills over the sides of an industrial dumpster. As we watch we hear an eerie high pitched whistle, a shaft of light slowly rises out of the metal box and seems to fly off between the houses.
</DIRECTION>

INT. FINISHED HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As a humanoid silhouette passes in front of the picture window, a shaft of light floats by in the fog outside. The silhouette continues around to look at the kitchen. It raises a hand to eye level. There is a sharp "SNAP" and a hard-edged cone of light shoots out of the darkness to capture the inside of the kitchen and pulls back a three-dimensional image of stove, sink, cupboards, electrical fixtures and walls to the silhouette.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

The police car is parked in the middle of the dirt road. Benny and the officers are intent on a light that reaches them only in strobes as it moves through the houses in the direction of the fire on the hill. The police searchlight swings onto the house.

Carrying a shotgun the officer motions Benny and Mike to fan out on either side of him and, guns drawn, they cut across the tract to where they last saw the bobbing light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fog quickly isolates them, heightening their fear. Each man becomes acutely aware of the loudness of his breathing and the crunch of his footsteps on the ground. They drift in and out of visual contact with each other.
</DIRECTION>

Benny freezes as he hears a burst of the high pitched whistle sweep by on his left. He turns slowly to see, through the ribs of an unfinished house, a shaft of the white light pointing at a cement mixer.

Benny, his flashlight throwing a feeble beam in front of him, inches around the house looking for what he shot at. He gets to where it should be but it's not there. His light searches the area. There is nothing but a stack of lumber. Shaking visibly he shuffles to it and peers around its corner. Nothing. Benny relaxes and allows himself to breathe again.

Benny continues around the house. He flashes his light into a doorway. There is nothing but framing. When he moves on, a figure steps out of the darkness to fill the space, then raises its arms. With a sharp snap cylindrical devices swing off its wrist into its hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the corner of the house Benny hears the snap and stops. The high pitched whistle starts behind him. He stumbles around to face a brilliant white light flying directly at him. Benny screams in terror and fires at it. The light swerves and a laser streak from one of the hand rockets sears Benny's chest and knocks him to the ground in pain. Holding his shoulder he watches the light rise and fall erratically between the houses.
</DIRECTION>

The officers watch in awe as the beam wobbles through the air, then crashes to the earth.

The two men begin to trot toward the light. It swings wildly around and, accompanied by the high-pitched whistle, starts to stagger back up the hill. Benny and the officer break into a run. They are on their way up the hill when the light in front of them crashes to the earth. It rolls over and lays still, the beam shooting straight up into the air. Benny and the officer slow their pursuit, terrified of what they might find. Suddenly a high-pitched whistle is bearing down on them from behind. Before they can turn a light rockets over their heads. With a rumble the hill begins to vibrate. As they follow its flight, they see lights beginning to ripple to life across the skin of a saucer-shaped spacecraft resting at the edge of the forest on top of the hill. With a rumble the hill begins to vibrate. Frightened, the officers stop.

The humanoid figure walks rapidly down the hall into the kitchen. An indistinct image plays on the inside of its faceplate and we hear the faint sounds of a percussive language. Through the window over the sink we can see the lights of the spaceship.

From the road Benny and the officer watch as the humanoid figure that just blasted over them flies between the trees and into the white light emitting from the underbelly of the spacecraft. The noise from the ship's power plant is deafening as it begins to rise above the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With Mike at the wheel the police car, its rack lights flashing, fishtails up the dirt road and slides sideways to a bone-jarring stop next to Benny and the officer. As they jump out of the way they find themselves facing into the super white beam of the figure that was in the house. They are between it and the ship. At the angle that it is coming up the hill, the light looks like it is heading directly for them. This is too much for the officer and in terror he raises his shotgun and fires wildly at it. The figure veers off and disappears into the fog.

With an awesome roar the spacecraft reaches escape velocity and hurtles into the night sky. The concussion waves knock Benny and the officers off their feet.

The figure thrashes over on its back and tries to close a shoulder-to-hip tear in its life-support suit. By the faint identification light that flickers on and off inside its helmet, we see a MAN FROM THE STARS. His skin is translucent coral. He is gasping as our atmosphere mixes with his and threatens to suffocate him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under his translucent skin a maze of veins and arteries extend from a white mass that sits in the upper half of his head. He is hairless. Underneath a graceful fore-head, transparent eyelids droop over black pupilless eyes. The thin lips that delineate his mouth are chalk-white.
</DIRECTION>

He tries to clutch the edges of the tear together but is too weak. His hands drop limply from the suit, allowing the rent to gape open and reveal the translucent body underneath.

Behind the faceplate a piece of white light breaks off from the shining mass in the STAR MAN'S head and moves down his neck.

The STAR MAN lapses into unconsciousness as we hear the truck pull away.

Below him he can see the road leading into the housing tract is blocked by police cars. The helicopter leans into a banking turn and the spacecraft's blackened landing site comes into view.

The sound of a powerful slow-speed drill greets Bell and Shermin as they enter. The extraterrestrial is still on its back with its helmet lights shining straight up. A hose that extends from a portable gas chromatograph has been suction- sealed to a corner of the faceplate. A SCIENTIST is making adjustments at the chromatograph while his COMPANION is monitoring the progress of the drill into the faceplate. Both are wearing contamination suits.

A green dot appears in the area of western Wisconsin, a red dot in the area of Death Valley, California. He drops his hands to his lap and sits very still.

The lift off of Shermin's helicopter reveals contamination -- suited scientists slipping the dead extraterrestrial's coffin into the Air Force helicopter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOODS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN, still in his life-support suit, looks surreal in the twilight world under the canopy of firs. The morning rain has gone. A hum of traffic pulls him across the hill to a stand of alders that border the forest. Through the leaves he can see a highway entering the sprawl of Eau Claire, Wisconsin. The cars and trucks zipping along the asphalt are of particular interest to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he has absorbed them he walks through the trees to get a better look at the town. On the wind he can hear shouts from students boarding a line of yellow buses in front of a grade school off to his right. Suburban houses have begun to snuggle up to the base of the hill he is on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keeping to the tree line well above them he continues his search for an avenue of escape. His head swivels to watch a Volvo station wagon come down the street. It swings into the driveway of the house directly below him and stops next to a Mustang Hatchback. The back door opens and JENNY HAYDN, a pretty girl in her mid-twenties, gets out carrying a crudely lettered be-ribboned sign 'Welcome Back, Mrs. Haydn.' Female voices drift up to the STAR MAN from inside the car.

Jenny laughs and waves. With the Volvo moving away up the street Jenny picks her newspaper off her walk and goes into the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN presses on through the trees. He hears a light plane overhead. He stops and watches until the branches cut off his view. A path between two logs leads him to the tip of a promontory. From behind the cedars growing there, he sits and looks down on the center of Eau Claire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Arm in arm, a YOUNG COUPLE meander through the trees. The boy has a blanket over his shoulder and the girl's hair is disheveled. Without seeing him, they walk past the STAR MAN crouched in a thicket of small pines. After they've gone by, he straightens up and watches them walk down toward the highway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HILLSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun is setting over suburban Eau Claire. The colors are reflected in the STAR MAN's faceplate as he watches Jenny push a hand mower over her back yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a dusty gray marble out of a leg pocket and while Jenny finishes the lawn he rolls it between his gloves. It turns a glowing gold as it grows in size. When it reaches the dimensions of a baseball, he brings it close to his faceplate and speaks into it.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR_MAN>

He opens his hands and the ball rises quickly into the sky. Jenny is dumping the grass clippings into a garbage can at the side of the house when the sudden motion of the message ball catches her eye and she watches it quizzically until it disappears.

Lyman and the technicians tap out orders to their tracking units and the views of the forest on three of the television screens change to images from their microwave scanners, neutron back scatters and doppler radar. On a fourth screen the forward-looking infrared module begins creating a picture of the UFO. The men relax as they recognize the configurations of a light sea plane.

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are looking through the living room window at Jenny watching television while she irons the clothes she plans to wear to work tomorrow. The STAR MAN stands just outside the light-fall in the back yard watching her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A commercial interrupts the old movie with a jolly fat MAN in a jumpsuit touting his used cars. The two words 'We have...' are repeated constantly during the pitch. 'We have automatics... We have sticks... We have colors... We have financing...' ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move in close on the STAR MAN'S faceplate.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn!

</JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns around and looks down indecisively, then hurries upstairs. A light goes on in the bedroom. The STAR MAN backs away to look up at it. He can't see anything. He is on his way to try and get in the side door when Jenny comes clumping down the stairs in an old sweatshirt and pulling on a pair of jeans. She disappears into the kitchen. Without warning the door ahead of him is swung open and Jenny rushes out. The STAR MAN barely has time to step into the shadows. Jenny grabs the handle of one of the garbage cans lined against the house and drags it down to the street. When she comes back for the second one we see that the STAR MAN is no longer in the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny comes in and locks the door. She passes through the kitchen and is on her way to the stairs when the STAR MAN steps out of the darkness in the living room. A scream catches in Jenny's throat.

	<DIALOGUE>

</STAR_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny bolts for the front door. At the end of the hallway her foot catches in a phone cord pulling the phone off an end table. The receiver is jarred out of its cradle. Jenny regains her balance and gets to the door ahead of the STAR MAN. She jerks it open, but the guard chain stops it three inches from the jamb. Frantically, she tries again but the chain holds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN slams the door shut and reaches out to grab her. She flails back at him. One of her hands strikes the panel on his chest and the identification light comes on inside his helmet. At the sight of the STAR MAN, Jenny begins to scream. He presses her back against the wall and puts a mittened hand over her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<STAR_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wehave...

Jenny ceases her struggle and begins to cry. The STAR MAN takes his hand away from her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't hurt me... please... please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Holding her with his eyes he grasps one of Jenny's hands and lifts it up to look at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He raises a piece of skin off her wrist, rolls it between his thumb and forefinger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny lets out a blood-curdling scream and strikes out at him. Flashes of light erupt off his exposed chest where she hits. The ferocity of her attack knocks him aside and she sprints up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN recovers and starts after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny gets there two steps ahead of the STAR MAN. She slams the door in his face and locks it. With him POUNDING ON THE OUTSIDE, Jenny throws open the closet and begins rummaging madly through the side pockets of her jackets and coats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The POUNDING STOPS. It takes her a moment to hear the silence. When she does, she whirls toward the door expecting the worst, but it remains closed. She waits. All she can hear is the sound of the rain. She intensifies her search.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY>

(hysteria creeping into her voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's got to be here... it's got to be here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
She finds it in the pocket of a down jacket. The Army issue .45 looks big in her hand. She releases the safety and, with a wary eye on the door, reaches for the phone on the night table next to the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Long before the receiver gets to her ear, she can hear the "BLEET" caused by the PHONE BEING OFF THE HOOK for so long in the living room. She hangs up and walks around the bed to sit on the corner facing the door. In the distance, we can HEAR the THUMP OF AN APPROACHING HELICOPTER. After a moment's indecision, Jenny gets up and releases the lock. Again she waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing happens. With the gun ready, she turns the knob and opens the door a crack. The hallway is empty. She kicks off her shoes and lets herself out of the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Jenny creeps toward the stairs in her stockinged feet. She looks in the bathroom. The STAR MAN isn't there. She decides to go downstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN isn't in the living room. Jenny sidles along the wall for the front door. At the archway to the den a hissing sound stops her. She peers around the molding. The spill from the stairwell light provides the only illumination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN is sitting on the edge of a chair with his back to her. He is naked. A dot of light is HISSING around his head. The shadows in the room make it difficult for Jenny to tell exactly what is going on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pointing the .45 at the STAR MAN, she steps into the room for a better look. The floor creaks and the STAR MAN turns to her. Jenny shudders at what she sees. The STAR MAN is holding an 8x10 color photograph of Jenny and a man in his mid-twenties standing on a beach in their bathing suits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dot of light is copying the man's features onto the STAR MAN'S translucent head. The top two-thirds of the face is already done. Everything is perfect, even the eyes. Jenny begins to tremble and lowers the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(in a small voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... please don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
She sags against the armchair, racked by sobs that are drowned out by the FLAP OF THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER. The STAR MAN, with the dot of light stopped on his left cheek, gets up and takes the gun from her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drops it on the couch and raises his eyes to the sound of the helicopter NOW DIRECTLY OVER THE HOUSE. THROUGH THE WINDOWS, we can SEE the searchlight scouring the hillside next to the back yard.

The STAR MAN returns to the picture and resumes his transformation. He completes the chin, then continues downward weaving skin and filling in the human characteristics over the entire body.

INT. JENNY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWNBREAK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny, sitting on the floor with her arms wrapped around her knees, is reflected in a mirror fastened to the back of the closet door. The STAR MAN edges around the door to look at himself in the glass. In baggy tan cords, a windbreaker and a plaid shirt, buttoned all the way to the neck and a button in the wrong hole halfway down the front, he looks like an innocent abroad. He notices the shirt is askew across his chest and, with his new hands, awkwardly resets the buttons. He looks himself over. His movements resemble a human's but are noticeably more precise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clothes seem right so he leans into the mirror to inspect his face. He squeezes the skin on his cheeks, examines his eyes, turns his head as far as he can to inspect the sides of his face, folds his ears forward to check the skin behind them and he even gives a good two-fisted tug to his hair to see if it is on securely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns from the mirror and goes over to where the .45 and a leg pouch from his life-support suit are lying on the bed next to a snapshot of the man whose identity he has taken. In the picture the man is dressed exactly as the STAR MAN is now. The STAR MAN picks up the gun and the pouch and, speaking to Jenny in his own language, steps to the door and motions for her to follow. Jenny consciously ignores him. The STAR MAN comes over, reaches down and grabs her arm to pull her to her feet. Jenny squirms back, but he holds her tight. She looks at the hand, almost touches it, then up at the familiar yet disturbingly unfamiliar face above her.

INT. MUSTANG - DAWNBREAK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wary of what will happen next, the STAR MAN watches Jenny move the gear selector to the drive position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car jerks forward and he grabs the dashboard to keep from toppling back in the seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
During the ride up the block, his head swivels from side to side trying to take in as much of the darkened urban landscape as he can. When the car stops at a 'stop' sign, he looks at Jenny questioningly.
</DIRECTION>
<STAR_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR_MAN>
<JENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which way do you want to go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
She motions ahead and he turns to look at an inter-section with streets running in three directions off of it. His eyes question Jenny again.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can go that way...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(points left)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That way...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(straight ahead)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That way...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
She points right. After another look at Jenny, the STAR MAN presses the palms of his hands together, concentrates briefly, then slowly draws them apart. The force field appears between them. On it the solarized view of the United States rotates until the red destination dot is on his right. He drops his hands and points to the right.
</DIRECTION>
<STAR_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(measured)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The satel compass continues to hover over the dashboard.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(staring incredulously at the compass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, what are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
She starts her right turn without looking left and fails to see a little MG approaching from that direction. The WAIL OF THE AIR HORN startles Jenny and reflexively she slams on the brakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mustang stalls and the MG squeals around them. Jenny checks the STAR MAN. He has pressed himself against the passenger door. The gun lies on the seat next to him. They both look at it. The STAR MAN recovers and picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(starting the engine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
This time when Jenny puts the car into drive, the STAR MAN is ready for the acceleration. The car completes the turn and the compass rotates to its new heading. Looking at it from this angle, Jenny suddenly recognizes it for what it is: an aerial view of the United States.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That green dot, that's us, isn't it... and the red's where you want to go?... You don't understand me, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN looks at her uncomprehendingly.

INT. MUSTANG - DAWNBREAK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN is watching Jenny drive. A set of headlights rushes TOWARD US in the other lane. Jenny twists around to follow the car as it goes by and we SEE the desperation on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she returns her attention to the road, she sneaks a glance at the STAR MAN to see if her action has given away her state of mind. His expression hasn't changed. Jenny takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. Uttering a phrase in his own language, the STAR MAN touches the steering wheel.

With the same phrase in his language, he points to the 'gear shift.'

The STAR MAN sucks himself back in terror as the van descends on him. It swings past his window and clips the rear fender of the Mustang. Both vehicles shudder to a stop. Jenny claws at her door. It swings open. She is halfway out before the STAR MAN manages to grab the tail of her sweatshirt. Jenny begins to scream at the top of her lungs and keeps it up while he tries to wrestle her down on the seat.

The STAR MAN frees his right hand and blindly searches the floor for the gun. He comes up with it and, shoving the barrel in the Man's face, barks a harsh command in his language. The Man freezes and Jenny stops struggling. It's suddenly very quiet on the street.

He keeps his eyes on the STAR MAN until he reaches the back of the Mustang, steals a quick look at the license plate, then blots for his van. The STAR MAN takes his hand off Jenny's mouth and slams her back into her seat. Uttering an expletive in his language he points the gun in her face and keeping it there indicates the red dot on the satel compass floating undisturbed above the dashboard.

Lyman and the radar technician are asleep on the floor. Seated in front of the radio console Shermin is going through the telex messages. Next to him the radio technician is bent over the desk with his head in his forearms.

There are no more gas stations in sight. The STAR MAN becomes bored with the silence. He picks up Jenny's wallet. The driver's license is familiar so he flips to the next window. In it is a picture of an older man and woman standing in front of a church.

The STAR MAN does as he is told. He doesn't like it, but he does it. With his lips puckered, he looks straight down the road. The car rises out of a gulley. Topping a knoll straight ahead is a gas station with an enormous Exxon sign revolving above it. With his lips firmly pressed together, he tugs Jenny's sleeve and points.
</DIRECTION>

Jenny gets out of the car. When she straightens up, she finds the STAR MAN staring at her over the roof. She slams the door and strides rapidly in the direction of the ladies' room. Stuffing the green pouch in his pocket, the STAR MAN trots after her.

<JENNY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go back to the car.

The STAR MAN follows Jenny inside.

She continues out. The STAR MAN goes after her.

Jenny points to the sign on the next door.

<JENNY>

</JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
She cracks the door for him.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the door from her and pushes it open for a look inside. Jenny ducks into the ladies' room. He is confused for a moment then takes a long look at the men's room. It means nothing to him. He backs out and tries the ladies' room. It is locked. Not knowing what to do, the STAR MAN stands uncomfortably in front of the door, then like a child waiting for his mother, he sits on the curb. He watches the Attendant lift the Mustang's hood and reach in for the dipstick. The numbers on the pumps turn over, adding up the gallons and the cost of the gas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everything is peaceful and quiet within the circle of light cast by the gas station. The STAR MAN pulls the camera disc out of his pocket and points it at the pumps. The cone of light flashes out and pulls back its three-dimensional image. The Attendant turns around and waves genially at the STAR MAN, who waves back a perfect imitation of the gesture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SHARP RUMBLE of a SOUPED-UP HONDA MOTORCYCLE coming up the off-ramp shatters the mood and the STAR MAN gets to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is startled by the image of the RIDER. In a one piece driving skin and helmet he looks amazingly like a space traveller. The STAR MAN steps cautiously forward for a better look and mutters something to himself in his language. The rider stops his bike at the second row of pumps and swings himself stiffly out of the seat.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I need a key for the head?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDER>
<ATTENDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>

Without taking off his helmet, the Rider sets out for the men's room.

The rider's approach frightens the STAR MAN. He backs up to the ladies' room door and knocks. There is no answer. He tries the knob. With the other hand he inches the gun slightly out of his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Jenny is bent over the sink dabbing nail polish around the corners of a paper towel. Her head snaps around to look at the doorknob. It holds.

The STAR MAN tenses and forces a smile as the Rider passes in front of him. A VOICE comes from behind the faceplate.

	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDER>
<DIRECTION>
The rider enters the men's room. As the door closes behind him, the STAR MAN's face falls and he knocks frantically on the ladies' room door. Jenny opens it under his knuckles. He blocks the doorway and she backs up as he steps inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LADIES' ROOM - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN looks around. Jenny's eyes widen at what is happening behind him. The pneumatic arm above the door is pulling it shut to reveal her paper towel pasted to the back. The message on it, written in red lipstick, reads: KIDNAPPED GOING W ON 169 JADE MUS. LIC#PXV237.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(stepping around him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's still a toilet. Hasn't become a ballroom.

She tries to swing the door open and hide her message against the wall, but she is too slow. The STAR MAN sees it and steps forward to read.
</DIRECTION>
<STAR_MAN>

Other graffiti on the door helps convince the STAR MAN Jenny's message has nothing to do with him and after a last look at it, he follows her.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. GAS STATION - AFTERNOON

A CAN of Coke CLATTERS DOWN the chute of a drink dispenser. Jenny picks it up and, with the STAR MAN hovering at her shoulder, moves on to the candy machine. He watches a quarter disappear into the slot and when Jenny picks another one out of her purse, he points to it.
</DIRECTION>

He hands the can back to Jenny. She looks at it and knows there are alien bacteria there her body would not like to meet.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eh... you keep it. I've had enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN takes another drink. He stops dead when he lowers the can. Jenny continues for a few steps before she realizes he isn't with her. She looks back over her shoulder. Her eyes go immediately to where he is looking. The license plate PXV 237 hangs like an accusation on the front bumper of the Mustang. Jenny decides to brazen it out.

Jenny can't take it anymore and screams back at him through tears.

<JENNY>

	Kidnapped is what you're doing to me now!!! Kidnapped is pointing a gun at me and taking me from my house! Kidnapped is changing yourself into my husband. I don't know what you are and I don't care. I just want to get away from you!

Jenny's outburst rocks the STAR MAN back into silence. He waits for her to calm down, then slowly takes the gun out of his pocket.

Her upper lip trembles and, in spite of herself, she might cry. The STAR MAN sees the center lane is open. He checks his side mirror and drifts over, only to be caught by a light. The car is still rolling when Jenny makes her move. She throws open the door and, by the time the STAR MAN turns around, she is out and running.

Over her shoulder, Jenny can see the Mustang coming. She dodges up a brick walkway toward a J.C. Penney shopping mall. The Mustang skids to a stop at the curb.

Jenny warily approaches the railing and peers over. Below her the STAR MAN comes out of a record store. She turns away and gets on the escalator to the second floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE GROUND FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN thinks he sees Jenny in an electronics store, but when the girl turns around, it is obviously not her. Backing out of there, he knocks over a sandwich board advertising a restaurant. The LOUD THWACK it makes when it hits the cement turns faces in his direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny's is not among them. His eyes raise to the mezzanine. Maybe she's there. He looks wildly around for a way up. He spots the escalator and, trying to keep the upper floor in view while he runs for it, he slams into an unattended pram.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It begins to tip over. The BABY INSIDE SCREAMS. The STAR MAN manages to snatch it out of the carriage before it hits the floor. He is looking for a place to put it when the MOTHER comes charging out of a plant store.

Fear erases the STAR MAN's tenuous grasp of English and he begins to jabber in his own language. This makes Burt even madder.

Jenny has just gotten on the escalator to the third floor when she hears her name. She knows she shouldn't but she gets off and joins the crowd at the railing. From there, she can see the STAR MAN trapped in a circle of people. He clubs Burt away from him and tries to thrash his way out of the mob.

Some of the onlookers have joined Burt in his attempt to bring the STAR MAN down. Growling in his own language, the STAR MAN fights back as best he can. The sleeve of his windbreaker is torn. One of the T-shirts lands a blow on his right shoulder that turns the STAR MAN around. He takes a blow on the chest. Another in the kidneys. Burt gets a grip on the STAR MAN's left wrist and holds on. The attackers close in. Jenny's voice cuts through the din.

Still shaken, the STAR MAN nods. Jenny realizes that it is comforting to him to have his hand in hers and she leads him like a child down the sidewalk to the Mustang.

We FOLLOW Jenny THROUGH the people milling around the benches in the waiting area TO the STAR MAN seated in an open-faced coffee shop. He is watching a MOTHER feed her baby in the booth across from him. A map of the United States is spread out on the formica. Jenny plunks herself down catty-cornered from him. The tear in his sleeve has been closed with safety pins.

Jenny takes a few sweeps at an imaginary highway with her thumb. The stares this pantomime draws make the STAR MAN more nervous about the bus trip than he already is.

EXT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN stops the Mustang in front of the office. He and Jenny get out and go inside. As the door closes on them, three Nebraska Highway Patrol cars speed up the off-ramp. The lead car turns right on a surface street and enters the motel parking lot at the far end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The middle car goes straight across the intersection and positions itself at the curb next to the driveway, giving access to a frontage road which leads to an on-ramp. The last car also turns right on the surface street, but parks in a restaurant parking lot directly across from the office.

The STAR MAN swivels the picture around so that he can see it. Jenny hands the smirking Clerk her credit card. He steps to the side and inserts it into the imprinter. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees a dot of light leave the STAR MAN's forehead to drop behind the magazine and into his trousers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Clerk glances over at Jenny to see if she hears the HISSING that is going on behind the STAR MAN's fly. She does and she hopes it'll stop soon. His eyes on the STAR MAN, the Clerk fumbles the key to 117 off the rack.

The Mustang careens down the on-ramp and squeezes into the traffic a hair's breath ahead of an 18-wheeler. This cuts off the patrol cars momentarily, but the Mustang doesn't have the speed to stay ahead of them. Using the other cars on the road as shields, the STAR MAN dodges from lane to lane trying to keep the police from coming alongside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

The lead patrol car feints forward on the STAR MAN's side. The STAR MAN sways over to cut it off and the middle patrol car slips in next to Jenny. The STAR MAN grabs the gun from under the seat.

Her eyelids flutter open and she tries to speak, but can't. The middle patrol car is lining up for another shot. The STAR MAN slams the Mustang into it, sending it spinning onto the shoulder and into a ditch.

The last patrol car speeds up to replace it. The lead patrol car slips in next to the STAR MAN. They've got him in a sandwich. The STAR MAN stands on his brakes.

Caught by surprise, the patrol cars rocket ahead of him. The Mustang cuts across the swatch of land that acts as a center divider in the highway and races west in the eastbound lanes.

INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny moans as the car jostles over the rough ground. The STAR MAN puts out a hand to cushion her ride. His headlights pick up a gravel road splitting the field and he turns onto it. In a quick look back, he sees the patrol car shooting across the highway after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We FOLLOW the Mustang as it winds upward through the grazing lands sparsely dotted with clumps of trees. The plume of dust kicked up by the fleeing car is turned silver by a full moon. The WAIL OF the PATROL CARS is DISTANT BUT CLOSING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PASTURE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mustang barrels around a curve and slides to a surprise stop before a gate in a barbed wire fence that ends the road. With the .45 in his hand, the STAR MAN jumps out of the car and tries the gate. It is locked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he turns back to the car, he sees something that frightens him more than the approaching patrol cars. A helicopter has joined the chase. He looks for a place to hide. A stand of cottonwood and elm fifty yards on the other side of the gate offers the only protection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN opens the passenger door. Jenny is soaked in her own blood. He hooks the strap of her purse over his shoulder, lifts her tenderly and, cradling her in his arms, wiggles between a fence post and the gate and jogs into the trees.

<DIRECTION>
A deep shadow on the other side of an elm offers a likely hiding place. He moves through the underbrush toward it. Without warning, his feet begin to slip out from under him. He struggles to regain his balance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he does he looks down to find himself staring at a RAGING RIVER 150 feet below. The bank on the other side is just a few feet above the water and in the moonlight he can see a flat plain cut by a highway that stretches into the distance. Slowly, he backs away from the edge of the cliff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From under the elm he watches the helicopter sweep out over the ravine. Its searchlight darts toward him bleaching the treeline. The overhanging branches cloak him and Jenny and the light passes without picking them up. The STAR MAN adjusts his grip on Jenny and starts off in the opposite direction from the helicopter to look for a way down the cliff.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. TREES - NIGHT

Shermin, his people and the patrolmen are combing the woods with flashlights in a picketline search. The Third Driver stops at the mouth of a clearing that runs between the cottonwood and elm to the cliff. He takes a bite off a block of chewing tobacco.

As he replaces it in his pocket, he sees a shadow flit across the far end of the clearing. He swings his flashlight in that direction. The beam catches a piece of Jenny and the STAR MAN.

THE STAR MAN AND JENNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN peers around the boulder. At that instant the searchlight from the helicopter happens to splash across the men in the field. He sees that their guns are drawn and pointed in his direction. The STAR MAN pulls back and takes a marble from his pouch. It grows and glows gold as the STAR MAN rolls it between his palms. When it reaches the size of a baseball, he clutches it firmly in his right hand and EMPTIES the .45 toward Shermin and the police. This time, there is a BARRAGE OF ANSWERING FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the BULLETS RICOCHETING around him, the STAR MAN lifts Jenny to his shoulder. He massages the golden orb until it becomes the size of a soccer ball, then takes two quick steps to the edge of the cliff and leaps into the abyss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABYSS - NIGHT

Her rusty laugh follows him into the parking lot. He walks between the trucks to a semi which has half of a pre-fab mobile home tied onto its flat-bed. The polyethylene that covers the open side of the house flaps in the WIND at the lower corner next to the cab. The Driver opens his door. He takes out a staple gun and refastens the dark green plastic to the house frame.

The STAR MAN moves Jenny into a rectangle of moonlight shaped on the floor by a high, wide window and strips off her blouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cold light marbles Jenny's skin and makes the blood from her wounds appear black. With her blouse, the STAR MAN wipes away the blood on the right side of her head and neck. He finds a deep glass cut on her cheek and two entry points in her neck. He concentrates on her cheek and we can SEE the glow of his brain through his human skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bit of the white light comes out of his forehead. It tumbles across to Jenny's cheek and settles into the wound. The STAR MAN watches intently as one end of the wound flares brightly for an instant, then dies. The flesh left behind has been closed without a scar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A larger piece of light drops out of his forehead into what's left of the gash. With that area suffused in a healing glow, he shifts his focus to the pellet holes on her neck. He sends two pieces of light plunging into the wounds. Immediately, they spread into halos which we can SEE radiating from under the skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of the night comes a LONG BLAST ON the AIR HORN and the STAR MAN has to steady Jenny as the truck swerves around something in the highway.
</DIRECTION>

When it settles back into its ride, the STAR MAN wipes the blood off Jenny's shoulder. The beams of the passing cars through the plastic catch the fatigue on the STAR MAN's face as he works over Jenny.

It's still dark in here. With a chunk of light in his left hand, the STAR MAN dabs at the last of Jenny's wounds, leaving behind a phosphorescent bandage. More of these patches glimmer up and down her right side. He checks her over to see if he's missed a wound. He hasn't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He covers her with his windbreaker and, exhausted by his efforts, sits back against the wall. He waits to see that Jenny is sleeping comfortably, then presses the palms of his hands together. The satel compass appears between them. The green dot tells him he is still on course.

Catching the windbreaker as it slips off her front, she remembers that she was shot and examines her right side.

	Hello... hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
The WIND snapping the polyethylene is the only answer she gets. She picks her blouse off the floor next to her purse, but throws it aside and shrugs into the windbreaker when she sees the blood and bullet holes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her sudden rise to a standing position makes her light-headed and she has to lean against the doorway until the spinning stops. With her hands outstretched, as guards against the sway of the truck, Jenny shuffles down the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello. Where are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
There is no one in the kitchen and she continues into the living room. It is empty. Jenny opens the door to an enclosed back porch. It is also empty. The STAR MAN is gone. She returns to the living room and stands there not really knowing what to do next. The countryside rushes by outside a floor- to-ceiling picture window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WAIL FROM the semi's AIR HORN jars Jenny out of her reverie and she goes to press her cheek against the window. She is looking past her left hand at the road when she notices a wide green ring on her finger above her wedding band. She steps back from the window to examine it, then with some trepidation, twists it off. As it clears the end of her finger, the STAR MAN's VOICE SPEAKS OUT OF IT.
</DIRECTION>
<STAR_MAN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Jennyhay...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny drops the ring as if she'd been stung. The STAR MAN's voice stops as soon as she does and the ring bounces across the floor until it hits the baseboard. It looks innocent enough lying there, but Jenny has a great deal of trouble making herself approach it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she finally picks it up, it does nothing. She turns it in her hand and when the side of the ring hole that was facing her when she took the ring off faces her again, the STAR MAN's VOICE CONTINUES.
</DIRECTION>
<STAR_MAN>

	You don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. I got a girl going to college this fall. The wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOK>
<DIRECTION>
He sticks a cigarette in his mouth and flips one up for the STAR MAN.
</DIRECTION>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smoke?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOK>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN takes it, quickly examines it, then positions it in his mouth at the exact angle the Cook did. His eyebrows raise when the Cook flicks his Bic and puffs an ash on the end of his cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The butane flame is swung in his direction and he flinches back before allowing the Cook to singe his Camel. He copies the Cook's puffing and the end of his cigarette begins to glow.
</DIRECTION>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wants to become a doctor. She's a bright kid. Hard worker. I think she'll make it. But the damned inflation's driven the tuition up so high it makes it real tough on a family like ours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOK>
<DIRECTION>
The Cook inhales deeply from his cigarette and blows smoke at the windshield. The STAR MAN mimics the inhalation, then chokes. His eyes bulge and his cheeks puff out as he tries to be cool and not cough. The Cook takes no notice of his struggles.
</DIRECTION>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got two other kids. I don't know what we'll do when they get old enough for college.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOK>
<DIRECTION>
Smoke starts to dribble out of the Star Man's nose and mouth. Puzzled, he re-examines his cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody blames it on the oil crisis. That might be where it starts. But I think a lot of people are just using that as an excuse to rip the rest of us off. I see it every day in the kitchen. Peaches. We use the gallon cans. The price has gone up three times in the last year. And now the cans are only half full.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOK>
<DIRECTION>
The Cook takes another drag. As if etiquette required it, the STAR MAN hurries to copy him. This time there are no ill effects.

</SECOND_ATTENDANT>

He hands the snapshot back to Jenny. She nods a 'thank you' and looks wistfully around the yard. There is nothing she can do. Fitting the picture back into her wallet, she walks away. After a few steps she turns back.

The activity in the diner comes to a screeching halt and in the silence Jenny adds in a normal voice:

An OLDER MAN, with a face seamed by cigarettes and weather, waves at her from the counter.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to Des Moines. If you can wait till I finish here, you're welcome to ride along.

<JENNY>

Smiling self-consciously, she takes a seat at the end of the counter and orders coffee from the waitress. While she is waiting for it to come, she happens to glance outside and sees a Colorado Highway patrol car stopped in the yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The officer on the passenger side is talking to one of the attendants. Jenny turns away from the window and finds that she is able to watch the conversation in a strip of mirrors that runs around the top of the pie case. The squad car leaves and her coffee arrives.

She sees the dun-colored Roadrunner waiting at the foot of the on-ramp for a break in the traffic, but she is too far away to see who's inside.

EXT. LAS VEGAS - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fire-engine-red Pontiac convertible with two COWBOYS (late fifties) in the front and Jenny and the STAR MAN in the back moves with the traffic along the main drag in the downtown area. The STAR MAN's head swivels from side to side trying to take in the neon that juts up around him. The convertible stops at a light. The cowboy on the passenger side opens the door and tips his hat to Jenny as she and the Star Man get out of the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDEWALK (LAS VEGAS) - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN is afraid of the crush of people and wants to stay close to Jenny, but is fascinated by the whir and click and jingle of the one-armed bandits that seem to be everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<STAR_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this gambling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny nods. A LADY in curlers and pedal pushers hits a twenty dollar jackpot. Hanging onto Jenny's hand the STAR MAN turns around and walks sideways to watch the quarters tumble out into the lady's shopping bag.
</DIRECTION>
<STAR_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.

INT. DRUG STORE - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN hangs back to examine a one-armed bandit inside the front door while Jenny goes to the counter. An almost imperceptible blue haze seems to seep from under the STAR MAN's palms as he runs his hands up and down the sides of the machine.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (to the clerk)

While the clerk searches for the map the STAR MAN comes up to Jenny.
</DIRECTION>
<STAR_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I have twenty-five cents, please?

</STAR_MAN>
<JENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<STAR_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to gamble.

</STAR_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny sighs and rolls her eyes and fishes two quarters out of her purse and hands them to him.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<STAR_MAN>

<DIRECTION>
(heading back to the machine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
He drops a quarter into the slot and pulls the handle. While the pictures of fruit spin behind the view window, his hands stroke the sides of the machine. An orange, a pear and a cherry stop in the view window. At the counter Jenny explains to the clerk that she is hitchhiking and wants the busiest route into Death Valley without going through Lathrop Wells. The STAR MAN looks long and hard at the machine before putting in his last quarter. He pulls the handle. The blue haze flows from his palms, three cherries lock into a line and the one- armed bandit begins to spit quarters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny is nervous about being here. She feels every face that looks at them could be a cop. The STAR MAN is pulling her through a Maginot Line of slot machines toward a 'Super Jackpot' machine that advertises a $275,000 payoff.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is crazy. We don't have time for this.

	If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN pops a gleaming silver dollar into the machine, pulls the handle and places his hands against the metal. Jenny, knowing it can't work, but hoping that it will, stands back and gnaws on her thumb. Then she sees the blue haze vibrating out of the STAR MAN's palms. Jenny stifles a scream. She looks around to see if anybody else has noticed. They haven't. The STAR MAN smiles at her. The force field does it's work. A picket line of 7's fills the view window. Amid the jangle of bells and flashing lights that accompany a winner Jenny doesn't know whether she should jump for joy or hide her face.

In the passenger seat the STAR MAN is riffling through a Columbia "History of the World." A Webster's Dictionary is on the dash in front of him. Wedged between his legs and the transmission well is a shopping bag full of money.

Jenny slams on the brakes. One of the Cobra helicopters, lit from the inside, is parked next to a line of flares across the road ahead.

The STAR MAN is looking through a window at the repair bay, lit by a work light. Jenny is standing in a phone shell on the front of the garage, the receiver to her ear.

The STAR MAN moves to the office door. He tries the knob. It is locked.

Tethered by the phone cord, Jenny tries to see what the STAR MAN is doing inside the repair bay.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REPAIR BAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using an air filter top as a basket, the STAR MAN scavenges from the work bench and the car up on the lift, fuses, lengths of wire, circuit boards from a radio, tubing, metal pipe and a Black and Decker drill. While he is doing this we get glimpses of Jenny pleading his case on the phone. Finally, leaving the receiver dangling at the end of its cord, she comes around to stand in the doorway.

INT. REPAIR BAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN shaves the rubber off the electrical lines leading into the fuse box and clips two wires of his own onto the exposed copper. With Jenny watching we have a montage of the STAR MAN working through the night: modifying the insides of the Black and Decker drill, cutting out the mid- section above the trigger, fitting electrical components into that area, screwing a pipe into the bit-clamp, welding it together with the spark that arcs between the electrical wires.
</DIRECTION>

Both hands on the wheel, Jenny is burning down the center line. The STAR MAN bends two thin wires trailing out from the grip of the drill. Jenny winces as he buries them into the flesh on either side of his left wrist. The car skates around the corner of a low hill. They can see that the Cobra is still sitting next to the road.

Jenny kills her lights and glues the accelerator to the floor. Three MEN scramble from the helicopter with M16s. A BURST OF SLUGS RIPS THROUGH the Camaro's WINDSHIELD. The STAR MAN leans out the passenger window and with an other-worldly scream, fires. The helicopter is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS. The concussion throws the men to the ground.

The STAR MAN draws the satel compass out between his palms. The green dot now covers the right half of the red dot. He presses his palms together and looks past Jenny at the rugged foothills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first light of day is starting to color the sky behind them. Jenny and the STAR MAN are startled by the DRUMMING WHOMP OF A HELICOPTER. The STAR MAN looks out the window for its source. He can't see anything. The SOUND FADES. In a moment, it is REPEATED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CAR and AGAIN IT FADES.

Jenny and the STAR MAN steady themselves for the last leg of their journey. Suddenly, their silence is exploded by a COBRA dropping out of the sky in front of them. Its searchlight bangs into their faces and, with its thirty-calibre MACHINE GUNS BLAZING, it comes straight at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny yanks the Camaro onto the shoulder. The SLUGS CHEW UP the asphalt beside it. She fishtails back onto the road. A SECOND COBRA surprises them from the STAR MAN's side. Its MACHINE GUN KNOCKS OUT the BACK WINDOW before he can FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN crawls over his seat and arranges himself in the hole that was the back window to meet the Cobras' next FIRING RUN. It doesn't take them long. The first two have been joined by a THIRD. They swoop down on the Camaro.

SHOTS THUMP INTO the trunk in front of the STAR MAN and he FIRES. The lead HELICOPTER ERUPTS, raining pieces of hot metal over the desert floor.

The STAR MAN turns toward the Cobra. Weakly, he raises his weapon and pulls the trigger. Nothing happens. The searchlight from the Cobra finds them.

Shermin's helicopter passes over the heads of Jenny and the STAR MAN and rises into the dawn sky.

	Shermin!!!

He throws down his headset.

(to the pilot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lock in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOX>
<DIRECTION>
The gunsights lock in on Jenny and the STAR MAN. Fox's grip tightens on the trigger. Suddenly the helicopter begins to vibrate and drift off its target. Fox looks toward the sound coming from his right and his eyes widen in fear as he sees the STAR MAN's ship looming over him.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The spacecraft passes over the top of the helicopter. The whirling downdraft emanating from the spaceship's underbelly yanks the Cobra away from Jenny and the STAR MAN and whips it into a spin which gets faster and faster until it disintegrates and falls to the desert floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny and the STAR MAN shield their faces against the DUST STORM that billows under the WHINING DESCENT of the spacecraft. It settles into a landing across the dirt road resting on its three pods. With a crack, a cone of bright white light blasts from the underside.

<JENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<STAR_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny nods.
</DIRECTION>
<STAR_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I do now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR_MAN>
<JENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN puts his arms around her and holds her tight.
</DIRECTION>
<STAR_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR_MAN>
<JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(her head on his shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm never going to see you again, am I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<STAR_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses the tears out of her eyes, then full on the mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
The STAR MAN steps back and places a hand on Jenny's stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<STAR_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell the baby about me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR_MAN>
<JENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<STAR_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
He turns from her and walks to his ship. Jenny watches him go, then remembers something.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
She gets the Webster's Dictionary and the Columbia History of the World from the Camaro and runs to the STAR MAN. He takes them and kisses her again.
</DIRECTION>
<STAR_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Jennyhaydn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny backs away as the STAR MAN walks under the ship into the white light. He waves one last time to Jenny and is swallowed into the ship by the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny turns away from the stinging sand as the space-craft lifts off. When she looks again, it is high and moving over the foothills. A banking turn brings it back. The ship dips low over her, rocks itself in a gesture of farewell, then shoots off into the stars. When she can no longer see it, Jenny drops her wave with a sigh and starts back toward the Camaro.

Over her walk, we SUPER:
