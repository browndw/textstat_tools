CAMERA PANS an arid expanse of scorched earth. J'ONN, a ragged and malnourished homesteader of some alien race, toils beneath a blazing sun, his BACK TO CAMERA. He sinks an auguring device into the ground, drilling in vain for water. There are many hundreds of holes in the earth around him. He suddenly straightens and squints into the dust storm as HOOFBEATS fill the SOUNDTRACK.

<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA TILTS DOWN revealing J'onn's rifle as he cocks the weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He uses stones as ammunition, which slip from his hand and fall to the parched ground as he tries to load the rifle. He turns and points the gun as the Rider continues his approach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
J'onn raises his gun as the Rider reins his horse to a halt ten feet short of him. The beast snorts and stamps its hooves impatiently while the Rider studies the frightened homesteader and removes a breathing apparatus from his mouth. Finally, he speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought weapons were forbidden on this planet.

The Rider swings down from the saddle. He's tall, powerfully built beneath his dusty robes, his face shadowed by a hood. He indicates their bleak surroundings.

A 23rd Century equivalent of a frontier saloon. Futuristic honky-tonk MUSIC. The patrons are rugged, unpleasant types. Klingons, Romulans, Andorians, you name it. Much drink and boisterous talk. Arguments. Fistfights. Two men play futuristic "pool" on a table filled with water.

Talk and noise go dead as the entire saloon turns its attention to the newcomer. The stranger, seen only from the back, steps into the squalid bar. The Bartender jerks his thumb in the direction of the back room. The stranger crosses to the back room and disappears inside. Talk and noise resume.

The stranger lowers the breathing device from her face and is revealed to be a young woman. A Romulan. Her name is CAITHLIN DAR and she stands on the threshold of the room, trying to adjust her eyes to the murky surroundings. She's a little nervous and a long way from home.
</DIRECTION>

The back room is a storage area for unwanted odds and ends. A ceiling fan swishes overhead pushing hot air around. Two men are sprawled in chairs at opposite ends of a table. They're two busy drinking to notice Caithlin's entrance.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, I'm Caithlin Dar.

</CAITHLIN>
<DIRECTION>
The man seated closest to Caithlin slowly swivels his head in her direction. He wearily extracts himself from his chair and comes forward. He's a Terran (specifically, an Englishman) named ST. JOHN TALBOT. Thin and dissipated, alcoholic, Talbot is a veteran of the diplomatic corps. He pats down his unruly hair and straightens his soiled suit. He gives Caithlin a tired smile and extends a limp hand.

Caithlin regards the hulking figure at the other end of the table. KORRD is an old, overweight Klingon, a once-great warrior past his prime. He doesn't rise to greet Caithlin. Instead, he takes a swig from a flagon and emits an earth-shaking belch.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SPACE - THE GREAT BARRIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enterprise is poised on the edge of the giant star cluster known as the Great Barrier. It is visually stunning and equally dangerous. We see giant regions of star formations as well as expanding blast waves from exploding stars. Beams of radiation from pulsars sweep the tiny and insignificant ship, bathing her in color.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BRIDGE - ANGLE TO INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sybok is on the bridge. Uhura, Chekov and Sulu are at their stations. Caithlin, Korrd and Talbot are also present. They and the rest of the crew are transfixed by the viewscreen, awed by the vista of a sky filled with thousands of stars, each a fiery orange.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But what really draws their attention is the black thundercloud looming directly ahead. Here starts the ring of gas and dust that enshrouds the center of the galaxy, hiding it from view. Behind this black veil is a region that emits ten times more energy than our sun. Through the chinks in the wall we see flashes of blue light - hints of the fires blazing within.
</DIRECTION>

Kirk, Spock and McCoy experience a rush of elation. They gaze through the window at an incredible spacescape, unable to deny the sensation stirring within them. Sybok was right.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - INSIDE THE BARRIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Surprisingly, there is no turbulence, no buffeting. The Enterprise travels through a fantastic passageway of light and color. Then, quite suddenly, the gas clouds part and the ship enters a region of incredible calm and serenity, like the clear space at the eye of a hurricane.

Kirk, fascinated by the planet, moves to the antique ship's wheel. He absentmindedly rests his hand on it. His eyes are drawn to the plaque attached to the spokes of the wheel. On it, the charter of the Enterprise has been set in bronze. CAMERA MOVES IN on these words:

Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Sybok descend into the bowl of the crater. They reach the center and stop. They look at each other, wondering, "Is this all there is?" Sybok tries to hide his disappointment. He looks around for a sign that isn't there, then, after a moment of deafening silence, he addresses their bleak surroundings.

(shouting; a trace of desperation) We have traveled far by starship...

<DIRECTION>
The ground comes to life beneath the feet of our hero's. The earth buckles and ripples as if nature herself were trying to break free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without warning a pillar of sheer rock rips through the surface and climbs skyward. Then another pillar shoots up, followed by another and another. They encircle the amphitheater like giant fingers. We INTERCUT Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Sybok reacting to this dazzling display of power.

The fingers of rock form a crude cathedral.

:SC: INT. AMPHITHEATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Within this primitive cathedral, Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Sybok watch as the ground in front of them melts like molten lava. It swirls, creating a vortex. A RUSHING SOUND comes from the planet's core, growing closer. Something of incredible power is on its way to the surface.
</DIRECTION>

Sybok staggers back. Like Kirk, Spock and McCoy, he must shield his eyes from the intensity of the energy shaft.
