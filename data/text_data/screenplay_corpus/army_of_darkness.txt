	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would you say that I am insane? I wouldn't say that I've lost my mind simply because I've heard the voices and seen the godless things moving in the woods. If anything, I think more clearly now than ever before. I know now that there is such a thing as a living Evil. A dark and shapeless thing that lives not in the spaces we know, but between them. In the Dark. In the night. And it wants the exact same thing as you and I: a chance at warm life on this Earth. It doesn't care that is already had that chance ...once. Now listen closely because there isn't much time. Listen and believe, because it's all true.

POSSESSED WOMAN - STOP MOTION ANIMATION Her blackened lips pull back and her mouth opens to an impossibly large size, like a snake about to eat an egg. ASH grasps a flaming log with his bare hands and rams it down the monster's oversized throat. She chokes. GOLD TOOTH AND THREE OTHER WARRIORS grab the beast and pull it off of Ash.

THE EVIL FORCE P.O.V. powers through the woods toward Ash. ASH kick his steed and bolts. THE EVIL FORCE sweeps over the forest floor, gaining velocity. ASH frantically weaves his horse around storm felled trees which jut from the ground. THE EVIL FORCE rips through the trees, splintering them to toothpicks. It burrows underground, and resurfaces, always closing upon Ash. ASH jerks upon the reins and his steed leaps a fallen tree. He gracefully leaps a second tree. But as he leaps over the third, he is ripped off the horse by a low branch. He falls hard to the mud as the horse gallops off. He groggily stands and stumbles onward.

He moves to the fireplace and hunches before the flames, CAMERA PANS TO.... THE SHATTERED MIRROR PIECES Each piece of mirror reflects an image of Ash. From the eight pieces of mirror spring... EIGHT TINY ASHES Two inch high versions of himself. They leap from the mirror fragments and land on the floor. ASH is unaware of them as he kneels close to the fire. TINY ASH #1, #2, AND #3 grab a discarded dinner fork. Like men on a battering ram, they race forward to jam it into Ash's buttocks. ASH SCREAMS in agony and jerks forward, banging his head into the stove pipe. TINY ASH #4, #5, AND #6 lift the barrel of the shotgun in Ash's direction. Another leaps upon the shotgun's trigger. BOOM! ASH barely dives away from the blast the would have taken his head off. THE TINY ASHES SHRIEK with uncontrollable laughter. They jump away from the shotgun and scurry off across the floor. ASH pulls the fork from his buttocks and heaves it. TINY ASH #1 is running for his life, as fast as his tiny legs will carry him. TRACKING SHOT - THE FORK a giant projectile as it ROARS AT CAMERA. PAN with it as it WHOOSHES past. FA-THONG! THE FORK skewers tiny Ash #1 to the wooden wall of the mill. ASH stumbles over a broom handle that has been thrust out in front of him by other tiny ASHES. His head slams into a stove pipe. He crumples. He lands with his cheek pressed against the hot stove. SSSSSSssss. He pries his face loose with a spatula. A BUCKET OF GREASE is pushed off a high shelf. CLANG! IT LANDS ON ASH'S HEAD and spills slippery grease about the floor. ASH with an upside-down bucket on his head, slips and falls, back and forth on the grease. He stands and tries to dislodge the bucket. He trips over the broom handle, again thrust in his path. He falls backward, onto a crochet basket with knitting needles jutting from it. BUCKET-HEADED ASH SCREAMS and jerks upward, slamming his bucket head into the stove pipe. CLANG! Ash rips the bucket from his head then yanks the needles from his buttocks. He looks about for the little imps. TINY ASH #2 crouching behind a log attempting to hide. BUT... ASH has seen him.

Ash's gigantic foot comes down to crush the little man. Tiny Ash #3 raises a rusty nail into the path of the descending foot. RIP!! THE NAIL RIPS through Ash's shoe. ASH jerks his leg upward in pain. Ash dances about the place hopping on one foot, HOWLING. He strays into the greasy area of the floor and stumbles over the broomstick again thrust in his path, swung there by Tiny ASHES #6, #7 and #8. He almost regains his balance when he strays into the oil patch, falls, and hits his head on the stone floor. BLACKNESS. ASH awakens on the floor of the Mill, like Gulliver he is bound with tiny ropes. Directly above him, on the edge of a table... TINY ASHES #4 AND #5 suspend Tiny Ash #6 by his legs. TINY ASH #7 AND #8 stand atop Ash's face. They push from either side of his nostrils, plugging his nose. Ash's mouth opens as he gasps for air. As he inhales... SUSPENDED TINY ASH #6 is released. TINY ASH #6 - SLOW MOTION - WIND FAN He free falls for a moment, then the tiny body arcing to form a perfect swam dive, plunges down into Ash's opened throat. ASH inhales the living beast whole. He chokes violently. He breaks his bonds an he hacks for breath. He puts his finger down his throat, trying to make himself vomit up the little man, to no avail. He looks about to crush some of the little ASHES but they are gone. He places his hand on his stomach and dizzily stumbles to a chair. He goes pale.

CLOSE ON ASH'S ARM - STOP MOTION ANIMATION We can see the outline of Tiny Ash #6's body squirming down Ash's arm, just beneath the skin. ASH watches in horror as... THE TINY FIGURE squirms down his wrist and disappears into his iron hand. The Iron hand snaps open and closes uncontrollably. The possessed iron hand swings at him. THE IRON HAND connects with an uppercut that knocks Ash out of frame. ASH lands next to an iron vice. He reaches for the EVIL HAND. But the hand has grabbed a mallet that BONK-BONKS him on the head. Ash is groggy as he is grabbed by the hair and yanked down into the opened vice. THE EVIL IRON HAND cranks the vice's handle. THE VICE tightens around Ash's head. Trapped, he looks to... THE EVIL HAND rummaging through a wooden toolbox. It comes upon a crude wooden punch. ANGLE - THE EVIL HAND - UNDERCRANKED stabs rapidly at Ash's good hand.

A DEADITE ARROW pierces his armor and he falls to his death. :SC: INT. COURTYARD A VIKING DEADITE looks up as he hears... CHUG! CHUG! CHUG! DEADITE'S P.O.V. THE DOORS OF THE BLACKSMITH'S SHOP BURST OPEN Through the dust and smoke something appears...An iron beast...belching steam...It's angry iron blades whirling. Behold... THE DEATHCOASTER The stripped chaise of the Delta 88 Oldsmobile. A steam engine is mounted to it's center to power the craft. At the front and rear are spinning, helicopter like rotor blades. GOLD TOOTH shovels coal into the Deathcoaster's furnace. ASH is at the helm. He pulls a cord. THE DEATHCOASTER'S STEAM WHISTLE SCREAMS to announce its birth. THE VIKING DEADITE is cut to ribbons by swirling blades. THE VILLAGERS ATOP THE PARAPET cheer! EVIL DEAD at the base of the ladders look up in horror to see... THE STEAM DRIVEN ROTOR BLADES slicing through two Deadites at once. The cow-catcher in front pushes aside the halved Evil Dead. ASH operates a crude instrument panel with only two levers to steer the craft. It's a bumpy ride. WIDE SHOT - THE DEATHCOASTER Thwop! Thwop! Two more skeletons bite the dust. leathery hands pluck a SCREAMING Gold Tooth from the craft. GOLD TOOTH disappears beneath the squirming corpses. A moment later he re- emerges as a skeleton himself, except for the single gold tooth that shines against the white of the bone. He stands and joins the Deadites. EVIL SHEILA leaps onto the moving Deathcoaster to face Ash.

<DIRECTION>
EVIL SHEILA attacks with a SHRIEK! ASH spins out his double barreled shot gun and... BLAMMITY-BLAM! ...blows her off the craft. She does a back flip into the other Deadites. ASH pulls hard on the steering stick and it tears loose from the craft. THE DEATHCOASTER careens out of control. ASH tumbles from the helm and hits the ground. THE DEATHCOASTER flips, crushes a group of Deadites against a wall, and explodes. ASH picks himself up from the dust. He looks upward to... LADDER #2 - ARTHUR attempts to push the ladder away. A sword comes up into frame, stabbing Arthur. He is yanked to his death with a shriek! Evil Ash, with his bloody sword, leaps up from the ladder and onto the parapet. He's headed for the Book of the Dead. BELOW IN THE COURTYARD - ASH races to a set of ropes and pulley that ascend the parapet. Two deadites come at him. He grabs the rope with his steel hand and slices one end of it with his sword. ABOVE HIM - A NET OF BOULDERS plummet down atop the two deadites, crushing them. Simultaneously, Ash is tanked upward by the rope, to the parapet. ASH looks to... EVIL ASH approaching the Necronomicon. ASH kicks aside a hay bale and removes a mini-crossbow with four flame tipped arrows, loaded and ready. He fires. A FLAME ARROW imbeds in Evil Ash's leg and ignites his body. Another flaming dart hits his shoulder blade. The flames consume his body. He burns and SHRIEKS! ASH watches in horror as... THE FLAMES RECEED revealing a bone white skeleton with mismatched eyes. SKELETAL EVIL ASH! It races at Ash with a SHRIEK. ASH AND EVIL ASH bring their swords together with such great force that sparks fly. Ash is forced back against the stone pedestal that holds the Necronomicon. CLANG! With a deft stroke, Ash's sword is flung from his hand. ASH'S SWORD imbeds in a wooden beam. EVIL ASH grabs the Necronomicon, then swings his sword at Ash. ASH grabs a burning iron torch from its mount. ANGLE ON WHOOSH! KLANG! WHOOSH! KLANG! Man and Skeleton battle with flaming torch and sword. ANGLE ON KLANG! The torch is knocked from Ash's hand. It falls over the edge of the wall and lands in the courtyard below. It ignites a fuse. The burning fuse leads to a sack of black powder. The sack sits upon the spoon of a catapult. ABOVE... SKELETON ASH swings his sword. Ash leaps over the blade. The Skeleton swings downward, and Ash side steps it. ASH rabbit punches CAMERA. CLOSE ON SKELETON HEAD Ash's fist bursts out all it's rotted teeth. ASH delivers a right hook, spinning the skeleton's head around in a circle. THE SKELETON gives Ash a backwards roundhouse kick to the face. Ash tumbles over the edge. ASH falls to the courtyard below, alongside the catapult. He glances at the burning fuse. EVIL ASH leaps from the parapet and lands atop the catapult. The Skeleton looks down at Ash with a nasty grin of bone. SKELETON ASH Behold... He gestures to the Evil Dead that overrun the parapet and now battle the last twenty of Arthur's warriors for control of the Keep. ANGLE ON SKELETON ASH

ASH AND THE SKELETON turn... A jubilant CHEER rises from the castle as... DUKE HENRY THE RED AND FIFTY OF HIS MEN thunder down the hill, across the drawbridge and into the castle courtyard to attack the Deadites! THE SKELETON - ATOP THE CATAPULT turns back to Ash and raises his sword for the kill. ASH has grabbed a sword from a fallen warrior. With a single motion he slices the hand that holds the Necronomicon from Skeleton Ash. ASH snags the book with one hand and on the backswing, slices through the rope, springing the catapult. THE SKELETON AND BURNING SATCHEL are flung over the castle wall. HIGH SHOT - LOOKING DOWN AT CASTLE THE SKELETON PROJECTILE rockets up past camera, waving its boney arms. The burning satchel follows. BOOM! The skeleton is blown to bits in mid air. A CHEER goes up within the castle courtyard as Henry's Warriors crush the last of the Deadites.
