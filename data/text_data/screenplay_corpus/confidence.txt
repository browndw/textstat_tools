FADE IN: EXT. - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT (PRESENT) Dumpsters overflow with the day's garbage. A pillar of steam rises from an underground grate. It's the dark place between buildings that a reasonable person avoids. We see JAKE VIG, a guy in his late 20's whose fashionable suit and good looks are in obvious contrast to the surroundings-- At first glance, you'd think he could run for Congress some day. At first glance. Jake faces a garbage dumpster on his knees, execution style. His face gives away nothing-- He could be kneeling in a strawberry field.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
There's the LOUD UNMISTAKABLE "CLICK" of a gun being cocked. The barrel of a gun slides gently along Jake's ear and comes to rest at the base of his skull. The voice and the gun belong to BUTCH (40's). With his suit and conservative looks, you'd make him out for a "Steve" or "Roger" more than a "Butch".

CUT TO: EXT. - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT Title: Three Weeks Ago... The same alley... The door of a building bursts open as LIONEL DOLBY (late 40's), dressed in a cheap suit, stumbles out breathing heavy. The dim light of a bare bulb glares off the sweat on his forehead. A moment later, Jake emerges from the same door carrying a large black revolver.

Jake waves Lionel back through the door they came out of. CUT TO: INT. - THE EUCLID BAR A dive furnished with a few mismatched chairs and a bar. A single overweight PATRON sits at a corner table with face buried in his hands as he WHIMPERS. Jake and, Lionel Dolby pass him as they emerge from a back hallway. MILES, late 20's, wipes blood off the bar. Placed at the edge of the bar are two briefcases, both open, both filled with neat stacks of blood splattered money. A DEAD GUY lies face down on the floor in a pool of blood. Jake grabs the Dead Guy's legs as Lionel watches in disbelief.

EXT.- THE EUCLID/CITY SIDEWALK- NIGHT Lionel emerges up the stairs from the basement level bar to street-level just as a POLICE CAR SCREECHES to a halt in front of the bar, lights flashing, SIREN WAILING. On the door is the emblem for the NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT. Lionel does his best to look casual as TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS jump out of the car and rush the Euclid.

Jake starts taking the money out of the briefcases. Gordo strips out of the jacket and shirt, revealing a THIN WHITE VEST. A wire runs from a battery pack on his belt, up the center of the vest, ending at a scorched, bloody, explosive squib. Gordo drops the vest along with a plastic bag containing fake blood. A nasty bruise on his chest marks the spot where the squib was.

NEW AGE MUSIC is being played-- Could be Yanni. Sitting in a lounge chair, wearing a white terry cloth robe is THE KING PIN.

<KING_PIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take . You can' t just be fucking witty about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess it lacks a certain style.

<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me rephrase-- I won`t do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<KING_PIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me repeat-- Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you killed one of my crew.

	Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JAKE>

The King Pin stands up and moves over to Jake.
</DIRECTION>
<KING_PIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
	</DIALOGUE>

With surprising speed, the King Pin grabs Jake by the neck.

	I don't like to ask things more than once, Junior. I want you to know how much that irks me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The King begins to gently trace between Jake's fingers with the nail file. Jake remains rigid against Lupus and Harlin as the nail file scrapes along the soft, fleshy webbing between his fingers. Jake shuts his eyes... Then opens them to find the King now gently stroking his hands-- Almost a loving caress.
</DIRECTION>
<KING_PIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have incredibly soft hands. Good cuticles . They' re like a baby's hands. Grifters with rough hands... You know that they're probably not that good. Means they've had to do some hard labor to make ends meet. But you... Smooth... Supple.

<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?

	That's no problem. We have those in stock.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW' s, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.

	It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ASHBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Silicon Valley?
	</DIALOGUE>
<LILY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</LILY>
<ASHBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
	</DIALOGUE>

Lily arches an eyebrow at Ashby.

<LILY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.

They all break out into LAUGHTER.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo--
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!

<JAKE>

	They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.

<ASHBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big.Com. That Internet thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ASHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sort of like a letter of intent.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
