An empty causeway spans a bay somewhere along the south shore of Long Island. The sky is overcast. SHEILA, a woman in her late twenties, wearing a full length heliotrope pleather coat over a waitress outfit, kneels in the middle of the road. A souped-up Vespa motor scooter stands nearby.

Sheila holds a Bridal Barbie and Ken doll set. She sets them down on the road, pulls out a can of lighter fluid and soaks the dolls. She pulls out a bowling pin-shaped lighter and torches the nuptial tableau.

Theo pulls out his resin bag, powders up his hands, and goes for Sheila. Theo and Sheila get low and nasty on the tarmac. Sheila turns and does the freak to Theo, rubbing her rear end into his crotch. As Theo and Sheila dance over near John he makes a throat slitting gesture across his neck. Theo's hands leave white prints on Sheila's butt. The Swing-a-delic funks so hard it causes spontaneous audience dance riots and structural damage in theaters across the country.

Kastle pulls shish kebab chunks off a skewer. He looks down to see that one of the chunks is a melted Ken head. He throws it away in disgust.

<KASTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank.

	That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.

	No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman. His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.

Theo strides towards the couple. The man under the halo is Buzz. He raises the club at the approaching Theo, keeping the woman in front of him as a shield. The front of Buzz's cap reads "I'm No Angel."

	You're a nice guy, Maynard, but if you got two wives - I ain't into no polybigamy. Buzz is silent. He takes the club out of her hand. She steps away - startled - then turns and jogs away. Buzz throws down his club in a fury.

<BUZZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.

EXT. MILES 'O' LANES PARKING LOT - DAY

The sign has been changed to "SHEILA'S ALLEY." A sparkling new badass super-chromed Vespa is parked in the handicap zone. The Barbie and Ken dolls are wired to the headlamp. They look incredibly worse for the wear. A parking ticket is nestled between them. Theo's car pulls in nearby.

At the far end, we see Sheila, dressed in a fitted jogging suit, bowling alone on her lane. Bowlers stop and hold their balls at their sides. Sheila notices the whole alley is silent. Theo steps up to the lane, bowling ball bag in hand. As he straps on his wristbrace he peers down the lane and sees a seven-ten split; mule ears.

A loud ZIP and light spills in through three holes. Three fingers approach the holes, blocking out the light once more. With a POP, the fingers leave the holes and the ball hits the lane with a KLUNK.

The camera races towards the pins along the maple boards.

PINS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two pins loom in the foreground, one at each edge of the screen. The ball slams into the right hand pin in super slow motion with a ROAR. Theo's eyes slowly close. The pin lifts and hurtles slowly across the frame towards its unsuspecting fellow pin. Theo's eyes open. With a reverberating EXPLOSION, the pin is taken out.

Alfie, hands trembling, lays a tiny wreath on Buzz Fazeli's grave. The headstone reads, "Maynard 'Buzz' Fazeli 'I Never Met A Bowler I Didn't Like.'" A muffled watch beeper CHIMES "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head." The camera pulls up to show ten headstones laid out in a bowling pin set-up with Buzz's at the head.

Buzz's silhouette against an orange sunburst sky. He wears his halo hat. He takes a beautiful PGA-perfect slow motion fluid golf swing, connecting with a THWAP. As he follows through, divots of turf dance at his feet. MUSIC swells. He holds the afterswing pose and gazes after the ball, off into the distance.
