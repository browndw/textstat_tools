	I don't even know what that word means. I know I've never felt it, whatever it is in all those songs. And I know that today most marriages end in divorce. Like my parents.

	Well mine too but --

</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah, And I read in Newsweek, there were these scientists who found that by stimulating a part of the brain with electrodes you can make a person fall in "love" with a rock. Is that the love you're talking about?

<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nooo. I don't sing in public.

	Anyway, I'm not near drunk enough to sing in front of all these people.

</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok then. Let's drink.

</TOM>
<SUMMER>

	Bartender!

</SUMMER>
<DIRECTION>
TEN MINUTES LATER. Tom is up there singing The Clash's "Magnificent Seven." You wouldn't think so but Tom is a ROCK STAR up there! He's dancing like Jagger, he's got everyone in the bar singing along to the audience-participation parts. It's a sight to behold. Summer is all smiles watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

They share another laugh and then it gets quiet. In that good way.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MCKENZIE>
<DIRECTION>
Tom shuts the door on McKenzie as fast as he can. Now it's just Tom and Summer. Tom talks a mile a minute to try and erase McKenzie's last exchange from her mind.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry you had to see that. Happens every time we come here. It's unbelievable. Something about that guy and singing for people. I don't know. But at least he didn't --

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I like you. Of course I do.

<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. As a friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just as a friend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<DIRECTION>
The wheels are spinning in Tom's head. What's the right answer here?
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I mean... I haven't really thought about... Yes. Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. I just... You're interesting. I'd like us to be friends. Is that ok?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<DIRECTION>
Tom was clearly hoping for her to say something else. He hides his disappointment the best he can.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah totally. Friends. You and me. That's... perfect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>

</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	G'night Summer.

Tom watches her walk away for a beat before he turns to go the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(under his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Friends. Awesome. That's just great. Well done Hansen, you idiot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Tom walks a few more steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then, seemingly out of nowhere, without his even noticing, SUMMER HAS WRAPPED HER ARMS AROUND HIM AND PULLED HIM INTO A KISS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's unbelievable. There's a few seconds where Tom isn't sure if he's dreaming or not. But then he realizes, suddenly, out of the blue, his best case scenario really is actually happening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE UP: "YOU MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE" by Hall and Oates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT STREET - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the greatest morning of all time!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom struts down the street. He's pointing at people as he passes, winking, doing a little shuffle. He is the man. He checks out his reflection in a window. A YOUNG PAUL NEWMAN stares back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People wave as he passes, they clap, they give him thumbs up. A parade forms behind him. The POSTMAN, a POLICE OFFICER, the HOT DOG VENDOR, RONALD MCDONALD and MAYOR MCCHEESE, everybody loves Tom today. HALL and OATES themselves walk with Tom singing the song.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cars stop at crosswalks to let Tom go by. The DRIVERS also pump their fists in celebration of Tom's achievement last night. He walks on, the man. We notice the sidewalk lights up every time he touches the pavement like in "Billie Jean".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARTOON BIRDS fly onto Tom's shoulder. He smiles and winks at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT OFFICE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom passes Summer's office whistling Hall and Oates. She sees him and immediately lights up.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!

Vance pokes out of his corner office.
</DIRECTION>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Summer, I need -- Oh hello Hansen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Mr. Vance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Mr. Vance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<DIRECTION>
And they're all business. As Tom turns to go, however, Summer gives him a little coy smile that would be enough to make anyone's day complete. Tom gives her the international signal for `I'll call you later' in return. Vance sees none of it. Tom walks to his cubicle, still on top of the world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT TOM'S PLACE - THAT NIGHT

Tom answers the door. It's Paul (in hospital scrubs).

</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
He walks into the hallway, out of her sight. He looks into the hallway mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>

	Settle. Don't get too excited. She's just a girl. There's lots of them. Who look like that. And like what you like. They're everywhere. Calm yourself.

Tom passes Summer's desk. A new SECRETARY sits there. He notices, in the trash, a reprint of an avant garde surrealist painting of two dogs humping. He stops and retrieves it from the bin like it's some family heirloom. He gives the secretary a dirty look for tossing it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm. So, basically you do want to ask the question, `are we boyfriend/girlfriend?' You're just afraid you'll get an answer you don't want and that will shatter your illusions of how good everything's been these past few months. Is that about right?

	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<DIRECTION>
And it is. Tom's hand is on the gear shift. She puts hers there and locks it with his. Tom listens and Tom watches Summer listening. There's something about this moment, the way she sings along, the way her eyes close during certain notes, the way her smile rises and falls like she could cry at any minute from being overwhelmingly happy or just simply overwhelmed. Tom is powerless to stop his feelings for this girl.

</DOUCHE>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<DIRECTION>
Tom puts his hands in his pockets and watches this exchange go down. Not sure what else to do. At this point he's more amused than concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You live around here?

</DOUCHE>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah not too far.

</SUMMER>
<DOUCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha. That's funny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUCHE>
<DIRECTION>
Tom smiles to himself. This guy's a tool. Nothing to worry about.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, uh, let me buy you a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUCHE>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<DIRECTION>
As she answers Summer gives a quick glance over to Tom. The Guy notices. Up to this point he had not connected the two of them together.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you with this guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUCHE>

Tom realizes he has to sort of say something now.

	Sorry, no thank you.

Tom is pleased.

<DOUCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're serious? This guy?

And now he's pissed.

<TOM>

	Hey buddy --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Douche)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be rude. I'm flattered, I'm just not interested. Now why don't you go back over there and leave us alone, ok?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<DOUCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a free country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUCHE>
<DIRECTION>
Summer and Tom make eye contact again, as if to say "now what?" After a beat:
</DIRECTION>
<DOUCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you and him, huh? I can't believe that. Is this guy really your boyfriend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUCHE>
<DIRECTION>
And that question hangs in the air. Tom, panicked, decides to cut the silence. All the pent up uncertainty and confusion, coupled with the challenge to his manhood in front of the woman he loves, all manifests in one single, solid, almost automatic RIGHT CROSS TO THE GOOD LOOKING DOUCHEBAG'S FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Which connects spot on and sends the Douche reeling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both Douche and Tom wince at the pain (Douche's chin, Tom's fist).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a beat of calm where Tom is actually sorta surprised. And then the Douche spins around and starts PUMMELLING TOM.
</DIRECTION>

	Did you see that punch? I don't know where it came from. I haven't punched someone since Josh Greenberg in fifth grade. Guess I'm gonna have to throw out this shirt.

Summer starts walking ahead and Tom notices for the first time she's furious.
</DIRECTION>

<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, that guy was an asshole!
	</DIALOGUE>

	That's a pretty complex question. Philosophers, poets, scientists, everybody has a theory, don't they? I kinda like what Nietzsche said: "There is always some madness in love, but there is also...always some reason in madness." Think about it. Pretty smart.

There's that word again.

Summer, Tom, Sarah, Martin in a row. Summer's face is cold, emotionless. Tom tries to look at her, to make eye contact, something. She knows he's looking but it doesn't make her head turn his way. Tom gives up and watches the movie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE MOVIE SCREEN. We see a BLACK AND WHITE FILM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a MAN racing down the street, fleeing from an unseen assassin. When he turns around we see the man is TOM. Bullets fly and he's hit repeatedly in the back while running away like Belmondo in BREATHLESS. He dies an elaborate, violent, horrible on-screen death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT CLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rave music blares. Tom stands off to the side looking miserable. Summer is on the dance floor. Though she's not really dancing with anyone in particular, she's dancing with everyone. Finally she comes over, white shirt dripping with sweat and clearly a little high on one thing or another.

But when he doesn't turn around she just shakes it off and starts dancing again.

Tom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom sulks down the street. Though it's sunny and warm, Tom is a sad, broken man and the world is an awful place. There's still Hall and Oates following Tom, almost trying to cheer him up. He checks out his reflection in a window. Ron Howard's brother Clint looks back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom walks by a COUPLE making out on a bench. He grimaces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks by a sign that says "TODAY ONLY: FREE BEER." He doesn't even stop.

Cartoon Bird returns but Tom swats it away.

The WORLD'S MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN stops to ask him for directions. He doesn't even look up.

INT BOARDROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom sits next to McKenzie and across from Vance. He's in his usual boardroom position, which is to say, near comatose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A female CO-WORKER, 50s, stands at the front of the room in mid-presentation, showing slides that have something to do with a cat in various poses. First we see, "Cat Reaching Up for Out-of-Reach Milk Bowl."
</DIRECTION>
<CO_WORKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This one says "Go for it!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</CO_WORKER>
<DIRECTION>
She clicks to the next slide. "Cat Hanging From Tree Branch."
</DIRECTION>
<CO_WORKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This one says "Don't give up!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</CO_WORKER>
<DIRECTION>
Click. We see "Cat Considering a Giant Leap."
</DIRECTION>
<CO_WORKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this one says "You can do it!" We have a whole line of inspirational cards featuring Pickles, my cat. I think people will really enjoy them. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CO_WORKER>
<DIRECTION>
She takes her seat.
</DIRECTION>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good job Rhoda, I agree. Really inspirational stuff. Now, who's next. We haven't heard from "Sympathy" in a while. Hansen...

(reacting to his name)

<TOM>

	Uh...no. I really don't.

</TOM>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have nothing?

<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I wouldn't say nothing... Actually, that's about right.

</TOM>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...k. We'll come back to you. McKenzie --

	You know what...?

</TOM>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes Tom.

</VANCE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I say something about the cat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well sure. Go ahead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This here is, and Rhoda, you know I mean no disrespect... but this... this is total shit.

<MCKENZIE>

<TOM>

	"Don't give up?" "You can do it?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
He points to the screen, still showing the "Cat About to Leap" image.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't inspirational. It's suicidal. He tries that jump, I'm writing a sympathy card for that cat. That's the last thing I want to be doing with my life. It's bad enough writing these things for people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hansen, this is a place of business. We don't cut down our co- workers --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's cause we're liars! It's what we do here. Why don't we level with people? Stop feeding them nonsense?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<CO_WORKER>
<DIRECTION>
(RHODA)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're a greeting card company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CO_WORKER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes but think about it! Why do people buy these things? Not to say how they feel. There's paper and pens for that. People give these cards when they can't say how they feel. Or they're afraid to. And we provide the service that lets `em get away with that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Tom is getting excited. The rest of the room is growing uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I say to hell with it! Let's level with America. Or at least make them speak for themselves! I mean, seriously, what's this...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(picks a card off the TABLE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I'm sorry to hear your grandmother has passed." What the hell? Let's give em some truth. Something like, "Sorry to hear about your grandmother. Here's a card so I get some credit in your time of need. I'm sure it makes up for the fact that grandma's dead."
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Vance and the card-writing team are appalled.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(picks up another card)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Congratulations on your new baby." Eh... How bout... "Congratulations on your new baby... Guess that's it for hanging out. Nice knowing ya, buddy."
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hansen, sit down!

</VANCE>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(picks up a card)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, what's this? Ooh... fancy! Look at this one with all the hearts. Let's open it up. "Happy Valentine's Day, Sweetheart. I love you." Oh that's nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<MCKENZIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tom...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCKENZIE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If someone gave me this card, Mr. Vance... I would eat it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<MCKENZIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tom!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCKENZIE>
<DIRECTION>
Tom recognizes he's losing his shit. He takes a seat on the boardroom table.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's these greeting cards, Sir, these cards, these movies, these pop songs. They're responsible for all the lies, the heartache, everything! We're responsible!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone shifts in their seats.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we do a bad thing here. People should be able to say how they feel, how they really feel, without some strangers putting words in their mouths. The truth. A card is a nice thought but it shouldn't do the dirty work for you. You love someone, tell them yourself, in your own words. Maybe it's not love at all. Maybe there's no such thing as love. Maybe it's... "galoogoo."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah I made it up, so what?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Tom gets up and walks to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all crap. We make and peddle crap. And sometimes people believe in this crap. I just can't do it anymore, Mr. Vance. There's enough bullshit in the world without my help. I quit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
And with that he gets up and walks off. The room is pretty stunned. Someone coughs. McKenzie tries to start a clap. It doesn't really take.

<PAUL>

	It's insane.

	No.

</PAUL>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>

ANGLE ON Tom walking away from them.

<DIRECTION>
Literally, his entire universe falls apart.

FX: BUILDINGS come crumbling down. The whole city turns to rubble. He's the only constant as the world around him is ERASED, brick by brick, beam by beam, as if by an unseen force and reduced to nothing.

The right girl I guess.

There's girls everywhere. I bet you have to beat em off with a stick.

Oh you'd be surprised.

EXT PARK - DAY

Tom and Summer are having a picnic. If it looks familiar, it's cause we saw them here on page 7. This is that fateful day Tom described to his sister and his friends. The day it all, finally, fell apart.

Not much more to say. Stay with them for a few extra beats of silence.

<DIRECTION>
EXT OUTDOOR MARKET - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom and Summer shopping at the fruit market. Unless we were looking for trouble we wouldn't see any. But since we are, we might notice she lags behind him as they walk through the aisles. His hands are in his pockets. He's bored. She's distant. But only if we're really looking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom, almost with a full beard, is redecorating his apartment again. We see him rearranging the furniture in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER. He hangs some new pictures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER. He uses a pencil on the wall to mark for a bookshelf. Then he uses a ruler to make sure his marks are even. He draws a faint line on the wall to mark where he needs to nail something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT COFFEE HOUSE - LATER
</DIRECTION>

That day again. As we've seen before, Tom reads a newspaper. Summer reads a novel.

INT MOVIE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom and Summer watching the film. Tears begin to well in Summer's eyes. They soon turn to audible sobs. Tom turns to look at her, to offer some sort of comfort, believing it to be a response to the movie. She doesn't look back.

Tom drawing a straight line on his wall. Redecorating.

He looks at the line he's drawn. He extends it a little bit. He draws another. He begins to furiously draw on the wall. From out of nowhere, inspiration has hit. An image starts to form. A pretty impressive looking futuristic skyscraper, almost shaped like a tear drop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT MOVIE THEATRE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Same day from the past. They walk out, at first everything's alright. It's exactly as we saw on page 7. But soon after that she begins to cry again. Serious, real sobbing.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to hug her. He hugs her. It's unclear if she hugs back.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Sum, it's just a movie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I'm sorry Tom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is everything alright with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, tries to pull herself together.
</DIRECTION>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I'm just...I'm sorry. I'm being ridiculous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's ok. This happens to me every time I watch "Hoosiers." Let's go for a walk, ok. Let's get some air. Or go to Sister Ray's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<DIRECTION>
They walk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT RECORD STORE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom and a much more in control Summer walk down the aisles. He grabs one.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It pains me that we live in a world where no one's ever heard of Spearmint.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never heard of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it's painful. Oh look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs a Ringo Starr album and shows it to her, just as we've seen on Page 7. She smiles and they continue on down the aisles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In CU, Tom goes to hold Summer's hand. But something happens. It could be a total coincidence, but just as his hand approaches hers (in SLO-MO), she moves it away and keeps it at her side. Tom puts his hands in his pockets, unsure if there's something to read in that.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT HARBOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom sketches intensely. The landscape, the skyline, the works. He's in the zone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT RECORD STORE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again, that fateful day continues. Tom and Summer outside.
</DIRECTION>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... Now what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now...I think I'm gonna call it a day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? You wanna maybe...get some dinner or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got pasta at home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you hungry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm pretty hungry, but --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got a great idea!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get breakfast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pancakes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Summer's resistance is futile. And the rest as they say is history.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE UP: "Number Two" by the Pernice Brothers. Which plays OVER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(417-464) INT TOM'S BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom shaves. Makes himself look presentable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER. Tom, now clean shaven and looking like he did when we first met him, sketches on his bed with one hand while holding a phone with the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT CITY SIDEWALK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom sits on a street corner drawing new additions to the city's skyline.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT LIBRARY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom sits with his feet up on a table, headphones on his ears, reading one of many Taschen books on innovative building design.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT OFFICE LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom drops off his portfolio with the security guard in the lobby of a high-rise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT SOCCER FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom and his mom and step-dad cheer on his sister playing soccer. It's a nice temporary distraction for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom getting bad news on the phone. He has a list written on his wall (which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of futuristic looking structures). He crosses "Abrams and Abrams" off the list. We notice several others are also crossed off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom has his car on the side of the road and is out measuring the distance between the beams of the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT PARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom jogs. A little faster this time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT TOM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom getting more bad news from the answering machine, crossing off yet another firm from the list. Few remain. He sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped. For a beat, lost in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, as if to shut those thoughts out, whatever they were, he turns on the TV and joylessly watches the nothingness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPLITSCREEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the LEFT, Tom, alone, on a bus. Looking out the window. Thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the RIGHT, Summer. In her wedding dress. The veil is lifted. And she's a bride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT OFFICE BUILDING - ANOTHER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom, in a suit, exits a building after another dismal interview. We can see he is frustrated but not deterred. In the distance, his favorite spot in the city, where he took Summer ages ago.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom walks over and sits down on a bench. He stares off, lost in thought. And then, from out of nowhere, there's her voice.
</DIRECTION>
<SUMMER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<DIRECTION>
Summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench. She may have just sat down, she may have been there for hours. Tom isn't sure if she's real. He doesn't quite know what to do.
</DIRECTION>
<SUMMER>
<DIRECTION>
(re: suit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where you coming from?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Oh. Nowhere. How long have you been sitting there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Awhile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<DIRECTION>
Tom finds it hard to look at her.
</DIRECTION>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I come here a lot. I always loved this place, ever since you brought me here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<DIRECTION>
The mention of their past makes the atmosphere frosty.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... I should probably say congratulations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably. But only if you mean it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if I do honestly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah well...anyway...I hope you're happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
They both laugh a little. The tension begins to dissipate.
</DIRECTION>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you, Tom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm good. Ish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah I quit the office.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? That's great! What are you doing now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mostly...sleeping. Breaking things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Awkward silence.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So who's the guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who, my guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... Wait. Don't tell me. I don't want to know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tom...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No really, I don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<DIRECTION>
More awkward silence. This one goes on a beat longer. And THEN:
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's amazing to me. You're married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not only someone's girlfriend, your someone's wife!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty crazy, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(SIGHS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll never understand that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tom --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's different now? How could things change so quickly?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. It just happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?! That's what I don't get.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... Tom...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, tell me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I woke up one day and I knew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<DIRECTION>
Tom says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew I could promise him I'd feel the same way every morning. In a way that I... I never could with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<DIRECTION>
And there's not much else to say after that.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom gets up to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what sucks? Realizing that everything you believe in is complete bullshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Destiny, soulmates, true love. All that stuff. It's nothing more than silly childhood fairy tale nonsense, isn't it? God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tom, don't go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should have listened to you, Summer. You were right all along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Summer takes a beat to let this hang there.
</DIRECTION>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<DIRECTION>
And then, out of nowhere, she begins to hysterically laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? This is funny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Tries to stop but it only makes it worse. Now's she's completely cracking up.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you laughing at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
And she can't stop. She's totally lost control.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(trying himself not to LAUGH)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a crazy person!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tom! You're the crazy person!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One day I'm reading a book at the corner deli and this guy sits down and starts asking about it. Now he's my husband!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is funny to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would have happened if I went to the movies instead? If I went somewhere else for lunch? If I showed up to eat ten minutes later? Tom, it was meant to be, just like you said. And as it was happening, I knew it. I could feel it, sure as the sun. And I kept thinking to myself "Holy shit. Tom was right." You were right about all of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It just wasn't me you were right about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<DIRECTION>
Tom is speechless. Summer takes his hand. We may notice her wedding ring. We may also notice that this is the same exact shot as the first scene of the screenplay. We hold it for a few seconds more. And then, the hands separate.
</DIRECTION>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, I should probably be getting back. It was good to see you. I'm glad you're well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<DIRECTION>
Summer gets up and starts walking away from him. After a SECOND:
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Summer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
She stops and turns back. He takes in her face, most likely for the last time ever.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really do hope you're happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<SUMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMER>
<DIRECTION>
And she walks away. The CAMERA TRACKS AWAY with her, leaving Tom alone in the park, getting smaller and farther away every second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FEW SECONDS OF BLACK, BEFORE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT OFFICE WAITING AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom, in a suit, with a hefty batch of architecture sketches at his side, waits in the foyer of Allen, Prince, and Gethers Architecture. From the room we can tell this firm is big time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We notice, before he does, a VERY CUTE GIRL sitting in a another chair, also waiting. She smiles. He smiles back.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you here to interview?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry?

</TOM>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would appear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, this is a little awkward.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I hope you don't get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you don't get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They both laugh. There's a silence for a few beats. And it's during this time that something weird comes over Tom and we can visibly see it in his face. He likes the look of this girl. This girl is cute. He'd like to talk more with her. And, honestly, he's a little surprised by it.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, uh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<GIRL>

	Do you go to St. Patrick's? Not to pray or anything but to stand outside?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do! I love that church. It's like my favorite structure in the city.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<GIRL>

	If only it wasn't near that horrible mirrored thing...

He starts to go. But halfway through the doorway, he pauses and looks back at the girl.
</DIRECTION>
<NARRATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If Tom had learned anything... it was that you can't ascribe great cosmic significance to a simple earthly event. Coincidence. That's all anything ever is. Nothing more than coincidence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NARRATOR>
<DIRECTION>
ANIMATION. 1 second clip of the colored sequence. Real fast. Hardly noticeable. But it's there.
</DIRECTION>
<NARRATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It took a long time but Tom had finally learned. There are no miracles. There's no such thing as fate. Nothing is meant to be. He knew. He was sure of it now.

</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok.

Tom turns back around.
