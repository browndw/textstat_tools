EXT. GASCONY - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dawn. A verdant field in Gascony. BIRDS CALL from tree- tops. The WIND RUSTLES through green leaves. A fox darts into a thick hedge. And last, anti-pastoral, out of place -- the sound of CLASHING STEEL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSE: France, 1625. Suddenly, two young men burst INTO VIEW, sword points cutting brilliant arcs through the morning air. The first is GIRARD, bearded, nearly thirty, a man in every facet. The second, D'ARTAGNAN. Younger in appearance and attitude. Exuberant, handsome. And at just this moment, bounding over a low stone wall with a boisterous cry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They battle across an expanse of turf thick with dew. Girard is the more polished combatant. But d'Artagnan is nearly a force of nature. He whips his sword through the air with wild-hearted abandon. He tumbles and somer- saults. This is fun. Girard and d'Artagnan cross the field, pass over a wooden fence, struggle toward a stable and hayloft. As they fight, both men utilize a variety of props. Handfuls of hay, a wooden spar, quick kicks from heavy boots. Anything goes as the swords cut through the air. D'Artagnan, gaining increasing advantage, forces Girard up against a peaceful country manor. Girard, seemingly cornered, executes a gymnastic flip onto the roof, fights from this high angle. D'Artagnan merely smiles... and follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON ROOFTOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seen briefly in silhouette against the rising sun, Girard and d'Artagnan scramble up the v-shaped rooftop, pause to exchange swipes at the peak, then slide down the other side, attacking, defending, as they go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INCLUDE INTERIOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the manor house, a HANDSOME WOMAN of forty glances up from her writing table, hears FOOTSTEPS on the roof. She reacts -- curious, not afraid -- and steps to an open window. As if to follow the footsteps to the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE Girard leaps to the ground first -- landing in an en- closure filled with SQUAWKING GEESE. D'Artagnan flies after. The geese scatter, d'Artagnan -- whose wild progress frequently resembles that of a young colt -- stumbles briefly. Girard seeks advantage, thrusts his sword toward the young man's heart. But d'Artagnan parries the blow with a heavy gloved hand, rolls over the offending goose -- glances deadpan apology -- and rises to fight again. The epic battle continues. Girard's modest success de- volves into desperate flight. D'Artagnan's seemingly endless reserves are wearing him down. Then, at the last possible moment, Girard spies escape: a slow- moving HAYCART RUIMBLING up the country road. He runs toward the cart, leaps upon it, turns back to d'Artagnan with a confident smirk -- an expression that vanishes when the young Gascon executes a nearly impossible leap to join him. And still they battle, the clash of swords a kind of music by now, the men, their exuberance, the bright morn- ing all combined into a dazzlingly heroic display. Just then: The haycart crosses a wooden plank bridge. Girard backs from d'Artagnan's sword, weak from exhaustion, he stumbles. D'Artagnan has his man and he knows it. He prepares one last blow -- -- And the haycart shifts, deposits both men over the side and down to the small muddy creek below. A comical antidote to all this glorious swordplay.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INCLUDE CREEK Girard lands flat on his back, stunned, his sword out of reach. D'Artagnan lands similarly, but recovers with grace, or rather, as much grace as the muddy situation will allow. He rolls toward Girard, sword in hand, and lightly places the sharp gleaming tip against his adam's apple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat. Then a surprise. Girard begins to laugh, long and loud. D'Artagnan responds with a charmed smile.

EMBLEM OF KING'S MUSKETEERS It FILLS the SCREEN, serves as background for the MAIN TITLES. As the FINAL CREDIT APPEARS, and the MUSIC ENDS, the blade of a sword ENTERS FRAME.

Just then: A window on the second floor bursts open, and a big Musketeer dangles a struggling Guard by his feet, threatening to drop him into the street.

A group of the Cardinal's Guards is seated around a big table littered with flagons and bottles. On the floor around them are their swords and rifles. It appears the Gruards are celebrating a victory. But wait. There's something wrong with this picture. On closer inspection, we see that the Guards have been stripped to their under- clothes and tied to their chairs with ropes. They are all bruised and bloody. Some are unconscious.

EXT. HIGH ROAD TO PARIS - DAY D'Artagnan, on horseback, pauses on a bluff overlook- ing the magnificent city on the Seine. What he beholds is Paris as it looked in the early part of the Seven- teenth Century, its steeples and towers rising to meet the sky. For a country boy like d'Artagnan, Paris is a magical place where the wildest of dreams can come true. D'Artagnan's reverie is broken by the sound of THUNDERING HOOFBEATS coming from behind. He turns in response and what he sees is this: Two women on horseback are riding for all they're worth pursued by two men on horseback.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D'ARTAGNAN
</DIRECTION>

His heroic blood stirs. Women in danger! As the women GALLOP past, d'Artagnan leaps from his horse. Quickly formulating a plan, he clambers up the trunk of a nearby tree and climbs out on a branch that overhangs the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE As the two riders pass underneath, d'Artagnan leaps into space and tackles one of them, knocking him out of the saddle. The rider hits the ground and is knocked sense- less. One down. D'Artagnan scrambles to his feet as the second rider re- verses direction and GALLOPS back, charging d'Artagnan. The rider draws his saber. D'Artagnan dodges the horse and the sword. He catches the second rider's arm and yanks him right out of the saddle. The man lands with a painful thud at d'Artagnan's feet. Before he can recover, d'Artagnan is upon him with flying fists. One swift punch -- and the second rider is senseless. Two down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D'Artagnan stands over his two victims, out of breath, but greatly pleased with his performance. He looks up as the two women ride back to see what's happened. The first woman is of noble breeding, a beautiful dark- haired girl in her late teens. Her name is ANNE. Her companion is roughly the same age, titan-haired and equally beautiful. Her name is CONSTANCE. Anne regards the two men on the ground, then d'Artagnan. She shakes her head, laughs with delight and rides off. Constance remains.

INT. MUSKETEER HEADQUARTERS - DAY Athos, Aramis, and Porthos sweep into the now deserted courtyard. Silence -- the last thing they expected -- stops them in their tracks.

Porthos reaches inside his cloak and takes out a crumpled red tunic he took from one of the Cardinal's guards. He drops it on the ground, digs into a pocket and takes out another. He finds another in his boot and another up his sleeve. There's one in his hat. Like a magician, he keeps pulling red tunics out of the most bizarre places.

Athos and Aramis have a few guard tunics themselves. They pull them out and drop them into the growing pile.

Richelieu turns to the great map, speaks gently.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHELIEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're homesick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHELIEU>
<ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(after a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lonely. Is that the same thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<RICHELIEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHELIEU>
<DIRECTION>
Richelieu brings his eyes back to Anne, continues:
</DIRECTION>
<RICHELIEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Austria's loss is France's gain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHELIEU>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure my new husband shares your opinion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<RICHELIEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nonsense. He's young, not blind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHELIEU>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mostly, he is absent. I've barely seen His Majesty since our wedding, and that was three months ago. Whenever he's around me, he has nothing to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<RICHELIEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arranged marriages can be difficult. Your father and I thought yours would bring Austria and France closer together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHELIEU>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Countries align more swiftly than people, I'm afraid. Louis and I remain... far apart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<RICHELIEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I advise you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHELIEU>
<DIRECTION>
He says it with seeming humility, not condescension. Anne nods assent.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHELIEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Louis was only nine years old when his father was assassinated. He lost his childhood forever that day. I have watched him grow toward manhood, seen the toll his life demands. A boy who is not allowed to be a boy sometimes has difficulty becoming a man. He is shy, yet boastful. Giving, yet stubborn. But most of all, he is not yet sure exactly who he is. The boy who lost his father. Or the King of France.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHELIEU>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But how can I...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<RICHELIEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flatter him. Make the boy feel like a King. So that the King may be your husband.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHELIEU>
<DIRECTION>
Anne considers his eloquent advice, formulates a reply... when the huge doors to the throne room open with a dull boom, the Seneschal chants:
</DIRECTION>
<SENESCHAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His Majesty, the King.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENESCHAL>
<DIRECTION>
The Seneschal steps aside as LOUIS XIII enters. He is surprisingly young, no older than d'Artagnan. His face is handsome and intelligent.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHELIEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Majesty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHELIEU>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cardinal Richelieu, I've been looking for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
As Louis strides toward them, Richelieu and Anne bow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Louis sees Anne, he reacts with an almost imper- ceptible start. Her presence catches him off guard.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Anne. Hello. I didn't know you were here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Louis hides his nervousness, not to mention his love, behind a formal veneer. Anne, emboldened by Richelieu's confidences, replies:
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like me to go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Louis suddenly remembers the reason he's here. Determin- ation breeds a more capable attitude.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Please, stay.

<RICHELIEU>
<DIRECTION>
(hiding his amusement)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps if I knew the question...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHELIEU>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've just been told that you went ahead and disbanded my Musketeers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<RICHELIEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You approved the decision.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHELIEU>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But not the timing of the matter. I intended to address them myself, explain the situation...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<RICHELIEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Majesty, France is on the brink of war. We dare not hesitate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHELIEU>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But these men are my personal guards...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<RICHELIEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are the bravest fighters in France. We'll need them in the field if we're to win this war with England. Buckingham plans to invade La Rochelle within the month. I thought it best to act quickly --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHELIEU>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will be the judge of what is best. For me, and for France.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
He says it with newfound resolve. Richelieu receives the rebuke with quiet grace. Anne watches the latter closely, suppresses a smile. The boy is nearer to King than Richelieu imagined.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHELIEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. Forgive me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHELIEU>
<DIRECTION>
A tense beat. Anne, feeling out of place, steps toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anne? Are you all right?

</LOUIS>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You two should continue this discussion in private.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Your thoughts on the matter interest me. They might... help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It seems to me that... you're doing very well on your own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
She means it. Anne smiles, exits. A beat. Louis sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's beautiful.

<RICHELIEU>
	<DIALOGUE>

</LOUIS>
<RICHELIEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I advise you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHELIEU>
<DIRECTION>
Repetition reveals calculation. Louis nods. And the Cardinal surprises with quiet humor:
</DIRECTION>
<RICHELIEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She scares me too. As do all women who join beauty to intelligence. What's a man to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHELIEU>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(enjoying the Cardinal's humor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<RICHELIEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The course of love is full of frightful turns. But, no matter how you feel, no matter how hopelessly afraid... never let her know that you are anything other than the bravest and most confident man in France. Make that your starting point, and everything else will fall... into place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHELIEU>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bravest man in France...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<RICHELIEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good advice for a shopkeeper. Let alone a King.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHELIEU>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Richelieu acting as the lost father. And Louis appreciating it, speaking as a son:
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Eminence, I'm sorry that I was sharp with you. It's just that the Musketeers... well, they're not just my guards. They're my friends too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<RICHELIEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. But don't worry. From now on, I'll take complete responsibility for your welfare.

Indeed he will.

Richelieu bursts out of the Throne Room and is joined by Rochefort. Walking quickly down a long hallway.

<ROCHEFORT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a foolish boy. And barely that.

<RICHELIEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That foolish boy is about to become a man.

	Which is all the more reason for us to act... quickly.

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of the way, idiot!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COACH_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
A speeding carriage bears down on him. D'Artagnan leaps from its path, stumbles. He looks up in time to see the passenger inside, and for a moment, time seems to stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is a noblewoman of remarkable beauty, her face framed by the carriage window. Long blonde curly hair that cascades in ringlets to her shoulders, languid blue eyes, and skin as white as alabaster. She is known as MILADY DE WINTER. She is to sex, what Constance is to innocence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D'Artagnan watches as if in a dream. The carriage, the beautiful woman inside it. Paris wraps its arms around the young man's heart. Suddenly: a second face enters the carriage window, replacing hers, jarring by contrast. It is the fierce visage of Milady's Indo-Chinese Bodyguard, PARKER. The bodyguard glares, pulls at the carriage window curtains, taking Milady, the dream, from view. HOLD ON d'Artagnan, bewitched, as the CARRIAGE RUMBLES off into the city.

EXT. STREETS OF PARIS - SEINE - POV SHOT - DAY A beautiful house situated near the Seine. Milady's carriage stops before it. She steps to the street, Parker follows. After a brief spoken exchange, the body- guard departs on some errand. HENRI, the driver, a brutal- looking fellow, incongruous in his elegant coachman's uniform, snaps the reins, and guides the carriage away. Milady steps inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - POV REVEALS this to have been the POV of two men standing in the shadows across the street. COUNT DE WINTER, forty- five, a kind face etched with sadness, and ARMAND DE WINTER, twenty-five, his son. They are well-dressed. But their manner and appearance suggests that they have traveled a long distance to find her.
</DIRECTION>
<COUNT_DE_WINTER>

INT. MILADY'S HOUSE - DAY Milady stands before a mirror, reaches for one of the many ivory combs that adorn her hair. As she places the comb we notice a small flower-like tattoo on her arm. She pauses to admire her beauty, then to see the image of Count de Winter, now standing behind her, his eyes dark and cold. Milady does not move from the reflecting glass, she smiles.

<COUNT_DE_WINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring you back. To pay for what you did to my son.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will kill you with my bare hands.

<DIRECTION>
The Count steps closer, close enough to touch. Milady, eyes bright with excitement, the smile still playing about her lips, replies:
</DIRECTION>
<MILADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well if that's the case, I'd better start packing. But first, my hair...

INT. MILADY'S HOUSE - DAY Armand climbs a flight of stairs. Still no sign of his father, or Milady. He calls out:
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
Worry makes him hurry. Armand takes hasty steps into Milady's bedroom. The first thing he sees is his own face in the mirror. The second is his father's inert body below it. Armand gasps, races to his side. A thin trail of bright blood is seen briefly at the older man's ear. Armand gathers his father up into his arms, and begins to weep.

EXT. CARMES-DESCHAUX MONASTERY - DAY The monastery is a windowless building bordered by a barren field, a dueling ground for men who have little time to waste. Athos sits on a stone bench, waits for his adversary to arrive. His horse is hobbled nearby. D'Artagnan rides INTO VIEW, dismounts.

Athos appreciates the young man's retort, takes a closer look. Then he rises to his feet, the pain in his arm makes him wince.

	I asked two of my friends to act as seconds, but they are not as punctual.

Porthos and Aramis arrive on horseback. They dismount, view d'Artagnan with amazement. D'Artagnan reacts with similar surprise, smiles sheepishly.

Athos gestures for Aramis and Porthos to stand aside. He draws his saber, ready to fight. A beat. And in that moment, d'Artagnan's face reveals an emotion he has never felt before in his young life. Fear. Athos sees it, allows him a moment to withdraw his saber. D'Artagnan does so, they square off, touch sabers, and...

	I may not wear the uniform, but I believe I have the heart of a Musketeer.

<PORTHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It couldn't be.

Athos knows that it is. He steps forward, extends a hand. The others follow, shake as well. Athos intro- duces each in turn.

Meanwhile, Jussac and his Guards look on with increasing impatience. He clears his throat, draws his saber. The Musketeers turn toward the Guards, d'Artagnan standing among them.

<DIRECTION>
D'Artagnan and the Musketeers draw their swords... and charge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIGHT Suddenly: nine men are locked in mortal combat. Athos takes a Guard named Cahusac, Porthos battles BISCARAT, and Aramis battles with two adversaries at once. D'Artagnan looks for an opponent... and finds himself face to face with Jussac. The fighting style of the Musketeers is an exuberant mix- ture of styles and techniques. Athos is a brutal swords- man, his strokes overpowering and savage. His repertoire also includes swift kicks, solid punches, the occasional elbow when necessary. Aramis is a seamless and graceful technician, he handles his two opponents with balletic ease, an artist working with steel and flesh, rather than paint and canvas. And last, and perhaps the most entertaining of all, Porthos. He is a walking arsenal, carrying a variety of bizarre weapons on his body -- a crossbow, daggers, bolo, nunchucks -- all of which he uses with the polished skill of a master. Add this funhouse of armaments to his already impressive size and strength, and you have a one- man wrecking crew of epic proportions. D'Artagnan's youthful energy is by now familiar. He bounds about like a newborn tiger, encircles his adver- sary, changing stance and shifting his ground with alac- rity. Jussac is having a hard time defending himself against his opponent who seems to be attacking from all directions at once.

MONASTERY

A monk watches from the bell tower, incensed by the battle raging on the field below. He grabs the BELL rope, gives it a mighty pull... and sounds a clamorous ALARM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE Porthos reacts to the interruption with irritation. He produces a pair of nunchucks. Biscarat looks at the odd weapon with professional curiosity, slight confusion... and Porthos whacks him on the side of the head, knocks him to the ground.

And Porthos returns to his original foe. Meanwhile, Athos' heavy strokes take their toll. Cahusac staggers, wounded in arm, shoulder, grazed at the head -- and falls to the ground with a thud. Aramis calls out to him, indicates d'Artagnan:
</DIRECTION>
<ARAMIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a look at our young friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARAMIS>
<ATHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean he's still alive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHOS>
<DIRECTION>
Not only is d'Artagnan alive, but he's making a fool out of Jussac. Frustrated, enraged, Jussac makes a full lunge at him, but d'Artagnan ducks, then slips under Jussac's sword like a snake and runs him through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jussac falls to the ground, lies still. He is dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Athos and Aramis react, impressed. Then turn their full attention on weakening foes. They disarm and disable them with swift strokes. Meanwhile, Porthos chases Biscarat into a grove of trees. The Guard has discovered the better part of valor, now runs for his life. Porthos -- who is at play as much as he is war -- takes a Spanish bolo from his cloak, and whips the balls over his head. Biscarat hears the odd WHIZZING sound, turns to face him. The color drains from his face.
</DIRECTION>
<BISCARAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BISCARAT>

Porthos lets the bolo fly -- it catches Biscarat about the neck, the balls slam into his head. The Guard drops to the ground without a sound.

Porthos deadpans, then grins acceptance. All for one, and one for all. D'Artagnan beams.

	Because I do not want you to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHOS>
<DIRECTION>
It's hard to say whether he's acting out of concern for the boy... or he simply doesn't give a damn. Whatever the case, d'Artagnan is crestfallen. The Musketeers mount their horses, Porthos and Aramis adopt a friendlier tone.
</DIRECTION>
<ARAMIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know Athos may seem cold and unfriendly, but don't let that fool you.

	Wake up, boy. The Musketeers are just a dream.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHOS>
<DIRECTION>
Athos spurs his horse, rides away. Aramis and Porthos follow. HOLD ON d'Artagnan as he watches the Musketeers grow small in the distance. Then, sadly, he steps to his horse, climbs into the saddle. It has been both the best and the worst day of his young life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That's when a group of horsemen come riding around the corner of the monastery -- five Cardinal's Guards led by Rochefort himself. They see their wounded comrades, Jussac dead, and the three Musketeers escaping in the distance.

And like two jousting knights, d'Artagnan and Rochefort meet in the middle of the field. Their BLADES connect with a resounding CLASH, d'Artagnan is knocked clear of his saddle. He hits the ground with a painful thud. Rochefort's Guards leap towards him.

The walls and towers of France's most infamous prison rise to meet a starless sky. The portcullis is raised by men-at-arms, admitting a spectacular crimson carriage pulled by a team of snow-white stallions. The emblem of the Cardinal of France is emblazoned on the carriage door, and THROUGH its WINDOW we see the profile of Richelieu.

<DIRECTION>
A chamber in hell. Spiders the size of rats, rats the size of small dogs. A foul stench in the air. D'Artagnan is sprawled in a corner, unconscious, on a filthy matted floor. The sharp tip of a sword pokes him in the chest. D'Artagnan wakes with a start, springs back into action. As if he was still battling Jussac at the Carmes-Deschaux. He slaps the sword away, leaps to his feet, and reaches for his own. But it is gone.

	Soon enough.

A long beat. D'Artagnan eyes the gleaming saber, forged in the Crusades. He nods, gestures for Rochefort to come closer. As if to impart a secret. Rochefort tilts downward, d'Artagnan rises up... and whispers.
</DIRECTION>
<D_ARTAGNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me my father's sword, and I'll cut out your heart.
	</DIALOGUE>

Bold words, bad timing. Rochefort snarls, slams the hilt of the sword into d'Artagnan's head. The youth slumps from the wooden stool to the floor, unconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCHEFORT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fool. Like your father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCHEFORT>
<DIRECTION>
Rochefort storms from the cell. He nods at a grizzled jailer on his way out, indicates the chains and manacles on the cell wall. The jailer scurries over to d'Artagnan, inert in a shallow puddle of foul water. He lifts, drags him toward the chains -- but d'Artagnan's eyes pop open, the jailer reacts with surprise, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: INT. BASTILLE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT The jailer exits from d'Artagnan's cell, closes the heavy door behind him. A CLOSER look reveals d'Artagnan in the jailer's soiled tunic, eyes bright with adventure. He looks left and right -- dank corridors, darkness, the OCCASIONAL GROAN. And steps lightly into the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON D'ARTAGNAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He seeks exit, finds only a labyrinth. Two jailers con- verse, step towards him. D'Artagnan leaps into a cell doorway, allows them to pass. Suddenly: scabrous hands reach from inside the cell, grab d'Artagnan by the throat. He shudders, leaps free. And continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D'Artagnan steps deeper in the labyrinth. Frustrated, no way out. Just then: more FOOTSTEPS heading toward him. D'Artagnan seeks refuge, watches as a cloaked figure steps INTO VIEW, accompanied by a retinue of sullen jailers. D'Artagnan thinks fast... and joins them.

INT. BASTILLE - NIGHT D'Artagnan keeps step with the cloaked figure, the ret- inue. He keeps his head down, glances at the corridor ahead, looking for a way out. But the cloaked figure is escorted up a long stairway, into another hall, and toward a pristine wooden door. D'Artagnan watches as the door opens, revealing... Cardinal Richelieu, a fear- some apparition in red, the most powerful man in France.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D'Artagnan's jaw drops. The cloaked figure steps inside. The jailers disperse. D'Artagnan takes steps as if to join them... then turns back, eyes the door, the Cardinal and the cloaked figure now behind it.

Rochefort steps into the room, grabs d'Artagnan roughly by the arm, hurls him from the chair to the floor. This time Richelieu does not utter protest. Instead, he turns to the Captain, commands:

EXT. BASTILLE - MARKET SQUARE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELLS TOLL. A motley crowd gathers around the execution scaffold, held back by men-at-arms. A hooded executioner mounts the steps of the scaffold in the company of a PRIEST. The Priest wears a black cassock and a broad black sombrero. The executioner, a large man, raises his axe and touches the end of the blade, cutting his finger. Razor-sharp. The executioner holds up his bloody thumb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd roars approval. And turns to regard the day's victim as he is rolled INTO VIEW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D'Artagnan stands, half-naked, his hands bound behind him, in a horse-drawn cart. The driver turns the cart, begins a circuit of the square. The blood-thirsty crowd cheers and jeers at d'Artagnan. But d'Artagnan keeps his head high. If he must die, he will die with dignity.

ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cardinal's familiar carriage is parked a safe distance from the square. The Guards who attend it have wandered off to watch the festivities. The coachman remains, seated on top, braiding his whip. Suddenly, a gloved hand grabs the coachman, yanks him from his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCAFFOLD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D'Artagnan is led by the Captain of the Guards up the stairs to the execution platform. The executioner and the Priest wait patiently above. D'Artagnan sees the bloodstained block where his neck will soon lie; pales. The Priest mutters comfort:
</DIRECTION>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fear not, my son...
	</DIALOGUE>

D'Artagnan regards the Priest whose face is hidden be- neath the brim of his broad black hat. He holds a large Bible in his hands.

	It's him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTANCE>
<DIRECTION>
For just a moment, their eyes lock. Inestimable space between. Constance's eyes fill with tears, she watches d'Artagnan. Porthos steps back from d'Artagnan, raises his axe. D'Artagnan shuts his eyes, wonders, mutters a silent prayer. That's when screams of panic erupt from the crowd. D'Artagnan raises his head to see the source of this mayhem.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARKET SQUARE The Cardinal's crimson carriage races toward the scaffold, scattering the crowd in all directions. Men shout, women scream, all leaping to avoid the stallion's sharp hooves, the coach's THUNDEROUS spinning WHEELS. In the driver's seat, clutching the reins in one hand and CRACKING a WHIP in the other... is Athos. Porthos uses the heavy blunt end of the axe to topple the closest men-at-arms. Aramis opens his Bible, pulls out a PISTOL, and BLASTS the saber from the hand of the Captain of the Guards. A man-at-arms raises his musket to shoot the false priest, but d'Artagnan leaps out of nowhere, lands on him with both feet, knocking the man- at-arms off the scaffold.

D'Artagnan rushes to the edge of the scaffold, springs into the air, landing on the seat beside him. Aramis and Porthos shed their disguises, jump after, light upon the carriage. The roof fabric tears, they drop into the plush interior below. Athos CRACKS the WHIP... and the stallions race off through the crowd, towards freedom.

D'Artagnan grabs a handful of coins, and tosses them into the air. Aramis smiles approval, drops back to the carriage interior. Pedestrians see the gold, shout, and leap after. Their hurried steps impede the Guards' pro- gress, horses rear up, soldiers tumble. But several of the Guards manage to avoid the obstacle, pursue the carriage with renewed determination. D'Artagnan hears a LOUD POPPING sound, ducks.

EXT. ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fog drifts across a lonely stretch of road. Suddenly: pounding HOOFBEATS come over the scene. MUSIC SWELLS. And galloping out of the fog come d'Artagnan and the three Musketeers, riding hell-for-leather. HOLD ON this heroic tableau for a long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRIDGE ON ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four rough-looking MERCENARIES crouch on a low bridge spanning a shallow stream. They are armed with muskets and swords. The Mercenaries wait in the darkness, whisper eagerly among themselves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of them hisses for silence, all conversation ends. And the sound of HOOFBEATS is heard in the distance. Faint, but growing closer.
</DIRECTION>
<MERCENARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoot low. We'll need their heads for identification.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCENARY>
<DIRECTION>
The Mercenaries raise their muskets, take aim. Right on cue, four horsemen come THUNDERING out of the mist. But just before they reach the bridge, the four horsemen break in half -- one pair rides to the left, the other to the right. Before the Mercenaries realize what's happened, the horsemen ride on either side, splashing through the shallow stream. In a flash, they return to the road, and race away. Having avoided the bridge completely. Cursing, the angry Mercenaries whirl about, FIRE at d'Artagnan and the three Musketeers as they ride into the night. Porthos' merry laugh drifts back to mock them.

EXT. ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT An overturned wagon lies in the ditch. Beer kegs litter the roadway. The wagon's driver, an old FARMER, sits on one of the kegs, holding his head. D'Artagnan and the Musketeers gallop INTO VIEW, rein their horses to a stop.

	Won't you step down... Musketeers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FARMER>
<ARAMIS>

<DIRECTION>
The Farmer laughs, contemptuously. He raises his pistol and aims it at Porthos' head. But before he can pull the trigger, THREE EXPLOSIONS ERUPT from under the cloaks of Athos, Porthos and Aramis. When the smoke clears, d'Artagnan is startled to see the three dead "Farmers" sprawled in the road and the three pistols emerging from beneath the cloaks of the Musketeers.

A large warm tavern with a ROARING FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Present are the INNKEEPER, his wife, a few benighted tra- velers and THREE BARMAIDS. They turn as the door flies open and the Musketeers and d'Artagnan enter from a RAGING STORM. They keep their cloaks drawn about them and wear the brims of their hats pulled low to cover their faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The occupants of the inn regard the new arrivals with suspicion. Outisde, the STORM BLOWS. D'Artagnan closes the heavy door. Fearful, the Innkeeper comes forward to meet the four ominous travelers.

The sound of SLIDING STEEL as Athos, Porthos, Aramis and d'Artagnan draw their swords, ready to fight. They stand back to back in a circle, ready for attack.

	I said, 'A Queen is no different than a barmaid in the dark. Though less... practiced in the arts of pleasure...'
	</DIALOGUE>
</PORTHOS>
<DIRECTION>
The Barmaids accept his leering compliment with glee. But d'Artagnan isn't so sure. Porthos, with two Barmaids, bellows a reply.
</DIRECTION>
<PORTHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're going to be a proper Musketeer, you'll have to learn the manly art of wenching. Right, ladies?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PORTHOS>
<DIRECTION>
The Barmaids heartily concur. D'Artagnan looks over Porthos' shoulder, to the dark-haired Barmaid seen previ- ously. Porthos follows his gaze, grins.
</DIRECTION>
<PORTHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahh, very good. Your first subject. But you'll need instruction. Watch closely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PORTHOS>
<DIRECTION>
Porthos pulls one of the Barmaids to his chest, brings her lips toward his.
</DIRECTION>
<PORTHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The secret to wenching is the first kiss. For in that kiss, a lasting impression is made. If it is weak, she will think you are weak. And if it is comical, she will think you are a clown. With me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PORTHOS>
<D_ARTAGNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Weak... weak. Comical... clown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</D_ARTAGNAN>
<PORTHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good. And as a Musketeer is never weak, and only rarely a clown, your first kiss must be all the things that you are. Like this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PORTHOS>
<DIRECTION>
Porthos gives the Barmaid a powerful kiss. He breaks it, turns to d'Artagnan with a grin.
</DIRECTION>
<PORTHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may speak first if you like, your name, her name, an endearment or two. But words are usually a waste of time.

	Only if you don't know which words to say.

All turn to regard Aramis. He'll play along too. Porthos reacts with delight. D'Artagnan with interest. Aramis continues:
</DIRECTION>
<ARAMIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Words may make a more lasting impression than a thousand of Porthos' kisses.
	</DIALOGUE>

</ARAMIS>
<DIRECTION>
Aramis' courtly behavior is as out of place in these en- virons as it is persuasive. The Barmaid slips from Porthos' lap, sits down on the bench beside him. Aramis does not touch her. He simply looks into her eyes... and begins to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<ARAMIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer's leash hath all too short a date; Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, And often is his gold complexion dimmed; And every fair from fair sometimes declines, By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed; But thy eternal summer shall not fade. Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest, Nor shall death brag thou wanderest in his shade, When in eternal lines to time thou growest; So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see. So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.'

The Barmaid, once skeptical, sits silently. Her face covered with tears. Aramis pauses, almost embarrassed by the outcome. He turns to d'Artagnan, cites:

Then one day, while riding in the woods, the girl was thrown from her horse, and knocked unconscious. The Count hurried to help her. Her dress was torn. On her her arm, the woman wore a gold band in the shape of a serpent. It was the only article of clothing she refused to remove. The Count's curiosity got the best of him. He reached over and slid down the gold band. He saw something on her arm... something she'd kept hidden 'til then...

Athos pauses, imagines that life. The Count and his angel.

That's when Porthos, dancing with abandon, spins out of control, trips and falls on Athos' table, crushing it to the floor.

Athos spurs his horse across the field, d'Artagnan and the Musketeers follow. But they discover crude battle- ments in their path. Athos changes direction, sees six horsemen waiting for them in the near distance. He changes direction again, as the horsemen charge after.

They ride as fast their mounts will carry them. A cross- roads up ahead. Athos sizes up the situation, shouts command.

INT. QUEEN'S BATH - DAY A room heavy with mist and steam. Behind a maze of gauze screens, we discover Anne reclining in a large tiled bath, Constance attending. Constance replenishes the bath with pitchers of hot water drawn from a boiling cauldron. In mid-conversation, as confidantes and friends:

Richelieu makes his case with forceful eloquence, seeming loyalty. Anne considers, replies, noncommittal:
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will speak to him.

Anne senses hidden agenda, intrigues below the surface. The conversation's conspiratorial tone begins to disturb her.

Richelieu, ever prepared, produces a sheaf of papers. No doubt counterfeit. But Louis has no way of knowing. He takes the papers into his hands, reacts with sadness.

Louis turns back to the balcony, the soldiers marching below. His mood glum and lonely. He sighs, moves on to another matter of business.

Richelieu nods, not the least bit concerned.

<RICHELIEU>

	There are so many to choose from. Is it the one about my alleged alliance with Buckingham? Let's see if I remember it correctly. While the English attack from without, I'll undermine the throne from within -- depose you -- and become sovereign of France myself. That rumor, Your Majesty?

EXT. RIVER AND FERRY LANDING - DAY

The ferry is an open flatboat -- a wooden platform, about fifteen-by-twenty feet. It travels from one shore to the other by means of a ferry rope. Transport is slow, the trip to the other shore takes nearly five minutes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Porthos and Aramis arrive, the flatboat is just re- turning, piloted by its FERRYMAN, a hunched and weather- beaten gnome. Four passengers wait to be carried across -- TWO GENTLEMAN CAVALIERS on horseback, and a country WOMAN and her child. As the flatboat enters its slip, the two Cavaliers urge their horses on board, rudely jostling the Woman and her child to the rear. The Ferryman, an experienced boot-licker, bows and scrapes to the Cavaliers, collects the coins they toss to his way.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRYMAN>

All turn to regard Aramis on horseback, Porthos at his side. The Woman reacts with grateful surprise. The Ferryman is outraged, spittle flies as he curses and protests.

The Cavaliers have already pulled out their swords. Porthos and Aramis now reach for their own. Porthos deadpans:
</DIRECTION>
<PORTHOS>

	</DIALOGUE>
</PORTHOS>
<DIRECTION>
FIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The middle of a river on a rocking flatboat is not the best place for a duel. But the combatants make the most of it. Slipping, sliding, and falling. They attack with everything they've got. The Cavaliers are excellent swordsmen. And, as if that were not enough, the Musketeers have an additional disadvantage -- they must keep the Woman and child clear of the flashing blades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Porthos drives his opponent about the flatboat with a devilish grin, chases him between -- and at one point, over -- blindfolded horses. Aramis duels with the expected artistry, gradually re- ducing his opponent to tatters. At one juncture, the child loses her footing, slides toward the low end of the flatboat, the deep river beyond. Aramis executes a neat sidestep, stops the child's desperate progress with one arm while continuing to do battle with the other. He returns child to Mother with a grin, continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two Cavaliers are soon vanquished, groaning on the flatboat deck. Porthos and Aramis meet at the middle, breathless. Porthos complains:

Aramis hurries to his horse, takes off the blindfold. Porthos grumbles after, follows suit. They leap atop their mounts, the horses slip upon the wet deck as they guide them to the edge.

And with that, as the Woman and child, the Ferryman look on, Aramis and Porthos guide their horses into the raging river. The Woman whispers after:

RIVER A wild ride down the ROARING RIVER. Porthos clinging to his horse for dear life. Aramis keeping an eye on his fellow Musketeer... and the deep rapids up ahead. Through twists and turns, walls of white water, huge boulders, and gyrating whirlpools... Aramis and Porthos finally reach a quiet pool, a leafy shore beyond. They lead their horses from the water, step toward dry land... and see yet another (or perhaps the same) patrol of Cardinal's Guards. Waiting, swords drawn, for their arrival. Porthos looks down at his latest sash -- destroyed like the others. Aramis draws his saber, mutters.

Cool, clear water. WIDEN to reveal d'Artagnan and Athos at a shallow pond, watering their horses. The forest around them is dark and primeval.

To the point, as always. D'Artagnan pauses to look at their beautiful surroundings, remembers:
</DIRECTION>
<D_ARTAGNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father used to hunt in a forest like this. He promised to take me on my tenth birthday. I don't know why he picked that year. Something about a boy becoming a man. I'd lay in bed at night and imagine it, just the two of us. But he died before I could go with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</D_ARTAGNAN>
<DIRECTION>
Athos is unmoved, or so it would seem. He replies with quiet cynicism:
</DIRECTION>
<ATHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. You have your boyhood wish at last. The dark forest. The thrill of the hunt. The nearness of death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHOS>
<DIRECTION>
Only d'Artagnan is the hunted, not the hunter.
</DIRECTION>
<D_ARTAGNAN>

	I'd be proud to die for my King.
	</DIALOGUE>
</D_ARTAGNAN>
<ATHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wanted to save you from the life of a Musketeer. You don't have to go looking for experience, d'Artagnan. It'll find you soon enough. And when it does -- it will mark you forever.

EXT. FOREST - DAY Athos leads d'Artagnan through the forest. Sunbeams shoot down through thick branches like golden bars. A pastoral setting, almost peaceful. And then: THUNDERING HOOFBEATS. Athos and d'Artagnan turn in surprise, see SIX HORSEMEN CRASHING through the glade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE Athos and d'Artagnan GALLOP through the dense forest. The horesmen FIRE PISTOLS as they ride. A SHOT grazes d'Artagnan's shoulder, he staggers, retains his mount. Athos leads them up a hillside, a series of boulders at the top. The climb is fast and treacherous, GUNFIRE all around them. Athos' horse is struck by a bullet, stag- gers forward... and collapses just as they reach the crest. D'Artagnan leaps off his horse, takes cover with Athos behind the boulders. Athos takes aim, FIRES a SHOT, and kills one of the horsemen below. The others curse, leap from their mounts, seek cover. SHOTS WHIZ back and forth like angry hornets. Stalemate, but not for long. They are badly outnumbered. The horsemen creep slowly up the hillside, from tree to tree. Athos turns to d'Artagnan as he reloads:
</DIRECTION>
<ATHOS>

D'Artagnan nods. Athos FIRES off another SHOT. He produces a gold coin, flips, slams it between palm and hand. And looks between.

ATHOS AND HIS POV Heads. D'Artagnan is to remain. Athos looks up without missing a beat.
</DIRECTION>

	But...?

Athos reloads, FIRES below. D'Artagnan recognizes the kindness he has received. That Athos cannot fully express it. And that there is no use arguing with him.
</DIRECTION>
<D_ARTAGNAN>

	At least take my pistol.

EXT. ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lonely stretch of road, illuminated by moonlight. A signpost announces: CALAI 15 LEAGUES. An exhausted HORSE CLOPS INTO VIEW, its rider half-conscious in the saddle. It is d'Artagnan. He can barely keep his eyes open. Suddenly, d'Artagnan passes out, tumbles from his saddle, and lands in the middle of the road. He opens his eyes once -- a sky filled with stars -- then closes them. We hear HORSES, and the CREAK of a CARRIAGE APPROACHING. The DRIVER brakes, and the horses are brought to a halt just short of trampling d'Artagnan. In the darkness, we can make out other shapes, rugged men on horseback, bodyguards to the carriage's passenger. Milady de Winter.

D'ARTAGNAN'S POV - BLACK SCREEN Out of the darkness, a face appears, BLURRY and OBSCURED. It FILLS the SCREEN, slowly swimming INTO FOCUS. It is Milady de Winter, even more beautiful in CLOSEUP. Familiar, and no doubt deadly, ivory combs gleam in her hair. She smiles warmly.

ANOTHER ANGLE

reveals the interior of a bed chamber at a roadside inn. D'Artagnan, regaining his senses, finds himself propped up in a large bed. He blinks into the face of Milady who sits at the edge. His eyes widen with recognition, faint awe.

D'Artagnan notices that his shoulder has been bandaged. He looks around the large room. A FIRE ROARS in the grate. Food and drink have been set upon a table. D'Artagnan continues, still groggy, uncertain:

D'Artagnan relaxes slightly. Milady rises from the bed. She wears a sky blue dressing gown, something soft and silken beneath it. D'Artagnan reacts perceptibly. En- joying his discomfort, Milady crosses the room, joins him at the window.

D'Artagnan and Milady face each other on a rug in front of the roaring fire. The plate of food between them is empty. They drink wine from goblets. D'Artagnan drains his cup, and stares into the burning embers. Milady speaks quietly, with seeming compassion:

Milady knows when to speak, and when to listen. She looks at d'Artagnan with gentle expression, allows him to continue. The warm room, the wine, her kindness. All conspire to loosen his tongue. D'Artagnan speaks quietly, from the heart:
</DIRECTION>

Her tone heralds a sudden shift. D'Artagnan sees the look in her eyes, can almost feel her lips upon him. But he resists. There is Constance's memory to consider. And midnight as it approaches.

Milady leans close, runs a fingertip along the line of his jaw. Her dressing gown falls open at the top, enough for d'Artagnan to see her breasts as they press against the silk beneath it. Milady speaks as her finger traces.

D'Artagnan pulls back -- just as Milady's arm arcs down toward his neck, holding a long sharp stick pin, almost a dagger, attached to an ivory comb. D'Artagnan sees it in the nick of time, parries with his free hand, knocking the dagger to the rug. Milady leaps after it, hands out- stretched. D'Artagnan follows, battles for the dagger, stunned with fear and surprise:

D'Artagnan nearly chokes on the knowledge. Milady is the messenger he is seeking. He grabs the dagger, rolls to the side. Milady staggers after, the shoulder of her negligee rips open. D'Artagnan sees the soft white flesh, reacts with shock, recognition -- she bears the brand of the fleur de lis. The infamous mark of the murderess. Just as Athos told it to him. Not so long ago.

D'Artagnan looks at the dagger in his right hand. Then, unwilling to fight the man with an un- fair advantage, he tosses the dagger to the side, steps forward to meet him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker disposes of d'Artagnan with lightning speed. A series of unexpected kicks, brutally efficient blows. The young man is unfamiliar with, and no match for, the martial arts. Parker hoists d'Artagnan to his feet, dazed. Henri picks up the dagger with bad intentions. Milady straightens her dressing gown, adjusts her hair, and commands:
</DIRECTION>
<MILADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILADY>
<DIRECTION>
Parker holds him fast. Henri steps forward. And d'Artagnan thinks fast.
</DIRECTION>
<D_ARTAGNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can kill me. But a surprise waits for you in England. That even Buckingham can't prevent.

	D'Artagnan. You are young, vain, and foolish. But I do not know if you are clever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILADY>
<DIRECTION>
D'Artagnan's expression reveals nothing. Except to suggest the existence of a secret he is bravely keeping. Duly deceived, though she doesn't know it, Milady changes her mind.

	We'll take him with us.

INT. INN - UPPER HALL AND LANDING - NEAR DAWN

Milady emerges from her room, dressed for travel. She is followed by d'Artagnan, now clothed. He is flanked by Henri and Parker. Henri presses the blade of a knife against d'Artagnan's side.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bodyguards are waiting outside.

Milady leads them down the hall. But when she reaches the landing, and looks at the tavern below... she draws back with surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE TO INCLUDE MILADY AND HER POV The innkeeper, roused from sleep, and wearing a night- shirt, is engaged in urgent conversation with Armand de Winter -- the son of the man Milady killed in Paris. The innkeeper shakes his head. Armand grabs him by the collar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D'Artagnan sees Milady's reaction -- surprise, impatience, and just a hint of fear. Milady commands:
</DIRECTION>
<MILADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The back stairs. Hurry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILADY>

They change directions. As he is pulled away, d'Artagnan catches a glimpse of Armand de Winter below.

INT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT D'Artagnan and Parker sit across from Milady. Her face betrays faint doubt, apprehension. Emotions she is not used to feeling, let alone displaying to the world around her. D'Artagnan sees his opening... and speaks:

	The man at the inn... what did he want?

	Why?

<MILADY>

<DIRECTION>
A beat. D'Artagnan studies her pale, beautiful face. Remembers Athos' tale of love and loss.

<D_ARTAGNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think he's not the first husband you killed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off her look)

	I once knew a man, one of the Counts of Berry. He told me a story... of beauty and danger. He was the bravest man I've ever known. And the saddest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</D_ARTAGNAN>
<MILADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILADY>
<DIRECTION>
The truth strikes home. Milady cannot conceal it. But she does not react with anger or scorn. D'Artagnan has reminded her of the one thing in the world that still touches her heart. D'Artagnan looks at her with a steady gaze. Milady cannot hold it, she turns to the carriage window.

EXT. CALAIS - NIGHT Milady's carriage turns down a steep lane that leads to the harbor. The fog is so thick that only the masts of the schooners can be seen, poking out of the gloom. Their lanterns glow gloomily. The carriage comes to a stop.

EXT. HARBOR OF CALAIS - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The lights of the harbor are muted by low-hanging fog. We see the outline of a ship waiting at the pier. Henri helps Milady out of the carriage. D'Artagnan follows. Milady's bodyguards dismount, six of them. A motley bunch of sinister killers. They look around the pier, ready for any encounter. D'Artagnan takes in his surroundings. There is a mel- ancholy air about him.
</DIRECTION>
<MILADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter, d'Artagnan? Still hoping for your friends to ride to the rescue?

<HENRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are the Countess de Winter's party, arrived from Paris. Permission to come aboard.

There is no reply. Closely guarded by Parker, d'Artagnan strains to see.

The deck is filled with swirling fog. Henri peers into the gloom as he climbs aboard, followed by the others. He addresses one of the crew, a tall figure standing nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take us to your captain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRI>
<DIRECTION>
The tall figure does not reply, nor does he move. Henri demands:
</DIRECTION>
<HENRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you, deaf?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRI>
<DIRECTION>
Henri goes to shake the man. He grabs his arm, and the man pitches forward, falling face first on the deck. Henri jumps back in alarm. Milady and the others react.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BODYGUARD
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Milady's Bodyguards rush around the deck, confront the other silent silhouettes. They, like the tall figure... are dead. The limp bodies topple at their touch. The Bodyguards shout alarm and panic:
</DIRECTION>
<BODYGUARDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dead! They're all dead!

</PORTHOS>
<DIRECTION>
That's when Porthos, and Aramis -- come swooping down from above like avenging angels. They swing on the ends of ropes, slicing through the air, then dropping feet first on top of Milady's Bodyguards. D'Artagnan stands open-mouthed, as his three friends draw their swords.
</DIRECTION>

</PORTHOS>
<DIRECTION>
D'Artagnan grabs a sword from the deck, turns to join the fray. And finds himself face to face with Parker, the Indo-Chinese bodyguard. Parker has two Oriental swords spinning in his hands. One knocks d'Artagnan's sword out of his hand. D'Artagnan does a back flip but falls on the slippery deck. As Parker is about to chop d'Artagnan's head off, his face grimaces as he is lifted on a sword OUT OF FRAME. In the mist Athos is revealed!
</DIRECTION>
<ATHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry I'm late. Did I miss anything?

D'Artagnan almost cries with happiness. He leaps to his feet and embraces Athos.

	Keep your mind on the mission, d'Artagnan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHOS>
<DIRECTION>
He winks at d'Artagnan, returns to the fray. D'Artagnan follows. The Musketeers confront Milady's evil Bodyguards in the night and fog. Athos with brutal perfection. Porthos with strange weapons and a healthy sense of the absurd. And Aramis with familiar grace and artistry -- and a marked determination to disable, not kill, his opponents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milady views the latter with alarm. As the battle rages around her, she retreats into the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Athos and d'Artagnan find themselves fighting side by side. Athos observes d'Artagnan's technique -- the usual frenetic windmill of feint and thrust -- with a frown.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHOS>

	Boy, it's a miracle you're still alive fighting like that.

	First, always find your enemy's weakness. Second, take advantage of it. Watch me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHOS>
<DIRECTION>
One of the Bodyguards, who wears a wooden leg, attacks Athos. Athos kicks the false leg out from under him, knocks him to the deck. D'Artagnan repeats, even as he disables his own foe.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Find the weakness. Take advantage. Got it.

Aramis kneels at a dying man, delivers muttered last rites. A Bodyguard races INTO VIEW, means to kill him where he kneels. Aramis doesn't miss a beat -- he shifts, rises, delivers a punch and kick, knocking the man off the ship to the water below. A SPLASH is heard. And Aramis resumes a priestly pose, continues the litany.

Milady grabs the deadly comb from her hair, grips the dagger's handle. Athos, stunned from breaking their fall, rolls to his side. Milady peers at his face, vulnerable in the half- light. And lowers the dagger. She will not kill him.

Athos' face is a mask of contradiction. He tries to pull the trigger, but it is not in him. Milady recognizes his pain with a nod. She feels it, too. Then, briefly, before she leaves him, Milady speaks softly. The past, their love, and where it led them.

EXT. SEASIDE CLIFFS - NIGHT A hundred feet below, waves crash on a rocky shore. On the jagged cliff above, a black mass of trees is outlined against a stormy sky filled with copper-colored clouds, surreal in effect. A sinister procession approaches the cliff. Porthos leads Milady. She wears a simple white shift, her hair pulled back into a long braid. She looks years younger, the girl she used to be. The Executioner walks behind them. Followed by Armand de Winter, Aramis, d'Artagnan. And Athos. He watches every step.

Milady kneels, the Executioner steps closer. The tableau silhouetted against a reddish glow on the horizon. The Executioner brushes Milady's braid from her neck, exposing the soft white skin beneath. He raises the scimitar overhead, and just as he is about to bring it down... a cry is heard, torn from the heart:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ATHOS

	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

Athos grabs the Executioner's wrist, and twists the scimitar loose. It falls to the ground.

The words he could never say, finally spoken. Milady locks eyes with him. Athos' desperate act, the pure feeling it signifies, has given her a kind of release. And the strength to face her fate.

	The Cardinal intends to assassinate the King at his birthday celebration on Friday.

And with that, Milady reaches forward, offers a gentle kiss. Then, as Athos and the others look on, stunned, uncertain... she takes a backward step, finds the cliff's edge... and steps over it. The Executioner rushes to look after. The others follow. Except for Athos, who remains rooted in place, eyes on the distant horizon. A long silence. THUNDER RUMBLES.

D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers thunder through on horseback. Pedestrians scurry to get out of their way. As they ride past, Porthos raises a crossbow and fires it. The arrow slices through the air with a terrible hum and imbeds itself on the public wall. Attached to the arrow is a piece of parchment, like the one in d'Artagnan's father's study. It reads: All For One, And One For All.

HOOFBEATS interrupt. The Captain turns in irritation. And Porthos and Aramis ride to either side, snatch the man up by the arms, drag him briefly through the air, and deposit him with a thud against a hitching post.

ENTRANCE DOORS Louis, Queen Anne, and their retinue enter from a corridor, proceed slowly across the room toward the balcony that overlooks the waiting crowd outside.

The streets leading to the Palace are clogged with people, all pushing and straining to get closer. D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers arrive on horseback, are forced to dismount. They push through the crowd, trying to reach the Palace, afraid that they will be too late. Athos barks orders as they struggle forward:

THEIR POV

Behind Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, something incredible happens. Musketeers appear from every direction. Some from the surrounding crowd. Some from buildings, roof- tops. Others appear on horseback, a few disguised as monks. And all defiantly wearing their blue and gold tunics. The murmur of the crowd becomes an excited roar. The corps of Musketeers line up behind Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. Porthos and Aramis exchange a smile. Athos keeps his usually dour expression. But his eyes are charged with excitement. They raise their arms, and face the long line of Guards. A hundred sabers flash in the sunlight.

The marksman forces d'Artagnan toward the edge of the tower. Two hundred feet to the ground below. They remain deadlocked for a beat, the marksman inching d'Artagnan backward, certain death behind him. And at the last moment, d'Artagnan summons up the strength of three -- and shoves the marksman backward with a resound- ing kick.
</DIRECTION>

The marksman stumbles, falls through the open trapdoor, and plunges to his death. D'Artagnan peers down the shaft. There's a faint CRASH as the marksman hits bottom. Utilizing the bell ropes like a fireman's pole, d'Artagnan grabs hold and slides down into the abyss.

The regiment of Guards rush forward, press their bodies against the door to secure it. BOOM -- the great door threatens to split in half. Richelieu huddles with Rochefort amid the rising panic. His eyes narrow to mean slits, he gestures toward Louis and Anne across the room.

Musketeers surround Louis and Anne to ward off attack. But the young King has no intention of being protected. He wades to the fore, fights side by side with his Musketeers. Anne watches him with a host of emotions. Respect, admiration... love. Louis pauses to return her gaze, then returns to battle. Constance dashes through the fray. She sees a Guard slip behind a curtain, approach the Queen. She grabs a heavy goblet, shouts:

Anne looks up. Constance tosses the goblet to her. Anne catches it neatly, brings it down on the head of the hapless Guard. Constance smiles, leaps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aramis cuts down a Guard. As another man comes at him from behind, Porthos intervenes, runs the man through. The two Musketeers pause to exchange deadpan thanks, and continue. Athos and Rochefort slash at each other. It is a mighty confrontation. But Athos soon gains the upper hand. Rochefort shouts to a nearby Guard for help. Now it's two on one. Athos receives a wound in the shoulder, he staggers... and the treaty falls from his tunic to the floor. Rochefort reacts with a start, he grabs the treaty, stuffs it into his doublet. Athos shakes off the sudden pain, disposes of the Guard. Rochefort and Athos face each other a second time. Athos wounded, Rochefort confident he can finish the injured Musketeer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Athos merely changes sword hands. Rochefort reacts. Their SABERS CLASH as they draw together. Rochefort grabs a dagger from his belt with his free hand. But Athos sees it coming, and smashes Rochefort across the face with his fist.

Rochefort goes sprawling. He loses his sword, it slides across the floor until someone's foot stops it. Rochefort looks up... and sees d'Artagnan standing on the blade.

D'ARTAGNAN AND ROCHEFORT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They battle before the blazing fire, sweat covers their faces. Rochefort wears a wolfish grin. But d'Artagnan has learned his lessons well. He attacks with gusto. Rochefort's grin soon turns toward desperation. He cannot match the boy's vengeful steel. So he drives a knee into d'Artagnan's groin. D'Artagnan falls to the floor. Rochefort means to finish him there. But d'Artagnan rolls away from the blade, leaps back to his feet. Undaunted, he hurls himself at his hated opponent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rochefort sidesteps, throws d'Artagnan against a wall. He pins him there, stunning the youth. And hisses with superior disdain:

But d'Artagnan remembers Athos' advice. "Always find your enemy's weakness." He shoves a thumb into Rochefort's good eye. Rochefort stumbles backward. D'Artagnan plunges his sword into Monsieur Cyclops's heart.

A tremendous cheer is heard from all. Richelieu is led from the room. He pauses in front of d'Artagnan.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHELIEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulations, Monsieur d'Artagnan. I'll be keeping an eye on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHELIEU>
<D_ARTAGNAN>
<DIRECTION>
(unphased)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Your Eminence. I'll be watching you, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</D_ARTAGNAN>
<DIRECTION>
Richelieu smiles his crocodile smile. Followed by guards, he turns and strides away, hands clasped behind his back, scarlet robes billowing behind him. Louis turns to the Musketeers. He indicates d'Artagnan.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this the young man who saved my life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Porthos puts a hand on d'Artagnan's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<PORTHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His name's d'Artagnan, Sire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PORTHOS>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Approach, d'Artagnan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
D'Artagnan's heart pounds as he draws closer to King and Queen. Then he remembers, reaches into his doublet. And turns to the Queen.
</DIRECTION>
<D_ARTAGNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have something that belongs to ... Your Majesty...
	</DIALOGUE>
</D_ARTAGNAN>
<DIRECTION>
D'Artagnan produces the bracelet he found on the country road. He holds it out to her. The King wonders, the Queen smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, d'Artagnan. But the bracelet does not belong to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off his look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It belongs to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Anne indicates Constance, who steps forward, INTO VIEW. D'Artagnan and Constance lock eyes for the third time. The thrill of recognition, the promise of romance, charges between. D'Artagnan slips the bracelet around her wrist. Constance kisses him on the cheek. Louis continues:
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	D'Artagnan, I am in your debt. What can I do to repay the courage you've shown me? Anything, D'Artagnan. Whatever your heart desires...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
D'Artagnan knows what he wants. But he is tongue-tied, unable to ask for it. Athos asks for him.
</DIRECTION>
<ATHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Majesty, his heart has only one desire. To become a Musketeer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATHOS>
<DIRECTION>
D'Artagnan looks at Athos, thankful for the intercession. Louis answers with pleasure.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then kneel, d'Artagnan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
D'Artagnan drops to his knees. Louis lays the blade of his sword on each of his shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The world is an uncertain realm, filled with danger. Truth despoiled by broken promises. Honor undermined by the pursuit of gold. Freedom sacrificed when the weak are oppressed by the strong. But there are those who oppose these powerful forces. Those who dedicate their lives to truth, honor, and freedom. They are a constant reminder to all of us. That such a life is not just possible, but necessary to our continued survival. As a country, as a King. These men are known as the Musketeers...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
As Louis speaks, D'Artagnan closes his eyes; countless images rush through his mind. His home in Gascony, Constance and Queen Anne on the country road, his first encounters with Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, their adventures together, the face of Milady. It's been a busy week.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rise, d'Artagnan. And join them. Musketeer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
D'Artagnan stands, transformed from boy to man. BELLS RING in the distance. Constance smiles brightly, tears gleam in her eyes. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis surround their young friend, and happily present him with the bright blue tunic of the Musketeers. They slip the tunic over d'Artagnan's head, react with a cheer. D'Artagnan hugs each of the three. For each has given him gifts more valuable than gold. Porthos, Aramis, and last... Athos. Who, to the surprise of all who know him... smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<PORTHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do my eyes deceive me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PORTHOS>
<ARAMIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I find it hard to believe myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARAMIS>
<PORTHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His lips, unused as they are to such a contortion, twisted and stretched... into a smile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PORTHOS>
<ARAMIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was spectacular. And what teeth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARAMIS>
<DIRECTION>
D'Artagnan basks in their company, wonders aloud.
</DIRECTION>
<D_ARTAGNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know this is a stupid question. But what exactly does a Musketeer do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</D_ARTAGNAN>
<DIRECTION>
Porthos and Aramis exchange a glance. They're not so sure themselves.
</DIRECTION>
<PORTHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Truth... honor...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PORTHOS>
<ARAMIS>
<DIRECTION>
(helpfully suggests a third)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And freedom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARAMIS>
<PORTHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Weren't you listening?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PORTHOS>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Three Musketeers -- no, make that the four Musketeers -- raise their swords, and clash blades together, causing them to give off sparks.
</DIRECTION>
<D_ARTAGNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All for one...
	</DIALOGUE>
</D_ARTAGNAN>

	<DIALOGUE>

MUSIC SOARS. The curtain falls.

<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.

THE END
