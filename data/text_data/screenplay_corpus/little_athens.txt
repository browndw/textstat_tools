:SC: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is dark and messy. JERRY, a soft, unshaven boy of about eighteen years, sits on the end of his bed in boxers and an old t- shirt. He has not quite woken up yet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry pulls a huge, well-traveled SUITCASE from his closet and tosses it onto the bed. He begins grabbing articles of CLOTHING from the closet and tossing them into the Suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry is in his kitchen, which is no brighter than his bedroom, and not much cleaner. Jerry takes another bite of his peanut butter and jelly SANDWICH. He chews mechanically, washing it down with a can of SODA. His lazy mind is somewhere else.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry gargles with a generic brand of MOUTHWASH and spits into the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He catches a glimpse of himself in the medicine cabinet mirror - he is not very attractive. He grabs his TOOTHBRUSH and RAZOR, and exits the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room has been stripped except for the bed minus its bedsheets, a naked pillow, a beat-up dresser with a small TV on top of it, an old POGO STICK propped against the wall near the GARBAGE CAN at the foot of the bed, and a few posters and scraps of trash. Jerry tosses his Toothbrush and Razor into his Suitcase next to a VIDEO GAME CONSOLE and several VIDEO GAMES, on top of which lies GRAND THEFT AUTO III. He has pitifully few belongings. He shuts the Suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The living room is also a mess - the place is either a pig sty or a house full of bachelors. Jerry, now in sweatpants and sneakers, but still wearing the same t-shirt that he slept in, carries his Suitcase through the foyer to the front door. He about-faces to look at the interior of his home. He will not miss it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to open the screen door - it's stuck. He fiddles with handle until the screen door opens. He exits, letting the screen door slam shut behind him.

<DIRECTION>
The kitchen is empty except for HEATHER and ALLISON, both about nineteen and dressed in EMS uniforms with "EMS" stitched conspicuously on the back, seated on opposite sides of a wooden table. Heather is dark-haired, about 5'9" and built like a lingerie model. Allison has blond hair, is several inches shorter than Heather, and although not overweight, she has a softer build than Heather. Heather has take-out PANCAKES and SAUSAGES in front of her, and she is putting it away like she is preparing for famine. Allison has a BAGEL and a PEACH, which remain hardly touched - she has a lot on her mind.

:SC: EXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRAD, in jeans with his t-shirt thrown over his shoulder, is standing in front of the door, waiting. MEGAN, in shorts, a t-shirt and a baseball cap, and AMY, in a sunskirt, look on. All in their late teens, they are unmade and worn-out, as if they hadn't slept last night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brad rings the doorbell twice and waits some more. Brad walks over to the window a few feet over from the door, trying to peer through the shades. Megan passes the time by pulling Jimmy's MAIL out of the mailbox that hangs next to the door.

:SC: EXT. POOL -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The slender white board extends majestically over the glistening blue water. PEDRO, an unshowered, pot-bellied Hispanic, about twenty-three years of age and wearing cut-off jean shorts, is standing at the end of the board, looking down at the water below as if expecting an invitation. COREY, a late teenager covered with tattoos, with twigs for arms and legs, lies against the hard concrete while inserting the pool VACUUM HOSE into one of the many pool skimmer drains. Pedro begins to bounce on the board - up, down, up, down. Pedro launches forth as if the water called out to him and, but for his want of grace, the entry would be poetic. Instead, Pedro's dive is as clumsy as it is painful.

JESSICA, about eighteen, wire-thin and plain, yet attractive in an unkept sort of way, with dirty-blond hair past her shoulders, lies on a couch sleeping. Her chokingly small living room is in a

<DIRECTION>
devastating state of disarray, with clothes and empty food containers flung in every direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ALARM on a table next to the couch begins blaring, and Jessica stretches out her arm to silence it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Jessica is standing in front of the mirror staring at herself, still half asleep. The bathroom is tiny like the living room - pathetic rather than endearing. She puts TOOTHPASTE on her TOOTHBRUSH.

Jessica returns to the living room wearing a t-shirt that reads "Athens Youth Group" in large letters along the front. Jina is gone. Jessica runs her hand through her hair, tossing it haphazardly. She grabs a pair of large SUNGLASSES off of the coffee table and places them over her eyes.

Ron exits and Jimmy sits on the bench in front of his locker, defeated. BUGGERIN' BOBBY BALES, a.k.a.

HEATHER is driving the AMBULANCE, sirens blaring, a CIGARETTE hanging out of her mouth, with ALLISON riding shotgun. HARRY, mild- mannered, rotund, middle-aged and slightly balding, is in the back sitting on a bench extending from the side of the ambulance, adjacent to a stretcher. Harry sits expressionless, adjusting his spectacles as the ambulance shakes mildly from the driving.

WIDE on the ambulance tearing through town, lights flashing. Heather is driving extremely fast in this emergency situation, recklessly passing both moving vehicles as well as stationary vehicles that have stopped to let the ambulance pass, on her way to running through a red light. In the rear of the ambulance, Harry whips back and forth on the bench, yet remains calm, as if unaware of Heather's reckless driving.

Within the parking lot, the ambulance comes to a screeching halt in front of a large picket fence encircling the pool. At the gate stands the LIFEGUARD.

All three climb out of the ambulance. Harry rushes toward the Lifeguard. Heather takes a final puff of her Cigarette and flicks it aside before continuing in the same direction as Harry. Allison lags behind, pulling a BACKBOARD and a large FIRST AID KIT out of the ambulance.

Allison and Harry are in the back with the Victim, and Heather is again behind the wheel, moving her head ever so slightly, as if to music playing in her head. Heather's moderate driving speed is in sharp contrast to the speed with which she responded to the scene. At the same red light that Heather recklessly ran earlier, Heather

<DIRECTION>
The Tow Truck has just pulled up into the driveway. Pedro climbs out and makes his way up the sidewalk to his front door, carrying a gallon of MILK. Emily climbs out and trails behind him, carrying her LAUNDRY BAG and PURSE. The house is very small, with a front yard that is not much bigger than the sidewalk, and neighboring houses not much more than a body length apart from each other. Pedro notices an EVICTION NOTICE on the front door, and that a brand-new lock has been placed on the otherwise run-down door. He tries unsuccessfully to open the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over and looks through the front window into his kitchen and sees his DOG. Pedro taps on the window. The Dog looks up at Pedro, wagging its tail. Pedro tries to open the window, but it's locked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pedro walks around to the side of the house. Emily throws her Laundry Bag over her shoulder and follows him, frustrated with the wait. He looks in the window on the pantry door. He backs up and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks toward Emily, blank. He looks back up at the house, frustrated. He about-faces, steps over to the side of the neighboring house, unzips his pants, looks both ways to make sure the neighbors are not around, and starts pissing. Emily shakes her head and heads back toward the truck, turned off by the whole situation.

The yard slopes significantly from the front yard to the back yard, and the view of the back of the house reveals two stories. As Jimmy turns the corner, he spots a black CAT walking up to him. He grabs the Cat.

Jimmy leans over from his chair and waves a hand in front of Car. Nothing. Jimmy jumps up from his recliner. He stares at Car. He steps over, takes two fingers and checks Car's pulse. He stands back, unsure of what to do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hesitant, Jimmy walks over to a closet, opens the door, and slides a GYM BAG out into the room. He opens the Gym Bag and pulls out a large bag of MARIJUANA and a few jars of K. He throws them into his Backpack, zips up the Gym Bag, and puts it back into the closet.

Music is audible from inside the house. Carter's house is an old dilapidated house, with a tiny front yard and huge back yard surrounded by trees, with rusty old cars scattered throughout. Just about everybody enters the house from the back. BERUBI, in his early twenties, very large and athletic, wearing mesh shorts and a beat-up t-shirt, and a MALE FRIEND, of a similar age with an average build and dressed lazily in khakis and an un-tucked shirt, are unloading a KEG from the bed of a PICK-UP TRUCK onto a dolly. HEATHER and ALLISON are standing on the back porch. Heather is holding a bottle of VODKA in her hand. Heather bangs on the screen door. CARTER approaches. In his early twenties, Carter is tough, with a modestly athletic build and a gruff voice, and possessing an appetite for greasy food and cheap beer. He's a guy's guy.

Carlos's CAR is parked in street in front of Carter's house, just down the street from where Pedro has parked, but on the opposite side of the street and facing in the opposite direction. Through the windshield, we see Berubi head back toward the house as Pedro glances at Jessica, now showered and dressed in a yellow tank-top, before climbing back into the Tow Truck and pulling back out onto the road.

JIMMY is standing in the kitchen in front of the door looking out onto the back porch, staring at the couple making out, momentarily transfixed.

We recognize the room as Jerry's old bedroom, empty except for a bed stripped of it's sheets, a naked pillow, a beat-up dresser with a small TV on top of it, and a few posters and scraps of trash that have been left behind. JIMMY and RJ are looking across the room at SINJIN, a young African-American male about RJ's age, with an average build, sharply dressed in a button-down, and sport coat. Sinjin has his back to Jimmy, and is bouncing up and down on a rusty old POGO STICK - his behavior constituting a sharp contrast to his stylish threads. LOUIE, an overweight, slobbish Caucasian male a few years older than Sinjin, sits in a rickety old WHEELCHAIR that might creak even more than Sinjin's pogo stick - in Louie's lap rests a BOWLING BALL BAG. Upon seeing Sinjin and Louie, Jimmy fondles his WATER BOTTLE nervously. He turns around to watch RJ closing the door behind them.
