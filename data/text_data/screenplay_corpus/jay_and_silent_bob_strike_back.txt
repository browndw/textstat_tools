OVER BLACK WE SEE:

<DIRECTION>
CHYRON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long time ago, in front of a convenience store far, far away--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. QUICK STOP YEARS AGO--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We FADE IN on the block of stores (Quick Stop/RST), from sometime ago, In fact, RST isn't RST; it's THE RECORD RACK -- a 45's store with head shop paraphernalia in the window. A white-trash MOTHER (maybe seventeen) wearing a baseball cap comes into frame carrying a chubby BABY. The Baby wears an oversized t-shirt under what looks like a little bathrobe, and messily eats a CHOCOLATE BAR. There are food stamps in the Mother's hands.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby-Boy stay here while mommy picks up the free cheese, 'kay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up at the bright sun, shielding her eyes slightly, then looks back at the baby on the ground. She takes off her baseball cap and places it on the baby.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This'll keep the sun out of your eyes. You be good now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
She walks away, leaving the baby sitting against the wall. With the backwards baseball cap and the chocolate around his mouth forming something that resembles a beard, the kid looks kind of familiar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, another MOTHER (also very young) decked out in a KISS concert shirt from years gone by and huge, feathered hair enters, with a black skullcap wearing BABY slung at her hip. She sees the first Baby, sitting against the wall and sets her Baby down beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't fucking move, you little shit- machine. Mommy's gonna try to score.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
A PASSERBY enters, heading toward the convenience store. He takes note of the Babies and the Mother heading into the record store, and then stops and addresses her, disgusted.
</DIRECTION>
<PASSERBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me--who's watching these babies?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PASSERBY>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MOTHER>
<PASSERBY>

<DIRECTION>
(walking away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave'em out here like that and see what happens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PASSERBY>
<DIRECTION>
The Passerby walks away. The Mother flips him the bird.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING SQUARE!

	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
The door closes, and the Babies sit there quietly for a beat. Then, they look at each other. The larger one says nothing. The smaller one says--

<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When the fuck did this happen?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<BRODIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, after X-Men hit at the box office, all the studios started buying up every comic property they could get their hands on. Miramax optioned Bluntman and Chronic.

</BRODIE>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miramax? I thought they only made classy flicks like The Piano and The Crying Game?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<BRODIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well once they made She's All That, everything went to hell. So you're saying you haven't gotten a cut of the movie? Didn't Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards used to pay you likeness rights for the comic book?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODIE>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We haven't seen a fucking dime for no movie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<BRODIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well boys, I'm no lawyer, but I think Holden and Banky owe you some of the proverbial phat cash. I mean they're making a movie based on characters that are based on you and Quiet Robert.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODIE>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It ain't me and Quiet Robert. It's a pair of stupid-ass superheroes that run around saying "Snitchy-Nitchies" or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<BRODIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe it "Snootchie Boochies." Regardless--you're getting screwed. If I was you guys, I'd confront Holden McNeil and ask him for my movie check.

(reading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Bluntman and Chronic is the worst comic I ever read. Jay and Silent Bob are stupid characters. A couple of stoners who spout dumb-ass catchphrases like a third-rate Cheech and Chong or Bill and Ted. Fuck Jay and Silent Bob. Fuck them up their stupid asses."

</HOLDEN>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the fuck said that shit?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<HOLDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A guy who calls himself "Magnolia- Fan." Check out what the guy after him said: "Jay and Silent Bob are terrible, one-note jokes that only stoners laugh at. They're fucking clown shoes. If they were real, I'd beat the shit out of them for being so stupid. I can't believe Miramax would have anything to so with this shit. I, for one, will be boycotting this movie. Who's with me?"
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna kill all these fucks--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<HOLDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, let it go. Number one, they're a bunch of jealous little dicks who use the anonymity of the Net to insult people who're doing what they wish they were doing, and number two, they're not really talking about you guys--they talking about Bluntman and Chronic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLDEN>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But they said Jay and Silent Bob! They used our real names. It doesn't matter that there's a comic book version of us and a real version, 'cause nobody knows we're real in real life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<HOLDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLDEN>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah! And all these people who read that shit think the real Jay and Silent Bob are a couple of faggots 'cause of that all these dicks are writing about the comic book Jay and Silent Bob! And maybe one night, me and Lunchbox'll be macking some bitch, and she'll be like "Oooo! I want to suck youse guys dicks off. What's your names?" And I'll be like, "Jay and Silent Bob." And she'll be like, "Oh--I read on the Internet that youse guys were little fucking jerkoffs." And then she goes and sucks two other guys's dicks off instead! Well fuck that! We gotta put a stop to these hateful sonsa- bitches before they ruin our good names!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<HOLDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First off, I don't know how good your names really are. Secondly, there's not much you can do about stopping this bile. The Internet's given everyone in America a voice, and everyone in American has chosen to use that voice to bitch about movies. As long as there's a Bluntman and Chronic movie, the Net-nerds are gonna have something negative to say about it. Jay steams, thinking. Then, a light dawns on him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLDEN>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But wait a second--if there wasn't a Bluntman and Chronic movie, then no one would be saying shit about Jay and Silent Bob, right?
	</DIALOGUE>

<HOLDEN>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<HOLDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, and kiss-off the hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties you're due in the process. Are you fucking retarded? Look, I'm probably not alone in the opinion that this flick is the worst idea since Greedo shooting first. I mean, a Jay and Silent Bob movie? Who would pay to see that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLDEN>
<DIRECTION>
Holden, Jay and Silent Bob pause and look at the camera for a beat. Then--
</DIRECTION>
<HOLDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But since it is happening, you might as well just ignore the idiots on the Internet, go find Banky, and get your "motherfucking movie check." As you so succinctly put it. That's what's important here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLDEN>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Holden McNeil--what's important here is that there's a bunch of motherfuckers we don't even know calling us assholes on the Internet to a bunch of teenagers and guys who can't even get laid. Putting a stop to that is the most important thing we could ever do.

Jay and Bob stand and look at each other, filled with purpose.

</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
Jay slumps into the seat beside Silent Bob.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fucking bored, man. There ain't shit to so on this bus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
Silent Bob mimes jerking off.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I already did that. Twice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
Silent Bob shrugs, looking out the window, Jay looks across the aisle and spots a CHILD IN A HELMET playing a handheld video game. He leans over to him.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yo, Gretzky--lemme get a turn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<CHILD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave me alone, little kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILD>
<DIRECTION>
The Child gives him the finger. Jay goes wide-eyed, turning to Silent Bob.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That fuck called me a little kid and gave me the finger! Go kick his ass!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
Silent Bob offers an incredulous look, as if to say, "He's ten years old."
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're my muscle, ain'tcha?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
Silent Bob kind of nods.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So go open a can of whup-ass on that little fuck, and get me his game!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
Silent Bob sighs and stands. He climbs over Jay into the aisle and stands in front of the child. He looks at him and registers doubt. He looks back to Jay, who waves him on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silent Bob steels himself, looks back to the kid and reaches for his game. The Child emits a high-pitched scream and starts punching himself in the head. Silent Bob dives back into his seat, trying to look nonchalant. The Child stops crying. Jay looks at Silent Bob.

The Bus Driver bangs on the bathroom door and shouts.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>

<DIRECTION>
No answer. The Bus Driver bangs on the door harder.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DO YOU HEAR ME?! OPEN THIS DOOR! NOW!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
The door handle turns, the door swings wide, and massive amounts of smoke suddenly billow through the back of the bus. The smoke clears to reveal Jay and Silent Bob squeezed into the bathroom, holding a massive joint.

Jay and Bob look behind them. There's a GUY hitching as well.

The GUY holds out his sign to them. It reads: Will Give Head For Ride.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but what happens when you get in the car, and you don't make with the head? Don't they kick your ass to the curb?

</JAY>
<GUY>

	There's one. On this side of it, we ain't gay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All hitchers do this. Why do you think people pick us up? If you get a ride, it's expected--I don't care who the driver is. It's the first rule in the Book.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What book?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>

A TRUCK starts to pull over to the side of the road. The Guy points to it, as if to say "See?" The passenger-side door opens. The Guy climbs into the truck and closes the door. He looks out the window at Jay and Bob.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Follow the rules of the Book, and you'll get where you're going in no time. Excuse me.

Through the windshield, Jay and Silent Bob see the Guy go face-first into the TRUCK DRIVER'S lap. The Truck Drivers smiles, and the truck takes off, roaring down the road.

Jay and Bob look at the gang, then take a hit off their joint and look back.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
Silent Bob starts typing as Jay dictates.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All you motherfuckers are gonna pay. You are the ones who are the ball- lickers. We're gonna fuck your mothers whole you watch and cry like little bitches. Once we get to Hollywood and find those Miramax fucks who are making the movie, we're gonna make 'em eat our shit, then shit our shit, then eat their shit which is made of our shit that we made 'em eat. Then all you motherfuckers are next. Love, Jay and Silent Bob.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
Silent Bob finishes typing and presses "Return". He and Jay nod at each other, then head over to the counter line, looking up at the menu board.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That'll fucking show 'em. Now we eat our Egga-Mooby-Muffins, then get back on the road, get to Hollywood, and stop that fucking movie from getting made. No more hairy-bush nuns, no more dogs. We keep our eye on the prize, and not let nothing-- and I mean NOTHING--distract me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
As Jay finishes speaking, he looks to the O.C. doors and freezes. A gorgeous GIRL walks through the front doors, all in SLO-MO to the tune of Prince's The Most Beautiful Girl in the World. She's bathed in light, glowing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She bats her eyelashes, gliding toward us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jay is mouth-agape wide eyed. Silent Bob looks at him, then at the O.C.Girl. He slowly waves his hand in front of Jay's eyes, getting zero response.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Girl smiles at us. His POV goes from her face, down to her breasts, then down to her crotch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jay moves past Silent Bob and meets the Girl in the middle of the floor. He embraces her and lands a long, sweet kiss on her mouth. After a beat, he starts fumbling like a teenager to get to second base under her shirt, totally incongruous with the music. The Girl kindly tries to deter him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But it's just a fantasy. Jay's still standing there next to Silent Bob, but he is sporting a huge BONER. Silent Bob rolls his eyes. He grabs a soda cup off the counter and sticks it over Jay's boner, just as the Girl joins them in line. She smiles at the zombified Jay.
</DIRECTION>

Jay and Bob look past Justice to see a VAN with three other gorgeous GIRLS stretching outside of it, throwing their hair around, looking incredibly sexy.

Without looking at Silent Bob, Jay quietly says to him--

The three Girls stand at the end of a large hallway. At the other end is a glass case, full of DIAMONDS.

Sissy pulls and aerosol can from her utility belt and sprays the air in the hallway. She watches the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly at the sound of the spray. Suddenly, within the mist, laser beams become apparent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sissy hands the decibel monitor to Chrissy and takes a few steps back, shaking her hands to limber up. She then runs forward and does an impressive series of flips down the hallway, not touching a single laser beam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once Sissy's flipping comes to a stop at the other end of the hallway near the Diamond case, she makes a hand gesture to Justice. Justice nods, and proceeds to do the same series of flips down the hallway, not tripping the alarm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.

Justice lands beside Sissy, and then Sissy gestures to Chrissy.

Chrissy tosses the decibel monitor over the laser beams, Sissy catches it, and the monitor rises only slightly.

<DIRECTION>
Then, Chrissy proceeds with her series of flips, which are even more impressive than the other two, including running up walls and pushing into handstand flips. When she passes the last laser beam, she lands between Sissy and Justice, arms in the air like a gymnast. Then, she lets out a loud, manly FART.

Willenholly emerges from the bathroom, holding the magazine. There's a massive wet spot on the front of his pants.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLENHOLLY>

The Deputy looks at the stain on Willenholly's pants, then at Willenholly.

EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--DAY

There are FIRE TRUCKS all over the place now. The burned out van is being poured over by Cops. Just then, Willenholly pulls up on a MOPED. He parks it and surveys the wreckage.

	My, oh my, oh my. Who let the cats out?

Willenholly rips down the Velcro patch on his jacket, revealing a badge.

	Federal Wildlife Marshal. This investigation is now under my jurisdiction.

<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh really? And why is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_1>
<WILLENHOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because someone let a whole mess of animals out of their cages, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLENHOLLY>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we believe that was just a diversionary tactic used to call attention away from the real heist over here at the Diamond Exchange.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_1>
<WILLENHOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, right. That's a believable scenario. It sounds more like something out of a bad movie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLENHOLLY>

Willenholly and the Cop look at the camera. Then, another COP joins them.
</DIRECTION>
<COP_2>

	Sir, the Provasik people say they've rounded all their animals up, except for one: an orangutan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_2>
<WILLENHOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen up, ladies and gentlemen! Our fugitive has been on the run for 6 hours! Average simian foot speed over uneven ground--barring injuries or preoccupation with tire tubes, mites or bananas--is four miles an hour. That gives us a radius of twenty miles.

(doing the math in his head)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Yes, you're right. My bad. Twenty- four miles. Now what I want out of all of you is a hard target search.

<COP_4>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_4>
<WILLENHOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLENHOLLY>
<COP_4>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does that mean, exactly--a "hard target search"? What's a "hard target"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_4>
<WILLENHOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. It's--a target--that's--hard. Anyway--
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLENHOLLY>
<COP_4>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So are you referring to the search's level of difficulty? Or is the hard target the monkey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_4>
<COP_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or the people who stole the monkey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_3>
<DIRECTION>
The COPS now chatter amongst themselves, to the effect of "Yeah--It could mean that too--He's got a point--,"etc. Willenholly rubs his temples.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLENHOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, how about this? What I want out of all of you is a thorough search of every gas station, residence, warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, outhouse, and doghouse in that area! Checkpoints go up at fifteen miles!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLENHOLLY>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wouldn't it make sense to put them up at every twenty-four miles--seeing as that's how far they'd have gotten in the last six hours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_1>
<DIRECTION>
They begin chattering amongst themselves again. Willenholly looks at them all, defeated. He starts to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLENHOLLY>

<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that fucking thing waving at us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
Suzanne nods. Jay steps out from behind Bob. They state at the ape.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit? That monkey understood us! Maybe it's some sort of super- monkey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
Suzanne offer them a "raspberry." Spitting as if the comment was ridiculous. Jay and Silent Bob react with surprise at this.

<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck was that for? It's not a stupid idea! I seen it in Congo?

	You're my bitch. You get my back. Don't go joining this chimp's side.

We PAN over from a chimp in a chemist's coat measuring liquids in a pair of beakers to a chimp at a drafting table sketching blueprints for an insidious war machine. An orangutan shakes hands with a group of five well-dressed men, one of which looks like the Cigarette Smoking Man from the X-Files.

	You'll have to be faster than Walt Flanagan's Dog to outrun the warrior gorillas, who hunt humans for sport, profit, and the occasional inter- species blow-job. And if you don't wind up with a monkey hog in your mouth, you'll be captured, killed or worse...

</JAY>
<WILLENHOLLY>

</JAY_CHRONIC>
<DIRECTION>
Cock-Knocker slams one of his huge fists into Jay's balls. Jay drops to his knees, wailing. Cock-Knocker then pulls a vibrator-looking device from his cape. He presses a button on it and a laser beam rises out of the vibrator, like a light saber.

Silent Bob quickly looks right, then left. His eyes fall on--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wall of armaments, on which hands a SILVER BONG, under the placard: BONG SABER--EXTREMELY EXPERIMENTAL. DO NOT USE. It's out of his reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silent Bob closes his eyes, concentrating. He reached his hand out to the Bong Saber, attempting the Jedi Mind Trick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the Bong snaps from the armory into Bob's grip. The Bong Saber blasts to life and Bob strikes a defensive pose. Bob rushes the astonished Cock-Knocker and the pair start light saber dueling.

Cock-Knocker battles Bob back. He vogues some impressive blade handling, prompting Bob to make a run for it--up the ladder of the Bong Reactor and over Cock-Knocker's head. He lands behind Cock-Knocker, striking another pose. Cock- Knocker then high- kicks Bob in the face, knocking him on his ass across the floor. Cock-Knocker rushers over to deliver a saber kill-shot, when we hear--

Willenholly goes wide-eyed.

<DIRECTION>
It's not Bluntcave. We're on a different soundstage, where a kid's movie's being shot: Mooby's Grand Adventure. There's a Barney-sized MOOBY surrounded by little KIDS. The Kids stare back at Willenholly terrified. The Mooby suit has smoking bullet holes in it. Mooby collapses.

Justice pulls the bag of diamonds from her jacket, revealing them.

Jay and Silent Bob hurl themselves over the Bluntmobile.

Missy and Chrissy flip over a lavish, exquisitely-packed craft service table labeled. CAST. They pop back up and start firing at Willenholly. Willenholly leaps behind a barren craft service table that holds a bag of Smarties and a dented can of RC Cola. He pops up and returns fire. When both are out of bullets, they drop back down behind the table and reload. From behind his table,

Justice rushes Sissy and instead of sleek kung fu, they launch into a down-and-dirty, girl's cat-fight; hair pulling and screaming.

Behind the Bluntmobile, Jay and Bob watch all the action.

<DIRECTION>
(to Banky)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had a deal with you on the comics for likeness rights. And as we're not only the artistic basis but also the character basis for your intellectual property, Bluntman and Chronic, when we said property was optioned by Miramax Films you were legally obliged to secure our permission to transfer the concept to another medium. As you failed to do that, you're in breach of the original contract--ergo, you find yourself in a very actionable position.

Banky stares at Bob, even more agog, joined by Jay. After a beat, Jay adds--

Justice now has the advantage over Sissy, holding her head and kicking her in the face, repeatedly, screaming.

<BANKY>

	So, what do you guys want, to go away and take your lady friends with you?

<JAY>

	Shitcan this movie so we don't get called names on the Internet anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<BANKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even if there's no movie, people are still free to talk shit about you on the Internet. That's what the Internet's for: slandering others anonymously. Stopping the flick isn't going to stop that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANKY>
<DIRECTION>
In the background, we see Justice high-kick Sissy into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>

	Well this isn't fair! We went to Hollywood, I fell in love, we stole a monkey, we got shot at, and got punched in the motherfucking nuts! We ain't leaving empty-handed!

	Well, boys--you're rich in love--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating Jay)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you're in love. And to top that off, you've got your own monkey. What more could two guys from Jersey possibly want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANKY>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All those fucks to stop talking shit about us on the Internet, for starters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<BANKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I keep telling you? There's not much you can do to stop that. Well, short of showing up at all their houses and beating the shit out of them, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANKY>
<DIRECTION>
Jay and Bob suddenly freeze. They look at each other and smile.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Bob)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know--with all that money we're gonna make we can buy a lotta plane tickets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET--DAY

Jay and Bob stand across the street from a house. They check the address on the big ream of paper they're carrying, nod at each other, and cross the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doorbell rings. A MOTHER answers it to see Jay and Silent Bob standing in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>

</MOTHER>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Yes. He's my son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May we talk to him, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
She walks away. After a beat, a fifteen-year-old KID comes to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<JAY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, a while ago. So?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<DIRECTION>
Jay and Bob nod at each other, then grab the KID, pull him outside, and start beating the shit out of him on his front lawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKY--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The passenger jet flies again, this time in the opposite direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jay and Bob knocking at another door. Another MOTHER answers. They speak, she heads inside, and another KID comes to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On Movie Poop Shoot.com. did you say Jay and Silent Bob--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reading off paper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"--are fucking clown shoes. If they were real, I'd beat the shit out of them for being so stupid."

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The marquee reads: JASON BIGGS AND JAMES VAN DER BEEK ARE BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WORLD PREMIERE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front doors open and the CROWD lets out. First we see DANTE and RANDAL.
</DIRECTION>
<RANDAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that was worse then Clash of the Titans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDAL>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I still can't believe Judy Dench played me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<RANDAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey--remind me to renew that restraining order.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDAL>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<RANDAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I'm gonna blast the flick on the Internet tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDAL>
<DIRECTION>
STEVE-DAVE and WALT exit.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVE_DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why can't Hollywood ever make a decent comic book movie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVE_DAVE>
<WALT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell'em Steve-Dave!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALT>
<STEVE_DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you stop saying that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVE_DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
ALYSSA and TRISH come out.
</DIRECTION>
<TRISH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that was just another paean to male adolescence and its refusal to grow up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRISH>
<ALYSSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, sis--but it was better than Mallrats. At least Holden had the good sense to keep his name off of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALYSSA>
<TRISH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why wouldn't Miramax option his other comic instead? You know--the one he drew about you and him and your relationship?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRISH>
<ALYSSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean Chasing Amy? That would never work as a movie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALYSSA>
<DIRECTION>
BANKY and HOOPER exit.
</DIRECTION>
<BANKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so fucking embarrassed--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANKY>
<HOOPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, you should be. They took your characters and reduced them to one ninety-minute-long-gay joke. It was like watching Batman and Robin again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOOPER>
<BANKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. That means a lot coming from the guy who pretends to be Shaft as opposed to the guy who takes shaft.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANKY>
<HOOPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't hear you complaining nightly. In fact, the only thing I do hear you say is "Yes, Hooper! Cradle the balls and work the shaft!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOOPER>
<BANKY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Hey! What'd we say? Not in public!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANKY>
<DIRECTION>
A guy behind them calls out to Banks.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice movie, you fucking Tracer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<BANKY>
<DIRECTION>
(recognizing him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You--!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANKY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, you sonovabitch! I'm back for round two!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Banky grabs the guy by the throat and starts choking him, while Hooper tries to break them up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILLENHOLLY exits with Justice in hand-and leg cuffs and a prison uniform. They're flanked by two ARMED PRISON GUARDS.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLENHOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I don't get out to the movies much. But I'd have to say Bluntman and Chronic was Blunt-tastic!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLENHOLLY>
<JUSTICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are these leg cuffs really necessary?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUSTICE>
<WILLENHOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't make me shoot you, Justice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLENHOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
And finally, Jay and Silent Bob come out.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>

WHIP PAN to Morris day and The Time on stage, performing "The Bird." During the song, Morris points to--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jay and Bob, who are dancing with Suzanne and Justice (who's still in cuffs, flanked by the Guards). Jay looks to Bob, they nod at each other and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jay and Silent Bob, join Morris Day and the TIME onstage, and dance us out to the coda, which reads--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CODA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bluntman and Chronic Strike Back went on to make a mere 2.3 million at the box office. It was the biggest commercial failure in the history of Miramax films. The film was roundly drubbed as a bad idea by the denizens of the Internet chat boards, and over the course of the next year, while they waited for the Quick Stop restraining order to expire, Jay and Silent Bob tracked them all down and beat the shit out of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREDITS. THEN--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NOWHERE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A familiar WOMAN closes a book that's marked: THE VIEW ASKEWNIVERSE. She puts the book down, smiles at us and skips off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
