Natalie closes the door and turns around, only to bump into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE JANITOR!

She gasps. The janitor just looks at her, no expression showing on his face. He just holds his mop.
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>

	Sorry.

<DIRECTION>
She walks past him. He continues to mop as Natalie makes her way through the giant hall to her dorm room.

Tosh and her boyfriend are all over each other, moans of pleasure coming from Tosh. We PAN over to Natalie, lying in her bed, listening to her headphones. But the music does little to block out the sounds of Tosh and her boyfriend. She sighs as the moaning continues.

Professor WILLIAM WEXLER, a nerdish man in his late forties, early fifties, stands in front of a large group of students, discussing urban legends.

Damon. He sighs, bored with the class.

Natalie and Brenda, watching Wexler. Parker sits behind them, eating. Damon sits next to Parker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wexler. He uses a control to activate a slide projector that is stationed at the very back of the large auditorium. The image of a woman sitting on a couch with a phone in her hand appears on the wall behind Wexler. On closer inspection, we see a man standing on the dark steps, a cell phone in hand. It is a very threatening picture.
</DIRECTION>
<WEXLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A baby sitter receives menacing phone calls. And upon investigating them, she realizes that they are originating from an upstairs bedroom, the very room where she's left the children under her care to sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEXLER>

Wexler presses the button and the image changes to a close up of the man.
</DIRECTION>
<WEXLER>

</BRENDA>
<WEXLER>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes, I'm sure it did. I'm sure most of you grew up thinking this happened to girls in, in all your hometowns, but it didn't.

<DIRECTION>
Parker nods his head while Wexler talks.
</DIRECTION>
<WEXLER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Contemporary folklore passed on as a true story. There are variations of this one going back to the 1960's, all of them containing the same cultural admonition: Young women, mind your children well, or harm will come your way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEXLER>
<DIRECTION>
Wexler stops, building up the tension. But then, his watch alarm begins beeping musically. He glances at it.
</DIRECTION>
<WEXLER>
<DIRECTION>
(to class)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Excuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEXLER>
<DIRECTION>
It continues to beep and Brenda laughs. Wexler turns to face her. Natalie is trying to control her laughter, but Brenda is laughing hysterically.
</DIRECTION>
<WEXLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something funny you might care to share with the rest of us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEXLER>
<BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
(through laughs) No, I was just saying, like, the cultural admonition is don't babysit?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The class laughs at this. Wexler doesn't find it funny at all.
</DIRECTION>
<WEXLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you, uh, come up here, and uh, volunteer for my little experiment, hmm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEXLER>
<DAMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that's a great idea.
	</DIALOGUE>

Brenda hesitates, making Wexler angry.

<WEXLER>

	Now, young lady!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEXLER>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
She gets up and starts to walk to the stage. Damon calls after her in a very Austin Powers like voice.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, baby, yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON>
<WEXLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, you'll probably survive.

</WEXLER>
<DIRECTION>
When Brenda gets up on the stage, Wexler tosses her a bag of candy.
</DIRECTION>
<WEXLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had those before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEXLER>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, they're Pop Rocks. They crackle in your mouth.

<DIRECTION>
Natalie, watching intently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brenda and Wexler. Brenda is chewing on the candy, which makes a crackling sound. Wexler picks a coke off his desk and opens it. He holds it out to her.
</DIRECTION>
<WEXLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirsty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEXLER>
<DIRECTION>
Brenda shakes her head and backs away, frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<WEXLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong? Something you might have heard about mixing Pop Rocks and soda?

He picks up the control and hits a button. The picture changes to show a young boy eating cereal.

<DIRECTION>
Brenda and Wexler. He gives Parker a disgusted look.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
He hits a button and the picture changes to an adult man grinning.
</DIRECTION>
<WEXLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if I told you that this is Mikey, alive and well, and working as an ad executive in New York City? Would you drink some then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEXLER>
<DIRECTION>
Brenda looks at the picture, then at Wexler, not knowing if she should do it. She doesn't want her insides to burst. Brenda sighs. From way in the back, Damon stands up and raises his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAMON>
<DIRECTION>
Parker points at Damon as he makes his way up to the stage. Parker leans forward while Natalie's jaw drops, amazed.
</DIRECTION>

Damon walks up to the stage and grabs a bag of Pop Rocks from off the desk. He opens it and pours some into his mouth.

Wexler hands him the coke.

Damon holds the soda up for the class to see, then drinks it. Nothing happens.

Damon looks like he's about to throw up. He puts his arm on Wexler's shoulder for support. Spit begins to come out of his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
Natalie and Parker. They're relived faces turn to horror as they watch Damon suffer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

The student turns and runs.

More colored spit and vomit pour from Damon's mouth. Students begin to stand up, afraid. Natalie has an expression of pure terror on her face. Then, all of a sudden, Damon stops. He doesn't move. His eyes close. All the students expect to see him explode, but then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes open and he grins. Damon looks at Brenda and chuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahh.

Brenda throws the bag of Pop Rocks at Damon. Natalie sighs and Parker throws his hands up, grinning.

Natalie walks over to her bed and sits down. She opens the year book and starts flipping through the pages. She stops when she comes to a picture of the Spirit Squad. We see Natalie standing next to another girl. On closer inspection, we see that it is Michelle Mancini.

Natalie looks over at the other page. There's a closeup of Natalie and Michelle. Under the picture are the words: Team Captains: Michelle Mancini and Natalie Simon. Natalie is quiet, remembering the yells they used to do. The voices of the Spirit Squad can be heard shouting. This is very hard for Natalie. Suddenly, there's a knock at the door and Damon enters.

She gasps and backs up. Paul looks up, but sighs. It's only a parka hanging on a rack. Natalie steps inside, eyeing the parka warily. Inside the closet is a shelf with books, a stuffed fox, along with other creepy things. Natalie's eyes wander down to the ground. She sees an axe resting against a shelf.

The picture changes to show an article from a newspaper. There's a picture of Brenda's boyfriend. The headline reads: "Teen killed in apparent gang initiation." It's the man Natalie and Michelle killed!

Brenda walks over and stands in front of the picture.

She grabs a scalpel off of a tray and whistles. She turns toward Natalie and waves the scalpel in front of her face.

	You do know this one, don't you, Natalie? A guy gets picked up by a woman at a bar. She takes him back to her hotel room. She fixes him a drink. Boom! He's knocked out. When he wakes up, he's in a bathtub full of ice and he realizes that one of his kidneys has been removed! Supposedly they sell them on the black market. I don't think it's ever actually happened, though. Until tonight.

<DIRECTION>
She stabs the scalpel into Natalie's exposed abdomen. Natalie cries out in pain. Her scream is muffled by the gag.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or is that the liver? I was always such a dope in anatomy. Well, who cares, right? First organ I see, I'm just gonna grab it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
She stabs the scalpel back into the first wound she made, and begins slicing Natalie's stomach open. Natalie screams in agony, the pain so excruciating. Suddenly, Reese appears in the doorway, gun held out in front of her.

Reese reaches into her pockets for her handcuffs. Suddenly, a knife appears in Brenda's hand and she screams. She spins around and slashes Reese across the chest. Reese goes down, dropping the gun and handcuffs. Reese falls to the ground. Natalie has gotten her other hand free and begins working on her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brenda screams and jumps down on top of Reese. They struggle, both reaching out for the gun. They roll across the floor, screaming. Natalie has one of her legs free. She works quickly while Reese has Brenda occupied. Reese's hand grazes the butt of the gun, but Brenda jerks it back. She reaches out and grabs it. Before Reese can try and grab it away from her, Brenda shoots her point blank.
