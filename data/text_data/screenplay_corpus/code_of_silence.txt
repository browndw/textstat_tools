Thundering north through the glass canyons of the Loop, the elevated train SCREECHES through the city awakening.

The el train RUMBLES north past the aging tenements of Uptown into the Belmont Avenue Station.

And down below, a garbage truck is slowly working its way up the alley. A garbage man in city overalls WHISTLES to the driver and the truck stops. He rolls a can to the grinding jaw as the driver sits, tense and alert, scanning the street.
</DIRECTION>

There's something odd about this driver. And the garbage man too, for that matter.

The room is small and bare. A selling den. VICTOR COMACHO and TWO COUSINS, all young and vicious, are sitting around a formica table with the two buyers, Doc and Spider. The Comachos are heavily armed. There is plenty of tension all around, but Doc seems a little more nervous than the rest.

Eddie appears at the front of the hall, gun drawn. He sees the boy on the hallway floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches cautiously, taking in the body, the gun, Cragie sitting against the wall, and the distraught Kosalas who stands transfixed by the dead kid. Eddie goes to Kosalas.

Several ferocious looking Comacho relatives have been allowed inside the police lines. One of them steps close to Victor.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kosalas is shakey. Cragie is tries to calm him down.
</DIRECTION>
<CRAGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, it's no big thing, Kid. A friggin' dog and pony show. Some dumb ass questions by dumb ass bureaucrats. "When's the last time you were at the range?" Crap like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAGIE>
<KOSALAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. It was a fuckin' accident. Why can't you just be --

</DIRECTION>
<DONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw man, don't do that. You know how much these things cost?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONATO>
<DIRECTION>
He gasps as they draw the boot off. Donato grabs for Eddie's hand, and squeezes against the pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie. Scam this. A bait shop. Worms, minnows. Don't even need real worms. Storage problem. Got those rubber ones, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONATO>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, what about the winter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>

Someone points Eddie out to Partida, an attractive, no- nonsense woman, who heads for him. Donato sees Partida coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, fuck, Partida. I'm gonna tell her you shot me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONATO>
<DIRECTION>
The resentment the other cops feel against Partida is readily apparent.

<DONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OW! A goddamn Dr. Jekyll!

Eddie smiles at Donato, who with his good foot, kicks at the medic bandaging the wound.

</PARTIDA>

	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>

As Partida heads for the building, another suited civilian comes over to meet her. The civilian escorts a Mexican grandmother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The old lady is agitated, jabbering in Spanish and pointing at the cops.

Efren stares ahead. Music looks at Eddie who is fiddling with the Rubic's Cube, to little success.

	</DIALOGUE>
</POMPAS>
<BRENNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna tune-up? Hey Sarge, you know why a Comacho's like a cue-ball? Cause the harder you hit 'em, the better their English gets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENNAN>
<DIRECTION>
It's not a joke, but a threat. Pompas spits at Brennan. Brennan is enraged, but Eddie pushes him back with a hand.
</DIRECTION>

<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

<SANCHEZ>

	Let's cut the shit, Cusack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie ignores him.
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Option 1: you can send em downtown. If Judge Collins didn't get laid last night, you can probably get him to arraign my clients for loitering in their own hallway. He'll set bail. I'll take care of it. Option 2: release them here and now and we'll call it a day.
	</DIALOGUE>

Kosalas, without an attorney, is being interviewed by Partida. A court stenographer is silently typing.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie and Kosalas are parked on an airport access road, watching private planes land and take off. Eddie's car, a five-year old Chevy, is wreckage. The quarter panels are rusted, the radio antenna is a coathanger, and when Kosalas pushes a tape into the cassette player, the windshield wipers start moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kosalas pops the cassette out, the windshield wipers stop; he throws the cassette into the glove compartment. But now he can't get the door to stay closed.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>

The white Learjet taxis to a halt at the far end of the field as an undistinguished Buick rolls down the ramp to meet it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie and Kosalas stand by their car, parked across the runway from the Learjet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The jet's engines shut down, the door opens, and a grim but handsome man emerges. LUIS COMACHO, a cruel and uncompromising survivor, has arrived. With him is an incredibly beautiful exotic woman.
</DIRECTION>

He is met by Pompas and Efren Comacho, the two lookouts who survived the raid. And Victor Comacho, who was wounded in the raid, is here with his shoulder bandaged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>

From where Eddie and Kosalas are standing it is impossible to hear the conversation at the Learjet, but it is clear that Luis Comacho is upset. They see Luis slap Pompas and Efren. Then he grabs Victor by both arms, ignoring his wound, and screams at him.

EXT. SOLDIER FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The machine in question looks like a miniature tank. This is the "Prowler," a robot anti-terrorist vehicle that is being maneuvered around various obstacles in a demonstration for the city's law enforcement agencies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "Prowler" is amazingly agile. And its BULLHORN VOICE breaks everybody up.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(from speaker)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arretez! Halten Zie! Stop! Do not move! No se mueve!...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The machine's three video eyes, searching the crowd independently, give it the appearance of an extra-industrial bug. One camera is mounted on a telescoping mast which extends to give it the perspective of a giraffe. The thing seems almost alive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Commander Kates is here, leading a contingent of departmental brass. With them are several dozen officers and a gaggle of city councilmen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Prowler is being put through its paces by the FACTORY ENGINEER. He controls the machine with a pistol-grip device that looks like a small TV camera.
</DIRECTION>
<ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...After the gyros are locked, any movement of the hand controller is duplicated by the 'Prowler.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
He turns his hand to the right and the Prowler, 50 yards away, sweeps its turret to the right, aiming the twin 30 calibre machineguns at the politicians. They move aside.
</DIRECTION>
<ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This simple control system means that even semi-skilled employees can operate the unit with a minimum of training. As they say, "Even a child can operate it."
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
Standing with Chief Kates, Eddie watches the demonstration with contempt. Kates turns to him.
</DIRECTION>
<KATES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's talking about you, Cusack. Pay attention. You're all gonna have to be qualified on this. It's the future.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATES>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just what the world needs, another gun without a brain.

<EDDIE>

Kates is about to say something when the demonstrator interrupts.
</DIRECTION>
<ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If the Commander will pick someone to try and elude 'Prowler,' we can show how our various target acquisition systems function.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
Kates points to Eddie, and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly the turret sweeps the horizon and locks on Eddie as he walks across the astro turf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP of the Prowler's hand controller.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MONITOR SCREEN shows the crosshairs on the back of Eddie's head. ON THE SCREEN the digital readout says: LOCKED AND TRACKING.

<DIRECTION>
Eddie keeps walking, seemingly oblivious to the Prowler. Suddenly he whirls and ducks behind a wall out of the Prowler's sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pops up with his gun pointed at the Prowler's controller.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
The controller, scared shitless, drops the hand control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Prowler dies -- the plug pulled.

Eddie smiles at Kates, and exits.

	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the cop.

</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Comachos slow down. The two groups survey each other -- Luis, hatred oozing from his eyes. And Eddie, without slowing, looks the vicious Colombian over with cool contempt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie walks by.
</DIRECTION>
<LUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much did they pay you to set up my brothers, Pig.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie freezes, makes a slow turn, and meets Luis' eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Eddie moves, faster than anyone else can react to, and he has Luis pinned to the wall, choking him.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay off my streets, asshole. Or I'll bite your head off, and shit in your neck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He releases Luis just as quickly, and turns to walk out, Kosalas backing with him, hand on gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luis gets some air back, and starts to scream.

Hysterical citizens scatter in all directions. A woman stands in horror unable to keep from looking at Gamiani's body lying on the sidewalk. She SCREAMS.

The green flourescents of the "Emerald City" give a deathly cast to the underground street as Diana rounds the corner, and collapses against the wall. Her heart pounding like a frightened deer, she has run as far as she can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pompas Comacho and two of his colleagues come racing around the corner. They spot her crouched against the wall.

A group laughs at the story. There is a stillness at the front door. One of the hoods from outside steps in. He wears a leather coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The heads at the bar turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks the length of the bar and enters the john. He is obviously out of place in this saloon. Nobody has both hands on the bar.

Eddie shakes his head and walks to the back of the room where Kosalas sits hunched over a drink, the only man in the room not laughing. He looks up whens Eddie pulls over a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<KOSALAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beer?

	<DIALOGUE>
	And the chance to do it again. Next time he might take away a cop. That make any difference?

He pulls out his gun. The remaining innocent bystanders split for the exit. Eddie walks forward into the room. The Comachos and their soldiers stand around him. Several have guns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie keeps them under the point of his gun. He gets to the door and has to turn his back on it to keep the gang in his sights.

They drag him to the top of the rear stairs, and kick him down to the alley.
</DIRECTION>

It seems like they are about to finish him off when suddenly all is quiet. The crowd parts. Eddie looks up through swollen eyes to see Luis Comacho standing above him, cool as ice. Luis reaches down and pulls Eddie's head up by the ear.

Eddie's eyes search the harbour as he maneuvers slowly alongside a rusting freighter. He stops and gets out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie opens the rear of the truck and lowers a ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we go partner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up his gun and a duffle bag from the cab and heads out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Comachos are ready and waiting. Luis walks through the middle of the vast empty plant toward the front, checking on his troops one last time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Against the grotesque shapes of the surrounding scrapyards, Eddie moves quickly from one concealment to the next, crouched low, advancing on the abandoned factory at the end of the dock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lays down his duffle and pulls out a Halliburton case. He opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From inside the garbage truck WE HEAR an ENGINE STARTING. It REVS a couple of times. And from within the container compartment of the truck emerges the Prowler. It clatters down the ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lookout spots the Prowler moving down the dock. He can't believe his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sights on the machine and FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And in the distance, the Prowler senses the insult and immediately turns its camera eye up to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lookout FIRES again. Immediately, the turret swivels and the twin MACHINEGUNS ROAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a long way down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUND of MACHINEGUN FIRE from outside galvanizes the Comachos. Luis runs through the long building toward the front with half a dozen of his men, all SHOUTING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddies eyes watch the miniature monitor of the Prowler's hand controller. On the monitor WE CAN SEE the Comachos running out in the front of the factory from the camera on top of the Prowler.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie gets up and moves toward the factory. He looks up at several high broken windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Prowler is having a field day. It's electronic sensors trace the source of every hostile shot and immediately return a withering stream of hot lead that chews the surrounding scenery -- and several Comachos -- to pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Eddie has not figured out how to control the Prowler's BULLHORN VOICE command system. It continues to BARK ORDERS to the dead hoodlums in three languages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luis runs through the empty plant toward the office screaming to Diana's guards.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Diana, tied to the chair, is momentarily alone as the guards rush out to the floor of the factory to see what's happening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two guards, their guns flying from their hands, are hammered back into the room by Eddie who blasts through the door after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Diana is petrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SQUAD CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kosalas and Kates are in the same car. Kosalas is driving.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</KATES>
<DIRECTION>
Kosalas spins the wheel into a U-turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "Prowler" rolls around the corner, its brutal turret bristling with firepower. It is driving Luis and the other stupefied Comachos further back into the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie guides his deadly partner with the hand controller.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Comachos dive for cover and spray the miniature tank with AUTOMATIC FIRE. But they are no match. Two continuous streams of hot lead chew up the place, splintering the loading dock and the catwalk hiding places and disintegrating the structure, churning the Comachos to hamburger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COMACHO SHOT RINGS OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie goes down and the Prowler hand controller falls to the ground, shattered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Prowler goes berserk, SPRAYING DEATH in a 360 degree circle until all the ammo is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then SILENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie touches the blood on the side of his leg. It's not serious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It appears everyone is out of ammunition. But a few Comachos are still hidden in the factory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie is after them like a tiger. Victor, shoulder still bandaged, never has a chance. He goes down, battered and broken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Luis has crept up behind Eddie. He jumps over a steel plate. He's going for Diana, a long knife in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie reaches for a reload. Puts it in his magnum. Aims, and blows Luis away just as he reaches for Diana.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the littered battlefield, Eddie escorts Diana toward the light streaming through the factory entrance. He takes off his jacket and wraps it around Diana's shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pier is crawling with cops with more arriving every second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fire boat is extinguishing the blaze set by the Prowler's incendiary ammunition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bodies of the Comachos lying everywhere astound the arriving "Home Team."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Officer Kosalas screeches to a halt and jumps from his car. Brennan and Music are running down the dock. Donato, a cast on his leg, hobbles after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emergency vehicles are arriving, and more squad cars, paddy wagons, and fire engines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie walks by the cops toward an ambulance, now carrying Diana. Kates calls out after him.
</DIRECTION>
<KATES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Cusack!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATES>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie stops, slowly turns around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a long pause.
</DIRECTION>
<KATES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you don't follow orders.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATES>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie hands Diana over to the waiting medics, who put her in the ambulance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pull back further and further until we see the rest of the Home Team. The ambulance, carrying Diana, pulls away with it's lights flashing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie walks down the pier alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
