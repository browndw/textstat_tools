A PROLOGUE APPEARS on a black screen:

<DIRECTION>
"This film is an attempt to understand the truth of Richard Nixon, thirty-seventh president of the United States. It is based on numerous public sources and on an incomplete historical record.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In consideration of length, events and characters have been condensed, and some scenes among protagonists have been conjectured."

On a portable screen we read the famous words from Matthew: "What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?" This FADES into:

Seven men in shirts and ties are seated around a table in a darkened room. They are smoking Cuban cigars, idly watching the film.

TITLE: "JUNE 17, 1972." Then: "THE WATERGATE HOTEL"

A BUSBOY yawns as he clears away the remains of dinner. A WAITER starts pouring Margaritas from a pitcher.

The moment the door closes behind them, GORDON LIDDY is on his feet, locking the door. OTHER MEN are visible, putting on jackets, securing technical equipment from briefcases and bags. They are: FRANK STURGIS, BERNARD BARKER, EUGENIO MARTINEZ, VIRGILIO GONZALES, and JAMES MCCORD.

EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT (1973)

TITLES RUN - A raw November night. We are looking through the black iron bars of the fence towards the facade of the Executive Mansion. A LIGHT is on in a second floor room.

We move towards it through the bars, across the lawn. Dead leaves blow past. A SUBTITLE READS: "NOVEMBER 1973"

A black LIMOUSINE slides up to the White House West Wing. An armed GUARD with a black DOBERMAN approaches.

The window opens slightly. The Guard peers in. Then, he opens the door.

GENERAL ALEXANDER HAIG gets out, walks up the steps. He carries a manila envelope. As he enters the White House, we hear an AUDIO MONTAGE of NEWS REPORTERS from the previous year. The VOICES fade in and out, overlap.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - LINCOLN SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The room is small, austere, dominated by a portrait of LINCOLN over the fireplace. HAIG stands in the doorway, holding the envelope.

<HAIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are the tapes you requested, Mr. President.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAIG>
<DIRECTION>
RICHARD NIXON is in shadow, silhouetted by the fire in the hearth. The air-conditioning is going full blast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Haig crosses the room, opens the envelope, takes out a reel of tape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nixon sits in a small armchair in a corner. A Uher tape recorder and a headset are on an end table at his elbow. Next to it is a large tumbler of Scotch.
</DIRECTION>

Haig hands the envelope containing the tapes to Nixon.

<HAIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAIG>
<DIRECTION>
Nixon gestures awkwardly. Haig turns on the lamp. For the first time we can see Nixon's face: he hasn't slept in days, dark circles, sagging jowls, five-o'-clock shadow. He hates the light, slurs a strange growl -- the effect of sleeping pills.

	Not like the others -- Dean, McCord, the rest ... We never got our side of the story out, Al. People've forgotten. I mean: "Fuck you, Mr. President, fuck you Tricia, fuck you Julie!" and all that shit, just words, but what violence! The tear gassing, the riots, burning the draft cards, Black Panthers -- we fixed it, Al, and they hate me for it -- the double dealing bastards. They lionize that traitor, Ellsberg, for stealing secrets, but they jump all over me 'cause it's Nixon.

</HAIG>
<DIRECTION>
Nixon looks at him, moved by his concern.
</DIRECTION>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was never the buddy-buddy type, Al. You know, "Oh I couldn't sleep last night, I was thinking of my mother who beat me" -- all that kind of crap, you know the psychoanalysis bag ... My mother ... The more I'd spill my guts, the more they'd hate me. I'd be what ... pathetic! If I'd bugged out of Vietnam when they wanted, do you think Watergate would've ever happened? You think the Establishment would've given a shit about a third-rate burglary? But did I? Quit? Did I pull out?

He stares, waits.

He suddenly tires of talking, rubs his hands over his face.

INT. EXEC OFFICE BLDG - NIXON OFFICE - DAY (1972)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUBTITLE READS: "JUNE 1972."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nixon's hideaway office in the Executive Office Building. BOB HALDEMAN, his crew-cut, hard-edged chief of staff, sits across the desk, a folder open on his lap. Nixon, at his desk, seems a healthier man than in the previous scene. Also there are JOHN EHRLICHMAN, portly domestic advisor, and JOHN DEAN, blond, gentrified, legal counsel.
</DIRECTION>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But O'Brien doesn't even use that office. The Democrats've moved to Miami. There's nothing there!

	It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.

<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Their fourth!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<HALDEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.

	Jesus! Did Mitchell know?

<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus! Through a window?

	It was her wrist. And it was through a plate-glass door.

	Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue. Maybe she'll stay this time.

A beat.

<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention. If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary! Was he smoking pot?

	The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect. He turns out to be ex-CIA.

<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Ex-CIA"? There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment. Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?

<EHRLICHMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	McCord? ...

	That fruitcake! What about him?

</NIXON>
<HALDEMAN>

	Well, you know, sir, he's a nut. He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper. You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen? He wanted to buy a damned fire truck! Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.

<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's Liddy got?
	</DIALOGUE>

	... But it'll just be a campaign finance violation ...

</ROCKEFELLER>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it. I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.

SPOTLIGHT on a sexy Studebaker car of the era. A DRUM ROLL, and suddenly out of the various apertures of the car pop six half-naked HOSTESSES doing the twist. Wild cheers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ANNOUNCER describes the new gimmicks on the car (AD LIB) as we swing to reveal NIXON, looking uncomfortable in a Stetson cowboy hat shaking hands with AUTOGRAPH SEEKERS and car buffs, posing for cheese-cake photographs. A banner behind him reveals: "Dallas Welcomes Studebaker Dealers."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Studebaker GIRLS are fanning out through the sales booths, whistling, swinging whips, as a large man in a Stetson, JACK JONES, accompanied by a suave-looking Cuban born businessman, TRINI CARDOZA, breaks through the autograph hounds to rescue Nixon.

EXT. JONES RANCH - DAY

<DIRECTION>
An entire LONGHORN STEER turns on a spit in a large barbecue pit, basted by black SERVANTS. We see a sprawling Spanish-style RANCH HOUSE in the countryside. The parking area looks like a Cadillac dealership. The CROWD is a mixture of CORPORATE EXECUTIVES, CUBANS, and COWBOY-TYPES, some WIVES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRINI is talking to TWO of the DANCERS, nodding his head in NIXON'S direction. They look, and smile at him.

Across the lawn, Nixon smiles back awkwardly as JACK JONES nudges him. They both eat steaks and corncobs.

INT. JONES RANCH - DAY

A walk-in stone fireplace dominates the room; the heavy beams hung with black wrought-iron candelabras. Thick cigar smoke impregnates the air; the crowd has substantially thinned to the heaviest hitters. The MEN, now in shirt-sleeves, drink from bottles of bourbon.

A man -- MITCH -- emerges from one of the side rooms with a DANCER.

Off to the side in a semi-private alcove, SANDY, the dancer, tries to make conversation, but NIXON is showing her pictures of his kids.

NIXON shares a look with TRINI.

All the Great Society activists are lying out there in wait, poised to get you if you try to come after them: the professional welfareists, the urban planners, the day-carers, the public housers. The costly current welfare system is a mess, and we are on the brink of a revolt of the lower middle class. The bottom line is -- no work, no welfare. Our opponents have exaggerated and over-emphasized society as the cause of crimes. The war on poverty is not a war on crime, and it is no substitute for a war on crime.

We simply have to face the hard fact that the law cannot go beyond what people are willing to support. This was true as far as Prohibition was concerned. It is far more true with regard to education and housing ... Yet those of us in public service know -- we can have full prosperity in peace time ... Yes, we can cut the defense budget. We can reduce conventional forces in Europe. We can restore the national environment. We can improve health care and make it available more fairly to all people.

INT. OPERATIONS CENTER & HELM'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They walk past ANALYSTS laboring in isolation behind Plexiglass walls; the hum of computers, a dark austerity to the place. They all glance up as NIXON strides past.
</DIRECTION>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's the job coming, Bob?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<CUSHMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frankly, sir, it stinks. I have no access. I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUSHMAN>
<NIXON>

<CUSHMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(sensing change)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's nervous, sir. He's heard you're looking for a new director.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUSHMAN>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<CUSHMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Helms. He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.

	Yeah? Well, I own the fucking casino.

INT. HELMS OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DUTY OFFICER opens the door of the director's office with a flourish. NIXON catches RICHARD HELMS throwing his trench coat and tennis racket on a chair, obviously hurrying in from a secret door. Helms spots Nixon, extends his hand with a reptilian smile.
</DIRECTION>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My friends call me "Mister President."
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so shall I.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Cushman)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arrange some coffee, would you General Cushman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<DIRECTION>
Cushman stares back a beat, bitterly. Nixon signals to Haldeman and Ehrlichman that he, too, wants to be alone. The door closes.
</DIRECTION>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President. You did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<DIRECTION>
Nixon paces the office, which is festooned with photos, awards and an abundance of flowers, particularly orchids. A collector.
</DIRECTION>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You live pretty well out here. Now I understand why you want to keep your budget classified.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<DIRECTION>
Helms sits on a settee, a hard-to-read man.
</DIRECTION>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're correct. I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not. The FBI is worthless in this area. I want your full concentration on this matter ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<NIXON>
<DIRECTION>
(stern)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then find something. And I want these leaks stopped. Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Screw congressional oversight. I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know. Pay close attention to this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<DIRECTION>
Nixon fixes him with his stare. Helms clears his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers. Things I signed as Vice President. I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<DIRECTION>
Now knowing Nixon's cards, Helms relaxes -- about an inch.
</DIRECTION>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<DIRECTION>
Helms wanders over to his prize orchids, fingers them.
</DIRECTION>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you know ... that was unique. Not an operation as much as ... an organic phenomenon. It grew, it changed shape, it developed ... insatiable, devouring appetites.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not uncommon in such cases that things are not committed to paper. That could be very ... embarrassing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<DIRECTION>
Nixon is embarrassed, and does not like it. Suddenly, the Beast is in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<HELMS>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (reminding him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I, for one, saw to it that my name was never connected to any of those operations.

</HELMS>
<DIRECTION>
On Nixon, waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<HELMS>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (fishing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Diem? Trujillo? Lumumba? Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, Dick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<NIXON>
<DIRECTION>
(very uncomfortable)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others. All of them ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. This is the fastball. Helms pours himself a coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces. You could do the same ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not Jack Kennedy. Your agency is secure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<HELMS>
<DIRECTION>
(stirs the coffee)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not if I give you all the cards ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia. That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<HELMS>
<DIRECTION>
(sips his coffee)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Current levels may not be sufficient.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<DIRECTION>
Helms smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And me? ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good. Of course you'll continue as DCI. You're doing a magnificent job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And of course I accept. I'm flattered. And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. And you will give General Cushman full access.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<HELMS>
<DIRECTION>
(grudgingly accepts that)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Castro.
	</DIALOGUE>

(tense)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think we can treat this as a formality. Mr. Kennedy made a verbal promise to the Russians not to invade Cuba. But you authorized Dr. Kissinger to put this in writing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<DIRECTION>
Nixon is taken aback by Helms's inside knowledge.
</DIRECTION>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you tapping Kissinger?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<NIXON>
<DIRECTION>
(cold)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is not my practice to spy on the president. Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<NIXON>
<DIRECTION>
(absorbs this)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CIA policy? The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms. Except what I dictate to you ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat, they stare at each other)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Nixon stares.
</DIRECTION>
<HELMS>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President. Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cuba would be a small price to pay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So President Kennedy thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<DIRECTION>
A disturbing image suddenly appears in Nixon's mind -- KENNEDY with his head blown off in Dallas. Followed by an IMAGE of his own death. In a coffin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The smell of the orchids in the room is overwhelming. Nixon feels himself dizzy.
</DIRECTION>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency. But I would never, never consider ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His death was awful, an awful thing for this country.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality. Do you appreciate flowers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELMS>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. They make me sick. They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young. But let me tell you, there are worse things than death. There is such a thing as evil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats? "The Second Coming"?

	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

<HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Black Irishman. Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.

NIXON gets out of the front of the presidential LIMOUSINE. MANOLO follows.

Nixon looks up: a surreal scene. The Lincoln Memorial has been turned into a pagan temple. FIRES burn on the broad marble steps, half-naked KIDS sleep on filthy blankets below the immense columns. Hendrix plays faintly on a portable radio. Nixon starts up the steps, picking his way among the sleeping forms.

He passes a GIRL, tripping, eyes closed, twirling a long scarf over her head. He stares at her, steps on a sleeping bag.

Nixon reaches the top of the monument. Taped to one of the pillars is a poster. Nixon scowling, and the motto "Would You Buy A Used Car From This Man?"

Nixon peers at it, moves inside. He looks up at LINCOLN in the eerie firelight. Banners with peace signs have been draped over his shoulders, bunches of flowers between his fingers.

	That man up there lived in similar times. He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray. You know, the liberals act like idealism belongs to them, but it's not true. My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves. My grandmother was an abolitionist. It was Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown, to abolish slavery. They were conservative Bible folk, but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... Forty years ago I was looking, as you are now, for answers.

On Nixon listening behind his desk, hands cupped over his mouth, frown across his face -- the classic Nixon image of a deep thinker. The CAMERA drops across his desk. And moves towards a MIKE drilled in the edge of the desk.

<DIRECTION>
INT. FILE ROOM - BASEMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bank of TAPE RECORDERS labelled "Oval Office," "Lincoln Room," "Phones 1-6," "EOB," is rolling. BACK TO SCENE AT OPTION:
</DIRECTION>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much do you need?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could get that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh huh ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could get a million dollars. We could get it in cash. I know where it could be gotten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT: the TAPE rolling.
</DIRECTION>
<DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm still not confident we can ride through this. Some people are going to have to go to jail. Hunt's not the only problem. Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments. Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh, I think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<NIXON>
<DIRECTION>
(worried about Dean)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest. But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John. It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore. There's a cancer on the presidency. And it's growing. With every day that ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads. The average people don't think it's much of a crisis. For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here. Isn't it ridiculous?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I agree it's ridiculous but --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit. Goldwater put it right. He said: "Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course. That's the tragedy of all this. Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<DIRECTION>
Dean has a nervous look in his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He won't. He told Ehrlichman he won't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
A lightning-like IMAGE reveals MITCHELL, responding to EHRLICHMAN. This is Nixon's mind at work.
</DIRECTION>
<MITCHELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You tell Brother Dick I got suckered into this thing by not paying attention to what these bastards were doing. I don't have a guilty conscience ... And he shouldn't either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCHELL>
<DIRECTION>
Nixon glances towards the microphone as he moves around the desk to get closer to Dean.
</DIRECTION>
<NIXON>
<DIRECTION>
(loud and clear)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's right. Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John. A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate. What do we have to hide?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(prompted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we have nothing to hide.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<NIXON>
<DIRECTION>
(repeating)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have nothing to hide.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the only flaw in the plan is that they're not going to believe the truth. That is the incredible thing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<DIRECTION>
Dean, who is worried about his own hide if the truth comes out, sees the point of this.
</DIRECTION>
<DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I agree. It's tricky. Everything seems to lead back here, and, uh ... people would never understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Nixon awkwardly puts his arm around Dean's shoulder. Dean begins to sense a betrayal in the offing.
</DIRECTION>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John, I want you to get away from this madhouse, these reporters, and go up to Camp David for the weekend. And I want you to write up a report. I want you to put everything you know about Watergate in there. Say: Mr. President, here it all is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<DIRECTION>
Another lightning-like IMAGE is Nixon's worst fear -- JOHN DEAN is at the table, plea-bargaining with TWO PROSECUTORS, their backs to us.
</DIRECTION>

</NIXON>
<DIRECTION>
A pause.
</DIRECTION>
<DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this. Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John, you don't want to start down that road. I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is beyond you or even me. It's the country, John. It's the presidency.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand that, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. You know how I feel about loyalty. I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail. That I promise you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moves closer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John. I have complete confidence in you.

NIXON is really drunk now, listening to some GIBBERISH on the tape. We move in on his profile, framed by Lincoln in the background. We should not be able to make out the voices -- occasional words like "Castro," "Kennedy." But that's about it ... nothing more. And as we move closer on Nixon, bleary-eyed, we should feel he has no idea, either, of what he's listening to. It's just ... noise. PAT's voice cuts in. She's standing at the doorway.

	<DIALOGUE>
	... The House Judiciary Committee has voted twenty-seven-to-eleven to recommend impeachment to the full House. The deliberations now go to the House floor ... In its report, the Committee offers evidence that Nixon obstructed justice on at least thirty six occasions, that he encouraged his aides to commit perjury, and that he abused the powers of his office ... In a separate report, the Senate Select Committee details the misuses of the IRS, the FBI, the CIA and the Justice Department. It denounces the Plumbers, and it raises questions of whether the United States had a valid election in 1972.

HIGH ANGLE - Haig knocks and enters the Lincoln Sitting Room. A shaft of LIGHT from inside zigzags the darkness. And we hear a snatch of LOUD MUSIC before the door is closed.

NIXON sits in his chair in a suit and tie, listening to "Victory at Sea" at top volume. In front of him is a picture album -- 1922 portraits of the NIXON FAMILY. HAROLD holding ARTHUR. RICHARD stares glumly at the camera between HANNAH and FRANK.

<DIRECTION>
GENERAL HAIG, with KISSINGER behind, approaches with some papers held out in his hand. Nixon sees them, turns down the hi-fi.

<NIXON>

	"Victory at Sea," Al ... Henry. The Pacific Theatre. Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks.

	This is something you will have to do, Mr. President. I thought you would rather do it now ... I'll wait outside.

Haig drifts out as Kissinger comes out of the shadows. Nixon looks down blankly at the sheet of paper in front of him.

<KISSINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I say, sir, if you stay now it will paralyze the nation and its foreign policy ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KISSINGER>
<DIRECTION>
Nixon looks up at Kissinger. The Judas himself -- at least one of them. There is irony here that is apparent to Nixon but not to Kissinger.
</DIRECTION>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry. When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sitting up, suddenly intense)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?

</NIXON>
<KISSINGER>
<DIRECTION>
(prepared response)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They will understand, sir. To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions. History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KISSINGER>
<NIXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That depends who writes the history books. I'm not a quitter ... but I'm not stupid either ... A trial would kill me -- that's what they want.

<DIRECTION>
(with some satisfaction)

	<DIALOGUE>
	But they won't get it.

He signs the resignation paper. A pause. It lies there.

	If they harass you, I, too, will resign. And I will tell the world why.

	Uh ... not really. You mean on my knees?

A silence. Nixon wraps his arms across his chest and rocks back and forth in an upright fetal position. Kissinger, looking very distressed, reaches over and touches the President, trying awkwardly to console him.

A solitary SENTINEL -- a Marine Guard -- stands at strict attention, eyes forward, as we hear the VOICES of:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The THREE SILHOUETTES of NIXON, KISSINGER and HAIG walking out. HIGH ANGLES allow us to hear their VOICES echoing off the empty rooms, and sometimes catch a glimpse of a passing face. From the voice we can tell that Nixon has resumed his customary bluffness, a sense of bravado in the face of defeat.

	... I remember my old man, I think they would've called him a little man, a common man. He didn't consider himself that way. He was a streetcar motorman first, and then he was a farmer, and then he had a lemon ranch. It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I assure you. He sold it before they found oil on it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIXON>
<DIRECTION>
IMAGES of FRANK and HANNAH NIXON now arise in Nixon's consciousness -- a past he would never really connect his own life to. As if it were a storybook, a fabled America that never was. The MUSIC should, in a sense, accentuate this divorce of sentiment from reality.

	... and then he was a grocer. But he was a great man because he did his job, and every job counts up to the hilt, regardless of what happens ... Nobody will ever write a book, probably, about my mother. Well, I guess all of you would say this about your mother: my mother was a saint. And I think of her, two boys dying of tuberculosis and seeing each of them die, and when they died ... Yes, she will have no books written about her. But she was a saint ... But now, however, we look to the future.

Nixon is holding himself together by sheer force of will. Many members of his STAFF are weeping. He pulls an old well-leafed book open, puts a set of eyeglasses on to read from it, the first time he's ever worn them in public.

"She was beautiful in face and form and lovelier still in spirit ... When she had just become a mother, when her life seemed to be just begun, and when the years seemed so bright before her, then by a strange and terrible fate death came to her. And when my heart's dearest died, the light went from my life forever ..." That was "T.R." in his twenties. He thought the light had gone from his life forever.

We sometimes think, when things happen that don't go the right way, we think that when someone dear to us dies, when we lose an election, when we suffer a defeat, that all is ended ... but that's not true. It is only a beginning, always; because the greatness comes not when things always go good for you, but the greatness comes, and you're really tested, when you take some knocks, some disappointments, when sadness comes ... Because only if you have been in the deepest valley can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain ... To have served in this office is to have felt a very personal sense of kinship with each and every American. In leaving it, I do so with this prayer. May God's grace be with you in all the days ahead.

EPILOGUE runs over a DARK SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<EPILOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nixon always maintained that if he had not been driven from office, the North Vietnamese would not have overwhelmed the South in 1975. In a sideshow, Cambodian society was destroyed and mass genocide resulted. In his absence, Russia and the United States returned to a decade of high-budget military expansion and near-war. Nixon, who was pardoned by President Ford, lived to write six books and travel the world as an elder statesman. He was buried and honored by five Presidents on April 26, 1994, less than a year after Pat Nixon died.
