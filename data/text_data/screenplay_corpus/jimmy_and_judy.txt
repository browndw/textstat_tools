INT./EXT. BACKYARD - SUBURBAN HOUSE - JUDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV of a HOME VIDEO CAMERA shooting into the window of teenage girl's bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door inside opens. In walks JUDY OAKS-KELLEN (18), a blond haired, mousy girl, wearing only a T-shirt and panties. As she heads to the mirror we hear...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sound of skin smacking against skin and heavy breathing. Whoever operates the camera is definitely CHOAKIN' THE GOPHER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judy combs her hair in the mirror, oblivious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera operator is in a whack off frenzy as he...
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERA_OPERATOR>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, mmph.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERA_OPERATOR>
<DIRECTION>
He's climaxed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sounds have stopped, but the tape keeps rolling. Judy stops combing her hair as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera shuts down.
</DIRECTION>

CAMERA ON:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - THE TRACK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera shoots from inside a car hidden camera style as Judy runs laps during her gym class. Judy, again, has no idea that she is being filmed as camera zooms in tight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's tired, sweating profusely, and looks completely miserable. She stops running, exhausted, as the other kids pass her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a very Butch looking female GYM TEACHER (40) walks over and begins BERATING Judy. The Gym Teacher's face turns red as she spews insults inches away from Judy's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can't hear what she's saying, but whatever it is, it's cruel, harsh, and very intense. Exhausted and humiliated, Judy holds back tears as...

Camera shuts down.

INT./EXT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD/KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Late summer evening. Camera Operator wipes dirt from the lens with his shirt revealing his face for the first time as he looks at camera. This is the first time we get even a glimpse of JIMMY WRIGHT (21). His looks are striking, even a bit awkward, but not at all unappealing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He throws a mischievously evil look at the lens, then settles his face back to normal. He spins the camera away, pointing it at the back of his house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the kitchen window, Jimmy zooms in on his mother (JIMMY'S MOM) (40's) idyllic version of a mom in new millennium suburban housewife clothes. She's on the phone, preparing dinner.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Mom, heard you and Dad doing the nasty last night. Thanks for that one. By the way, who the fuck is Nancy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Camera whips over to JIMMY'S DAD in the LIVING ROOM, well dressed, rich looking and fat in his late 40's, watching baseball on TV, tired after a long day's work. He drinks from a tumbler of expensive scotch neat with an ice cube, munching on mixed nuts from a crystal bowl.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Dad, Mom's on the phone telling her friends that you're hung like a light switch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Dad reaches into his pants to give his balls a good scratch. Jimmy gives the play by play like a baseball announcer.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Daddy, there he goes. He makes the reach and... yes! Both balls at the same time! One heck of a double play!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Eyes on the TV, Dad takes his hands out of his pants and sniffs them.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the sniff to finish it off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Satisfied, Dad reaches in and grabs a handful of nuts as he continues to watch TV. We zoom out to see both Mom and Dad, each through different windows.

INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark and in silhouette, Jimmy flips on the camera by remote. It's too dark to see faces or bodies with any detail, but Jimmy's clearly having sex with a PROSTITUTE in his bed. She is young, black, and looks very much like a prostitute.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he pounds into her...
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you like that nigger? Come on nigger, do you like it?

Jimmy's behind the camera interviewing the Prostitute who sits up in his bed holding the sheets to cover herself. With the lights on, we can see that she's clearly unattractive. Jimmy asks his questions with a gentle confidence.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, so. What was going through your mind when I called you a nigger?

	Well, what did it feel like?

Long, awkward pause. Jimmy Doesn't know what to say.

No reply from Jimmy.

No answer.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was trying to do the unthinkable and unimaginable when I called you that. I wanted to see if was even possible for me to do that.

They pause.

<PROSTITUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Jimmy speaks softly and confidently.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>

(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I want to die. Like I don't deserve to live anymore. And that I will never want to do something like that to someone again.

The prostitute finds Jimmy's answer endearing.

<JIMMY>

	My parents provide me with food and shelter because they have been conditioned by society into thinking it's the appropriate thing to do. In reality they can't stand to be in the same room with me. They're fascists, brainwashed, and unforgiving.

INT./EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy hides hidden camera style inside his car in the high school parking lot, bleachers in the distance. School is letting out as he zooms in on Judy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's looking at the ground as she's taunted by a group of Other Harassing Teenagers, a tear streaming down the side of her cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Judy is bashed in the face with a school bag. She falls to the ground, then picks up her broken glasses as camera zooms out to catch the Girl who hit her (Mean Girl).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nearby, a big, Dumb Looking Bully Type (18) taunts her as she cries. His taunts are biting and as excessive as the Mean Girl's, then he dumps a cup of soda on Judy's head as she's crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judy screams at the top of her lungs. The group runs off laughing. Jimmy whip pans to the Mean Girl as she laughs with her friends, then whips pans back to Judy, now on her feet, blood running from her nose and onto her white shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera shuts down.

INT./EXT. JUDY'S HOUSE - JUDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A scene we've seen before. Jimmy is off camera videotaping Judy through her bedroom window. We hear him FLOGGIN' THE DOLPHIN off screen while Judy combs her hair in the mirror. She stops when she hears...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Grown Man, (45), walks into the doorway of her bedroom. This is JUDY'S DAD. He comes in and doesn't say a thing to her. Judy doesn't acknowledge him at all and continues combing her hair as though he's not even there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes up behind her, then wraps his arms around her, giving her a warm hug from behind. Something's not right. The masturbation sounds STOP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judy's noticeably uncomfortable but doesn't resist as her Father begins kissing her neck. His hand slowly creeps down to her pelvic area, his other hand turning out the bedroom light. The room goes dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera flips down, then OFF...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then COMES BACK ON AGAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once again we're looking through the camera pointing at the window, but now it's the distorted, grainy, black and white of "Nite Shot" mode. Though we see the Judy's mirror and her dresser, she and her Father are nowhere to be found.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whatever's going on between them, it's going on out of frame, away from the view of the window. Camera shuts down.

As camera pulls back, we HEAR but don't see Judy's Parents talking to Jimmy's Mom and Dad at the table. Judy is bored, completely uninterested in their conversation.

The TV is off. All we see is Judy's back. She hasn't once turned around to face the camera during any of the clips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sits still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She trembles but doesn't turn around. She collects herself but still doesn't turn around. Jimmy holds the camera steady.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still she doesn't turn around.

<DIRECTION>
She fidgets in her seat but still doesn't turn around.

She now sits still on the edge of the bed like she is in a trance, but still doesn't turn around to face the camera.

No movement.

Then no movement.

<DIRECTION>
She leans her head down towards the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then no movement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still no movement or any reaction for that matter. It's like she is in a trance and can't wake up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy (O.C.) continues to roll without budging.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still no movement.

<DIRECTION>
It looks like she's about to turn around. She moves her head in the direction of the camera, then assumes her original position facing the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then... no movement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still no movement.

Then Judy collapses onto the bed. Jimmy, still rolling, gets off the bed and begins filming her as she lies on the floor crying hysterically.

Judy cries and cries and cries and cries. She then lets out a cry from the depths of her soul. The cry is long, hard, and loud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy gets up, then stands above her with the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rolls over on her back and is now facing directly into the camera. She tries to collect herself.

Jimmy's behind the camera. He stands at the head of the stairs shooting down. Sounds of a dinner party just getting started come from downstairs. He walks down the steps into the party.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A generic "Happy Twentieth Anniversary" sign hangs above the front door. Camera pans awkwardly to a lame K-Mart style studio portrait on the wall. It's Jimmy's parents wearing saccharine sweet smiles, Dad's hair slicked back, Mom in an overdone hair-do and in way too colorful clothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gifts sit on the entry-way table. Party Guests are dressed nicely and are mingling in the house, drinks in hand. Dinner is yet to start. As Jimmy moves into the...

ENTRY-WAY

People at the party all turn to camera, a look of shock on their faces as Jimmy walks through.

More and more people react with gasps and revulsion at camera, but we can't tell why. Jimmy moves camera to the...

LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is full of More Party Guests. Frame moves across a huge mirror on the wall over a cocktail bar. We catch a glimpse of Jimmy's image and realize...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy is completely NAKED and has PAINTED HIS ENTIRE BODY SILVER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera quickly turns away from the mirror as some people run from the room.

One of the Female Party Guests (#1) SCREAMS.

INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera is being removed from the camera bag. As the lens pans quickly, we catch a glimpse of Jimmy smirking, holding the camera. He's way too close to the lens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He flips it around until it locks on DR. WALTERS, MFCC (40), Jimmy's not very accomplished therapist. Walters seems to have a very gentle and nonthreatening aura that suggests he's the type of person you would feel comfortable talking to. He sits by the window in his relatively uninteresting office. Jimmy has turned on the camera in the middle of their first session together.

<DR_WALTERS>

	Jimmy, we discussed this. You can't tape our sessions. It's not allowed.

The camera doesn't move.

<DR_WALTERS>

Jimmy (O.C.) doesn't respond.

Still no answer.

Still no answer.

Dr. Walters sits in front of the camera, trying to stay perfectly still and calm.

Dr. Walters is so nice and so calm, that we start to feel sorry for him.

No movement.

<DIRECTION>
No movement.

Dr. Walters fidgets.

Then holds still.

Dr. Walters is doing his best to stay calm.

Dr. Walters gets up and comes towards the camera. He grabs it just above the lens and tries to take it away.

<DR_WALTERS>

A fierce battle of tug of war breaks out. We see Dr. Walters becoming increasingly pissed off.

The back and forth is suddenly getting violent, until...

Jimmy is filming Judy, who is sitting on his bed. Her face is red, her eyes have watered up, and her nose is snotty and running from after an intense session of crying. Jimmy is catching her seconds after she's has finally composed herself.

</JUDY>
<JIMMY>

CAMERA ON:

<DIRECTION>
Camera's on a tripod. Jimmy sits in a chair, the back of his shoulder foregrounds Judy.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not good on camera. It makes me nervous.

</JUDY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It felt like someone had been reading my mind.

She stops.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was like someone had jumped into my head and watched what was being projected.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Now Judy completely has forgotten that the camera is there.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And earlier, what you said about God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy zooms in the camera by remote. Judy's distracted.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(off her look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy refocuses.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said that it felt like God had sent someone to protect me, and to look out for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at Jimmy as if he is an angel.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I said that you are the only person in my life who has ever looked after me like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy tries to stifle tears, but they're starting to flow again. As camera zooms in further, Judy catches sight of Jimmy's finger on the remote and BLOWS HER FUCKING TOP, leaping from her chair.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, I hate it when you film me crying!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy goes for the camera, struggling to get it off the tripod, she finally frees it and points it at Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you like it, huh? How do you like having a camera shoved right up your ass?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Camera's framed poorly, moves around a lot, goes in and out of focus, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you like it? Do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like it or dislike. I'm used to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy moves the camera directly in his face. The lens is millimeters away from his nose. We see an extreme close up of his nostrils.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Generally I'd place the camera further away from my nose, but if this is your preferred shooting style then I guess I'll have to adjust to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy leans in and rests his nose on the lens.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's this work for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy pulls back and continues filming him.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me a break.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Now Judy's the interviewer. Her framing is not quite as adept as Jimmy's.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... why do you have to film everything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't film everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you like to film me crying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it's rare that I get to find someone that lets their emotions go. When a person is crying, I mean truly crying, or truly laughing or smiling or frowning or gasping. For a few seconds or minutes I get a chance to see that person's soul. And really, now that you've forced me to think about it. I think it's a very rare and beautiful thing to be afforded that opportunity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy is shaken and speechless.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy's moved and forgets herself. Camera drops from Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy helps her put the camera back up on him.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy sits still. Judy doesn't know what to do with that.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy doesn't have an answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy reaches forward and takes the camera away from her and turns the interview around.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>

(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why you and why me? Why are we together right now?

Judy doesn't know what to say.

Judy fidgets again, then...

<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(blows her top)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because we're both fucking weird!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy pauses. The pressure of the camera from Jimmy makes her feel like she has to give him more.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because we're the two weirdest kids in the world. And God made us for each other and I fucking love you, and you did all this because you love me too, and fuck everyone and everything that doesn't get it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy's out of breath. Camera still points at her.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, right?

Judy stares back at the camera, longing for an answer from Jimmy. She told him she loved him. Camera shuts down.

	They feel abandoned by our need for privacy and insecure because we no longer seek their approval.

	When you don't have any friends, don't play sports, don't go out, have no one talk to, nowhere to go, no one to listen to you, or no one to help you figure things out, you sort of have to figure things out by yourself. And without any of those things I have nothing but time to think about stuff.

O.C., Judy is sticking her chest out for Jimmy. He looks away from the road to stare, her breasts filling out her top nicely.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy tilts the camera down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN A FLASH we see a lifelike dildo sticking out of Jimmy's fly, a smiley face sticker covers the head. The camera quickly shakes and spins off the image as Judy screams bloody fucking murder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy laughs. Judy forgets the camera is on. She drops it into her lap, fabric from her clothes covers the frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can hear Jimmy and Judy laughing hysterically.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)

	That's why I did it. Now come on. I showed you mine, let me see yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the rustling of Judy's clothing. Camera falls to her feet on the floor of the car. There's silence. Off camera, Judy's nervously showing Jimmy her breasts.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me see 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy has a naughty and flirtatious smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the blink of an eye she suddenly lifts up her shirt and exposes her bra, then pulls her shirt back down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy protests.
</DIRECTION>

<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can. You can trust me with your life.
	</DIALOGUE>

<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.) (gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please.

Judy gets the same sexy, naughty smile and lifts up her shirt exposing the bra, keeping it there.

<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you take off your bra?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy looks nervous but gives in. She unhooks her bra from the front and exposes her naked breasts for as long as she can. Jimmy focusses the camera's attention on them. It's too much for her. She quickly pulls her shirt back down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy tilts up to a close up of Judy's face.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>

She starts tearing up.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You haven't even asked me to be your girlfriend and I did that. I'm a slut.

(wiping her eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	I want this moment to be captured forever. I'd rather not kiss you at all than waste the opportunity to document the most beautiful moment of my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy leans towards Jimmy, then suddenly attacks him and shoves the camera to the side. They are making out exuberantly. The camera shakes and wobbles. We can hear heavy breathing and the two of them smashing up against the interior of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy finally has the camera in position. He has one of his arms extended and now we can see the two of them kissing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judy's devouring him in that raging teenage hormone sort of way.

No response.

Jimmy films Judy who lies next to him in the bed. Her face is sweaty and red and he is still a tad out of breath. Jimmy is capturing her literally seconds after they had sex.

She's somewhat bewildered, then she notices the camera. She's starting to get used to it.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy thinks.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was scared at first. Really scared. I didn't expect it to be so loud and you looked so mean. But then I got home and started thinking about it. About how your muscles looked and how dangerous it all seemed. It made me like... all excited, and like...

</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's bare ass flashes us as he heads out the bedroom door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judy holds the camera as we hear Jimmy in the hallway. He opens a closet door, fumbles through it, then busts back into the bedroom, holding the shotgun he used out on the lake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy zooms in on Jimmy's naked upper body as he stands in front of her and begins pumping the gun and pulling the trigger. Obviously the gun is not loaded.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>

Jimmy gives Judy the gun. Now she's holding the gun and the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's heavy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy points the gun at Jimmy. She lowers it, aiming right at his crotch just below frame.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I see the appeal. Give me the camera.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy hands Jimmy the camera. Camera moves and shakes as she hands it over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy frames her up nicely. Now we see Judy topless, pointing the gun directly at the lens of the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think of this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
She brings the gun down, then takes the barrel of the gun and places it between her breasts, squishing them together, covering her nipples as she rubs the barrel between her breasts.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy takes the barrel of the gun from her breasts and near her mouth. She starts rolling her tongue over the top of the barrel slowly and seductively, then stops. It looks as if she's about to perform full mock oral sex on the barrel of the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is SO hot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
As she is about to start to move her mouth and lips over the gun, then suddenly we hear a garage door open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy throws the camera sideways down on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck! It's my parents!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
We are now seeing sideways rotated images of Jimmy and Judy panicking, throwing on their clothes as fast as humanly possible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy grabs the camera off the bed and turns it off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - PARENTS' BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy is hiding in the closet of his parents' bedroom. He has the door of the closet cracked and puts the lens of the camera through the crack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's Dad enters the room. He has no idea that he is being filmed and that Jimmy is in the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's Dad walks over to the dresser, opens up the top drawer and pulls something out. It's too dark in the room to tell exactly what he's pulled out, but it appears to resemble some sort of undergarment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's Dad begins undressing, then steps out of frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat, he reappears. Now he's wearing nothing but a sequined teddy. He's totally fat, hairy, and nasty looking. He sits on the side of the bed, his back to us. Now we see that what he grabbed out of the drawer was actually a pair of fishnet stockings. He begins putting them on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he is finished putting on his panty hose, he gets up off the bed and begins admiring his legs in a mirror. He begins to gently stroke the sides of his legs, relishing the feel of the hose over his hands and fingertips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He seems to be lip syncing the words to a song and begins to get all worked up. He shakes his hips and dances around the room for a few seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Jimmy's Dad goes to the dresser and pulls out a long brunette wig from the back of his top drawer. Putting it on, with the fishnet stockings, sequined teddy and long wig, he has transformed himself into the world's fattest, ugliest, hairiest, Cher look-a-like.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone else enters the room.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY_S_DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi sweety.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY_S_DAD>
<DIRECTION>
Holy shit. It's Jimmy's Mom, and she's wearing a leather dominatrix outfit!
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY_S_MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you ready for me, you fucking slut?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY_S_MOM>
<JIMMY_S_DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not quite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY_S_DAD>
<JIMMY_S_MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't feel like waiting. Hurry up bitch. What do you have left to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY_S_MOM>
<JIMMY_S_DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just need to put on my makeup.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY_S_DAD>
<DIRECTION>
As Jimmy's Mom exits frame, we see Jimmy's Dad go to the mirror. He opens up the top drawer again and pulls out a little makeup bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's Mom re-enters, now wearing a mini leather biker's hat, carrying a riding switch.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY_S_MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on slut.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY_S_MOM>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's Dad finishes applying his lipstick and moves over to the bed. By the way Jimmy's parents are behaving, it's as if they've gone through this routine a thousand times.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's Mom drifts off screen as Jimmy's Dad gets up on all fours. Suddenly, we hear a SMACK as Jimmy's Mom hits Jimmy's Dad on his ass with the switch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lets out deep pleasured groans as she continues SMACKING him with the whip harder and harder. He yelps, squeals, and gyrates his hips back and forth, then starts dry humping the air until she stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's Mom comes back through and out of frame. Jimmy's Dad pushes his belly into the bed, groaning from the pain while he waits for her return.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She comes back, moving quickly across the screen wearing an enormous strap on dildo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Disappearing out of frame again, Jimmy's Dad gets himself ready for her one more time, ass up, on all fours on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From behind, we can see her hand as she hikes her husband's dress up his back, then we see his face and hear him grunt as she rips his fishnets off screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a pause. Nothing seems to be happening, but Jimmy's Dad is bracing himself for something. His face tightens up. Off screen, Jimmy's Mom has started mounting him from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy can't take it any longer. As he slowly emerges from the closet, his Mom notices Jimmy almost immediately. She jumps off her husband, screaming bloody murder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera's shaky but it's easy to guess what's been happening. Mom's just started doing Dad from behind with the strap on.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi mom. Hi dad. What are you guys up to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's Dad leaps from the bed and begins shouting. He looks completely absurd screaming at Jimmy wearing his sequined dress and wig.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee dad, what do you say the two of us go out to the front yard and throw some ball together? We'll have a nice friendly game of catch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's Dad attacks Jimmy. He swings at the lens. He's one angry drag queen daddy. He begins strangling Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY_S_DAD>

	You little mother fucker. Turn off that fucking camera!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY_S_DAD>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's Mom rips off her strap on dildo and begins beating Jimmy's Dad with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judging from the punishment she's inflicting upon her drag queen husband, the dildo apparently is made from the finest and heaviest of materials.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY_S_MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it! You're going to kill him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY_S_MOM>

Jimmy's Dad lets go. The dildo's doing the trick.

Jimmy's Mom keeps swinging the dildo at Jimmy's Dad even though he's let go.

Jimmy's Mom now directs her attention on Jimmy. She screams at him as she swings her gigantic strap on towards the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY_S_MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You little beast! You want to film something? Film this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY_S_MOM>
<DIRECTION>
She continues to swing the strap on as she walks closer and closer to the lens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera goes crazy. Loud sounds are heard throughout the room. Evidently Jimmy has been tackled. We hear wrestling and grunting. It seems that Jimmy's Dad has tackled Jimmy, or maybe his Mom, or both, but the camera is too shaky to tell just what has happened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's Dad is still fighting. He seems to have them all pinned against the floor. He's crushing his mother.

<DIRECTION>
We hear Jimmy's Mom screaming/repeating herself. We see a hand go over the lens. Jimmy and his mother and father are all in a wrestling match on the floor.

Jimmy with great enthusiasm begins to sing as the camera shakes.
</DIRECTION>

CAMERA ON:

EXT. FOREST/MEADOW - RUNNING NAKED - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy has the camera and is chasing a naked (just from behind) Judy through the woods. The camera shakes and rattles, but we can definitely tell this is all in good fun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judy screams as she is being chased through the woods. She couldn't feel more free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She begins to tire and slows down. She can no longer run and turns towards the camera. As she turns around, camera shows her from the waist up. She has a beer can in her hand and she is a little drunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For the first time, she's completely at ease with her own body and looks perfectly natural being naked in the wilderness. She walks towards the camera smoothly and seductively. Her long hair blond hair blows gently in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>

</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're right mister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy giggles, then dances around playfully in the woods. She has never felt so alive.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want this to ever end. I want to be here forever. I want to dance and be naked and be free, and I want us to ball our brains out everyday, and I want to feel the air on my body and I want to get drunk and not care about anything in the world. I just want us to be together in this moment.

<JIMMY>

(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah Erlanger. Everybody was talking about it in the nut house. That's ALL anybody fucking talked about was this dude who lives up there named Uncle Rodney. He supposedly has a commune where we can do this kind of thing every day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uncle Rodney's commune?

Jimmy takes a deep breath, a touch of intensity flashes in his eye, then...
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>

	I want to go one day without masturbating. I want to liberate my penis. I want to clone you so we could have a three way and neither of us would be cheating. I want you to scrape my balls with a cheese grater...

Jimmy hands Judy the camera as she starts to frame him up, but they're really engaging each other's eyes over the top of the eyepiece.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's transcendental because it transcends everything. Life, love, law, people, things... A bond so strong that our souls will become one and it can never end, even in death. If you swear on the bond, it means you'd rather die than break your promise.
	</DIALOGUE>

Jimmy stares at her, then slowly leans in for a kiss... a long, wet, toe curling kiss. Jimmy finds a way to point the camera at the kiss.

They break apart. Judy sighs, staring into Jimmy's eyes, then leans into him, his lips touching her forehead, their eyes closing as they feel the energy of true love.

<DIRECTION>
Judy laughs, then screams with embarrassed excitement. Her laughter and happiness is infectious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pounds her fists on the dashboard and laughs again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can hear Jimmy laughing off camera as well.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>

THWACK! Someone has thrown a full soda can on the hood of Jimmy's car. He pans and zooms the camera over and sees a car full of Three Teenagers laughing at them.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother fuckers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the TEENAGE DRIVER of the car appears, as if out of nowhere, running to the passenger side. Jimmy zooms out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The frame catches up to him just as he spits a huge LOOGIE into the car, hitting Judy right in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judy screams. The car full of Three Teenagers laugh hysterically at her expense.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy hands Judy the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, you're definitely going to want to tape this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy calmly gets out of his car as Judy tapes him through the window. We can hear her breathing heavily as she tries not to cry softly off camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy has gone to the rear of the car. We hear the trunk open while Judy films through the windshield at the car full of laughing teens. Jimmy enters the frame carrying a baseball bat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see him talking calmly to the driver of the car, the Kid who spat in Judy's face. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy reels back and clocks the kid right in the face with the bat. The Kid falls over into the front seat of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy calmly walks over to the front of the car and begins bashing in the windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.) (to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Now rage has taken over Jimmy over entirely. He's bashing in the windshield with all of his might.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The teenagers all go running from the car. A crowd starts to form in the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.) (to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God Jimmy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy has now completely bashed in the windshield and moves to the front of the car. He now begins smashing the other windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now a sizeable crowd is formed. Jimmy is seemingly oblivious to them and continues bashing the car.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.) (to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you Jimmy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Now it's to the point of overkill. But Jimmy won't stop. It's as if the rage he's been carrying inside of him his entire life is now coming to the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear sirens in the distance as Jimmy continues to bash the car. The car is in near shambles as we hear police sirens in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judy begins screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy stop, please stop. Jimmy... oh god, Jimmy stop. God damn it, fucking stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy doesn't. He pounds the car harder as a police cruiser pulls up. Two policemen get out of the car. They are temporarily paralyzed with indecision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see one of the officers trying to speak with Jimmy. He just ignores them. The policemen are oblivious to the fact they are being filmed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the officers gets out a can of mace and sprays it in Jimmy's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Jimmy is completely freaking out. We hear him scream, but he continues to bash the car with his eyes closed. One of the cops draws his gun as Jimmy swings aimlessly towards them. He gets sprayed again with the mace and is now completely blinded. A huge crowd has now amassed outside of the grocery store.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God Jimmy, oh God...

Now the entire parking lot is filled with cop cars. Lights are flashing all around Jimmy. He is surrounded but sill continues to swing the bat.

<JUDY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Three cops tackle Jimmy from behind. Judy throws down the camera and runs out the door. The camera is face down on the seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear Judy get out of the car, leaving the door open so we can hear the entire scene with much more intensity. The sounds of police sirens and radios is overwhelming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a woman screaming and more sirens and cars are pulling up. More screaming and sounds on the radio is heard. We hear police chatter:
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_CHATTER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.) (over the police radios)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to need an ambulance stat at the parking lot of the grocery store on Route 18...
	</DIALOGUE>

More screaming and chatter is heard until someone enters the car. We don't know who it is. They turn off the camera.

Jimmy's pulled forward to the drive thru while Judy tapes from passenger seat. A voice squawks at Jimmy, asking for his order.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I get a double cheese burger, no pickles, large fries and a coke?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>

Jimmy looks at the camera.

(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seriously, what did you do? What was a day in the life of Jimmy in the nut house?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, besides masturbating, I talked and talked and talked and fucking talked until they were satisfied. But basically I told them what they wanted to hear. I said shit like...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy does an over the top mock sincerity speech.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Now that I'm finally able to talk about my problems, I now realize that my behavior was inappropriate and harmful to others."
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I figured it out. I had to cry as much as possible. Whenever someone would cry they'd call it a "break through." So I'd be like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy does an imitation of himself in therapy. He looks directly into the lens.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You start out slow, then you build it up like this... "Now I know that using violence is not the answer."
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy is getting progressively sappier and more over the top with his self impersonation.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you go like this:
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(snaps back into the impersonation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was wrong, I know I was wrong and I'll never do it again. I don't want to hurt people or myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy does an obnoxious fake cry.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boo hoo, waaaaaa, boo-hoo-hoo, waaaaaaa.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(snaps out of it)

	You're so lucky. I wish I was diagnosed with something. What does it mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy pretends he is reading from a text book 50's industrial spoof style.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ODD is a disorder characterized by an overwhelming pattern of negative, hostile, and defiant behavior which causes severe delusions where the patient can no longer distinguish fantasy from reality.

(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. I love that!

Jimmy smiles as he gets his burger out of the paper bag. He then opens the top bun of the burger to examine if they got his order correct. They didn't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy playfully begins to act crazy.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see. They fucked up my order. I specifically asked for no pickles.

</JIMMY>
<JUDY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy goes into a cartoonish like crazy person character.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He begins by taking the pickles off of his burger. He puts the burger down, quickly lifts his shirt, holding it up with his chin while he places two pickles over top of his nipples.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy yells.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooow, jeez, they're hot! I burnt my nipples with the pickles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy cracks up laughing. Jimmy takes a pickle off of his left nipple and dangles it directly in front of the lens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He then feeds it to Judy. We hear Judy chomping on the pickle and giggling off camera. The camera shakes then shuts down.

CAMERA ON:

INT./EXT. GHETTO/JUDY'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judy is driving through the ghetto as Jimmy shoots out of the window. On the sidewalk, he catches glimpses Drug Dealers, a Crack Whore, a Drunk stumbling along, and Other Pretty Sketchy Characters.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love the ghetto. I don't know what it is about it. I fucking love it. It's always the first place I go to when I get out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love it when you're out of the looney bin. Do you think you might be able to try to avoid the place for a while?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.) (joking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If they don't send me to the bin, maybe they'll send me to jail.

This upsets Judy.

(O.C.) (tired of it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No it's not all right! When you're in there I have to be out in the real world alone, by myself Jimmy. You go away and come back like it's no big deal. Well it is a big deal. I don't want to spend another day without you. Do you understand me? I'd rather die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy's holding back tears.

<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't believe him. She's really starting to cry despite herself. He pulls his eye from the lens to look at her.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Judy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>

Judy looks over at him.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>

(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I promise. I swear on my life and I swear on our bond, I'll never go back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Her freak out subsides.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you swear on our bond, then I believe you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy lets out half cry and half yelp. Her emotions are a bit out of control.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you so fucking much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you too.
	</DIALOGUE>

Awkward silence. Judy looks like she wants to ask Jimmy something.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was thinking, the last time you got out we did it like five times, like as soon as we saw each other, we got naked and started doing it. And today, my parents weren't even home and I tried to do some stuff to you, but you were acting like you weren't interested.

(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean to.

<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was it because you jerked off so much while you were locked up?

Jimmy hands her a small bottle of whiskey. She takes a sizable gulp, makes a face, then hands it back to Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy is getting upset again.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(voice cracking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why don't you want to have sex with me Jimmy? You don't think I'm pretty anymore?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, no! That has nothing to do with it. After I saw my dad being rammed in the ass by my mother, I kind of blocked it out, but when I was in there they kept talking to me and talking to me about it. Now I can't stop it from coming into my head. Every time I get wood, the instant replay machine in my brain projects this image of my Mom pounding into my Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, that's awful. I didn't know.

</JUDY>
<JIMMY>

(O.C.)

Judy takes another drink off the bottle of whiskey and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you like this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
While she is driving she pulls down her tank top and quickly exposes her breasts through the top of her shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now we're talking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy tries to position her body so her breasts are in frame. She begins pushing one up, then sticks out her tongue, teasing.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is so hot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>

Judy smiles and looks over at the camera. One hand on the steering wheel and one on her breast, when...
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch out!

BOOM!

A loud THUMP hits the car, shaking the camera.

<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you hit someone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy's in shock. Jimmy puts the camera on the floor of the car by the passenger seat. He forgets to turn it off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All we see is a close up of the floor and Jimmy's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>

Jimmy gets out of the car. We hear the car door open then close.

Judy sounds like she is having a complete nervous breakdown. She's crying, but in an extremely nervous and frantic way.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God, what are you doing?

The Cop is close, we can feel his footsteps coming towards the car. Judy collects herself as best as she can.

<DIRECTION>
It seems like forever, then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUMP!

A weird, digital, black and white image plays on the camera. There's no light and Jimmy's got the camera back in "Nite Shot" mode. He's standing outside of the car filming the Homeless Man who is lying dead inside of the trunk. Judy stands next to him as he films.

The Homeless Man is twisted and contorted in order to fit in the small confines of the trunk.

INT. DINKO'S TRAILER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Music is playing extremely loud in a funky ass trailer as Judy dances with DINKO (late 20s) a completely drunk trailer trash dude wearing a pizza delivery outfit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Empty whiskey and beer bottles are scattered throughout the tiny living room as cigarette smoke hovers around them due to a ridiculously low ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judy is dancing in a very sexy manner with Dinko who is dancing like a complete dork. Dinko has no moves, rhythm, or beat whatsoever, but dances with as much vigor as a dog on crack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy is sitting on the couch filming them dancing in front of him. Dinko is forced to scream over top of the music to be heard. He looks directly at Jimmy noticing that Jimmy's turned on the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DINKO>

We can still hear Dinko talking to Jimmy.

<DINKO>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right man. That's cool. Hey um... If I tell you to stop taping though, man, you gotta stop. I got some hard core junkies coming over here. Sometimes, if they see shit like that, they fucking flip. Crank junkies are a whole different kind of breed man. They're fucking hard core mother fuckers. You don't know what they're gonna fucking do. This one guy got paranoid about something. He used to climb on his roof to take a dump. That's the only place he would shit! How fucked up is that?

</DINKO>
<DIRECTION>
Dinko gets up and moves into the kitchen area, crossing the frame. Jimmy focusses the camera's attention on various items in the kitchen while Dinko talks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's ripped open small electronics and appliances everywhere, as if Dinko's been taking everything apart and trying to put it back together.
</DIRECTION>

Jimmy pulls out to include Judy in the shot. She's in the kitchen doing another line of crank off a counter top.

<DIRECTION>
As Judy bends down to snort her line, camera drifts over to Dinko who's holding a HUGE HILLBILLY WAD OF CASH in his hand and stuffs it into a box of cereal. Jimmy zooms in on the cereal box. There's a whole bunch more cash in there.

Judy keeps on dancing in her own little world while Dinko goes to the door. Judy finishes her bottle of beer. She's pretty drunk and cranked out at this point.

Dinko is at the front door dealing with a customer. We can't see her and we can barely hear what they're talking about, but it seems Dinko is engaged in a heated conversation with her. He yells back into the living room from the front door.

</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Dinko brings in HAZEL,(40), a frightfully thin crank addict. She's scared, nervous, and completely strung out, and she looks like death. They stand off to the side of the room watching Judy dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judy realizes the woman is in the room and stops dancing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy zooms in on the woman. Looking closer we see that Hazel is in the final stages of her life/addiction. She's sweating and her eyes are bugging out of her skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dinko turns the music down so they don't have to scream.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>

<HAZEL>

Hazel is trembling. The party atmosphere has come to a complete halt.

<DINKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up you fat fucking junkie and take your clothes off or you ain't getting shit.

Dinko unbuckles his belt as fast as he can. Hazel begins to cry as Dinko pushes her into position on all fours.

Judy is crying profusely in the background as Dinko pushes Hazel to the ground. Jimmy zooms in on Dinko, framing out Hazel as Dinko gets himself ready to take her from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DINKO>

	That's it. Just like that.

Dinko sees something O.C. from Jimmy, we can't see that surprises him.
</DIRECTION>
<DINKO>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DINKO>
<DIRECTION>
BAM!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dinko takes a shot in the throat and falls onto Hazel. Jimmy's shot him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judy has stopped screaming. Hazel on the other hand is freaking out, trapped under a squirming Dinko.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy sets the camera on top of something, stands up and brings the gun to Judy.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy doesn't know what to do. Jimmy puts the gun in her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finish him off! He deserves a bullet right in the fucking face, doesn't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>

</JUDY>
<JIMMY>

	Then do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy points the gun at a still squirming Dinko. She can't bring herself to pull the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can hear Dinko choking on his own blood. He struggles to move towards Judy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's now standing behind Judy. He wraps his hand around hers, helps her point the gun and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shoots Dinko right between the eyes. Jimmy helps her again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM-BAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two more shots into his chest, Jimmy's hand still wrapped around Judy's over the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy lets go of her hand and the gun drops to the floor. She's stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy comes towards camera and shuts it down.

Elvis gives a quick windmill strum to his guitar and starts.

Jimmy pulls the camera from the screen and points it at Judy to get her reaction. Her eyes are locked on the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judy's face drops. We, on the other hand, are dying to see what she's looking at.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy swish pans back to the TV and zooms in tight. The television fills the frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GHETTO - COP CAR CAM (FOR VEGAS MOTEL) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(From Sc. 37, p. 64) On screen we see something completely new. It's a black and white security cam style video image. Just as the announcer described, this is the kind of image that comes from a video camera that's mounted on the inside of a Cop Car. It's static and covered with date/time text, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On TV, we finally get a chance to see what transpired when Jimmy and Judy were pulled over. Judy is standing outside the cop car. The moment she sees it approach, we see her freak just a bit and get into the car quickly and suspiciously. The cop gets up, gets out of the car and goes over to the driver side to talk to Jimmy. After a few moments, he summons Jimmy out of the car while Judy waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cop asks Jimmy to open the trunk. He doesn't have his gun drawn, but he is being cautious, one hand on his gun holster, the other shining on Jimmy's face with a flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
<DIRECTION>
(on TV)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead and open it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy stands by the trunk of the car, but he's not really obeying the Cop's commands. He's stalling. The Cop is getting suspicious. We can barely hear what they're saying to each other over the noise of traffic that whizzes by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's an unintelligible exchange, then... the cop steps forward, raising his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
<DIRECTION>
(on TV)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put your hands on the vehicle.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<COP>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On the vehicle, now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DIRECTION>
The Cop and Jimmy are sort of at a standoff. Jimmy finally leans over and puts his hands on the trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cop comes in close to Jimmy, pulling his hand from his gun holster and shifting it to pull his cuffs off his belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At that exact moment, Jimmy makes his move, LEAPING for the Cop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the Cop to the ground and off screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All we see is a barely decipherable image of Judy freaking out in the passenger seat because she can't see what's going on and neither can we.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About 5 seconds go by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gunshot is fired.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It feels like an eternity, then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy pops up off the ground. He's got the Cop's gun! He hesitates, not knowing what to do. He pauses, hesitant, then shoots down towards the ground, where the cop is lying out of frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs around the front of the car and into the driver seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a moment of hesitation as Jimmy and Judy seem to be screaming at each other in the car, then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy slams on the gas and the car takes off into the distance.

Judy starts the shaver back up and proceeds to shave Jimmy's head. She starts right down the middle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hair falls into Jimmy's face as Judy slides the buzzer from front to back. Jimmy now has a reverse Mohawk. He laughs at himself along with Judy.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy then shaves the entire top of Jimmy's head, giving him the quintessential male pattern baldness look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks ridiculous.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>

</DIRECTION>

<JUDY>

Jimmy gives it a feel for himself. He sticks his pinky in the side of his mouth.

<JIMMY>

Judy laughs, then kisses the top of Jimmy's head.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for marrying me. You're my prince charming that came and swooped me off me feet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>

The irony is thick. Bald, lanky, 21 year old Jimmy with a mouth full of food looks like anything but Prince Charming.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And one day, we're gonna have a house and a white picket fence and a baby. Tell me what you think we should name the baby.

Jimmy whips the camera around to zoom in on what he's looking through the window. Finally, we see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two Florence County Sheriff's Cars with their lights flashing are parked in the parking lot of the cheap motel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy zooms in on the cops as they get out of their cars.

</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy forgets to shut the camera down. He holds it by his waist as the two quickly struggle to get the hell out of the diner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Follow along with them, camera by Jimmy's side, mostly pointing randomly at the floor of the diner or out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They head out the door to the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARKING LOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Action continues, the camera still rolling without Jimmy realizing it. They run at a fast clip along the parking lot as they head toward...
</DIRECTION>

(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Jimmy slides into the driver seat and throws the camera onto the dashboard. We see Jimmy behind the wheel as they drive out of the parking lot. He's in freak-out mode, afraid as hell they're going to be caught by the cops.

</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I don't think they're coming.
	</DIALOGUE>

Jimmy's still not certain. He looks for a while. Then he sighs. It seems that he knows they're not coming.

Judy opens her eyes. The first thing she sees is Jimmy filming her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judy smiles like an infant who sees her daddy for the first time after a night's sleep. Judy, very childlike, opens her arms for Jimmy to hug her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy leans over, camera in hand, and gives her a hug. The camera shakes and goes out of focus as he's hugging her.

Judy bites her lip and drives. Slowly, she comes around a bend as they arrive at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNCLE RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND/PARKING AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judy's eyes go wide.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God. Is that it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy doesn't say anything. He just keeps the camera trained on Judy. By the look on her face, what she's seeing looks pretty cool.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this where your friend lives?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy points the camera through the front windshield. Now we see what Judy was seeing... about thirty trailers, all along the water's edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It looks like a commune for run-away teenagers with crank addictions and budding/wannabe drug dealers. The kids are throwing a combination party, barbecue, and drug festival.
</DIRECTION>

Judy doesn't respond. She just drives. Her eyes are starting to well up a little bit. She's getting emotional.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is sooo amazing. It's like a dream.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy's on cloud nine. The place has exceeded her expectations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judy keeps driving as we see young people, all more or less the same age as Jimmy and Judy. Some live in trailers, some in tents. They watch as Jimmy and Judy drive in. Clearly new faces are of interest to them.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go over here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Out the window, they approach another trailer. Clearly this trailer is more important than the others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, a dorky looking douche bag type, BUDDY (20's) talks to some of the Younger People in intense language. They all look over to see Jimmy and Judy approaching.
</DIRECTION>

Jimmy hands off the camera to Judy, who retrains it on the Buddy and the Wunderland Teenagers he talks to.

Jimmy gets out of Dinko's car and heads up to him while Judy films. We don't hear the conversation between Jimmy and Buddy man, but clearly he's happy to see Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buddy gives Jimmy a big hug like he was a missed relative or an old friend. It's all smiles between the two of them.

Buddy is standing outside of a Piece Of Shit Trailer. He's the douche bag type that we saw from a distance give Jimmy a hug in the previous scene.

He's surprisingly charismatic and gracious and does his best to make Jimmy and Judy feel at home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy films as Buddy gives them a walking tour of the group of trailers by the river. Judy's with them as well.
</DIRECTION>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>

Jimmy's panning around the landscape. People are watching them walk with Buddy. It's almost as if they've got some kind of celebrity status because they're with him.
</DIRECTION>
<BUDDY>

	It don't look like much but we do some pretty good partying around here. Ya'll are welcome to stay as long as ya like. Fuck it, you can stay forever. There's only two rules. Don't mess around with the labs which are down back there...

BUDDY laughs at his own joke.

	Other than that, ya'll can do whatever the hell you want, whenever the hell you want. You wanna do some of the stash at the parties, that's cool too. We'd like it if you do it, normally we'd say you gotta sell some too, but Rodney says y'all's is a special case 'cuz you ain't leaving 'til the heat's off for sure, that could be months or... shit, years for you guys.

<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you look happy, happier than you've looked in a long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy smiles even wider. She floats towards camera while Jimmy zooms in on her smiling face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she comes closer...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHE SPLASHES towards the camera, trying to get Jimmy wet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera shakes as Jimmy hops up to avoid be splashed.

Faint moonlight comes into the trailer from outside. Jimmy is filming Judy as she's just gotten into bed. She sees the camera's on.

<DIRECTION>
Judy's on such a cloud nine high, she's almost in tears. She wraps her arms around him and SQUEALS with delight, pushing the camera into an awkward position as she smothers him with kisses, then squeezes him tight, like she's going to squeeze the life out of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She whispers in his ear.

Head to toe shot on Jimmy. Buddy, we'll find out in a second, is behind the camera. Jimmy looks at a trailer off screen. He's excited, a little off center and a little nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buddy tries to film Jimmy as he's walking towards Rodney's trailer.

Jimmy stops for a second.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<BUDDY>

	Shit man. Don't have to. She's one of his girls, man. She'll meet him.

Jimmy stops in his tracks and looks at Buddy.

<JIMMY>

<BUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)

	Relax dude... Just like you're one of his boys. Shit man, I'll give you two weeks and you'll WANT her to experience him. You may even want to, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy looks at Buddy, not quite sure what to do with any of it. Buddy senses the tension.
</DIRECTION>
<BUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just go see him. Here, take your camera.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Buddy extends the camera, lens forward. We can see Jimmy's puzzled look.
</DIRECTION>
<BUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants you to film him, man. With the camera. He'll tell you when to turn it on, then you video.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's puzzled, but he reaches forward and takes the camera, shutting it down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - UNCLE RODNEY'S TRAILER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Images of UNCLE RODNEY (50) going in and out of focus as he sits on the side of a king sized bed. Scars and tatoos litter his arms and neck. His eyes are bit maniacal like Charles Manson, but he's able to maintain a stoic, but nonetheless dangerous demeanor as Jimmy begins setting up the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like a prison inmate or rabid dog, you get the feeling that Uncle Rodney could EXPLODE on you at any second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy moves the camera around the room so we briefly see the interior of the trailer. It's an ELABORATE triple combination of a middle eastern harem, sixties psychedelic motif, and white trash/junk-yard memorabilia.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUST OUT OF FRAME we hear a female voice crying softly, whimpering. The voice is close, in the room with us, but we can't see who's making the sounds. Uncle Rodney ignores it completely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera shakes, indicating that Jimmy is exceptionally nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just one second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<UNCLE_RODNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take your time man. I want you to feel comfortable. More importantly, I want you to get this right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_RODNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, the camera stops shaking. Jimmy zooms out to a medium shot revealing that Uncle Rodney has HAZEL lying next to him on the bed with her head on his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Uncle Rodney gently strokes her hair like he's petting a dog. Hazel, in the midst of EXTREME withdrawals, cries and whimpers like a child, oblivious to Jimmy, the camera, and everything else in the world except for Uncle Rodney.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is so strung out and her cravings are so intense that she can barely speak.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm ready whenever you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Uncle Rodney looks down upon Hazel.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_RODNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a second. I have to take care of my baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_RODNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Uncle Rodney admires his work.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_RODNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's beautiful isn't she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_RODNEY>
<HAZEL>
<DIRECTION>
(begging, pleading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAZEL>
<DIRECTION>
Hazel, entrenched in a crystal methamphetamine psychotic episode, can only gasp in unintelligible spurts.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_RODNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some people come here too far gone. Like Hazel here. The only thing I can do for her is ease her pain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_RODNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Hazel rolls her body back and forth on the bed, all the while keeping her head in Uncle Rodney's lap.
</DIRECTION>
<HAZEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAZEL>
<UNCLE_RODNEY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Hazel)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhhhh... How about a baby one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_RODNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Uncle Rodney's tenderness in dealing with Hazel calms her. He's having way too much fun treating her like a baby.
</DIRECTION>
<HAZEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAZEL>
<DIRECTION>
Uncle Rodney takes his pinky and dips it into a small plastic bag of powder. He then places it to Hazel's nostril.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She quickly snorts the tiny bit off his finger.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_RODNEY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Hazel)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you go...
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_RODNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Hazel begins whimpering again. It wasn't nearly enough to satisfy her.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_RODNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's something about addiction that brings out something beautiful in a person. Addiction is pure. Addiction reduces a person to an infant. And there's nothing more pure and beautiful in the world than an infant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_RODNEY>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his finger to Hazel's nostril again, but this time, without any meth on the tip. She snorts with all of her might then starts crying. Uncle Rodney is toying with her.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_RODNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hazel is no longer an adult. She's an infant and I'm the surrogate mother who provides her with much needed breast milk. It's a role that both of us have accepted and embrace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_RODNEY>
<DIRECTION>
He leans over and grabs a syringe, already filled, then gently holds Hazel's arm and expertly injects the liquid into her vein.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing happens for several seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hazel's breathing accelerates. Suddenly she sits up, her eyes go wide. Hazel clinches the bed as if she were riding a roller coaster.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_RODNEY>
<DIRECTION>
(proudly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my girl!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_RODNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Then, she makes eye contact with Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A curious, frightened look comes over her face. Clearly, she recognizes him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She suddenly JUMPS from the bed and runs out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_RODNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a little jumpy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_RODNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Uncle Rodney smiles, amusing himself with his own joke.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_RODNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's begin shall we? And please... I'm going to use this tape for my fans, so let's try to get this right.

	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_RODNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Uncle Rodney starts in on his mantra. It's obvious that he's well versed in his meandering rant.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_RODNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those kids out there... we, the so called "undesirables" - you and me, we know the truth. You know that society doesn't want you, your parents don't want you, corporate America sure as fuck doesn't want you... You wouldn't be here otherwise.

No one respects us... No one sees what we have to offer... No one has compassion for us.... They don't care, or they're too naive to see that we're a by-product of a wasteful society that has failed to educate, embrace, influence, or inspire any of us. We're societal garbage. The counter culture no longer exists. It's dead... It's been replaced by us--

Long pause.

<UNCLE_RODNEY>

	The garbage culture... thrown aside, imprisoned, institutionalized, systematically abused, executed, and enlisted into wars started by government ass- fuckers just to kill us off. JUST TO KILL US OFF. And every week one of you shows up here, disillusioned, addicted, angry, pissed 'cuz they tossed you aside... into the garbage. Every time someone like you shows up here the garbage culture gets a little bit stronger and they get a little bit weaker. Until the "them" and the "they" of this country run out of places to put us, to put its garbage, and the garbage OVER-FLOWS into their cities from out of the confines of the spaces that they have set aside for us.

<UNCLE_RODNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what's here for you. That's what's here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_RODNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Rodney settles himself down and takes a few deep breaths as Jimmy begins zooming out. Uncle Rodney lights a cigarette to calm himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy keeps filming, not knowing whether Rodney is finished or just taking a break.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera shuts down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - FIRE PIT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone (Buddy) is filming a raging party consisting of a lot of strung out young white trash junkies just like the ones Jimmy was interviewing before. It's certainly a weird bunch. They all look alike, dress similar, and have the same type of crystal methamphetamine induced facial expressions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Most of them are smoking weed and drinking forty ounce beers while dancing around a campfire and playing the bongo drums. They all seem to be having more fun than anyone should be allowed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera pans to Jimmy, so we realize that he's not filming. Our best guess would be that it's Buddy who's filming. Jimmy screams at the camera over the noise of the Bongo drums.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Judy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Buddy's hand comes into frame as he points by the fire pit. We now see Jimmy see Judy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She dances fervently drinking a forty surrounded by tons of other drunk, happily intoxicated teenagers. Say what you might about the attendees to the event, this party is a FUCKING RAGER and Judy is happy to be the center of everyone's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone dances faster and faster as the rhythm of drums beat faster and become more intense. It's an all out jam session.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy heads to the center of the circle of people dancing around Judy. Camera follows him with a zoom as he does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUMP CUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Who knows how much later. Minutes or hours, the party rages forward. The camera spins around. The party has reached a new level of drunken absurdity. Most of those who are dancing are drunk, stoned or both.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the background, while it's too dark and hectic see anything explicit, some of the teenagers are engaged in a variety of sexual activity. Some have threesomes. Some are probably having oral sex. Still others dance around them in the foreground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera zooms in on Uncle Rodney.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing just behind him, we see of flash of someone recognizable. It's a skinny woman, she looks vaguely familiar, but it's hard to get a fix with all the craziness going on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns her head to look over at Rodney.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we can clearly see that this person is...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAZEL - with her eyes wide and clearly in the height of rolling on crank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND she's saying something to Uncle Rodney that's definitely pissing him off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bodies wipe the frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUMP CUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moments later. Camera catches Judy who hasn't missed a step along the way to being a high, drunken mess. The rhythm of the drum beats is ever present.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Uncle Rodney comes up behind her and wraps his arms around her shoulder, saying something to her, but we can't hear it over the noise. Jimmy approaches and they start talking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy doesn't notice, but there are about four or five of the kids, especially a couple of Rodney's Bigger Guys standing not too far behind Uncle Rodney watching the conversation intensely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's really difficult to put your finger on it exactly, but something doesn't seem right here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Uncle Rodney lets go of Judy and puts his arm around Jimmy. With the noise of the drums and the fact that we're zoomed in from a distance, we can't hear anything they're saying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Uncle Rodney and Jimmy are having a conversation as they move towards the camera. Though Jimmy can't see it, we can see that Rodney's Bigger Guys, the ones that were standing behind Uncle Rodney are now pushing Judy along behind Jimmy and Rodney. Though Uncle Rodney seems to be having a very light and friendly conversation with Jimmy, we continue to get the feeling that something ominous is afoot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, they approach camera and we can hear them.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_RODNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so glad you guys came down here. We never would have guessed you'd come and see us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_RODNEY>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been awesome. Judy loves it here.
	</DIALOGUE>

Uncle Rodney's got Jimmy in an incredibly friendly one armed side hug.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_RODNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew she would. By the way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_RODNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Rodney's face drops.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_RODNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you did to Dinko.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_RODNEY>
<DIRECTION>
This hits Jimmy like a lead weight. Before he can react at all, and before he realizes that anything is happening, Jimmy is suddenly thrown into a headlock by Uncle Rodney.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Off camera, something similar is happening to Judy.

CAMERA ON:

EXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - DARK WOODS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear intense struggling and laughter. By the sounds we hear, we gather that Jimmy and Judy are being dragged off into the woods against their will by Buddy and Rodney's Bigger Guys, but it's too dark to tell if that is what in fact is happening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone unidentified is running the show and operates the camera. It's impossible to see, but it's definitely Buddy's voice.

MUNCH. Somewhere in the darkness Jimmy's been kicked in the gut. The camera hits the ground. It lands right in front of Jimmy. We can still barely see what's going on, but we're close enough and there's enough flashes of light from flashlights to see that Jimmy is face down and bloody.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>

	Fuck you!

<DIRECTION>
Jimmy gets kicked again just once. Then suddenly, a barrage of kicks come at Jimmy one after the other after the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leaves and grass and dirt and flying feet shoot at Jimmy's face as he is kicked and beaten repeatedly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The process goes on for about thirty excruciating seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can't tell how much damage has been sustained, but Jimmy's not moving. He's either unconscious or dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With one last kick, the camera is knocked aside and we don't see Jimmy's face anymore.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Noooooo! Noooooo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy screams at the top of her lungs over and over again as we hear them tearing at her clothes. Then they pick her up and start pulling her away from camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her screams get quieter and quieter... fainter and fainter.
</DIRECTION>

</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Finally there's silence. The camera isn't moving. It's on the ground and in the dark. Camera shuts down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - PARKING AREA - DINKO'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's completely pitch black dark. We can see nothing. We can only hear the sound of Jimmy fumbling around and breathing heavily and nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEGIN NITE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, we see everything, albeit in a weird black and white grainy fashion. Jimmy's flipped the camera into Nite Shot, using the fuzzy black and white mode as a tool to see in the complete darkness. He's strapped the camera to his wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The image is Jimmy's POV as he searches through his trunk for something. Pulling aside a duffle bag, we see the 9mm pistol that Jimmy stole from the Cop. He grabs it as camera shuts down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - FIRE PIT/OUTSIDE RODNEY'S TRAIER/INSIDE RODNEYS TRAILER/PARKING AREA/DINKO'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By the fire pit, the site where the teenage drunken of orgy took place, the bonfire has been put out and there are dozens of drunken/passed out teenagers lying on the ground in sleeping bags and in tents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy begins looking for Judy with his night vision camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees a girl lying on the ground in a sleeping bag with her back turned to the camera. Her hair is identical to Judy's, but we can't see her face. Jimmy quietly steps over passed out teenagers, being extremely careful not to awaken anyone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy accidently kicks a forty ounce beer bottle that causes a loud clanking sound of glass on glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy stops in his tracks in anticipation of someone waking up. No one does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy continues to walk towards the GIRL WHO LOOKS LIKE JUDY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kneeling directly in front of her, Jimmy puts his hands on her shoulder and pulls the girl's front region towards the camera. The girl flips over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's not Judy. And luckily, the girl is so severely intoxicated that she doesn't wake up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy now makes his way over to a tent. He quietly unzips the mesh entrance and extends his arm out to video tape the inside. Turns out, the person in the tent is just another passed out flunky loser. Jimmy quickly takes his arm out of the tent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy gives it one last go and continues to look for Judy among the sea of passed out bodies lying on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No luck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's not too far from Uncle Rodney's trailer. He decides to make his way up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks, using his Nite Shot to see, through the sea of bodies until he gets up to the entrance...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a cracked glass door leaning up against the woodpile by the entrance. Jimmy steps around it, turning the lens at the glass. He briefly catches his reflection. He looks like hell warmed over, freshly bruised and cut from the recent beating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving forward, Jimmy makes it to the front door of Uncle Rodney's trailer. We hear music coming from inside. Very slowly and very carefully, Jimmy cracks the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's even darker inside of the trailer, but Jimmy presses forward in spite of that fact, still using his Nite Shot to see. A boom box sits by the bed, still on, playing music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy is scared shitless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the corner of the room, in a make shift bunk, is Uncle Rodney sleeping with his arms wrapped around a girl in a spooning position. There's no doubt this time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's definitely JUDY!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are both sound asleep and actually look very cozy lying together. Jimmy slowly walks over towards them. Each step is slower and slower, being extra careful not to wake them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once Jimmy is within arm's length of the two of them he stops. He hesitates for a moment. He hasn't prepared himself for this particular situation and doesn't know exactly what to do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He continues filming them until he finally musters the courage to extend his non-filming arm out to tap Judy on the face. Judy remains unconscious/sleeping as Jimmy gently taps the side of her cheek. Jimmy slowly begins tapping harder and harder until the tap evolves into a poke. Still nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THWACK! An arm comes out of nowhere and grabs Jimmy's poking hand. Jimmy has woken up Uncle Rodney!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera shakes out of control. Uncle Rodney screams at the top of his lungs:
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_RODNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the fuck...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_RODNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Intense and furious wrestling ensues as Uncle Rodney flies out of frame then, in a split second:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gunshot goes off. We hear a Uncle Rodney collapse, followed by more gun shots. The camera has fallen from Jimmy's hand and dangles by the wrist strap. Camera comes to rest on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNCLE RODNEY'S BLOODY FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's shot and killed him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, footsteps hit the deck. Buddy opens the door of the trailer.
</DIRECTION>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
BAM, BAM, BAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three more rounds are fired, hitting Buddy square in the chest, knocking him down. Jimmy points the camera at a dead Buddy on his back then whip pans it back to Judy in the bed. Finally we hear Jimmy speak.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Judy, Judy, wake up. Fucking wake up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Outside we hear voices of some of Rodney's Other Teens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy acts fast. Judy has been drugged and is mostly unconscious and groggy, but Jimmy picks her up and gets her on her feet, shouldering her out the door. Shot continues to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear faint voices...
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODNEY_S_BIG_GUY_3>
<DIRECTION>
A DISTANT GUNSHOT FIRES, but we can't see what is going on. It's too dark and the camera is too shaky as they go to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARKING AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another DISTANT SHOT, then Jimmy gasps in pain. He's been shot, but decides to run, trying to carry a groggy Judy anyway. Their car is in sight as we hear guns going off and bullets whizzing by them. One hits Dinko's car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy opens the door, then places the passed out Judy and the camera in the passenger seat, climbs over her, throwing the camera into Judy's lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see him scramble to get the key in the ignition as we hear a BULLET HIT the driver's door. The car starts, and Jimmy throws it into gear, flooring the gas as he speeds away.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Judy? Judy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing.

	Are you all right baby? Please wake up Judy. Judy?
	</DIALOGUE>

We don't know if Judy is dead or alive.

Jimmy swerves to avoid something in the road sending the camera to the floor as camera shuts down.

	Mexicooooooh....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Judy points the camera up at Jimmy. This is the first time we've seen him at all since he was beaten up by Uncle Rodney's group. He's a wreck. His face is puffy. His lip is cut up. His eye is swollen. He looks like a flyweight boxer who just went fifteen rounds with a heavyweight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drives with one arm because the other one is in a bandage.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy looks like a beaten man, both physically and emotionally. His bad ass attitude and rebellious charisma are seemingly non-existent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For the first time, we are seeing Jimmy without his armor. He looks like any other 21 year old kid who is down, vulnerable, and confused. Not to mention the fact that he has a fucking bullet lodged in his shoulder.

<DIRECTION>
Impact sends the camera flying against the windshield, CRACKING IT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sounds of metal twisting and glass shattering is all encompassing as the camera shakes in a violent frenzy!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera settles on Judy's face, bloody, unconscious against the steering wheel, her neck snapped, eyes open in a death stare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera stays focussed on Judy for the longest time as she leans against the steering wheel. Music plays on the radio. It's JOHNNY CASH's cover of Tom Petty's "I won't Back Down".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVERHEAD SHOT of a news helicopter flying above the final scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking down from above, we see what the helicopter sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A scene of about twelve State Trooper cars, lights flashing, with Jimmy and Judy's car wrecked. Ambulances are there. Jimmy and Judy's lifeless bodies are pulled from their car as Johnny Cash's song shifts from background to score.

The helicopter continues its circular pattern as the song continues and we...

FADE TO BLACK.
