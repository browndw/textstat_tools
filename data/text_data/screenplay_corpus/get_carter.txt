A blinding beam of light cuts across the room. One pornographic slide after another hits the screen at the opposite end of the room. They show a dowdy group in some anonymous bedroom, frozen in various stages of a sexual orgy.

GERALD FLETCHER is slumped on a sofa. His young wife, ANNA, is curled up beside him.

Jack Carter, drink in hand, watches from an armchair.

<DIRECTION>
Clunk. Another slide hits the screen. Gerald is getting turned on. He runs his hand along his wife's stockinged leg. Anna shudders momentarily. She obviously finds his touch repulsive. Carter watches Gerald's hand.

An unmade bed with pyjamas on it, a beaten-up wardrobe, a dressing table and chair are about it. Carter hears a vehicle stopping on the street below. He eases back the ancient net curtain. Two men in a Land Rover are looking up. They see him and quickly drive off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter looks around the room. On top of the wardrobe there's an old shotgun. He reaches up and brings it down. Memories flood back. He reaches up again and finds a box of cartridges. More memories, jack and Frank grew up here. He leaves the gun on the bed and returns to the landing.

An overhead light snaps on to the face of a dead man FRANK CARTER. He is lying in a coffin. His eyes are closed, his skin made-up, like porcelain.

DOREEN CARTER is sixteen and, like most girls of her age, tries to look older. She wears all the right gear but it's cheap and doesn't fit properly. Her long hair is lank. There's something sad and embarrassing about her appearance. The young undertaker watches as she enters Frank's house.

<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absent friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He raises his glass
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and drinks, then continues
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
thoughtfully.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't think he might have done it on purpose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<KEITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? You mean, like, kill himself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEITH>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie and Keith look at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doreen watches them. She is getting very upset by the conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<KEITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naw. Frank? Kill himself? You what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEITH>
<DIRECTION>
Carter stares at Keith, who is getting uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<KEITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, what for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEITH>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I was wondering.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<KEITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEITH>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<KEITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It just would. He was always the same.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEITH>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since when did he drink whisky?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<KEITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEITH>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody seems to know.

</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Doreen is now crying openly.

<EDDIE>

(finishing off his drink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bloody good bloke. One of the best.

</EDDIE>
<DOREEN>
<DIRECTION>
(blurts out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How would you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(She suddenly jumps
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	up and empties her glass in Eddie's
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
face.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or you? Or you? None of you knew. I knew. He was me dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOREEN>
<DIRECTION>
She runs off out of the door crying. Keith goes to follow. Carter puts his hand out to restrain him.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let her go. She'll be OK.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Eddie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(wiping his face with a handkerchief)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Eddie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have another?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie stands up, cap in hand. Carter pulls out a wad of money.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, look.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He peels off a note.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get your suit cleaned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It's all right.

</EDDIE>
<CARTER>

(standing, pushes
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	the note in his

<DIRECTION>
top pocket)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You work here, Keith?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<KEITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEITH>
<DIRECTION>
Carter thinks for a moment, then leans forward to Keith.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<KEITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEITH>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.

<DIRECTION>
(He casts an eye around the bar.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<KEITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEITH>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where would I find him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<KEITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Today? At the races. He always goes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEITH>
<DIRECTION>
Carter takes out his phial of pills.
</DIRECTION>
<KEITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you know Albert?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEITH>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Went to school with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.

:SC: EXT. RACE TRACK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rain has just stopped. Bookies and punters lower their umbrellas. Horses thunder towards the finishing post. Turf flies in all directions as the jockeys whip their mounts in a last desperate effort and the crowd roars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. TRACK ENCLOSURE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Albert Swift is standing by a bookmaker's marking bis race card with a biro. A hot dog is sticking out of his mouth, like a cigar. A man of about thirty-five, be appears much older, probably from an excess of booze and women. He looks up, and his mouth drops open, the hot dog falling to the ground. He has seen Carter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. TRACK ENCLOSURE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter is pushing his way along the line of bookies, all the time looking about him. The track loudspeaker announces the winner of the last race.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. TRACK ENCLOSURE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Albert pales. He holds his race card in front of his face and disappears into the crowd. As he moves off, his foot steps on the hot dog and tomato ketchup oozes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. TRACK SADDLING ENCLOSURE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter stands alone, casting an eye over the punters. His eyes rest on someone the other side of the saddling ring ERIC PAICE. Dressed in a grey chauffeur's uniform, cap, dark glasses and gloves, he is standing close to three well-heeled-looking men with binoculars and shooting sticks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Horses for the next race are being led around the enclosure. Carter approaches from behind. He looks at Eric closely before speaking.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grey suits you, Eric.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Eric swings round, startled.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>

Carter smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>

	What you doing around here then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you know this is my home town?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I didn't know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Funny, that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Carter takes out his cigarettes. Eric takes one.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'm visiting relatives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would be. If they were still living.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Meaning what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A bereavement. A death in the family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all right, Eric.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Carter flicks bis lighter and gives Eric a, light.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, well. Small world, isn't it?

</ERIC>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>

</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Eric smiles back.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brumby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Eric shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kinnear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Eric shakes his head
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's it to you anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not always a healthy way to be...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you should know, if I remember rightly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
A track announcement interrupts them.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Making a living.

</ERIC>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good prospects for advancement, is there? A pension?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He can't resist it
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	any longer. He lifts the sunglasses off Eric's nose and looks into his
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
eyes.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know, I'd almost forgotten what your eyes looked like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Eric stares back.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still got a sense of humour?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I retained that, Eric.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He moves towards
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	the saddling ring
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
and turns to Eric.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't say I do.

Starting gates slam open and the horses leap out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HIRE CAR - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter is driving along a country road. Ahead, two cars are between him and a Cadillac with dark-tinted windows. The Cadillac turns on to a minor road. Carter follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CADILLAC - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric Paice is driving. In the back sit the three men seen with him at the race track. The drinks compartment is open and they are helping themselves to champagne. Racing results come over the car radio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HIRE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter follows the Cadillac at a safe distance. It turns into a driveway. Carter slows down and reads a sign by the entrance: The Heights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drives on and parks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. THE HEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter comes through a wooded area. He pauses by a lake, now overgrown with weeds. A big man stands tossing stones into the water. Carter silently picks up a dead branch then runs at the man. Carter whacks him on the head and he collapses unconscious into the lake. Carter moves on towards the house. MARTY and RAY the two men previously seen in the Land Rover, are playing with an Alsatian on the spacious lawn fronting the house. It's a Victorian building surrounded by acres of woodland.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter breaks from the trees and darts for the side door. One of the men notices and shouts after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. THE HEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter runs into the house and slips into a small service room. Ray and then Marty charge inside but miss seeing Carter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A game of poker is in progress. Seated around the table are the three men with Eric at the race track. With them is an elegant man, CYRIL KINNEAR. On the sofa are GLENDA, a sexy-looking young woman, and Eric Paice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray bursts in.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carter's here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Eric jumps up.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where?

</ERIC>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You stupid shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Carter walks past Ray, blowing him a kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kinnear watches with some amusement.
</DIRECTION>
<KINNEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see what it's like these days, Jack. You can't get the material.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KINNEAR>
<DIRECTION>
Carter looks at Eric.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<KINNEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down, Jack,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to girl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KINNEAR>
<CARTER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Scotch, please.

<KINNEAR>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Piss off, Ray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KINNEAR>
<DIRECTION>
Ray closes the door behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Glenda brings Carter his Scotch. He looks at her as she sits beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<KINNEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eric told me of your bereavement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KINNEAR>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<KINNEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KINNEAR>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No? Funny that. Neither did I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<KINNEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KINNEAR>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<KINNEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nasty way to go.

</KINNEAR>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
One of the three men sitting around the table with Kinnear gets impatient. PETER, LES AND HARRY are well-heeled, middle- aged, northern businessmen.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<KINNEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses. Give him the bloody bottle.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He picks up his cards.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, where are we?

</KINNEAR>

Harry keeps a cold, wary eye on him.

</CARTER>
<HARRY>

</HARRY>
<CARTER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry, I don't like to push, but could you let us know how much your hand's worth?

</HARRY>
<KINNEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>

Kinnear lays more cash on the table.

Harry looks sick.

	Well now, Thorpey. It seems I've got a secret benefactor.

Thorpe looks longingly at the bottle of Scotch. Suddenly Carter punches him hard in the stomach. He grunts and collapses into a chair.

<CARTER>

	Now, I want to know who it is, Thorpey.

Carter tosses the whisky bottle to Keith and continues wearily.

<CARTER>

Thorpe looks at him, terrified. Slowly he stands. Carter grabs him by the testicles and applies preasure. Thorpe screams.

<DIRECTION>
It's a large, new, ranch-style house, set back from the road. The front garden is a landscape gardener's nightmare, with its phoney brick and wrought-iron wishing well, porcelain dwarfs, lily pond, the lot. Fairy lights hang over everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a party going on. Lights are on in every room and the rock music is loud. The drive is lined with sports cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter parks and gets out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of a side door a young man stumbles towards the lily pond. There, he promptly throws up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter watches from behind a tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His attention shifts to the white Bentley turning into the drive. It brakes sharply and the driver jumps out.

CLIFF BRUMBY has been to a police ball. He is impeccably dressed in tuxedo and white scarf. Now he's hopping mad.

The rest is lost as he disappears inside. He then powers out through the side door
</DIRECTION>
<BRUMBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... spewing over my fucking goldfish.

</BRUMBY>
<DIRECTION>
He aims a kick at the young man's backside, sending him face-down into the lily pond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs Brumby gets out of the car and hovers for a moment. As she approaches the house, people pour out. Brumby appears at the door with a boy pulling up his trousers.

Mrs Brumby goes into the house and closes the door. Brumby passes an upstairs window as Sandra locks herself in a bedroom.

<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, tell him the Fletchers sent me.

Mrs Brumby is uncertain what to do. Carter sits in an armchair to make his point. She leaves. A moment later Brumby storms into the room.

<BRUMBY>

Carter starts to laugh. He realizes Thorpe has lied to him. Brumby isn't his man.

Carter moves to the door.

Brumby moves between him and the door.

	Listen, I don't like it when some hard nut comes pushing his way in and out my house in the middle of the night.

Carter again makes to leave. Brumby stops him.

Brumby swings at him. Carter moves away from the punch, then applies several sharp blows to Brumby's head and neck. Brumby groans and collapses into the armchair, hurt.

Carter's car screeches as it corners from the alley on to the road. Peter is leaning against the open door of the Jaguar. When he sees Carter coming straight at him, he scarpers for the pavement. Carter hits the Jaguar's door at speed, tearing it off. It flies up and crashes on to the tarmac as Carter careers over the wasteground. Soon he is out of sight.

Con comes running. Peter is looking at the damage.

They look at each other for a moment. Carter shakes his head. He gently takes the sunglasses from Margaret's face and folds them up.

</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
He smacks her hard across the face. Margaret cries out. The car draws alongside. A steel mesh separates the pedestrian way from the traffic, so the two men can't get to Carter until he reaches the end of the bridge. Con leans out, his usual cheery self.

Carter comes running down the steps with Con not far behind. He arrives at the river road. In the distance, he can see his parked car.

As he nears the car park, Peter's Jaguar comes down the hill. It's going to cut Carter off from his car.

A Sunbeam Alpine sports car waits there. Its engine roars into life and it races out of the car park. It reaches him just before the Jaguar and slows down.

Carter sees that the driver is GLENDA. The hood is down, so he vaults into the car as it accelerates off.

The Sunbeam swings round, narrowly missing the oncoming Jaguar, and roars away. Peter hasn't a chance. He's facing the wrong way and has little room to manoeuvre.

Glenda laughs as the car swings wildly around a corner at the top of the hill.

</GLENDA>
<DIRECTION>
Glenda leaves for the bathroom. Carter, curious, looks at the film projector. It's loaded. He switches it on. A beam of light hits the opposite wall. He settles down to watch the film. The leader flashes by, then a title being chalked on a school blackboard 'The Teacher's Pet'. A zoom back reveals Glenda, bare-breasted, holding the chalk. This is followed by a long shot of a young girl, dressed in school uniform, waiting at a bus stop. A car approaches and stops. A woman driver offers the girl a lift. The woman is Margaret. The identity of the girl not revealed.

:SC: INT. GLENDA'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter is sitting up on the mattress, amused by the soft porn unfolding on the white wall in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The schoolgirl accepts the lift and the car drives off. The door to an anonymous apartment opens and Margaret comes in with the girl. Her school hat still hides her identity. Glenda is there to greet them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girl is very awkward. Glenda tries to make her relax, sitting her down and showing her a magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Glenda brings her into a bedroom. She takes her own top off and goes to do the same with the girl. She takes her hat off. A close-up shows that it is Doreen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter tenses but never flinches from what's happening in the film. Margaret comes into the bedroom and feigns shock at what she sees. She slaps Glenda and they start fighting, eventually rolling off the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The apartment door opens and a man smoking a big cigar comes in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter sits up. It's Albert Swift.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Albert opens another door, looking for someone. He leaves. Another door opens and he's in the bedroom. He sees the two women fighting on the floor, but on the bed is his prize Doreen. Carter watches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doreen bites her nails and looks terrified. Reflected in the mirror behind Carter is the image of Albert taking off his trousers. The reel runs out and flaps like a fish. Carter doesn't move. Tears form in his eyes. He looks old and defeated. His is a wasted life. Then the anger that drives him explodes again and he throws back the bedclothes.

There's a big party going on. The music is loud. It's mainly rich-looking middle-aged men and young dolly birds. Different things are obviously going on in different rooms in the house. Dancing in one room, blue movies in another, etc. Kinnear flits from one to another. Eric Paice is on the phone. He puts the receiver down and crosses to Kinnear.

	It's Carter. Listen carefully, you hairy-faced git. I've got the film and enough evidence to put you away for a long time. All it takes is one call to the police.

Carter and Margaret get out. They appear in the beam of the headlights and move further into the wood.

<CARTER>

</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Margaret is confused. Take your clothes off. Margaret does just that: coat, blouse, skin. She goes to remove her knickers.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep your pants on.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lie down.

</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Again she obeys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He kneels on her, pinning her arms with his knees, then stuffs a gag in her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out the hypodermic, places it against her arm, and injects the heroin into her. She struggles, her eyes moving frantically about. She screams, but its muffled by the gag. Carter holds her down and she quickly goes under. Carter removes the gag. He stands, picks her up and walks into the darkness with Margaret in his arms.

Kinnear is alone, speaking on the telephone quietly. The party is still going on.

</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
He taps his cigarette against the ashtray. On his middle finger is a large ring with the initial 'J' on it. He listens until the line goes dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman beside him stirs. He stubs out the cigarette and switches off the light. Darkness.

Eric comes out of the front door. Inside the party is still in progress. He gets into a Cadillac and drives off.

<DIRECTION>
Carter is parked where he can see the drive up to Kinnear's house.
</DIRECTION>

The Cadillac appears and swings on to the road.

<DIRECTION>
There's the sound of a phone being dialled.

	Police.

</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long line of police cars move slowly up the drive, followed by a police bus. They park by the front door and around fifty policemen pour out. They move silently around the building. A chief constable opens the front door and walks in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The police move through the house and grounds. In the bedrooms they find groups of people in bed together. The men in particular protest and are obviously concerned about being identified. The police find evidence of drugs, pornography and so on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, police are combing the grounds. In the long grass leading down to the lake they find women's clothes. They follow the trail until they discover a woman floating naked, face downwards, in the lake. A policeman with waders goes in and pulls her to the side. As others heave her out, we see that it's Margaret.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house is surrounded by police measuring and photographing, and outside the house are police cars and ambulances. The lawn is crowded with the party crowd. In the early-morning light, they look like dolls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kinnear comes out of the front door with two plain-clothes officers and gets in a police car. Sirens going, it comes down the short drive to the gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HIRE CAR - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter is driving along a coast road. The sea and a wide beach lie on his right. Long rows of houses are to his left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun is still low. It's very quiet. He arrives at a harbour and drives on until he reaches the end of a vast wooden jetty running out into the estuary. It's a coal loader for tankers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This jetty is very high, a complex of wooden staves and pillars, interwoven with steps and gangways. On its top tier is a complex of railway lines, signals and black coal chutes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. COAL JETTY - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter parks his car and picks up the shotgun and a bottle of Scotch off the back seat. He get out and walks over to the jetty and along a lower gangway. At the far end, a man is standing. It's Eric Paice. Eric turns around abruptly. He sees Carter and disappears up the nearest stairway. Carter follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the top he stops to listen, but can see and hear only the harbour waters lapping below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter looks back to the coal jetty, just in time to see Eric scamper down to the level below. Eric sprints for the roadway. Carter waits and then starts running directly above him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric keeps running. Carter stays always overhead. He's playing cat and mouse with Eric.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Paice darts down another staircase to ground level and makes for the roadway. Carter stops above the roadway. Below, Paice makes for the parked car. Carter holds the gun up. Eric stops and looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay away from the car or I'll blow you apart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Eric darts under the jetty. Carter runs on down the steps. He can see Eric scampering along the row of cottages towards the beach. Carter starts after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric runs out on to the beach. The only sounds are his feet pounding the pebbles and his hurtful panting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, factory chimneys belch out smoke. Carter appears. For a moment he watches Eric stumbling along at the far end of the beach. He climbs down to the beach and starts running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter is gaining on Eric rapidly. Eric looks round and panics. He stumbles and falls over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets to his feet quickly and disappears round the headland. Carter follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the other side of the headland, the scene is extraordinary. The deserted beach is like the edge of the world. The sand is black as far as the eye can see. It's littered with rubbish. Several old lorries are sunk deep in the sand. High, grass-covered cliffs flank it on the left. It's deserted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, a continuous line of giant black buckets move, like cable-cars, out to sea, before they deposit their load of coal slag and move inland again. The coal mine itself is inland, hidden away behind the cliffs. The sea, like the sand, is black as it crashes on to the shore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric is half-way along the beach, struggling in the mud. Carter closes on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric nears the line of buckets and cuts inland towards the mine. Carter has nearly caught up. The buckets grind and crash as they move along the cable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric scrambles up the narrow valley down which the coal slag travels. He is panting horribly. Carter is close on his heels. Near the top, where the buckets are practically at ground level, Eric stumbles and falls. He is too exhausted to get up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter stands over him.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
(panting slightly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stand up, Eric. Stand up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Eric just manages it. Carter pulls the bottle of Scotch out of his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet you could use a drink, could you, Eric?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
He throws the bottle to Eric.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eh? Have a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still got your sense of humour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Eric takes the cap off and looks at Carter. He's in a terrible state.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drink up, Eric. Drink up. I want you to drink all of that. Do you understand? Drink up. Just like it was with my brother, Frank. Go on, son. Drink up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Eric pours the whisky into his month. It spills over and runs down his face.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drink up, Eric.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Eric begins to stagger about.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was you who poured it down him. Eh, Eric?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Eric takes a breather and looks pathetically at Carter. No mercy there.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you all have a good laugh, eh? Did you have a good laugh when he was spewing it up? The whisky is pouring all over Eric's face and suit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
It's disgusting to watch. Suddenly, he retches, but nothing comes up.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drink it! Drink it! Did you all pass the bottle round after the car went over the top?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Eric is choking.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't stop, Eric.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Carter leans forward and with his free hand lifts the bottle up to Eric's mouth again. In the other, he holds the shotgun. Eric chokes and retches. Carter has seen enough.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Eric.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Carter raises the butt of the gun and brings it down on Eric's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric's body, loaded on to a a coal bucket, moves off on it's final journey. Carter, laughing, walks beside it, gun riding on his shoulder. The bucket shudders and grinds as it moves along the cable. Eric's body moves of on its final journey. It reaches the end of the line, where an automatic catch tilts it. Eric's body drops into the sea. The coal slag follows in a cloud of black dust. The waves pass over and everything is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter stands for a moment, turns and walks back along the beach. He stops, looks at the shotgun, and decides to get rid of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CLIFF TOP - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below, Carter moves slowly by the edge of the sea. He raises the shotgun to throw it away. High on the clifftop a rifle and telescopic lens line up on Carter. A finger curls around the trigger. On the middle finger of the same hand is a large gold ring with the letter 'J' engraved upon it. It is the man Kinnear contacted after sending Eric to his death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The finger tightens on the trigger and pulls it. There's a quiet, whooshing sound. Carter drops to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BEACH - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter lies on the beach. The waves lap around his head. A small trickle of blood pours out of a hole in his temple. He's dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CLIFF TOP - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kinnear's hit man coolly dismantles his rifle. He carefully wraps it in a cloth fishing-rod carrier. He walks off and is soon lost as he drops out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:

<DIRECTION>
THE END
