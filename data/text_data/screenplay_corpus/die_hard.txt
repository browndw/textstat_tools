405 FREEWAY - LOS ANGELES - EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christmas tinsel on the light poles. We ARE LOOKING east past Inglewood INTO the orange grid of L.A. at night when suddenly we TILT UP TO CATCH the huge belly of a landing 747 -- the noise is deafening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 747 - PASSENGERS - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The usual moment just after landing when you let out that sigh of relief that you've made it in one piece. As the plane TAXIS to its gate, they stir, gather personal belongings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON JOHN MCCLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
mid-thirties, good-looking, athletic and tired from his trip. He sits by the window. His relief on landing is subtle, but we NOTICE. Suddenly, he hears --
</DIRECTION>
<SALESMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't like flying, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALESMAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
McClane turns, looks at the Babbit clone next to him. Caught, he tenses, holds his armrests in exaggerated fear.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, where'd you get that idea?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<SALESMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ya wanna know the secret of successful air travel? After you get where you're going, ya take off your shoes and socks. Then ya walk around on the rug barefoot and make fists with your toes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALESMAN>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fists with your toes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<SALESMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's not a fist when it's your toes...I mean like this...work out that time zone tension.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(demonstrating)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better'n a cup of coffee and a hot shower for the old jet lag. I know it sounds crazy. Trust me. I've been doing it for nine years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALESMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The plane stops. Passengers rise, start to take down overhead luggage. McClane does this, but as he opens the door above, the businessman BLANCHES seeing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS P.O.V. - MCCLANE'S BARETTA PISTOL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peeking out from his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Recognizing the look, McClane smiles reassuringly.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(showing badge)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a cop.

<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trust me. I've been doing it for eleven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
The businessman relaxes, moves off. McClane now wrestles down the biggest Teddy Bear FAO Schwartz had to offer. Balancing this, he moves down to another overhead, takes out a topcoat and an overnighter. Barely managing all this, he turns, COLLIDING WITH:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PRETTY STEWARDESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She bumps noses with the bear, gives a look.
</DIRECTION>
<STEWARDESS>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling, about the bear)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you should have bought her a ticket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEWARDESS>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
He scrutinizes the nether regions of the bear, shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She doesn't complain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<STEWARDESS>
<DIRECTION>
(eying him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither would I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEWARDESS>
<DIRECTION>
McClane smiles, with just enough of a sigh to know he's as wistful about things-that-might-have-been as she is...moves down the aisle.

INT. THE NAKATOMI BUILDING (LOS ANGELES) - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON A bottle of Dom Perignon as the cork explodes across a large office floor decorated for Christmas. A Japanese man, mid-fifties standing on a desk holds up the bottle triumphantly and looks out at an adoring audience of junior executives and office personnel. He is JOSEPH TAKAGI, Sr V.P. of Sales for Nakatomi, a multinational corporation.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
In the b.g., obviously still at work, an attractive BUSINESSWOMAN in her mid-thirties, studying a computer printout, heads toward her office. Falling into step with her is HARRY ELLIS, thirty-seven, V.P. of Sales. Well-dressed, with stylish, slicked-back hair, he looks and acts very smooth.

</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her name is HOLLY GENNARO MCCLANE, though the nameplate on her door stops after the first two. She puts the printout down on her secretary's desk.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIS>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was thinking more of roaring fireplaces...mulled wine and a nice brie...

Holly ignores the come-on, turns to her secretary.

<HOLLY>

Holly just points to the door. He follows Ginny out, clearly not giving up. Just then the party on Holly's phone picks up and we:

<HOLLY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Lucy McClane. This is your mother.

Lucy hands the phone to a young Salvadorian woman, PAULINA, the housekeeper.

Holly hides a trace of disappointment.

<HOLLY>

INT. LAX - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag, comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal. He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an act which drives him into another fender bender with a CUTE GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma. As she smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic gear and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
(sotto, to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	California.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around the terminal at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS P.O.V. - TERMINAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FAMILY REUNIONS are going on all around his as grandparents greet grown children and their children, YOUNG WIVES greet uniformed SOLDIERS, our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant wife and two pleasant kids. It's all very traditional, very touching and not the least bit corny.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting. Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform. As he waits he beats out a rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J. McCLANE written on it in magic marker. McClane pauses in front of him, unsure.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm John McClane.

</MCCLANE>
<ARGYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(introducing himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Argyle. I'm your limo driver. Hey, nice bag.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARGYLE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and starts walking. McClane paces him, still juggling bag and giant animal.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Argyle. Don't you take this stuff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<ARGYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(stops)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I? I'm sorry. You're gonna have to help me, man. This is my first time driving a limo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARGYLE>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's okay. This is my first time riding in one.

<DIRECTION>
TILT UP from the Lincoln emblem on the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both Argyle and McClane are in the front seat.
</DIRECTION>
<ARGYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just kick back and relax, man. We got everything you need: CD, CB, TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARGYLE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks in the back seat, which is occupied by the bear.
</DIRECTION>
<ARGYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to McClane)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Or is he married?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARGYLE>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell. He scowls at Argyle.
</DIRECTION>
<ARGYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The girl was off today. Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(back to the topic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, your lady live out here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARGYLE>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The past six months.

	Meanwhile, you still live in New York?

	<DIALOGUE>
	You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<ARGYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I'm sorry. When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
(instantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you divorced of what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARGYLE>
<DIRECTION>
McClane gives up.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<ARGYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But meant her moving here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARGYLE>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Closer to Japan. You're fast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<ARGYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, why didn't you come?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARGYLE>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<ARGYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the point)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARGYLE>
<DIRECTION>
McClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<ARGYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(popping in a cassette)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mind if I play some tunes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARGYLE>
<DIRECTION>
A hard RAP SONG blasts from the speakers.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How 'bout some Christmas music?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<ARGYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is Christmas music.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARGYLE>
<DIRECTION>
And damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run DMC doing a revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something. McClane gives up, looks out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Convertibles with Christmas trees in their back seats, Time/Temperature signs which reads: 69 degrees, palm trees trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token "Happy Chanukahs"...it is clear that Christmas L.A. style has its own unique style.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LIMO - CENTURY CITY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TILT DOWN FROM one of the stars of this film, the well-lit, impressive and spanking-new NAKATOMI BUILDING. The limo pulls up, parks, and Argyle gets out. McClane lets himself out, which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to do it. They both go to the rear of the vehicle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NAKATOMI BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Argyle climbs out of the limo and stops by the trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<ARGYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms. Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARGYLE>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's corny, but I could live with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<ARGYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARGYLE>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll find someplace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up at the highrise lit by huge spotlights, then back at Argyle who's made no attempt to open the trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<ARGYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell you what. I'll pull into the parking garage and wait. You score with your wife give me a call on the car phone and I'll leave your bags inside at the desk. You strike out... I'll get you to a hotel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARGYLE>
<DIRECTION>
He hands McClane a business card with the number on it.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
(taking the number)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're all right, Argyle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<ARGYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just remember that when you sign for the tip.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to the building)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're paying for it, so don't be shy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARGYLE>
<DIRECTION>
McClane grins, heads inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NAKATOMI LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beautiful and -- on first glance -- deserted. Finally a SOUND in the sterile lobby reveals the presence of a SECURITY GUARD hidden until now behind a massive desk. McClane goes there, signs in.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holly McClane?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
The Guard points to a prominent touch screen computer console.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just type it in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
McClane is confused for a moment, then he moves to the screen. He gives the Guard a look...the Guard raises his eyebrows as if to say give it a try.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCREEN - CLOSER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane types, "McClane, Holly". Pause. The screen replies, NO SUCH EMPLOYEE LISTED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MCCLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frowns...thinks. Simultaneously inspired and suspicious, he types again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane types, GENNERO, HOLLY. This time the screen CHANGES, shows an elevation of the building and then a floor plan of the 30th floor with Holly's office BLINKING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cute toy.
	</DIALOGUE>

<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. When you have to take a leak it'll help you find your zipper.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirtieth floor...

</MCCLANE>
<GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take the express elevator and get off at the noise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
McClane nods, moves off. He moves to the elevators, and as he does his experienced eye takes in:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER SECURITY GUARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patrolling a different area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEVERAL HI-TECH CAMERAS AND SENSORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
which are cleverly worked into the decor of the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane reacts with bored professionalism, NODS to the guard.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lots of hardware...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
The guard shrugs. McClane gets in the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane hits "30" and REACTS to the hyper-powered SPEED with which he rises. He rotates his head, getting out the travel cricks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he approaches the 30th floor we hear a tremendous THUMPING, THROBBING NOISE. McClane stops and listens before he realizes -- it's the party. As the doors open the noise ATTACKS us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
30TH FLOOR - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane moves around the edge of the party, gradually spiraling inward. He grabs a glass of Mimosa champagne punch from a passing tray, sips...scowls. Spotting open beers in an ice bucket, he tosses the punch into a potted plant, even burying the plastic glass. Sipping the beer, he moves through the dense party. People he doesn't know throw streamers over him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WOMAN kisses him. He grins. A MAN kisses him.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself, shaking his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	California...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
Finally he queries a DANCING WOMAN. The MUSIC drowns out their words but she nods, points off in some generic direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane heads that way, cuts around a Christmas tree, loses his bearings. He sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TAKAGI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who has an air of authority. McClane goes up to him.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, I'm looking for --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<TAKAGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holly Gennero?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKAGI>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. How'd you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<TAKAGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've spent half my life on airplanes, I can recognize someone who just got off one.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane. I have ...something to do with this company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKAGI>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I've heard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
Takagi smiles, leads the way. As they approach Holly's office door, McClane notices the name there is -- again -- "Gennero".
</DIRECTION>
<TAKAGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holly went to the Vault room to FAX some documents...she should be back any...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKAGI>
<DIRECTION>
HOLLY'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellis is behind the desk. He's SNIFFLING and just as they come in he SWEEPS the back of the slick desktop with his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both McClane and Takagi catch on...but Takagi tries to hide his awareness.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah...hi...I just had to make a quick call, and this was the nearest phone...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIS>
<TAKAGI>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ellis, this is John McClane...

(with meaning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holly's policeman?
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ellis is in charge of International Acquisitions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKAGI>
<MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking hands with Ellis)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That explains the recent deal with Bolivia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
Ellis REACTS, runs a checking finger under his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
(sotto)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine.

<DIRECTION>
(looking through the glass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You throw quite a party. I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<TAKAGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, we're flexible. Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKAGI>
<DIRECTION>
McClane laughs. He likes this guy.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, it's kind of a double celebration. We closed a pretty big deal today and a lot of it was due to Holly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIS>
<DIRECTION>
The door OPENS. Holly comes inside.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All set, Joe. The contracts went over the wire, and --

(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
MCCLANE AND HOLLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment. Does the sound of the party stop for him? We know it. For her? It's more cryptic. We sure hope so.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(recovering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was hoping you made that flight.

</HOLLY>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was hoping you were hoping that.

She laughs, kisses him on the cheek. Ellis notes the awkwardness.
</DIRECTION>
<TAKAGI>
<DIRECTION>
(to McClane)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.

<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I remember our first date.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<ELLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show him the watch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIS>
<DIRECTION>
As she hesitates:
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on, show him. What're you, embarrassed?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to McClane)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little token of our appreciation for all her work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIS>
<DIRECTION>
He takes Holly's wrist, holds it up. McClane smoothly takes the wrist away from Ellis, looks at the watch.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync. I think it's me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Holly, pointedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there a place I can wash up?

<HOLLY>

(happy for the excuse)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Follow me.

They go out. Alone, Takagi's look at Ellis shows his disapproval of certain snow at Christmas.

EXT. NAKATOMI - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An Emory freight truck turns off Olympic into the underground parking garage of Nakatomi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARKING GARAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It goes down the ramp and passes Argyle's black limo. The driver's seat is EMPTY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIMO - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Argyle sits in the back seat hidden from the outside world by the tinted rear windows. He is making a drink from the bar with the TV on and his rap music blasting from the cassette player, oblivious to the truck passing behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARKING GARAGE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Emory truck stops in front of the service elevator on the next level down. As the truck idles, the uniformed driver makes a note on his clipboard.
</DIRECTION>

INT. ELLIS' OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TILT UP FROM McClane's BARE FEET. He is clenching and unclenching his toes.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised, actually feeling tension decline)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son-of-a-bitch. It works.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
Holly sits on the desk here, watches him remove his jacket, tie shirt, etc. Begin to wash up in the private bath.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a long story. You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's okay...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I have an eye on his private bathroom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
McClane's face shows his relief (or rather, his attempt not to show any).
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, where are you staying? This all happened so fast I didn't even ask you on the phone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
McClane finishes drying his face and steps to the bath doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago. He said I could bunk with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...Where does he live?

	Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pomona! You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy. I have a spare bedroom. It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
McClane fixes her with a look.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They would, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(beat; honest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then a man and a woman, both a little tipsy, open the door to the office, see that it's occupied and beat a hasty retreat. The interruption temporarily dents the mood. Holly tries to smile. But for McClane it's the last frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I've missed you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Especially my name. You must miss it every time you write a check. When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<HOLLY>

(caught)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. It's unnerving. I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't we have this same conversation in July? Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, here it comes. One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to know my idea of a marriage? It's a partnership where people help each other over the rough spots -- console each other when there's a down...and when there's an up, well, hell, a little Goddamn applause or an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I needed that, John.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I deserved that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
There's a clumsy pause as if she's almost challenging him to say...something but he sets his jaw, says nothing. Just then the door opens and Ginny leans inside.
</DIRECTION>
<GINNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miz Gennero? Mr. Takagi is looking for you...he wants you to say something to the troops...
	</DIALOGUE>

Ginny looks puzzled, goes out. Holly sighs, moves to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be a few minutes. Wait here --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't I always?

She's gone. Immediately, he slaps his forehead, contrite.

INT. BUILDING LOBBY - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Guard at the front desk notices the Emory truck on his monitor. The Guard continues to watch the Emory truck and only half notices as a Mercedes pulls up in front of the building and two extremely well-dressed BUSINESSMAN (late twenties) climb out and start up the stairs for the door. As they cross the lobby to the Guard's table to sign in, we hear their conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_1>
<DIRECTION>
(THEO) (animatedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...So, Kareem rebounds -- listen, this is a great play -- feeds Worthy on the break, over to A.C., to Magic, back to Worthy in the lane and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_1>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the other man pulls out a Walther pistol with a silencer and aims it at the Guard's forehead. Before the Guard can react he pulls the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<THEO>
<DIRECTION>
(dryly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boom...two points.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEO>
<DIRECTION>
(The speed with which the murder takes place sets the tone for the rest of the action.) The killer moves behind the desk, stepping over a small pool of blood from the Guard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His name is KYLE, big, with long blond hair like a rock drummer. Karl takes off the silencer and looks at the video monitor of the Emory truck. The first man, Theo, opens his briefcase, takes out a portable CB radio and speaks into it.
</DIRECTION>
<THEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEO>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the driver nods at the security camera as several men climb out of the rear of the van and begin unloading wooden crates by the service elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELLIS' OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane looks at all the lavishness around him and picks up a phone by the toilet. He opens his wallet and takes out the phone number Argyle have him. A photo of his children stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's of Holly, the two children and himself in happier days: Six months ago, before Nakatomi came calling to Holly's door. McClane flips it over. On the back in crude but painstaking hand of a five-year-old it says: WE MISS YOU, DADDY. LOVE LUCY (and in more primitive letters) JOHN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane returns the photo to his wallet, dials the number.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUILDING OPERATIONS CONTROL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo enters the small control room and comfortably sits behind a maintenance keyboard. Whistling a vaguely familiar tune, he TYPES in some commands and locks down the passenger elevators up to the 30th floor. Then with several more computer commands, systematically causes:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HEAVY STEEL GATES TO THE PARKING GARAGE CLOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ESCALATORS TO THE GARAGE COME TO A STOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CONTROL ROOM - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo finishes typing and disconnects the keyboard and pulls out the wires from beneath the panel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors to a service elevator open TO REVEAL HANS GRUBER, impeccably dressed, lean and handsome, he steps out into the lobby like he owns the building -- and in a way he does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo steps to the door of the control room and tosses Hans a COMPUTER CARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hans goes to the front door, waves the card over a magnetic plate. An LED BLINKS and the door LOCKS with a THUD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hans looks out at the street. Appropriately enough, "not a creature is stirring." Century City is quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOBBY - QUICK CUTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An elevator opens REVEALING TEN MORE MEN, all armed with Kalashnikov machine guns are carrying canvas kit bags. One of them, EDDIE, a rugged American in his twenties, goes to the dead guard and immediately begins changing into his cloths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A) Karl takes a tool case from the elevator and joins his brother TONY, first playfully grabbing him. They head for the basement stairwell;
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B) Theo leaves the control room and nods to Hans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C) Eddie finished adjusting buttons and snaps on his pilfered uniform, takes his position behind the front desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks at his watch and seems pleased. He steps into the service elevator with the others and presses the button for the 30th floor. The entire sequence has taken maybe sixty seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELLIS' BATHROOM - 30th FLOOR - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane is still barefoot, his pant legs now rolled up above his ankles. He stretches his toes again. Damn, it works. He lights up a new Marlboro, dials a number on the (bathroom) phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUILDING BASEMENT - PHONE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large sign says: PACIFIC BELL EMPLOYEES ONLY. Inside Tony stands in front of an intimidating matrix of phone lines -- but what he has in mind won't require a doctorate in Electrical Engineering. Karl comes over, gives his an elder brother's punch on the arm, points out what to do. Together they focus on four CPV plastic conduits which run out of the main panel over their heads. Tony nods. Opens a case REVEALING a compact electric chainsaw.

<DIRECTION>
INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hans and the others approaching the 30th floor. As they grow closer, we hear the noise of the speakers growing louder and louder. The men cock their weapons and brace themselves as the car stops and the elevator doors open. ON THE SOUND OF GUNSHOTS AND SCREAMS WE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELLIS' OFFICE

<DIRECTION>
McClane grabs his shoulder harness off the back of the chair, moves quickly to the doorway. He looks down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MCCLANE'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two terrorists, FRANCE and FRITZ, armed with M-5 machine guns searching the offices on the hall one by one. They open a door, look in from the hallway, and move on quickly to the next.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are four offices away and moving fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane looks across the corridor and sees the stairwell door -- too far to reach without being seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MCCLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
steps back, throws off the safety on his Beretta and braces himself. He opens the door, peers through a crack at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALLWAY - FRANCE AND FRITZ
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK CUTS as McClane's eyes SCAN their weapons...he's totally outgunned, and he knows it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franco and Fritz reach the office just before Ellis' and throw open the door REVEALING the man and woman who interrupted Holly and McClane a few minutes before, now in the throes of passionate lovemaking on the desk. The two terrorists smile at each other, then enter the office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later the man, (trying desperately to pull up his pants) and the woman (buttoning her blouse) are pushed out into the hall and toward the larger group by Fritz. The other terrorist, Franco, goes to Ellis' office and opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is...empty.

<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWELL - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON McClane's bare feet padding quickly up the concrete stairs, two at a time. We FOLLOW him up, then out onto the:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
31th FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is the mezzanine floor immediately above the main Nakatomi lobby. McClane sees Theo and KRISTOFF wheeling carts of equipment. McClane ducks back into the stairwell, he runs up another flight and out onto:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNFINISHED FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eventually it will be one large secretarial pool, but only a portion is completed. Half-finished partitions and office furniture in its original plastic wrappings are everywhere. One end has a few lonely finished working areas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane moves quickly to a desk and picks up a phone. It's out.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit...

</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks out the window at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEIGHBORING BUILDING - MCCLANE'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A high-rise apartment building a half-block away sparkles with lights. McClane stares at a PRETTY GIRL in her bedroom. She's wearing drop dead underwear right out of the Victoria's Secret catalog. As we watch, she flops down on her bed, and with one long leg in the air, effortlessly dials a call on her high-tech phone. It seems so easy.

The employees have been herded to the center of the room where the desks have been pulled back. Many people are whimpering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around the room for McClane. She's so intent on this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward. Exasperated, he SHOVES her. Her glare at him shows us her mettle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly. He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage. He pats her hand "reassuringly."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group. He reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook. He checks his own scribblings like a dais speaker.

McClane pauses outside the stairwell door to the 33rd floor, he presses the handle and cracks the door open TO REVEAL a computer floor. The computer machinery drones on under the lights behind plate glass windows. McClane quietly closes the door and moves to another floor.

MCCLANE'S P.O.V.

Three terrorist, JAMES, ULI and HEINRICH, are unpacking the wooden crates we saw in the garage from the service elevator. It's not clear what they're doing but it seems very military like and ominously defensive. Heinrich POINTS up to the ceiling and says something in German. The others nod.

Takagi looks confused. Hans puts a friendly arm around Takagi's shoulders and guides him into the adjacent board room where Theo types in commands onto a built-in computer console.

<HANS>

Hans barks him to silence:

Suddenly he looks up at the ceiling and sees a sprinkler head. His look drops to the wall and focuses on a small red fire alarm switch by the door.
</DIRECTION>

INT. MAIN FLOOR - L.A. FIRE STATION - NIGHT

An ALARM sounds. Quickly firemen move to their machines as a voice of a 911 DISPATCHER drones.

<DIRECTION>
UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane stands silhouetted against the window. In the distance he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto Avenue of the Stars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the second. McClane watches in disbelief. The trucks slow and turn down separate side streets, heading for home.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son of a bitch...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN. A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine gun drawn. We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire floor. McClane is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MCCLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
under a desk. He takes in his options.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The feet of Tony. They move slowly in his direction. McClane Looks down the aisle next to the windows. It leads to a series of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path if he can make it past Tony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TONY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fire has been called off, my friend. No one is coming to help you. You might as well come out and join the others.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(fingers the trigger of his machine gun)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I promise not to hurt you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then around it and fires a blast into the space. It is empty. As the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near the cubicles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tony heads toward the noise. Sensing a trap, he moves past each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches the doorway of the last one. The sound is just around the partition. He tenses, then spins into the cubicle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TONY'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A radial arm saw spins noisily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TONY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
grins at his nervousness. He moves to turn it off, not realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane, steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel against Tony's temple.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freeze, Police...don't move or name your beneficiary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
Tony doesn't. McClane cocks his Beretta. Tony watches him calmly.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't hurt me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<TONY>
<DIRECTION>
(smug)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you are a policeman. There are rules for policemen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. My Captain keeps telling me the same thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head. Tony REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends his pistol into the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that sends Tony reeling into the hall. McClane holds on as they slam through several plastic board partitions. They careen across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STAIRWELL LANDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below. For a moment, both men lie still. McClane, still holding onto Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly to the side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man. Then, slowly, methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM. He turns all his pockets inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on it. He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND coming from somewhere attracts his attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rises, moves cautiously to the source.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during the struggle. McClane stares at it, formulating a plan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 32ND FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN FROM Tony's now shoeless feet TO McClane, who sits on the floor near the body hurriedly lacing up the dead terrorist's boots on his own feet. He ties the last lace and tries to take a couple of steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He winces in pain, goes off balance. Quickly he starts taking the boots off.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A million terrorists in the world and I kill the one with feet smaller than my sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
He yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage. Then he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretary's chair. He starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DESK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where he scribbles a note we cannot read on a piece of paper. Then his eyes fall on some Xmas decorations nearby. He smiles to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE ELEVATOR - UNFINISHED FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON McClane's back as he pushes Tony's body on swivel chair into the elevator. (NOTE: WE CANNOT SEE TONY'S HEAD) CAMERA ADJUSTS as McClane pushes the buttons for the 31th and 30th floors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We notice he's got the dead man's machine gun and that a wooden desk ruler protrudes from McClane's back pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator doors close and the car starts down. After it's dropped only half a floor, McClane forces the doors open with his fingers -- stopping the car between floors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors, then opens the outside doors of the floor above (31st) with his fingers and pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor, then up onto the roof of the car. Once on the roof of the car he reaches over the edge and removes the ruler, closing the inside doors and setting the car in motion again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOSTAGE FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hostages have been gathered together in a group in the center of the open floor, guards flanking them. The elevators are barely visible from the edge of the group, which is where Ginny and Holly are sitting. Ginny winces, uncomfortable on the floor. Holly soothes her. Hans stands in front of them like a stern camp counselor in front of the assembled bunk.
</DIRECTION>
<HANS>

	I wanted this to be professional, efficient, adult, cooperative. Not a lot to ask. Alas, your Mr. Takagi did not see it that way...

A "DING" attracts his attention. He turns.

<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE

The elevator doors OPEN and Fritz, guarding the area. WHIRLS, gun held ready. His jaw drop as he sees:
</DIRECTION>

Still and dead, flopped in a swivel chair, a red Santa hat gaily placed on his head.

The guards quickly hustle the hostages away as Hans crosses to the elevator, but for before.

HOLLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sees the body...and REACTS. She knows her husband's abilities... not to mention his twisted sense of humor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEAR THE ELEVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Fritz stands there, confused, Hans comes to the elevator with Franco, lifts Tony's chin and sees that his neck has been snapped. He sees a folded piece of paper in Tony's collar, takes it out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

ROOF OF ELEVATOR - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane is staring through a tiny crack at the scene below him. CAMERA ADJUSTS from Fritz in the b.g. to Hans and France just below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane is WRITING in his weather-beaten cop's notebook. The first notation is NUMBER OF HOSTAGES: HOLLY + 30 -- odd. Then it says, NUMBER OF TERRORISTS? As we watch, he adds "3 ? 1 in Lobby (?) and 2+ with hostages?? Plus ones on roof (3)."
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...we have to tell Karl his brother is dead. Tell him to come down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANS_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Now McClane writes "HANS=LEADER. Karl=BROTHER. USE THIS?" As Fritz calls Karl on his CB, Hans looks at Franco.
</DIRECTION>
<HANS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Franco, you and Fritz take the body upstairs and out of sight. I don't want the hostages to think too much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CAR ROOF - ON MCCLANE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On top of the car, listening to the conversation below. Franco and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close. The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy, grease-coated cables to keep his balance. Already his clothes are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the dirt and sweat. The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the machine floor. The doors open and McClane hears them roll the chair with the body off the car. McClane looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MCCLANE'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MCCLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulls himself up onto it. As he moves along the catwalk looking for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door, 2'x3'. McClane pushes it open and looks in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MCCLANE'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Total darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MCCLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
takes out a coin. A quarter. He stops, switches to a nickel. Throws it into the void. It is a full four seconds until we HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below. You don't have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus...

</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM. Opening the door McClane enters a darkened:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUMP ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
damp and full of pipes and goes to another door. He cracks the door and looks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MCCLANE'S P.O.V.

<DIRECTION>
The lower level of the roof. Open and deserted. Only a heliport above him is higher.
</DIRECTION>

30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME

WIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers SLAMMING out, papers flying. KARL has done this, and he's barely started. He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a hole into the plaster. Finally, Hans goes to him, lays controlling hands on the man's shoulder.

McClane moves around the roof, circling the helipad, making sure he has a good enough view to avoid being ambushed. He can't see in all directions at once but he's doing the best he can.

TIGHT as one after another after another HOSTESS TWINKIE is stacked up on the counter. CAMERA WIDENS and we SEE the young male CLERK, who stifles a smile. Another teenage employee behind the counter also smothers a laugh.

running for his life, from Fritz and Franco, doesn't realize he is being herded around the building toward Karl. Suddenly McClane turns a corner and sees Karl. The big man fires a burst and McClane ducks back stopping at the exterior door to the pump room he used before. It is locked from the inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He BLOWS the lock off with a burst from his machine gun and slips into the darkness of the:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELEVATOR SHAFT NEAR PUMP ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coming quickly out of the pump room, McClane picks his way over the same ground as a few minutes before and opens the door to the elevator shaft. The dimly lit shaft yawns before him. He starts down the ladder back to the catwalk, moves along it -- STOPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The catwalk ends, and the elevator is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PUMP ROOM - OTHER END

Karl crosses, starts to open the door to the elevator shaft when suddenly their radio crackles with --

	</DIALOGUE>
</HANS>
<DIRECTION>
Karl turns off his radio. In the light of their flashlights, the two other terrorists look at Karl in stunned disbelief. He opens the door to the elevator shaft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - ON MCCLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's OVERHEARD enough of this to realize he's in deep shit. He backtracks to the air shaft door, strikes a cigarette lighter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELEVATOR SHAFT (OPPOSITE SIDE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karl steps off the ladder to the catwalk, his own gun held ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MCCLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEARING Karl's approach, McClane thinks fast, looks down at his narrow confines, and then at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS WEAPON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and its canvas gunsling and metal strap slides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quickly, McClane lets out all the slack in the sling. Then, he BRACES the weapon across the outside opening of the air shaft door and lowers himself into the:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AIR SHAFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
meanwhile holding onto the canvas sling with his elbows bent over it like a kid doing a half-asses skin-the-cat on a swing set.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His feet slowly move down the smooth aluminum walls until they reach the top of the air duct, then DANGLE in the open space. He straightens his arms to give him length enough to touch the bottom edge of the duct.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he FEELS something GIVE above him and looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE SLING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It was designed to carry a gun on a man, not vice versa. The few inches of extra canvas are sliding through the clips. When they're gone...he will be too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KARL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves silently toward the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - MCCLANE'S TOES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
now only inches from the bottom edge. McClane's arms are fully extended now. He hears Karl on the metal catwalk. His muscles strain and quiver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SLING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the canvas end slips through the clip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MCCLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FALLING. He grabs the ledge of the air duct as he falls and his body slams into the aluminum wall with an echoing BOOM. Above him on the catwalk the rifle rattles on the metal outside the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON KARL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Around the corner Karl FREEZES, unsure of the sound:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MCCLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
holding onto the ledge by his hands. With every ounce of strength he tries to pull himself up into the horizontal duct, clawing for a hold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON KARL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rounds the corner and sees McClane's rifle lying beneath the doorway. He moves to the small door, shines his light and aims his rifle down into the air shaft ready to fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shaft is deserted. Moving his light around he sees the air duct. Without hesitation he turns and backtracks to the pump room door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIR CONDITIONING DUCT - ON MCCLANE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lies exhausted and motionless in the narrow crawl space. He awkwardly fishes out the lighter from his shirt pocket and thumbs it ON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flickering GLOW shows him this ain't no place for claustrophobics -- it's a long, long long dark and narrow corridor full of weird shadows. The far end (if there even if one?) is BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whew...for a moment there I was worried.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns out his lighter, and starts crawling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MACHINE FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three terrorists rush down from the roof in hot pursuit, Karl leading the way through the door. Karl points quickly to the left and right where there are a series of rooms. The others checks these while Karl approaches the CAMERA, trigger finger ITCHING. Almost immediately, the others return.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCO>
<DIRECTION>
(a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.

Karl looks puzzled. Then he thinks, mentally retracing McClane's few options. Karl's eyes scan the architecture here, and then suddenly he looks UP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ceiling is criss-crossed with air ducts. He fires a burst into the ducts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIR DUCT - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane remains motionless in the air duct. Three quarter-size holes inches from his face show how close Karl came to nailing him. Sweat covers his face, drips silently onto the aluminum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACHINE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karl listens patiently for sound. Just then the two other terrorists return.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCO>
<DIRECTION>
Karl hesitates a moment, fighting his instincts before finally turning to go. Suddenly the duct McClane is in GROANS slightly under his weight. Karl stops and looks up at the matrix of aluminum duct work, trying to single out the source of the sound. He steps back into the room and raises his rifle. Holding it upright he presses the barrel up into the belly of McClane's air duct, feeling for weight -- the weight of a body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE AIR DUCT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane sees the indention of the barrel pressing into the aluminum fifteen feet away. There is a pause and another three feet closer. He can hear Karl's footsteps on the concrete -- moving slowly below the duct.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON KARL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes are fixed above him on the air duct. He presses the barrel up again. Still nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MCCLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silently he moves his hand, slowly draws his Beretta. The next indention presses up six feet away. McClane points his gun downward and waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KARL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stops directly below him. The barrel starts up and just touches the duct under McClane when Franco returns to the door and calls:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Karl! Police! Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCO>
<DIRECTION>
Karl hesitates then lowers his gun and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
He hears the door close and lowers his head.

INT. 33RD FLOOR - SAFE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The large LED WINDOW in the front of the safe BEEPS and letters creep by: ACCESS CODE ACCEPTED. We HEAR a CLUNK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Theo, who grins. Now his computer screen reads, LOCK #1 DISABLED. DO YOU WISH TO PROCEED?

Theo puts goggles on his eyes, holds out his hands towards Kristoff like a doctor requesting a scalpel. Kristoff gives him a GIANT DRILL.

The elevator doors open on Karl, Franco and Fritz. They step out onto the darkened floor. We SEE large number "3" painted on the doors of this floor.

They move quickly toward the windows on the Avenue of the Stars side where a terrorist, ALEXANDER, with a BAR rifle has set up a machine gun nest under a half-opened window. Directly below him we SEE Powell's car.

But Powell accelerates in reverse away from the building, keeping his head low and praying he doesn't hit anything as the bullets follow him, digging into asphalt. A half block away his car runs off the pavement and down a SLOPE, finally BOUNCING to a jarring HALT in a parking lot which is destined to become police H.Q. a few pages from now. Powell sits up and clutches the mike.

The leader here is named Hans, and besides the pea shooter he ventilated your car with, they got machine guns and sidearms up the yin yang. On top of that one of 'em had a big enough chunck of plastic explosive to orbit Kate Smith.

An unmarked police car pulls up across the street from Nakatomi building and a MAN in a sportcoat climbs out.

	John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out.

McClane turns, moves on...we STAY ON him until he REACTS to a CLICK. He slowly turns:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hans is...well, Hans again, from expression to posture. He holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly into his radio in German.
</DIRECTION>
<HANS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Karl! Franco! I'm on 33. Come quickly.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to McClane)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put down your gun and give me my detonators.

	Hans. Your Hans.

</MCCLANE>
<HANS>
<DIRECTION>
(nods, indicating McClane's gun again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put it down now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANS>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.

	Yeah. Like you did with Takagi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
McClane raises his machine gun, aims at Hans. Hans PULLS THE TRIGGER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Click. Astonishment. Click-click-click. McClane steps in carefully, reclaims his pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think I'm a shmuch, Hans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator.

</HANS>
<DIRECTION>
McClane whirls in time to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KARL, FRANCO AND FRITZ
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coming out of it, FIRING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane FIRES back, killing Fritz. Karl and Franco take cover. McClane ducks into a water cooler alcove, looks back at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHERE HANS WAS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's gone, a SWINGING OFFICE DOOR the only evidence of his passing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane curses himself, then RETREATS into a:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANK OF COMPUTERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where he DUCKS and DODGES as bullets ping and ricochet all around him. Ducking, rolling, he FIRES at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANCO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his weapon FLYING:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He SLIDES right into a glass door. It smashes around his head. Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MCCLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction. He turns:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MCCLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked. One of his shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans, who escapes with only superficial scratches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks at the glass around him, gets an idea. He SHOUTS to Karl in German:
</DIRECTION>
<HANS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The glass! Shoot the glass!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANS>
<DIRECTION>
And, saying this, he demonstrates. Karl follows suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MCCLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it. BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM. Their BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form! Big CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven. McClane reaches the end of the counter, DIVES and rolls to the floor:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS FOOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
goes right down on a jagged SHARD. He GROANS, keeps going:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STAIRWELL DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's out, gone, safe!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karl looks pissed as hell. Behind him, Hans sifts through rubble, then comes over, smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's holding the bag of detonators.
</DIRECTION>
<HANS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smile, Karl. We are back in business.

As Thornburg GRINS we GO TO:

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Wincing in pain, McClane washes his foot in a sink basin. He washes a deep cut, soaps it, but the pain doesn't relent. When a VOICE speaks, he JUMPS, realizes it's the CB.
</DIRECTION>
<POWELL>
<DIRECTION>
(on CB)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roy? You still with us?

Suddenly remembering an NYPD course in first aid from ten years ago, McClane removes the improvised bandage, check the cut more carefully.

Powell doesn't answer right away. At the same time, McClane swallows, seeing a gleam inside his foot. He gingerly probes, and pulls out a shard of glass almost three inches long from its angled gash, his mouth twisted in a silent scream all the way.
</DIRECTION>
<POWELL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I...realized I couldn't do what I had to anymore...at least not out there. I had an...accident.

McClane throws the glass across the room, forehead bathed in sweat.

Realizing what he's hearing for the first time, McClane's face shifts to a new kind of pain.

	Eleven years ago. Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.

Theo and Kristoff and Hans huddle over the computer monitor screen as if it was a warm fireplace. Theo points to the computer screen; all they can do is wait.

<DIRECTION>
Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood in shock.

	We are cowboys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
VAULT ROOM - WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and disbelief. He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLLY'S WRIST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and she is YANKED off her feet!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him! McClane LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the last minute!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUILDING - LONG SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The roof still in flames, McClane hangs halfway out of the window, jagged glass raking his face, straining to hold onto Holly as Hans drags her out!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane braces himself against the window frame and strains to pull Holly closer. With a MOAN, she catches the windowsill with her inside hand. McClane STRETCHES with his other hand, begins to INCH towards Holly's wristband.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANS' HAND - WIDEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A death grip on the watchband. We WIDEN, SEE that, blood flecked teeth GRITTING, he is STRAINING with his other hand to bring up the gun he is still holding!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MCCLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holly's SCREAM alerts him. Hans locks eyes with McClane one last time, starts to pull the trigger, as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERY CLOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane RELEASES the latch on the watchband! The overtaxed metal SNAPS, links flying:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hans' face registers his horror as he and most of the watch suddenly drop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We LISTEN to his scream all the way down, finally HEAR him HIT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McClane pulls Holly back into the room and holds her.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, babe. It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down at Hans' body, then back at the scrap of wristband he's still holding.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a warranty on this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
She laughs through her tears, holds onto him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUILDING - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smoke drifts up from what has suddenly become the top floor. Thornburg's remote truck careens into the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A crowd watches as the front doors of the building open. We SEE McClane, who holds up Holly and in turn is supported by SWAT men. As REPORTERS start shouting questions, McClane breaks free of his entourage, and, holding Holly, pushes into the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
(calling out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Al? Al, you here -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd eddys and surges...suddenly Powell is there, and McClane knows it's him. They stare at each other, ten feet apart, and then they're grinning, extending their hands. But somehow a shake isn't enough, and they're embracing each other like men who've lived through combat together...which, in fact, is the truth.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLANE>
<DIRECTION>
(emotional)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Al. Man, you were my rock. I couldn't have made it without you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<POWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POWELL>
<MCCLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm serious. Hey, this is my wife... Holly Gennero.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLANE>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(taking Powell's hand, correcting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holly McClane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Hearing this, McClane grins, pulls her close.
</DIRECTION>
<POWELL>
<DIRECTION>
(to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A pleasure. I guess John doesn't need me to give you that message anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POWELL>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(puzzled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Message?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
McClane begins to make silent "ixney" gestures in Powell's direction.
</DIRECTION>
<POWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, about him being such a jerk -- and how he's really sor --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(seeing McClane)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- ee...Uh, I'm sure he'll fill you in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POWELL>
<DIRECTION>
Just then Robinson barges forward.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you for debrief, McClane. You've got some things to answer for -- Ellis' murder -- property damage -- interfering with police business --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBINSON>
<DIRECTION>
A SCREAM causes McClane to turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There in the doorway is Karl, clothing and body scorched. Easily as crusted in dirt and blood as McClane, he holds his machine gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the crowd panics trying to escape, Karl locks eyes with McClane and levels his gun. McClane throws Holly to the ground and grabs the dumbstruck Robinson's sidearm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he doesn't get off a shot -- a lone gunshot stops Karl -- knocking him back through the doorway. McClane looks back to see Powell still sighting down the barrel of his .38.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His hand is rock steady. He sees McClane's look.
</DIRECTION>
<POWELL>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugging)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were right. You couldn't have made it without me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POWELL>
<DIRECTION>
They smile. Suddenly McClane and Holly squint as LIGHTS pan onto them. Thornburg pushes his way forward, mike extended like a weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<THORNBURG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. McClane...Mrs. McClane...any comment on your incredible ordeal? What are your feelings now that it's all over?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THORNBURG>
<DIRECTION>
Without a beat, Holly PUNCHES HIM in the chops. He FALLS, dropping the mike with an electronic SQUEAL. McClane looks at his wife, amazed. Behind them, Thornburg sits on the ground, nurses his lip, turns to his camerman.
</DIRECTION>
<THORNBURG>
<DIRECTION>
(eager)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you get that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THORNBURG>
<DIRECTION>
McClane and Holly continue on, turn towards:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARGYLE'S LIMO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a little smashed up, but still running. Argyle is standing beside the open door. McClane and Holly get in and Argyle closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<ARGYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(getting in the front)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If this is their idea of Christmas I gotta be there for New Year's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARGYLE>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW the read window where McClane and Holly are kissing. As they drive off, we:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
