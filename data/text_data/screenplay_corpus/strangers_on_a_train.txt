Activity of cars and taxis arriving and discharging passengers with luggage, busy redcaps, etcetera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We FOCUS on a taxi pulling up and stopping, The driver hands out modest looking luggage, including a bunch of tennis rackets in cases to a redcap. CAMERA PANS DOWN as the passenger gets out of the taxi so that we see only his shoes and the lower part of his trousers. He is wearing dark colored brogues and a conservative suit apparently. The feet move toward, the entrance to the station and out of scene. Immediately a chauffeur-driven limousine drives up and an expensive place of airplane luggage is handed out of this, and the passenger alighting from the back is seen to be wearing black and white sport shoes which, as before, are all we see of him. The sport shoes start off in the wake of the brogues.

CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to SHOW two young men seated in two parlor car chairs. BRUN0 ANTHONY, the wearer of the sport shoes, is about twenty-five. He wears his expensive clothes with the tweedy nonchalance of a young man who has always had the best. The wearer of the brogues is a fine looking but, at the moment, a somewhat troubled young man. This is GUY HAINES. He, too, is in his middle twenties and is well dressed because he can now afford to be. He nods politely, acknowledging Bruno's apology, then turns away with the gesture implying he wants privacy.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beg your pardon, but aren't you Guy Haines.

Guy nods with a polite half smile. Being a well known tournament tennis player, he has had this sort of experience before.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNO>
<DIRECTION>
(snapping his finger)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure! I saw you blast Faraday right off the court in South Orange last season. What a backhand! Made the semi-finals, didn't you?

	I'm Bruno Anthony. Bruno. See Guy looks up. Bruno indicates his gold tie pin which bears his name in cut- out letters. Guy looks at it with the faintest expression of disdain. I suppose you think it's corny. But my mother gave it to me so of course I wear it to please her.

	Yes, I am. Ask me anything, from today's stock reports to Li'l Abner, and I got the answer. Even news about people I don't know. Like who'd like to marry whom when his wife gets her divorce.

Bruno and Guy are finishing lunch. Bruno has been drinking and his eyes are bright and feverish. An almost empty liquor bottle is near a couple of detective novels covered with gaudily Illustrated dust jackets. Bruno has in unlighted cigarette in his mouth. Guy's lighter is on the table. Bruno snaps it a couple of times, as though fascinated, lights his cigarette and puts the lighter on the table again.

</BRUNO>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I may be old fashioned, but I thought murder was against the law.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<BRUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But not against the law of nature. My theory is that everybody is a potential murderer. Didn't you ever want to kill somebody? Say one of those useless fellows Miriam was running around with?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNO>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't go around killing people just because you think they're useless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<BRUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, what's a life or two? Some people are bitter off dead, Guy. Take your -- wife and my father, for instance. It reminds me of a wonderful idea had once. I used to put myself to sleep at night -- figuring it out. Now, let's say you want to get rid of your wife.

</BRUNO>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(raises a finger and stops Guy's protest)
</DIRECTION>

	Let's say. You'd be afraid to kill her because you'd get caught. And what would trip you up? Motive. Now here's the plan...

	I'm afraid I haven't time to listen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<BRUNO>
<DIRECTION>
(ignoring the remark)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's so simple, too. A couple of fellows meet accidentally, like you and me. No connection between them at all. Never saw each other before. Each of them has somebody he'd like to get rid of, but he can't murder the person he wants to get rid of. He'll get caught. So they swap murders.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNO>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swap murders?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<BRUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Each fellow does the other fellow's murder. Then there is nothing to connect them. The one who had the motive isn't there. Each fellow murders a total stranger. Like you do my murder and I do yours.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- hello, Guy.

</MIRIAM>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're looking well, Miriam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Miriam's face is pretty because it is still young. She is self-centered and inclined to be vindictive. She wears harlequin glasses with myopic lenses which tend to make her eyes look small.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So are you. You've got a nice tan, playing tennis with all your rich friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(ignoring the remark)

	What time do we meet your lawyer?

(sly little smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your hurry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My hurry? That's funny, coming from you! You're the one who's in a hurry, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(coyly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you wouldn't give me the divorce right away, I sort of hoped it was because you were a little bit jealous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(biting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got over being jealous, a long time ago Miriam.
	</DIALOGUE>

Miriam's eyes slide toward the other girl clerk who has moved closer, within listening range.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating empty glass cubicle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's talk in there.

Guy follows Miriam across to the empty room. Miriam has brought her purse along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They enter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CUBICLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once inside, the sounds of the music playing from other parts of the shop are heard but very faintly. The piano tuning still goes on, but less stridently. Miriam and Guy are cooped together in the close quarters.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(intimately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now this is cosier. Sort of like old times, isn't it, Guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(coldly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, skip it, Miriam. It's pretty late to start flirting with a discarded husband. Especially when you're going to have another man's baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know, I think you're handsomer than ever?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see your lawyer and get this over with.

	Here it is.

</GUY>
<MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(taking the money greedily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I'd known what all that tennis nonsense of yours was going to lead to, I wouldn't have run out on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you trying to say, Miriam? Come out with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<MIRIAM>

(tucking the bills away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not getting a divorce.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(tense and angry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, you little doublecrosser. I didn't want this divorce, you did. That's what you've been harping about for the past year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a woman's privilege to change her mind... Now I can shop for some pretty clothes. I wouldn't want you to be ashamed of me in Washington when we go to all those dinners and swanky parties.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what do you mean by that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(Coyly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't look so mad, Guy. You always smile when your picture is being taken for the papers. Especially when you have Anne Burton hanging on your arm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's not talk about Anne Burton.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, it's really serious between you two? Well, you can throw your dreams about her into the ashcan. Guy, I'm coming to Washington.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What for?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To have my baby and be with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why me? It's not my baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But people don't know that, Guy, do they? It would make a pretty story, wouldn't it -- the senator's daughter involved with a married man who's about to become a father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(furiously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You black conniving little liar!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
A few people in the shop look around as Guy's voice rises above the sound of the record playing.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep your voice down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened? Did he run out on you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No man runs out on me. Not even you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a liar and a cheat, Miriam. You've wanted to get rid of me long enough and now I'll go you one better -- I never want to see or hear of you again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(demurely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could be very pathetic as the deserted little mother in a courtroom, Guy. Think it over. Who would believe you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Guy seizes her angrily and in so doing, knocks the tone arm across the record with a loud screech. From outside we can see heads turn. Mr. Hargreaves, the manager, is very disturbed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT THROUGH GLASS PARTITION FROM HARGREAVES' VIEWPOINT We see Guy gripping Miriam's arms and apparently addressing her in a threatening manner, although we do not hear his words. The smile has faded from Miriam's face and something like cringing fear has taken its place. She is drawn and tense and seems to cower beneath Guy's rage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Hargreaves moves forward and opens Guy's tirade.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...That's what should happen to people like you. And if I...

</GUY>

<DIRECTION>
(his eyes blazing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. I'm leaving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to exit from the booth. Miriam grabs his arm and screams at him:
</DIRECTION>
<MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling like a fishwife)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You heard what I said, Guy Haines. You can't throw me away like an old shoe. I'm coming to Washington to have my baby. Tell that to the senate!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Guy strides out of the store, the manager and a few customers turning around in surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two customers in other booths, seeing the quarrel, open their doors simultaneously and Miriam's tirade is climaxed by a cacophony of noise, a big symphony, loud hot music, and the apparently unaware piano tuner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAIN STREET METCALF SHOOTING TOWARDS STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guy is striding along angrily. He comes to the same intersection and the same cop. The officer makes a friendly gesture, is if he'd like to talk awhile, but Guy strides past him without noticing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. METCALF STATION (PROCESS) Guy comes into the scene, crosses to a row of public telephone booths, enters one. Inside the telephone booth, he dumps some loose change on the shelf, sticks a nickel in the telephone, speaks into it.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Long distance.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want Washington, D. C. The number is Republic 0800. Person to person. Miss Anne Burton.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Another pause, very long. Guy is very restless. He digs a cigarette out of his pocket and sticks it in his mouth, then looks through his pockets for his lighter, doesn't find it. He looks puzzled, but about that time the operator speaks to him.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Guy picks coins up off the shelf and drops them into the telephone, then waits. He shifts the receiver and fumbles in his other jacket pocket, then turns to the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>

	Anne, -- Anne darling. Yes, I'm in Metcalf --

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I know how you must feel.

	Sure I sound savage. I feel savage. I'd like to break her neck!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a pause, then raising his voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said I'd like to break her foul, poisonous, useless little neck!

	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Meantime the noise of a through train has been HEARD, and the horn on a streamliner locomotive. It has come up very fast, it is now almost to the station. Guy rises his voice and yells into the telephone. His voice fights the roar of the train:
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I SAID I COULD STRANGLE HER!

The expression on his face is frenzied and suggesting that he means exactly what he is saying.

The scene opens on a CLOSEUP OF A MAN'S HANDS. One of them is semi-flexed and turning slowly, The other is receiving the final touches of a manicure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that these are Bruno's hands, and that, he is studying them moodily, CAMERA PULLS BACK FARTHER to reveal his mother, MRS. ANTHONY, sitting opposite him at a little table in the Anthony living room. She is working with scissors, file and nail buffer. Mrs. Anthony is a gentle, once pretty woman, whose pastel exterior harbors a tigress-like determination to protect her son, Bruno is in his robe and is unshaven. There is evidence of long established wealth in the heavy dark appointments of this room.
</DIRECTION>

Bruno's roar of laughter puzzles Mrs. Anthony, but she is pleased to hear his good humor. He puts an arm around her.

<DIRECTION>
We see the train come around the curve. Again this is just the same angle that we used for Guy. It comes to a stop in the foreground and we see Bruno alight onto the platform. He looks about him for a moment and then strolls away in the direction of the town. He approaches the row of telephone booths.

From his viewpoint we see a typical frame house. The upper windows are lit as are the lower ones as well. A woman is sitting in a rocker on the front porch. This is MRS. JOYCE, Miriam's mother. She has white hair. A woman comes along the street and pauses as she gets to Mrs. Joyce.

Again from Bruno's viewpoint, we see Miriam's house. At this moment the front door swings open, emitting a long streak ot bright light. We see the silhouette of a woman emerge, followed by two other men. They're laughing and joking. Suddenly they look up the street. At this very moment the bus pulls up in front of Bruno's view, cutting off the sight of his quarry. The bus comes to a stop.

From his viewpoint, the girl, whom we now see is Miriam, is running followed by the two young men. They are calling for the bus not to go - shouting, "Hi - stop!" Mrs. Joyce calls from the porch:

Bruno turns to follow Miriam, his manner casual. As he takes a few steps, WE PAN ACROSS with him until, over his shoulder, we see a merry-go-round in the background. Miriam and the two boys are aboard and climbing onto horses. As Bruno goes toward the merry-go-round, the CAMERA MOVES UP A LITTLE with him. The merry-go-round starts to move slowly round as Bruno hops on.

Bruno begins to look around for Miriam, who is apparently on the other side of the merry-go-round. He starts to thread his way through the horses which are beginning to move up and down. CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM. He passes one or two of the oncoming heads before he reaches Miriam. She is on an outside mount which is high in the air when she sees Bruno facing her.

Across the water may be seen a small wooded island. Between this and the boat landing there is an artificially constructed "Tunnel of Love".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Miriam and her companions approach the boat concession and CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM onto the little landing stage. CAMERA MOVES UP SLOWLY over the boy's shoulders until we get MIRIAM IN CLOSE UP. She glances back. Her expression changes to a coy smile of satisfaction as she sees:

Miriam and her companions are escorted to a small boat with electric motor. Once they are seated the boat chugs away from the landing stage and off into the darkness.

Bruno steps into the foreground and gets into the next boat which floats alongside. He, too, moves away into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Miriam's boat passes through, she gives another little glance over shoulder before her boat disappears into the darkness of the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a brief moment Bruno's boat comes into the picture, and it, too, goes into the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
We see the silhouettes of the occupants of Miriam's boat on the wall of the tunnel, lit dimly from the light coming from the tunnel exit.

The group of Miriam and her companions are scrambling out of their boat and moving onto the island, one of the boys trying the boat on the shore. They disappear into the Woods of the island.

Again Bruno's boat comes into the picture. He steps out, lift the prow of the boat a little onto the shore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT ISLAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the amusement park lighted beyond the lake. Silhouetted in the foreground, the trees and foliage of the island. Nearby we see the silhouetted figures of Miriam and her companions move across the scene, right to left. Miriam is pushing George away from her.

</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Miriam backs out of the bushes until the back of her head is in CLOSEUP in the foreground of the shot. Suddenly she hears steps in back of her and turns her head toward CAMERA. Her face changes as she recognizes someone offscene.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
She gives a coy smile of recognition. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the mad and shoulders of Bruno between Miriam and the camera. His hand holds Guy's lighter which he flicks on as he raises it above Miriam's face. 0f Bruno, we see only the back of his head and shoulders.

We see Bruno's gloved hands dart quickly to Miriam's throat. The lighter falls down out of picture, and as Bruno's hands grip her throat, his head moves slightly to blot out Miriam's face. His head moves a bit farther until Miriam's face is nearly uncovered at the other side of the screen, and we see her glasses fall off.
</DIRECTION>

Miriam's glasses hit the ground. The shadows of their struggling figures over the shot.

Miriam's head drops into the picture by the glasses.

Bruno's hand comes into the picture and picks up the glasses. One of the lenses has been broken by Miriam's fall.

As we see Bruno's sport shoes move away, the CAMERA MOVES PAST MIRIAM'S HEAD until it comes to Guy's lighter pressed into the earth.
</DIRECTION>

Bruno glances back over his shoulder. He looks down and goes back one or two steps.

We see a full view of the island again, with the amusement park beyond. The faint noise of the calliope continues in the distance. Bruno has been lost to view.

Bruno by this time has stopped onto the landing stage, and in company with the other people, is looking back as if to see what's wrong on the island. Then he moves away, starting off of the landing stage. The boatman turns and glances at Bruno, but quickly returns his attention to the disturbance across on the island. He hurries forward and with a couple of men passengers jumps into one of the boats. He calls to his assistant as he gets into the boat.

As Bruno calmly threads his way along the midway, we hear above the noise of the various concessions, a shrill police whistle in the distance. Presently a couple of policemen comes running from direction of the main entrance and past Bruno. He glances at them over his shoulder, then strolls on toward the main entrance to the park.

As Bruno comes out through the turnstile, he stands for a moment on the street. At this moment a man hesitates at the curbstone. He is blind and tapping the sidewalk with his white cane. He takes one step into the roadway, then hesitates. Bruno steps forward and takes the blind man's arm. CAMERA PULLS BACK as Bruno escorts the blind man across the road. With a sweeping gesture he holds back a couple of cars to lot them pass.

Once on the other side of the road, the blind man utters his thanks.

Guy is standing at the telephone which is still ringing. He has Miriam's glasses in his hand. He looks down at them for a moment, then picks up the receiver. He hesitates, then speaks into the phone.

His figure tense, he rings the bell. After a moment's wait, the door is opened from inside and Anne Burton stands in the lighted hallway.

LONG SHOT LIVING ROOM FROM GUY'S VIEWPOINT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SENATOR BURTON and BARBARA BURTON are seated near a desk on the farthest side of the room. Senator Burton is a distinguished fifty, a man with great pride in tradition, his family and his career. Barbara, Anne's younger sister, is a lively seventeen who loves excitement, says exactly what she thinks and rarely thinks before she says it. Superficially, in height and figure, she resembles Miriam. She also weirs glasses. By her gestures we gather she is speaking urgently, but softly, to her father, who lifts a weary hand to quiet her as she looks toward Guy in the hallway, Barbara keeps quiet and also looks toward Guy. They both wait for him to enter.
</DIRECTION>

	Good evening, sir. Hello, Babs.

</GUY>

Barbara has been squirming in her seat, then as if jet propelled she catapults out of it and runs to Guy, giving him a big hug and a smack on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something awful has happened, Guy.

</BARBARA>
<SENATOR>
<DIRECTION>

Subdued, she sits down. But Guy remains standing.
</DIRECTION>
<SENATOR>
<DIRECTION>
(finding it difficult to begin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There seems to be no way of diplomatically breaking tragic news. I'm sorry, Guy, to be the one to tell you. It concerns your wife. She's been murdered.

Guy stares woodenly at the Senator, is if hypnotized.

Slowly Guy's eyes meet hers. They are remembering what he said on the phone: "I could strangle her." He sinks into a chair. The Senator is quite distressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
During the following scene Barbara quietly goes about the business of pouring drinks and serving them. She knows everyone's preference.
</DIRECTION>
<SENATOR>
<DIRECTION>
(wrylt, to Guy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It happened on an island in an amusement park. It was sort of a lovers lane, I believe. A rather sordid atmosphere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR>
<BARBARA>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miriam went there with two boys. They were the ones who found her. So they're not suspects. But you probably will be.

(wide-eyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's not fool ourselves. The police will say Guy wanted Miriam out of the way so he could marry Anne. In a crime of this sort the police first go after the husband, and Guy had every motive.

From Bruno's viewpoint, as Barbara speaks,CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER until to faintest impression of the merry-go-round fills the screen with the effect of whirling around Barbara's head. Her glasses seem to glint until her eyes are obliterated by the glare.

We see Guy excuse himself from Barbara, cross to Bruno and speak to him angrily, obviously asking, "What are you doing here?" Bruno, however, greets Guy with a smile then turns from him, unperturbed and bland. He sees Anne and moves toward her, smiling.

Interrupted by new arrivals, Bruno moves away out of the picture, with a charming smile to Anne.

There are cars lined up outside on the street. One limousine is pulling up in the center, two figures at the passenger door. One is climbing in. The other is Guy.

Guy suddenly begins to realize what Anne is getting at.

Anne lowers her head, deliberately avoids looking at Guy, as she asks:

</ANNE>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I get him to do it?

</ANNE>
<GUY>

	Well, he'd read about me in the paper. He knew about Miriam -- and about you. He suggested that if he got rid of Miriam for me, I should kill his father.

</GUY>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must have realized he was talking a lot of nonsense!
	</DIALOGUE>

<GUY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, Anne, that's why I didn't want you to know anything about this. I wanted to protect all of you -- your father, Barbara. And now that you know, you're acting guilty, too.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still in his dinner clothes, Guy is seated in deep thought near the telephone, wrestling with his problem. There is an open telephone directory in front of him. He comes to a decision, picks up the telephone and dials a number. He waits for the answer, then:
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bruno? Yes, yes, it's Guy...I've decided to do what you want. I'll make that little visit to father....

Guy is sitting at the table. He is dressed differently, having changed from his dinner clothes to a sack suit. There is only one lamp lighted in the room. Guy presents a grim picture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is studying the plan of Bruno's house, and he picks up the key Bruno sent along with it. Finally he looks at his watch, then folds the plan and puts it in his pocket with the key. He rises, crosses to the chest of drawers, opens the top drawer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT: THE OPEN DRAWER
</DIRECTION>

Guy's hands take out the Luger. His hand then picks up Miriam's glasses from the drawer, holds them a moment. He is about to put them back, then decides to take them along, puts them into his pocket.

Guy comes out of the window onto the second floor fire escape. He creeps stealthily down and emerges into a narrow alleyway. He steps back into the shadows for a moment when he sees:

CLOSE SHOT Guy leaves the gates ajar and then, taking the plan of Bruno's house from his pocket, and the key, he looks toward the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STEPS LONG SHOT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a long flight of steps. Moonlit. They are lined with tall black cypress trees which throw their shadows across the steps. Guy moves out of one shadow, into another and carefully starts up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE DOOR
</DIRECTION>

He pauses, looks about for a moment and listens. Then he puts the key into the lock, finding it with his flashlight. The door opens a few inches. He turns off the flash, and enters.

A huge shadow lies it the head of the stairs. As Guy comes slowly up the stairs, the Great Dane looks down at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUY ON THE STAIRS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reacts to the sight of the dog, stops an instant, and turn on his flashlight. The heavy massive face of the dog looks straight down at him. Guy turns off the flashlight and after a moment of indecision starts slowly up the stairs once more, the dog watching every step he takes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UPPER HALLWAY

Guy comes up the last few stairs and still the dog hasn't moved. Guy slowly edges past him and the Great Dane's head turns to watch him.

<DIRECTION>
INT. ANTONY BEDROOM LONG SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is in darkness except for the dim outline of the recumbent figure in the bed. We hear Guy's voice, in a loud whisper:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Antony!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>

The figure stirs.

The low CAMERA throws a vast shadow up on the wall behind him, creating a grimace of his smile.

Bruno rises from the bed and sits on the and of it. He is fully dressed, just as he was at the party, in white tie and tails.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNO>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father isn't home tonight, Mr. Haines.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles grimly at Guy's surprise)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was about to tell you that over the phone. But you came to such a sudden decision. I wondered why.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNO>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(recovering quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since you sent me a key to your house, I decided to use it -- to make a little social call on your father. I thought he'd be Interested to know he his a lunatic son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
The faintest flicker of Bruno's eyes indicates the intensity of his reaction. He stares hard at Guy.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then a I correct, Mr. Haines, in assuming that you have no intention of going ahead with our arrangement?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNO>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No intention whatsoever. I never had.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<BRUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see. You won't have any further use for the key, then, Mr. Haines.
	</DIALOGUE>

(he holds out his

him the key)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you very such.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNO>
<DIRECTION>
As Bruno continues to stare at him, Guy takes out the Luger. For a moment a look of fear comes into Bruno's face as he thinks Guy will probably shoot him. After a pause, Guy tosses the gun on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Bruno's relief turns again to menace. He picks up the gun and fingers it nervously.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Bruno. You're terribly sick.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(haltingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know whether it's possible for you to realize it or not. I don't know much about these things, Bruno. But why don't you go someplace where you can get some treatment? Not only for your own sake, Bruno, but you can't go on causing more and more destruction to anyone you happen to meet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Bruno pays no attention. He rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guy's arguments have made no impression on Bruno whatsoever. He fingers the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like to be doublecrossed. I have a murder on my conscience, but it's not my murder, Mr. Haines -- it's yours. And as you're the one to profit, I think you should be the one to pay for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNO>
<DIRECTION>
For an instant his nervous hands seem to be struggling with the urge to kill Guy.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(gives up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I guess it's no use, Bruno. We sees to have nothing further to discuss.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY MED. SHOT

Guy walks toward the stairs, tense and apprehensive. Bruno is following him, still holding the gun. When the Great Dane sees Bruno it gets to its feet, as if waiting for a command.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guy starts down the stairs but Bruno stays where he is, the dog beside him. Gay turns and looks back it this tableaux of menace.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. I'm not going to shoot you, Mr. Haines. It might disturb mother.
	</DIALOGUE>

<BRUNO_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Miss Burton!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anne turns back in direction of the voice. CAMERA PULLS BACK until we can see the feet of Bruno protruding from behind a chair in which he is sitting. He has obviously heard the entire conversation between Anne and his mother. Bruno rises. He is in dressing gown and pajamas.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid mother wasn't very helpful, was she?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNO>
<DIRECTION>
Anne is too stunned to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I'm very upset with Guy. He shouldn't have sent you on an errand like this.

</BRUNO>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guy doesn't know I'm here, Mr. Antony.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<BRUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's been leading you up the garden path, I'm afraid. He must be very desperate to try to involve me. I've been protecting him ever since we had that conversation on the train and he told me how he hated his wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNO>
<DIRECTION>
Bruno is now standing near the window a little apart from Anne, with his back to him. He takes something out of the pocket of his dressing gown and looks down at it in his hand. It is Guy's lighter. Suddenly he stuffs it back his pocket and turn back to Anne.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, do you know, Miss Burton, he tried to get me to go back to the island one night after dark and pick up his lighter so the police wouldn't find it? He dropped it there, you know, when -- well, that night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNO>
<DIRECTION>
Anne's horror is growing.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The whole thing's been worrying me so much. But of course I couldn't do it, Miss Burton. It would have been too risky. And besides, it would have made me an accessory.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anne stares at this insane man and sinks on the settee. She starts to cry in sheer frustration. Bruno goes to her sympathetically.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Burton, I know how you feel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNO>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his hand on her shoulder. Anne flings it off. There is an awkward pause as Bruno looks down at her. Then he begins to look around restlessly.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Burton, you must excuse me. I have an urgent appointment.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must go up and change. Now, I really must go...if you'll excuse me...

He turns, starts out of the room and up the stairs in the hall. Anne watches him.

MED. SHOT GUY AND BRUNO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bruno swings around till his back is to us. He pushes Guy toward the edge, but Guy manages to grab the rein of the nearest horse. The momentum of the machine swings Guy around against the horse, whose big head towers in the f.g. Bruno, on this side of the horse pushes forward and tries to grab the reins from Guy's hand. He tries to slash at Guy's face. The back of Bruno's head is toward us during this. Guy suddenly leans out across the horse and smashes his fist against Bruno's face. Bruno's head goes back until it is in the f.g. in a upside-down position.

In the f.g. is a young boy of four years. He is excited by the speed of the ride and laughs at the fight with great enjoyment. He sees this by suddenly glancing over his shoulder. In the b.g. Guy and Bruno are continuing their fight. Bruno rises. Guy staggers after him. Bruno again leaps upon Guy. The two men sway toward the CAMERA until Bruno gets alongside the little boy. The boy now shows some anxiety. The three figures now fill the screen with the horses' heads in the f.g. Bruno is forced against the little boy, who now, alarmed, beats Bruno on the cheek with one hand, the other holding onto the brass rail in front. Bruno stops and with a sweep of his arm, knocks the little boy off the horse onto the floor below. The little boy, in falling, grabs the horse's rein or stirrup.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK ON MERRY-GO-ROUND
</DIRECTION>
