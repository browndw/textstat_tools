The SCREEN is mostly black, but we see out through the meshed rear windows a desolate panorama of gnarled trees and grubby landscape, bleak and hopeless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we HEAR outside the barking and baying of bloodhounds, not like they're tracking, but just playing as the truck turns and stops. The BUS GUARD and DRIVER get out. The back of the truck is opened by the guard and through that rectangle of bright sunlight, the silhouettes of the Newmeat descend, Luke last.

EXT. PRISON CAMP LUKE'S P.O.V. (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Scene: in a hollow is a long barracks, white-washed, faded gray, one story high. At right is a mess hall and laundry. A chain-link fence surrounds the whole compound. The corners of the fence are telephone poles with floodlights on the tops. These burn all night. Back of the mess hall, again outside the fence, are several kennel runs in which bloodhounds are now ROARING. A wooden tower with a simple board roof stands at two corners of the compound where the guards sit when the prisoners are not locked in the barracks. A picnic table sits in a grassy area just outside and at one side of the gate is a picket fence enclosing a scrubby lawn.

The Newmeat jostle into line. They are wearing State Issue gray pants and their own Free World shirts. All except Luke carry a paper bag or cigar box containing their wordly goods. All except Luke look apprehensive, worried. Luke stands with languid grace, neither insolent nor hostile, nor fearful. The Bus Guard hands Boss Paul a folder that contains records as the Captain approaches from his porch.

INT. BARRACKS (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bare, unpainted wood. The windows are barred and covered with chain link. The door from the barracks up to the compound passes a small area enclosed by a woven metal strap cage. In this usually sits the WICKER MAN, whom we generally see as a heavy, short shape moving about his own business which is making an endless series of rings or jewelry by hammering coins with the back of a heavy spoon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the barracks locks by the tongue of a strap iron bar that is thrust through a hole in the wicker where the Wicker Man locks it by padlock. Thus he can always see them, but they can't reach him. The single big room is filled with two and even three-tiered bunks. Bare bulbs hang from the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARR, the floorwalker, a 240 pound behemoth, is indoctrinating the Newmeat while they change into camp clothing: gray twill trousers, shirt and jacket, all numbered, which has been piled on the table. Carr squeegees up and down, a restless man, and CAMERA in following him SHOWS us the room. At the same time, the Wicker Man is moving about the barracks, tapping the floors and bunk posts with a broom handle for signs of tampering. Carr pays no attention to him, addressing the Newmeat.

	Any man not in his bunk at eight will spend a night in the box. There is no smoking in prone position in bed. To smoke you must have both legs over the side of your bunk. Anyone caught smoking in prone position will spend a night in the box. You get two sheets. Every Saturday you put the clean sheet on the top, the top sheet on the bottom and the bottom sheet you turn in to the Laundry Boy. Any man who turns in the wrong sheet spends a night in the box. No one will sit on the bunks with dirty pants on. Any man sitting on a bunk with dirty pants will spend a night in the box. Any man who don't bring back his empty pop bottles spends a night in the box.

Most of the other men already have their food and are sitting down with no jockeying for places: everybody knows. They are shoveling it down as fast as they can, getting back up for seconds.

as they are counting in through the gate, their hats with their personal possessions in them held out to be inspected, their pockets turned out. A guard frisks them quickly but efficiently. The Captain stands nearby ignoring them, testing a golf swing. The men move to the mess hall, most of them on the run. Luke moves painfully with exhaustion. Alibi seems quiet and cowed, lost in the crowd. They fall into a line at the mess hall door. Dynamite, his spoon out, moves to the front of the line and Luke winds up somewhere near the rear.

Alibi is led to the box. A light stands about it shining down into it and it always burns when the box is ready to be used or when there's someone inside. Now a nightshirt is laid out on top of it. Alibi strips and puts on the pajamas. Boss Kean opens the heavy lid of the box and we see it is grilled with heavy chain link fencing and with strap iron bars. A chamber pot is put inside. Alibi stands in the box, looking back at them, then lies down out of sight. The lid is slammed shut.

He is tanned and hardened now, and has mastered the work rhythm. SHOT WIDENS to show Dragline near him, checking his shovel for nicks but really eyeballing a passing car. In the ditch, Luke expertly scoops up a shovel full of sand and, levering the handle on his knee, flips the sand through the air so it hits spang in the pan of Dragline's shovel while Dragline is still eyeballing. It knocks him off balance and by the time he has caught up, Luke is already catching him with another shovel full.

Loudmouth Steve, his MOTHER -- a desperately fortyish blonde -- and a couple of other prisoners and visitors occupy the background. Parked next to the table is a truck. In the bed lies Luke's mother, ARLETTA. She is propped up on pillows and wedged in for traveling.

He walks back, looks at the eggs, making an expression of distaste. He turns away and does some more exercises. Gambler moves over very close to him. Luke is going up and down, up and down doing knee bends. Gambler tries to look into his eyes, examine his stomach, listen to his wind. Luke sticks out his tongue obligingly for a check.

	Wanda trembled, faced by this awesome decision. It was the moment of choice. Could she take the plunge and wantonly hurl herself into pagan abandon? Or would she remain ever fettered by the bonds of her puritanical upbringing? Could she take this chance to experience the sensual thrill of total release and gratification? Or would she turn her back and retreat into frigid denial? Desire and fear, temptation and terror, yearning and horror, warred within her beautiful young body...

Dogboy reaches in and carries out -- the body of Big Blue. Staggering with fatigue, tears in his eyes, Dogboy stumbles up to the Captain.

Behind Luke are Godfrey, Paul, Bosses Six and Seven and the Captain. Kean and Shorty flank the gang. The guns are held levelled at the men. One guard uncuffs Luke's hands; others produce a sledge hammer, ballpeen hammer and a set of leg irons from the Captain's car. Two guards kneel before Luke and begin hammering on the irons. Silence except for the HAMMERING AND CLINKING. Luke is silhouetted, a tall, straight figure on the low horizon. The Captain looks directly ahead.

The Captain feeds his fury staring, then reaches out his hand and Boss Paul lays the blackjack in it. As the chain guards finish and stand up, trembling with rage, the Captain takes a convulsive step forward and brings the sap down behind Luke's ear. As Luke tumbles down the littered embankment toward the men:

Nodding curtly, the Captain gets back in his car. Someone throws a shovel down the embankment. It CLATTERS until it lands beside Luke. Dragline and the others are by his side, helping him to his feet. Above Godfrey stares down at them.

INT. MESS HALL (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men file in from work, sullen and quiet, Dogboy serving but without his usual chatter. Higgins leans back, unusually alert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON DOORWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Luke appears, unshaven but cleaned up and in his uniform. The men make room as he moves to his accustomed place at the head of the line, before Dynamite.
</DIRECTION>
<DOGBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's our champeen hog gut. Ain't et for four days, gonna need a little extra... Well we got plenty for you...

</DOGBOY>
<DIRECTION>
Higgins nods, Dogboy continues to pile it on. When Luke tries to move on, Dogboy reaches out and grabs the plate with his free hand and continues to ladle it out. Behind Dogboy, Jabo, the cook, looks sympathetic to Luke.
</DIRECTION>
<JABO>

Luke looks at the impossibly piled plate and moves off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUKE AT A TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is eating with great difficulty, finally puts his spoon down and his eyes close with weariness. Koko reaches over and takes a bite off the plate. Luke sits there and one by one the men get up and file out, each one passing behind Luke and taking a bite until, as Deacon takes the last mouthful, the plate is empty and Luke stands up and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMP YARD (DAY)

Luke begins slowly shoveling the dirt back into the ditch. Boss Shorty nods with satisfaction and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON LUKE (LATE AFTERNOON)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dirt is almost all back in the ditch. A shadow falls on the dirt beside him. A walking stick falls across his buttocks and he staggers to his knees.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BOSS_PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
He canes Luke on the back of the legs. Luke falls and rolls over and Paul canes him across the head. Luke gets up on all fours and makes a rush right at Boss Paul. He is so weak and uncoordinated that the attack does nothing but smear blood and dirt over Paul's uniform. The guards beat Luke away and he falls on his back in the soft dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BARRACKS (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men are restless, their efforts to ignore what's happening are futile. Dragline gets up and looks out the window into the yard. Koko leans over beside him. He holds the picture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DRAGLINE'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke under the lights, working again, slowly, dumps a shovel full of dirt and hasn't the strength to move the shovel. Momentarily, he stops moving and is hit. We HEAR the thud and the groan he gives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BARRACKS (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dragline goes back to his bunk. We HEAR another thud and a cry from outside. Dragline begins to WHISTLE. Koko begins to chink his chains. Onionhead and Dynamite join in with their chains. Other prisoners rhythmically beat on bunk posts. Only Society Red does not join in.

ANGLE BY WINDOW

as Luke steps out of pitch black into the harsh light in full view, calm, slight smile, having chosen his moment. His voice is loud, clear, mocking:

<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHAT WE GOT HERE IS A FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE...

</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
A SHOT! It catches Luke in the throat and throws him back, but he stays in the light, still smiling.

EXT. CHURCHYARD (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON guards and police, FEATURING Godfrey, who holds his smoking rifle. There are confused SHOUTS and movements by the sheriffs, but the Captain and the prison guards only look toward Godfrey, then turn away, stoic.

INT. CHURCH

as Luke falls to one knee, trying to hold himself up. Dragline is by his side, helps him up and to the door.

EXT. CHURCHYARD (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where Bosses Kean and Paul move in to handcuff Luke. Dragline, seeing Godfrey, bellows out an INCOHERENT ROAR and charges past the surprised guards to knock Godfrey to the ground, tear his glasses from him. Confused, bewildered, Godfrey gropes for the glasses as the prison guards beat Dragline into submission.

ANGLE ON CHURCH (PRE-DAWN) (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Luke, handcuffed behind his back, is being led toward the Captain's car by Bosses Paul and Kean. He is half-paralyzed, blood pouring from him. The Captain has turned his back on Godfrey, talking to the Sheriff.

MOVING SHOT LUKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he is brought past Dragline, who is being held by several guards. Tears stream down Dragline's cheeks. Luke looks at him, still smiling as he is pushed into the Captain's car.

LUKE INT. THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it begins to move out. In the b.g. across the road we SEE the Negro villagers watching, silently. The window of the car is up and the reflections on the glass make Luke already dim, a little distant.

<DIRECTION>
MOVING SHOT THE CAR (DAWN)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it moves down the road, over the trestle. It is the mystic hour of dawn, the sun's rays just diffusing as we watch the car until it disappears over the rise in the road.

EXT. ROAD CLOSE ON YOYO (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The yoyo is swinging in the sun. As the shot WIDENS we SEE it is Dragline, wearing chains, wielding the yoyo and now we SEE the others working around him. Godfrey is gone; Boss Paul is now the Walking Boss. The MUSIC gains strength and speeds as

Dragline works with strong, certain grace and determination and the others also seem more vital and free as imperceptibly the CAMERA PULLS BACK and RISES SLOWLY TO:

HELICOPTER SHOT

<DIRECTION>
as the men grow smaller in the limitless field of gold stretching in all directions as far as the eye can see, intersected by four roads that reach out to infinity. Now the men are specks, now invisible in the fields and there are only the roads, lines in the gold, going on forever. OVER THIS, SUPERIMPOSE the PICTURE OF LUKE, now scotch-taped together, HOLD and
