INT. AIRPLANE - DAY On a chartered plane flying from Miami to Newark Airport. JACK is the captain. His copilot PAUL is seated beside him. In the passenger cabin, a female gymnastics team is celebrating a hard-won, glorious victory over the Miami team. They are singing, dancing in the aisles and drinking champagne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the rear of the cabin, there are three regular pass- engers: a teenager, his mother, and a man who appears to be a BUSINESSMAN. The plane is flying over the coastline. The partition between the cockpit and the passenger cabin is open. Jack is very excited. He can't stop turning around to look at the passengers.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>

(to Paul)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God! I can't believe my eyes! Look at these women! Will you look at the gorgeous calves on them?! I'm telling you, give me an athlete any day... Oh God! Look at that redhead over there, and look at that one! Christ, I hadn't noticed her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(miming a heart attack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul, I've just fallen madly in love with the most beautiful woman in the world...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(totally uninterested)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah? Which one?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(as though about to keel over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The blonde over there, she's too gorgeous for words. Just look at those eyes, look at those shoulders and the way she moves. I'm in love. Here, take over, I'll be right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack gets up and Paul takes his place at the controls. Jack makes his way up the aisle, through the girls who are blocking the way, to the object of his affections. She is sitting in one of the aisle seats and singing her head off. Jack leans over and whispers, quickly and intensely, to her.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello. I'm the captain of this plane. May I ask your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, my name is Jane. Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Jane, I've seen many beautiful women in my life but I swear to you, I've never, ever met a woman as exquisite as you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack kneels down before her, and the Girl looks at him, amused. He takes her hand and places it over his heart.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jane, can you feel my heart? It's pounding. This is horrible, I think I'm gonna faint. Listen: I'm madly in love with you, I'm single and here's my phone number.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He hands her his business card.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm putting my fate in your hands. If you don't call me, you'll make me the most miserable man on earth. This is no line and I'm not trying to get you into bed. This is something completely different. I love you Jane and if you call me I'll be the happiest man in the entire universe -- this is 'love at first sight.' Out of all these beautiful women I noticed only you, and...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Girl laughs as Jack goes on. Meanwhile, the Busi- nessman who was seated in the rear of the plane has gotten up and walked over to Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<BUSINESSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you Paul?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm not.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jane)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name's Jack and I live in a fabulous apartment in Manhattan overlooking the park and...
	</DIALOGUE>
<BUSINESSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you're the pilot, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I'm the pilot...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jane)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I'm not even asking for your phone number...
	</DIALOGUE>
<BUSINESSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't there a pilot whose name is Paul?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, the copilot -- he's up front...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Businessman disappears in the direction of the cockpit.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(back to Jane)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm leaving it all up to you, Jane, but if you do give me your phone number, then Jane, then...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Businessman has reached the cockpit.
</DIRECTION>
<BUSINESSMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(in a low tone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you Paul?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(turning around nervously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... Are you Jim?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BUSINESSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He hands Paul a man's purse.
</DIRECTION>
<BUSINESSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's your cash.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the stuff?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BUSINESSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have it. We've got problems. Too much heat. Too risky. We think the cops are on to us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whadda ya mean us? You mean me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BUSINESSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean shut up and listen. Two guys will be waiting for you in a black T-Bird, expecting the dope. Just ignore them. It'll be delivered to you on Sunday and picked up the following Thursday, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I won't be home, I'll be in the air for two weeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BUSINESSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's your problem. Make arrangements, a deal's a deal. Got it!?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack returns.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(bursting with excitement)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got her phone number! She gave me her phone number!
	</DIALOGUE>
<BUSINESSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's some magnificent view, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's wonderful -- Life is wonderful!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Businessman goes back to his seat and Jack grabs hold of the microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is your captain speaking. In honor of your victory, in honor of your beauty, and in honor of Jane, the most beautiful gymnast I have ever met. I'm going to give you a little demonstration of aviation gymnastics -- reserved only for the most important guest, hip, hip...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone shouts "HOORAY!" except for Paul and the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Businessman, who remain grim. Jack dips the plane very low over the water and skims the cliffs along the coast. It is a beautiful, impressive stunt. There are gleeful shouts in the cabin among the passengers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEWARK AIRPORT - PASSENGER TERMINAL - DAY Jack is saying an emotional goodbye to Jane as she leaves with her teammates. Jane finds it all very funny, but Jack looks totally wretched seeing her go. Jack and Paul walk toward the exit.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, what a woman!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul is nervous, glancing uneasily from car to car.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wanna share a cab?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, sure!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A black Ford pulls up in front of them and its driver looks at Paul who immediately turns his back on him.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's so beautiful! I've never been so in love before. Can you believe she gave me her phone number... Oh, Christ -- where is it?... Oh, no, don't tell me I lost it... It's a matter of life and death... Oh here it is -- thank God!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
All the while Jack has been rambling on, a beige car on the other side of the street has slowed down. Paul notices it. In the beige car, a narcotics agent, GRATON, is behind the wheel with one of his colleagues sitting beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<GRATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're slowing down. Take a picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The colleague snaps a picture of everyone who happens to be standing near the black Ford, including Jack and Paul. The black Ford pulls out. The beige car follows it. Paul observes all this out of the corner of his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, I need a favor, I got a little problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, sure... Hey, look, will you -- look at that sparkling beauty.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A very beautiful woman is coming down the walkway with cart overflowing with luggage. One of them falls off.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... I mean, it's like... There's this little package...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She'll never make it with all that luggage she's got. I gotta give her a hand. Look at the colors in her hair! Christ, I've never seen a woman like her before...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He's about to walk off when Paul grabs him by the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack, listen, can I...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure you can, no problem... Listen, I gotta go now, I'm gonna see if she'll share a cab with me. You take the shuttle, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I gotta explain to you about...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come over to my place tonight. We're having a huge party. Come around 9, okay? See ya later.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack races toward the woman and begins to help her with the fallen luggage. We see him talking to her and we can hear a little of what he's saying.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As exquisite as you are... I think I'm gonna faint.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He kneels, takes her hand and puts it over his heart. The young woman is flabbergasted. A lonely-looking Paul hails the shuttle bus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT A large, stylishly decorated apartment in Manhattan. A tremendous living room. A party's going on. Very LOUD JAZZ is PLAYING. The lights are dim. There are about 30 guests. Lots of young pretty women. Gourmet buffet. People are sitting on couches talking, others are eating, drinking or dancing. In a dimly-lit corner, Jack is kneeling before a girl sitting in an armchair. She is laughing as she listens to him.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering passionately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is no line and I'm not trying to get you into bed. This is something completely different. This is 'love at first sight.' Oh, I'm so happy... Let me go get you a glass of champagne. I'll be right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack gets up and goes over to the buffet. As soon as he's out of the girl's line of sight, he starts running toward the other end of the apartment. On the way he passes MICHAEL, who's deeply engrossed in a vehement conversation about modern art with a girl called SOPHIA. They're fighting like cats and dogs but seem to be enjoy- ing it.
</DIRECTION>
<SOPHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you saying that's art, are you really saying that's art? Well then you explain why.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It goes back to prehistoric man. They had comic strips on their walls, for God's sake.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	in Michael's
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ear)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm having a hard time. I'm working on two at once.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(very interested)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah, who?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The brunette in the armchair in the living room -- her name's Rosalie...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the other one?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clementine -- she's waiting for me in the den.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He moves away towards the den.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(to Sophia)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait one second for me, I'll be right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael walks off in the direction of Rosalie. Paul is wandering among the guests, trying to find Jack, he sees PETER who is talking with another young woman, NICOLE. Peter is nodding, idly looking around, com- pletely uninterested in the conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys have a beautiful place here. But the rent must be a killer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter isn't paying attention.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't it a killer?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, the rent... yeah, it's high but split between the three of us it isn't that bad, as long as we don't eat.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nicole laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi Peter, I'm looking for Jack, have you seen him?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh hi, Paul, how are you doing? Yeah, sure, I'll take you to Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Nicole)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me for a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They move away.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a lifesaver, I've been trying to get away from that woman for 20 minutes. That sonofabitch Carl is moving in on my Natalie. Gotta go... bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait -- What about Jack?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(in a hurry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's around somewhere. Check under all the couches.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul walks off in Jack's direction. We STAY WITH Peter, who reaches Natalie. She is talking with a very styl- ishly-dressed, tall, young man, CARL.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Natalie, I've been looking for you all night.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All night? I just saw you deep in conversation with Nicole!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Deep? Hell no, we were just talking shop.
	</DIALOGUE>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh come on Peter, we all know what a ladies' man you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who, me? Jack's the ladies' man, not me. You're the only lady I'm after.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CARL>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So tell me, how's your project coming along? I heard you're not ready yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've still got two weeks left before the semi-finals. We'll be ready.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been ready for three days now. We're gonna kick your ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Their project is really incredible.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh really? You've seen it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<NATALIE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling broadly at Carl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's top secret but he's been telling me about it...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(in a bad mood)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ours is incredible too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you ever get it finished.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul comes up to Jack, who is kneeling before Clementine, whispering passionate sweet nothings in her ear. It appears he's gotten beyond the "This is love at first sight" stage. He's getting down to the nitty-gritty now. Clementine is thrilled. Paul taps Jack on the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack, can I talk to you for a second?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hi, Paul, yeah sure...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (to Clementine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Please darling, don't move... I'll be right back, okay? I'll bring us back some champagne...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He disappears with Paul.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a lifesaver, Paul. I thought I'd never get away. Rosalie's waiting for me in the living room. Isn't she terrific?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who? Rosalie?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clementine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah, for sure, I dunno. Listen, can you do me a favor?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
With some difficulty, Paul follows Jack as he picks his way through the people dancing, heading in Rosalie's direction.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... What kind of favor? Damn, I've got to get her a glass of champagne.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, I've got a little problem. I'm having a valuable package delivered to me on Sunday, but I'm not going to be home. I've got to do the Hawaii-Tahiti-Australia route, so can I have the package delivered here instead?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(filling a glass with champagne)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, sure, of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he stops, thinking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, wait, I'm leaving for South America tomorrow. I'll be gone for three weeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's okay. Peter and Michael will be here. They'll take care of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you be sure to tell them about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely. Don't worry about a thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll be delivered Sunday and picked up next Thursday, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Delivered Sunday picked up Thursday. Got it. No problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a very delicate matter, Jack. It's very important they don't tell anybody about this package. It could be very... uh, embarrassing for me, you know what I'm saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. You got it. I'll see you later...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack is about to rejoin Rosalie. Paul grabs his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not to anyone at all. Tell them that, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, sure, not to anyone at all... Look, I'm sorry Paul, but I gotta get back to Rosalie. Now go have a good time. I'll take care of everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bye and thanks a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't mention it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul leaves. Jack finally reaches the armchair where Rosalie is sitting. He stops short, obviously disappointed.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-oh. Too late.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael is sitting next to Rosalie, right next to her. They get up to dance. As he passes Jack, Michael smiles broadly.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All's fair, old buddy...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack watches a moment, then breaks into a wide smile.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling Clementine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack whirls around and heads back towards Clementine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - FEW HOURS LATER - NIGHT The guests are leaving. Commotion in the hall, people are saying goodbye to Peter and Michael. Natalie is about to walk out.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Natalie, why don't you stay for a nightcap?
	</DIALOGUE>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I've gotta get up early...

<CARL>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	triumphantly;

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night, Peter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(with a forced smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night, Carl... I'll call you Sunday, Natalie.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She has already left. The door closes on the last of the departing guests.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you struck out again with Natalie, huh? That Carl is a real smooth operator.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's an asshole!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(mimicking Carl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'I heard you're not ready yet.' 'We're gonna kick your ass.' Well, we may be behind schedule, but we're still going to beat that sonofabitch and maybe I haven't scored with Natalie yet, but neither has he. She's not an easy lay, that's what I like about her. You know what they say: it ain't over till it's over.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter and Michael go into the living room. Peter is picking up glasses. Michael is emptying ashtrays into the wastebasket.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I didn't do so well either -- I blew it with Rosalie. I don't even know how...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's Rosalie?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That beauty I managed to swipe from Jack. I was about to ask her to stay the night when...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your old friend Sophia appeared and got you involved in a thrilling conversation about modern art, and meanwhile Rosalie...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could you know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael, all you want to do is steal Jack's girl friends. You don't give a shit about the women themselves...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not true. It's just that Sophia drives me crazy. She knows all the right buttons to push to make me mad.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(going into the kitchen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, it was a great party, everyone had a good time...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(still in the living
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	room, shouting to
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terrific... time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He, too, leaves the living room and runs into Jack, who has his arm around Clementine's waist as he heads toward his bedroom with her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT In the kitchen Peter is straightening up. Michael joins him, dumping the ashes. Peter begins washing the glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Jack? Did he leave?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, he's cuddling up with a blonde named Clementine...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not Clementine. I saw him doing his famous routine with Christie...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it is Clementine, the one with the tits this big...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christie's got tits that big, too...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but he was with Christie at the beginning of the evening -- after that he was with Rosalie and then with Clementine. And since I stole Rosalie away from him... Are you following this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack enters the kitchen in very high spirits, singing.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice work if you can get it, and you can get it if you try... Any scotch left?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, here, I just put it away.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry I can't give you guys a hand, but I've got something cooking.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you were leaving at dawn for South America?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am, the night's still young!... It's gonna be a lively one. I'm gonna make us a little snack.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He makes up a tray with sandwiches.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, who is it anyway -- Christie or Clementine?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maxine. Beautiful, enchanting Maxine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter and Michael look at one another surprised, mouthing silently, "Maxine?"
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Michael -- how'd it go with Rosalie?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, things were going great until...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your old friend Sophia appeared and dragged you into a thrilling conversation about modern art and in the meantime Rosalie took off with someone else.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno -- lucky guess...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't give a damn anyway, I have 24 drawings to hand in to my editor three days from now and I gotta work all night anyway... So it was all for the best. But you better not leave that Maxine's phone number lying around because when I'm done...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, I'll leave you her phone number on the hall table. If she's really terrific I'll put a big 'X' next to it. 'Bye, guys -- love ya. I won't wake you tomorrow morning. See you in three weeks...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - DAWN Jack and Maxine noiselessly exit the apartment. Jack is wearing his pilot's uniform. Maxine pushes the button for the elevator. Jack sneaks back into the apartment and leaves a note on the hall table that says: "Maxine 227-2013." Next to the number Jack has put a big "X."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF APARTMENT - DAWN Jack and Maxine exchange a brief kiss and go their separate ways.

EXT./INT. NEWARK AIRPORT - PLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack is in the cockpit with his copilot, RON. The ENGINES are REVVING. Jack is checking gauges. He looks out the window idly and sees: The crew of another plane walking across the tarmac. Paul is one of the crew. Paul sees Jack and begins to gesture wildly, but his voice is drowned out by the noise of the ENGINES. Just seeing Paul is enough to remind Jack about his package.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn! I forgot to tell them about the package!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ron)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta make a quick phone call. I'll be right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RON>
<DIRECTION>
(knowingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack, there'll be plenty of girls where we're going.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, c'mon, I've really got to make a phone call! What do you think I'm going to do, pick up one of the New Jersey delegates to the I.B.M. convention?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack walks back towards the phone. As he walks we see that the plane is filled with ugly, boring businessmen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARCHITECTURE OFFICE - DAY In the architecture firm of which Peter is one of three partners. The whole staff, about 15 people in all, is gathered around a large model, the project for a big amusement park. They all seem worried about something. JERRY, one of Peter's partners, seems particularly angry.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The model's not finished, the blueprints are a mess and you may as well forget the specs, they're a disaster! I know we're talented. I know we're good. Then why is it we can never get organized? Why is it we're always behind schedule?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Jerry, architects since Leonardo have always been behind schedule. It's a tradition, for God's sake. Why break with tradition?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because this is the chance of a lifetime for our company, and there happens to be a deadline. There are millions of dollars at stake here. And our main competition had their project in three days ago!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but word around town is their project's a piece of shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, it's a piece of shit, but it's a ready piece of shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're just going to have to buckle down, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're damn right we are. Starting now, everybody works around the clock! Everybody! We have two weeks to be ready for the semi- final selection. And we will be ready. And we will win. You want to know why we'll win?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because we're gonna cheat.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go bribe the judges!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think this is a joking matter, gentlemen.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Jerry...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A SECRETARY enters.
</DIRECTION>
<SECRETARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's an urgent call for you, Peter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not in.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SECRETARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Jack -- he says it's 'super important...'
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter picks up the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi... yeah... listen, make it quick, I'm in a meeting here... yeah, a package... okay... someone'll drop it off Sunday and pick it up Thursday... No problem ... yeah... we'll put it aside, okay... no, no, we won't tell anybody about it... Is that it?... Right, we won't tell anyone... Hey -- love 'n' kisses to the Brazilian girls, vaya con dios, old buddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter hangs up, laughing. Jerry gives him a dirty look.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - DAY Peter, dressed in casual clothes, knocks on the door of Michael's room, and peeks in. Michael is asleep fully clothed on his bed. His drawing table is strewn with papers, overflowing ashtrays and empty coffee cups. The lamp is still on.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going out for bagels -- how many you want, three or four?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(opening one eye)

	<DIALOGUE>
	What time is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eleven-thirty.

<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A.M. or P.M.?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A.M. C'mon, up 'n' at 'em.

<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up 'n' at 'em yourself, asshole -- I just went to bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you finish?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, I didn't get anywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well then... nap time's over. Back to work. So how many bagels, three or four?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Six, six!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He buries his head under the pillow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY Peter opens the front door, he stumbles over an object, looks down; at his feet he sees a wicker basket lined with pretty pink-and-white checked gingham. In the basket a tiny baby lies fast asleep, her head gently resting on a lace pillow. Peter looks at this object in amazement. There is an envelope pinned to the basket with the words, "FOR JACK" written on it. Peter picks up the letter -- he opens it and reads.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta be kidding!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Abruptly he turns and races back to Michael's room.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael! Michael!
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(still groggy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get your ass out here and see what's on the doorstep.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(mutters)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This has gotta be somebody's idea of a joke!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They run to the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look for yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a basket with a baby in it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reads Michael the letter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Dearest Jack, here is the fruit of our love. Take good care of her. I have to go to Europe and Japan for six months, her name is Mary. Good luck, Love, Sylvia.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are we going to do with it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give it back to her mother, that's what.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it says she went to Europe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we'll see about that, d'you have her phone number?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whose phone number?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The girl's... Sylvia's...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why the hell would I have her number? I've never even heard of this chick!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean you don't know who she is?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way. If I had to keep track of all Jack's girlfriends, I'd have to be a full-time secretary.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what are we gonna do?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, look, she's waking up... Hey, look, she's crying...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no, this can't be happening! She's not gonna start to cry now?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-oh, now she's really crying!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's her problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe she's hungry?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what are we s'posed to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feed her, I guess...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but what?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soft stuff... I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(exploding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no, I swear to God this is unreal! Can you believe that bastard Jack?! 'A little package,' he tells me on the phone, 'just put it aside till Thursday.' Put it aside -- can you believe him!?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Jack said that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah and he also said 'don't tell anyone about it -- anyone at all.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, so he told you about this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, he told me a package would be coming today, but he didn't say it'd be this!
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(very angrily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, he's got a helluva nerve!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just listen to the racket she's making! What are we s'posed to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(brilliant idea)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's call Jack's mother!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She lives in Miami for Christsake. She can't stop the baby crying from Miami.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, just to ask her advice...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, he said not to tell anyone...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this is an emergency!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! No way! You know what a pain that woman is -- she'll be on the next plane here to move in with us...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I should call my mother...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, please -- leave the mothers out of this, okay?! It's only four days. We should be able to handle that, besides you know the rule around here: it's fine to have a woman over once in a while, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael finishes the sentence in unison with him.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER_AND_MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... never for more than one night at a time!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that includes mothers!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter steps over the basket and heads towards the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to the store to buy some baby food.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I supposed to do while you're gone?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pick her up and hold her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(panic-stricken)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whaddya mean, pick her up? I've never held a baby -- I'll drop her!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter is already gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFEWAY - DAY Peter enters the store and rushes right over to a store CLERK.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What aisle's baby food on?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Down there by the meat section.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter heads for it purposefully. When he gets to the right aisle, he stops short, taken aback: a vast range of products extends before him. He starts examining the baby food jars and cans of formulas, going from one to the next, not knowing where to begin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - DAY Michael is still in the hall holding Mary very clumsily in his arms. He is anxious. He realizes she's soaked. This disgusts him. He holds her at arm's length; she squirms. He goes and gets a towel from the bathroom, spreads it out on the living room couch and lays the baby down on it. MARY SCREAMS -- she much prefers Michael's arms to the couch. A panicky Michael picks her up again, grumbling.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay, don't cry like that... I'll hold you, I'll hold you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He tries rather unsuccessfully to wrap the towel around the child. Obviously Michael is very put off by the smell coming from Mary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFEWAY - DAY Peter is talking with a Safeway CLERK, a woman in her 50's, who is tall and heavy, somewhat gruff and masculine in appearance, and wearing slacks and a smock.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's the best brand?
	</DIALOGUE>
<STORE_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Depends on what your pediatrician recommends.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh right, the pediatrician... But which one sells the most?
	</DIALOGUE>
<STORE_CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to a can)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This kind.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, so this is the best kind?
	</DIALOGUE>
<STORE_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the cheapest.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it's the worst kind?
	</DIALOGUE>
<STORE_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're all good, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to another can)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, okay, then I can take this kind.
	</DIALOGUE>
<STORE_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's got iron in it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Is that good or bad?
	</DIALOGUE>
<STORE_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's very good.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, why don't they all have iron in them?
	</DIALOGUE>
<STORE_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some babies are allergic to iron.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to yet another can)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, okay, well I'll take this kind then.
	</DIALOGUE>
<STORE_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That kind doesn't have any milk in it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I see, there's milk with no milk in it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<STORE_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some babies are allergic to milk.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's the stuff that no babies are allergic to?
	</DIALOGUE>
<STORE_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soy formula.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, okay, I'll take the soy formula.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a can.
</DIRECTION>
<STORE_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That one's Advance.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh really? What's Advance?
	</DIALOGUE>
<STORE_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How old's your baby?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(Peter tries to
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	estimate Mary's
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
size)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... about this old.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - DAY MARY is SCREAMING in Michael's arms as he walks her up and down the whole apartment. Now there are three towels wrapped around her. Michael is exasperated. He angrily sings her a lullaby.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rock-a-bye baby on the tree top...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop crying now; c'mon, stop... quit it, will you?... When the wind blows, the cradle will rock... What is that jerk doing? Milking the cows or something?... When the bough breaks the cradle will fall...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
MARY only SCREAMS LOUDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFEWAY - DAY Now Peter is surrounded by three women arguing: The Store Clerk standing with her arms crossed and haughtily looking down on everyone; an efficient, practical sort of young woman (WOMAN #1); and another thin, pale woman whose baby is lying in a baby carrier in her shopping cart and who seems very nervous (WOMAN #2).
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does she have any teeth yet or not? That would give us a clue as to how old she is.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't looked.
	</DIALOGUE>
<STORE_CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
(coolly disagree- ing; to Woman #1)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My grandson's only five months old and he already has two teeth. But my daughter didn't have a single one at seven months -- so, y'know, how many teeth they have... doesn't mean a thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<WOMAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But didn't those friends of yours tell you what formula they usually give the baby?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(embarrassed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, actually they had to leave unexpectedly. They had to catch a plane...
	</DIALOGUE>
<WOMAN_1>
<DIRECTION>
(to Peter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she teething?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Teething?
	</DIALOGUE>
<WOMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does she drool? Does she cry all night long? Does she chew on her fists? Does she put everything into her mouth?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She acts out her words.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know she can't talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
<WOMAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But didn't those friends of yours tell you how old she was?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(as Woman #2 is
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	starting to get on
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
his nerves)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you they had to leave unexpectedly.
	</DIALOGUE>
<WOMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or else you could weigh her; that would tell you how old she is.
	</DIALOGUE>
<STORE_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, my five-month-old grandson weighs more than my neighbor's grandson and he's nine months old. So, y'know, how much they weigh... doesn't mean a thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what about me? What should I buy?
	</DIALOGUE>
<WOMAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't they even tell you the pediatrician's name?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(still calm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. They didn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
<WOMAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure have weird friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have no idea how weird.
	</DIALOGUE>
<WOMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or else her hair. Does she have lots of hair?
	</DIALOGUE>
<STORE_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My grandson, y'know, he has so much hair you can make a ponytail with it! And I know some kids who are totally bald at a year- and-a-half. So, y'know, how much hair they have... doesn't mean a thing...
	</DIALOGUE>
<WOMAN_1>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, he's really something, your grandson -- is he good at math too?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter starts to pick cans off the shelf.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, ladies, thanks for all the advice. But I think I'll just take one of each. To be on the safe side.
	</DIALOGUE>
<STOCK_CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
(to Peter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't forget -- if the baby's less than three months old, you have to be sure to sterilize the bottles.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter stops and turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What bottles?
	</DIALOGUE>
<WOMAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what? This must be a kidnapping.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - DAY Michael is rapidly pacing up and down the apartment, vigorously rocking Mary. As soon as he sits down anywhere to rest, MARY SCREAMS, so Michael pops back up and begins the marathon all over again.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb, if that jerk isn't back in three seconds I swear I'll throw her down the garbage chute... Mary had a little lamb, little lamb...

	What the hell kind of lousy stinking diapers did you get? They're way too big!

	Yes, he does.

<PUNK_1>

	We came for the package.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Package? Oh that's cute, referring to her as a package! Anyway, you can tell Sylvia she's a lousy stinking bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PUNK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sylvia?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, Sylvia! You can tell her she's got a hell of a nerve dumping her problems into our laps!

<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants to know if we had trouble!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have any idea what it's been like around here for the past four days?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She could have at least given us a phone number or the name of someone to contact...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PUNK_1>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't get it. Didn't they tell you we were gonna be here today?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure they told us! So what? That doesn't make the last four days any less hellish than they were!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, anyway, they're here now, that's all that matters!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter turns and walks toward the basket.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The next bottle's in 45 minutes. I made it already. It's in the basket.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PUNK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bottle? Whadda ya mean, bottle?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About an hour after her bottle, she starts yawning. Put her to bed right away or it's pure hell for the next three hours, at least that's what we've noticed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter has returned with the basket. The Punks look at the baby, their eyes wide with disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is that? A baby?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's a very short teenager. Of course it's a baby! Now listen carefully: I'm giving you a can of the milk she's been getting. She loves it, and more importantly, she's not allergic to it. I even put a can of the same brand in here for you, but in powdered form, understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Punk #1 hears "powder" and catches on.
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! I get it! Powdered milk! Very clever!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, right... real clever... Okay, here. She's all yours. Good luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He hands them the basket. Punk #1 grabs the handles.
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I got it. You can take her out now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take what out? I'm not taking anything out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PUNK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute, I don't get it! We take the basket and the milk, that's all. We ain't gonna take the... what's inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whadda ya mean, what's inside?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You take it all, man! It's a package deal!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PUNK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what are we s'posed to do with it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do I know? You take it where they told you to take it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PUNK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y'mean, I take it to the connection?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, whatever you want to call it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PUNK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure that's the plan?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bet that's the plan! We're not keeping her one more second.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PUNK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, if that's the plan...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He passes the basket to Punk #2
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Here, hold this. Okay, so long!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They start to leave, pressing the elevator button.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly a little worried)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... listen... maybe you could leave us the address or the phone number just in case. So we can find out how she's doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Punks exchange a puzzled glance.
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah, sure, the address.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(feebly searching his pockets)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit, I don't have it on me... But I'll call you. Okay, so long!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER_MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So long!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator has arrived. The Punks quickly slip inside it with the basket. Michael closes the door. Peter plops down in the armchair by the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aah, relief at last! Good riddance!
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said it! Now maybe I can get some work done.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He disappears in the direction of his room. Peter is sitting on something hard. He pulls it out from under him, it's a package. He looks at it, casually reading: "Care of Jack Collins." He tosses it to the side. Suddenly, it dawns on him. He leaps up, grabs the package and runs into Michael's room.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, a package, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was this package delivered to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, why?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter raises his voice, exasperated by Michael's calm attitude.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When the hell did this package arrive?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you quit shouting!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming even louder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did this fucking package fucking arrive, Michael?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know... Oh yeah, Sunday -- Mrs. Razzolini brought it up...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the package those guys came for, not the baby, you asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, asshole yourself!... Oh shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter nods and begins to bark orders.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look out the window and see if you see them, I'm gonna try to catch up with them...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael runs to the window. Peter runs like a madman through the apartment out the front door. He presses the button for the elevator. It's in use.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamit!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the door leading to the stairs and races down them, holding on to the bannister. He flies, overwhelmed by anxiety. Suddenly he trips, loses his balance and makes a spectacular crash landing. The package gets a bit crushed, and little individual packets of white powder spill out of it. Peter stares at them in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up a few packets and examines them.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God, no... dope! That's all we need!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to tremble with fear. He picks the packets up as fast as he can and hastily puts them back into what's left of the package; then shoves it all into his pocket and continues racing down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>

	You want to ride the subway with a hundred grand in uncut dope, go ahead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PUNK_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well we can't ride around carrying this baby basket. We'll get stopped by the cops.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PUNK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So go ahead, take the subway and stop bothering me. I'm going to hook this onto the back seat.

Peter comes rushing out of the building.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(huffing and puffing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, thank God, you're still here! There's been a terrible mistake. That wasn't the package you were s'posed to take. It was another one. I have it right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PUNK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean? What other package?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take the basket back and give you the other package, here. No mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter takes the package from his pocket and is about to grab the basket. Punk #1 pushes him back violently.
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ain't takin' nothin' back, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>

<PUNK_1>
<DIRECTION>
(in a low but very aggressive tone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You tryin' to double-cross us or something? Beat it before I get pissed, man.

<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(panic-stricken,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	in an equally
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
low tone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm telling you, I've got your package right here. There's been a mistake...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PUNK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A mistake my ass! Now get outa here, man, or I'm gonna stick this right in your gut.

<DIRECTION>
Punk #2 is about to get on the motorcycle. Peter stops him.

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm telling you, I've got the real package in my pocket.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PUNK_2>
<DIRECTION>
(to Punk #1)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch it, the cops!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter quickly puts back the package in his pocket. A patrol car comes up next to them, right beside the car in which Graton is sitting, taking in every bit of the action.
</DIRECTION>
<GRATON>
<DIRECTION>
(to his partner)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terrific! I bet these morons screw up everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
One of the COPS gets out of his car and comes over to the Punks and Peter. Peter is scared stiff.
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK_1>

	<DIALOGUE>
	If you called the cops on us, pal, you're a dead man.
	</DIALOGUE>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, what's that doing on the back of the bike?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
No one answers.
</DIRECTION>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wouldn't by any chance be intending to drive with a baby basket on your motorcycle, would you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PUNK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not, Officer. We'd never do something like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So why did you strap it on in the first place if you had no intention of driving with it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PUNK_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it wouldn't fall off.
	</DIALOGUE>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very funny.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As he speaks, Peter undoes the bungie cord from around the basket and takes it off the motorcycle.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, really, Officer, they weren't gonna drive off with it -- They were just watching it for me while I was doing a quick errand.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Punks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Punk #1 gives him a dirty look.
</DIRECTION>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, let's see some identification, everybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The punks exchange a glance. Suddenly Punk #1 shouts:
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They take off running in different directions. Cop #1 charges after Punk #1 and yells to his partner who's still in the car:
</DIRECTION>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch the guy with the basket!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Cop #2 leaps out of the car, gun in hand. Peter stiffens with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<COP_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freeze! All right, asshole, let's see some I.D.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(urbanely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Officer, let's stay calm now. I haven't the slightest intention of running. I am not a criminal. I'm an architect.
	</DIALOGUE>
<COP_2>
<DIRECTION>
(calming down a little)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your I.D., let's see it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm terribly sorry, Officer, but I don't have any identification on me. I just came down with my baby to run a quick errand. I haven't committed any crime.
	</DIALOGUE>
<COP_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, let's go, in the car. I'm taking you down to the station.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, c'mon, that's impossible -- you see I have a baby. I have to give her a bottle in fifteen minutes, I can't go anywhere. I live right in this building -- let me go up to my apartment and I'll get you my license immediately... You can even come with me if you like...
	</DIALOGUE>
<COP_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, lead the way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They disappear inside the building. Peter is carrying the basket in his left hand; his right hand is clenched on the horrible package hidden in his pocket. Just then Cop #1 comes running back, empty-handed. Graton gets out of his car and comes up to Cop #1, show- ing him his badge.
</DIRECTION>
<GRATON>
<DIRECTION>
(angry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inspector Graton, Narcotics. It just so happens I was tailing those two guys and now because of you clowns I lost them, probably forever. Thanks a lot!
	</DIALOGUE>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could we know?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it. Listen, your partner went in here with the guy and the baby. He lives up on the tenth floor. I can't go in because if he sees me, my cover is blown. So could you please try not to lose this one, okay? He's someone who's gotta be watched very closely. I've called for backup and it's on its way.

<COP_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks. I'll just wait out here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter enters the apartment and calmly crosses through the house, carrying the basket. As soon as he's out of the cop's sight, he starts running like a madman down the corridor. He runs into Michael who was just coming to meet him.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, what's happening? What were those cops doing...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter shuts him up, grabs him roughly under the arm and leads him into his room, closing the door behind them. Peter speaks softly but he's totally freaking out, he can hardly breathe.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael... Michael... we're in deep trouble. The package... The package...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a cop on the doorstep... He didn't see you... He mustn't see you... We're in deep trouble, Michael...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me what...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The package they came for wasn't the baby, it was dope, drugs, a shitload of dope! We were stopped by some cops down on the street.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But did the cops see the dope?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's right here.

He takes out the package.

Michael takes the package, opens the window and starts to climb out it when Peter stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, whatever you do, don't lose the goddamn dope, we gotta be able to return it to those dealers or we're dead. Those guys are serious.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts down the fire escape, then stops and turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, by the way, I put some water up to boil for her bottle.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael disappears. Peter picks up Mary, grabs his wal- let and leaves the room. When he gets to the hall, he discovers that Cop #1 has joined Cop #2, to whom he is whispering something. Peter holds his license out for them to see.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's my license.
	</DIALOGUE>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to remain in the apartment. The narcotics squad will be arriving any moment now. They want to ask you a few questions.

	Narcotics squad? What do they want with me? I don't even use aspirin!

INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY Michael is buying a pair of scissors, glue and a roll of Scotch tape. Then he buys a box of large diapers -- he chooses the ones that come in a box. Michael leaves the supermarket, whistling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARK - DAY Michael is sitting on a bench facing the grass, with his back to us, he seems quite busy. As we CLOSE IN, we discover that he has opened the box of diapers and that he's holding one of them; its plastic has been carefully cut out with scissors. Casually, glancing right and left, he takes the individ- ual packets of white powder out of his pocket and shoves them into a little plastic bag from the supermarket. Then he carefully tapes the bag so it's well-sealed and flattened out, and he inserts it into the diaper, be- tween the plastic and the absorbent fabric. Next, the diaper is taped up, folded back up and put back in the box, neatly packed between the other ones. Michael closes the box again and glues it together so it looks as if it's never been opened. He throws all the other stuff away in a trash can and grabs hold of his brand-new box of diapers. He walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - DAY Michael comes into the living room with his box of diapers and a bag of groceries. In addition to the two cops there are now THREE NARCOTIC AGENTS who are interrogating Peter. He is holding Mary. The basket is on an armchair.

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I just gave it to her.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Agent #1 picks up the other telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Jack? Fine, yeah. How're you? Yeah, he's fine, too. Yeah, we left a message for you, right... No, it was nothing special, it was just, I mean... to see how you were doing and all ... No, no emergency. Everything's fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (loud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said everything's fine! The what?... I don't know what you're talking about... Oh yeah, the package! Yeah, yeah, it got here ... and was picked up, uh-huh. Hey! Why didn't you call sooner? Huh? 'Cause what?... Oh, you're onto something hot -- well, aren't you the lucky one!... So when are you getting married?... Forget it, I was just kidding... Well, everything's fine up here. So have a good time. See you in a couple of weeks. 'Bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter hangs up. So does Agent #1.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that's interesting. So you wanna tell me about this package and the hot something-or-other your friend lucked onto... in La Paz... Bolivia... South America?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter sits down, stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - DAY Mary is lying on Michael's bed. He has just finished putting a regular diaper on her. Then Michael looks for the tampered-with diaper in the box. He finds it, checks that it is well-sealed, and places it under Mary's bottom. Just then Agent #3 appears in the doorway. Michael calmly finishes putting the dope-filled diaper on the baby on top of the other one. MARY is COOING. Every- thing appears normal. However, a trained eye might be very surprised by the enormous thickness of the diaper covering the young lady's backside. But a narcotics agent is not necessarily the most qualified person to notice something odd like this. Agent #3 silently observes Michael, who gives him a big smile as he slips on Mary's pajama bottoms. Michael picks Mary up and for the first time talks to her in the kind of silly babytalk used by adoring parents.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okey-dokey, honeybunch, it's time to go beddy-bye now... We're gonna take a nice long nappy-wappy...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He goes back to the living room, followed by Agent #3.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Agent #1 is in the process of showing Peter a photograph.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you recognize anyone in this picture?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter looks: it's the photo of Jack and Paul that was taken at the beginning of the movie.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. This is Jack Collins.
	</DIALOGUE>
<AGENT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah? Now that's interesting.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael has laid Mary down for a nap in her basket, observed by the five cops. He now sits down, cheerful and bubbling over with enthusiasm.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So! Can I get you something to drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Agent #1 totally ignores him.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, who's the baby belong to?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Jack's daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<AGENT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And why are you two taking care of her?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because her mother's in Europe for six months, and since Jack had to be away for two weeks, I took my vacation to take care of her, I love kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, Peter and I just love kids!
	</DIALOGUE>
<AGENT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that's interesting. Well, we'll be seeing each other again soon, in fact very soon. In the meantime, I'd appreciate it if you didn't leave New York in the next few days.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
All the cops head for the door. Michael accompanies them, putting on a very urbane act.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come back anytime, gentlemen. You're always welcome here. We have no particular plans to leave New York in the near future, so don't worry about us now. 'Bye now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Once the cops are gone, Michael races back to the living room. Peter has collapsed into his armchair.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(in a low tone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ, what a mess! They'll be on our tails around the clock! How the hell are we gonna get rid of the goddamn dope?! By the way, where is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(also speaking in a low tone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's cool, don't worry, I got it stashed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael points to Mary's bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This way it's close at hand!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you out of your mind??
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax, will you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I diapered the dope on her right in front of the cop and he never noticed a thing!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told the cops we were taking care of her. You realize we're now stuck with the kid till Jack comes back. There ain't nobody coming to pick her up, and I have to go back to the office today!
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. You're not gonna stick me with this kid! Tell them you need a maternity leave, tell them anything, but we've got to go 50-50 on this!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's not all -- we haven't heard from the punks yet either!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY Hidden within a parked car, three men are keeping a close watch on the entrance to Peter, Michael and Jack's build- ing. The two uniformed cops emerge, get in their car, and pull away.

(CONT'D) (yells)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Goddammit, Jerry, of course winning the competition is important to me! The firm's my whole life if you must know. No, no, please -- don't send anyone over here... Don't you come either. No, Jerry... Okay, listen, I'll be there in a half-hour, but I can't stay long. No! Don't come here! I'll be right over.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up. Michael enters the room, with his coat on.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta go over to Mr. Oxman's -- he just called and he's freaking out. He says if I don't bring some cartoons over now, the deal's off.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going now?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but don't worry about it, I'll be back before it's time for her next bottle. She's asleep now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terrific, just terrific! Jerry just called: I have to go to the office right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, call him back. Tell him you'll come later.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no way. I can't, he's suicidal. Why don't you call Oxman and tell him you'll be there in a few hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're crazy. Oxman is leaving in an hour. If I don't meet him before then, I blow my 15,000 dollar contract.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit, I can't take this anymore!
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, maybe we could pawn her off on Mrs. Razzolini, just for a couple of hours -- she's crazy about her!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good idea! Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUILDING - DUSK Peter and Michael get out of the elevator on Mrs. Razzolini's floor. They each are holding one of the handles on the basket. They are walking quickly. Suddenly Michael stops Peter.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait -- I hear someone... I'll go see...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter waits with the basket. Michael tiptoes to the corner of the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the very end of the corridor, on Mrs. Razzolini's doorstep, he sees the three narcotics Agents talking with Mrs. Razzolini. We can hear snippets of their conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<RAZZOLINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I brought a package up to them... I think it was last Sunday...
	</DIALOGUE>
<AGENT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are these people like? What kind of lifestyle do they have?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael hastily returns to Peter, still on tiptoes. He leads him back to the elevator and pushes the elevator button.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just as I thought -- the goddamn cops are grilling Mrs. Razzolini.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit! We sure as hell can't hand her the baby with an ass full of dope... right in front of the narcs!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator has arrived meanwhile.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(breaking down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What should we do? I really gotta go...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, she's just had her bottle. She's sleeping like a log. Let's just leave her in the apartment. What can possibly happen to her? She's as regular as clockwork. She won't wake up till 8:30 and we'll easily be back by then...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you're right, we won't be long.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They rush into the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DUSK The three men, slumped in their car, are watching the door of the apartment building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three narcotics Agents emerge from the building and walk away. A short time goes by. Peter and Michael emerge from the building and quickly walk away. The three men get out of their car, cross the street and enter the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peter comes out of the elevator, key in hand. He's about to put it in the lock on the door, but stops short -- the door is already open.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael? Michael, are you here?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. Peter pushes the door open. The sight that greets his eyes is very dismaying. It looks like a tornado has hit the house. Everything's on the floor, it's all been smashed, it's all been ripped apart. Gone is the beauti- ful apartment that had been so lovingly decorated. In its place, utter devastation and shambles. Peter stands there speechless for a moment, then an awful thought crosses his mind. He runs like crazy into his room -- the basket's not there. Stepping over the debris and all the things strewn over the floor, he rushes into the living room, then into Michael's room. The basket's nowhere to be seen. Peter falls apart; without even realizing it, he's moan- ing and muttering distractedly. He runs into Jack's room, into the kitchen, into the bathroom. The basket is nowhere to be seen. Peter runs all over, back and forth ten times in all the rooms. Tears are flowing from his eyes. Suddenly, he hears FAINT CRIES. They're coming from the back bathroom. Peter rushes to it, practically ripping the door from its hinges. There on the toilet is the basket, and on it there's a note written in big messy printing which says: "NEXT TIME WE TAKE HER." Mary looks at Peter and smiles; she seems in great shape. A distraught Peter picks her up, hugs her tightly and kisses her all over as he takes her into his room. Just then, Michael appears in the corridor, silent and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
overwhelmed. He comes to the door to Peter's room and looks at him. Peter, mortified to have been caught kissing Mary, hastily distances himself from her, hold- ing her at arm's length. He puts her down on his bed and exits the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT The debris has been shoved up against the walls. Peter and Michael, in their pajamas and dead tired, are slumped over the table. Peter is giving Mary her bottle. Michael is looking at Mary as though he were seeing her for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PETER'S ROOM - NIGHT Peter is in bed, completely out of it. Michael is changing Mary very carefully. He puts one diaper on her, then the second one, full of dope. He lays Mary down in her basket, then places the basket on the bed, nestled between the wall and Peter's body. Michael, holding the soiled diaper, silently goes out. Once he's alone, Peter leans over the basket. Mary and he stare at each other intently and seriously. Peter switches off the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - DAWN The DOORBELL RINGS. Michael, asleep on his mattress on the floor in the middle of his wrecked bedroom, emerges from sleep and glances at his clock: it's 6:10 AM. He staggers to the front door and opens it. The door is being held together with a string. Agents #1, #2, and #3 are at the door, with four other cops backing them up. Mrs. Razzolini is standing behind them and staring, wide- eyed, a look of horror on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning, officers. Can I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<AGENT_1>
<DIRECTION>
(holding out a piece of paper to him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Search warrant.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(playing the gentleman, waving away the paper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe you, officer. Go ahead, we have nothing to hide. Hello, Mrs. Razzolini!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Razzolini turns her back on him and hurries away. The cops enter the apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll have to excuse the mess... We had a few friends over last night...
	</DIALOGUE>
<AGENT_1>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at the devastation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, really? Well, if I were you I'd get myself some new friends!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter comes in, in his bathrobe, furious.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you guys looking for, anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
<AGENT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably the same things your friends were looking for last night! Didn't Mrs. Razzolini bring you a package last Sunday?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean the chocolate Easter bunnies? We ate them already.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to walk away.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, you have no idea how many packages we've been getting lately. It's hard to keep track of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<AGENT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we can help.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to his colleagues)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get to work!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
All the cops enter the apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PETER'S ROOM - DAY Peter is in bed, with the basket beside him. A narcotics AGENT is rummaging through his scattered belongings.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you mind if I look in your bed?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(big smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My pleasure. Try not to make a mess.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter gets up, takes the basket off the bed and keeps it in his hands. The Agent searches the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll look in the basket, if you don't mind...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be my guest.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up Mary with her huge diaper. The Agent searches the whole basket.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you very much, sorry about this...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He goes out. Peter, undaunted, pats Mary's big behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - DAY The cops are leaving.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there's obviously been a mistake. As far as you're concerned this investigation is closed. We apologize again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(big smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, don't mention it! It was a pleasure having you here! I hope you'll find what you're looking for very soon!
	</DIALOGUE>
<AGENT_1>
<DIRECTION>
(looking straight at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So do we.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael closes the door and races into the living room where he discovers Peter putting on his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you hear that? He said there'd been a mistake and they weren't going to bother us anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullshit, it's a trick.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think so? Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They just said that to put us off guard. They saw the condition this apartment's in.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They know the punks were here looking for the dope and that they probably didn't find it. So that means we've still got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he said the investigation was closed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, let's just see how closed it is. I'll go downstairs. You watch out the window and see if I'm being tailed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY Michael is peeking out at the street from the window above. Peter comes out of the building and turns left, walking very quickly. Suddenly, Peter stops, turns around and retraces his steps. We can clearly see a man, who was walking about six yards behind Peter on the opposite side of the street, also turn around and retrace his steps. It is Graton.
</DIRECTION>

<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(entering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So? Was I right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's one guy for sure! A redhead, kind of young, disguised sort of like a college student.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew it. They're going to be watching us around the clock. How are we going to get the dope back to the punks?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have the feeling they'll come to us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll have to be very careful.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHTFALL Michael is walking on the street carrying two bags of groceries. Suddenly, a guy walks up to him and elbows him sharply.
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi! Doin' a little shopping, huh? How's your place -- not too much damage, I hope.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you guys want?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PUNK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We want the dope. Tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And we want to give it to you. But the cops are tailing us nonstop. Matter of fact, there's one right behind us now...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PUNK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's your problem, man. Figure out a way to shake 'em. Either we safely get the dope tomorrow, or you, your friend and the kid'll get this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he quickly stabs
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	the grocery bags
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
three times)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll call you tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He runs off, disappearing into the darkness. From the slit-open grocery bag milk flows out onto the sidewalk. Michael is shaking all over. Standing about twenty yards away, Graton hasn't missed a thing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COP CAR - NIGHT Not far from Peter, Michael and Jack's building, Graton, in his car, is talking into the microphone of his police radio.
</DIRECTION>
<GRATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... My snitch told me the gang hasn't gotten the dope back yet, but they will soon. They made contact with the two guys tonight ... No, no, they don't know I'm tailing them. These jerks are going to fall right into my hands...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT Peter and Michael are seated in the living room, which is still an utter wreck. They can't take their eyes off the phone that's between the two of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are sitting silently, not moving. Mary is playing in her basket. The PHONE RINGS. Peter and Michael both jump three feet in the air. Michael picks up the phone.

	Jack? What the hell are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(listens to a long explanation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... yeah... oh yeah? Well, listen very carefully, Jack. That wonderful, fantastic babe you brought back from Bolivia? The one you're gonna marry tomorrow? Well, you're not going to bring her here!... You are going to say 'goodbye' to her very nicely and put her in a cab back to Bolivia... Why? Because there's another wonderful, fantastic babe waiting for you right here at home ... Who is she? Oh, that's a surprise! You'll see when you get here. But believe me, she's out of this world. You're going to be up all night with this babe. She's crazy about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(in a low tone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make it quick, the punks may be trying to call...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So hurry home, Jack, this little doll can't wait to see you. 'Bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up.

<PETER>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That goddamn mother fuckin' jerk of an asshole! I swear when he comes through the door I'll kill him! I'll...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The PHONE interrupts. Michael leaps up and answers it.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Listen, tomorrow, Central Park at the fountain near the merry-go-round, five o'clock. Be there, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They've hung up on the other end. Michael hangs up and sits down, drained.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... That was it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(equally drained)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All we can do now is hope our plan works.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think the cops have our phone bugged?

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think that's legal, is it?

EXT. STREET - NIGHT Graton is speaking into the microphone of his radio. Next to him sits a cop with phone-tapping equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<GRATON>
<DIRECTION>

	We got 'em, Chief. Five o'clock tomorrow at the fountain near the merry-go-round! I'll arrange for back-up... Hold it, someone's going into their building...

We see Jack getting out of a taxi with his luggage and going into the building.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yoo-hoo, guys! I'm home! I've got presents for you... so where's that wonderful fantastic babe...

<DIRECTION>
He enters and sees the state the apartment is in.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... What the hell happened here?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He walks into the apartment, shocked and overwhelmed.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peter! Michael! Are you here?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He goes into the living room -- No one'sthere. Into Michael's room. No one's there. He goes into his own room, where the destruction is even moreshocking than elsewhere since nothing has been touchedin there.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael!... Peter -- where the hell are you, for Chrissakes?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He runs like a madman into Peter's room and stops short on the threshold. Michael and Peter are each holding a handle of the basket as they rock it gently.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(furious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is going on around here? What happened to this place? What happened to my room?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter and Michael look him right in the eye, still rocking the basket.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And anyway, what the hell are you swinging that thing for?

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I get it. The 'silent' treatment! Okay, if you won't talk to me, you can talk to my lawyer! This is grounds for divorce! You're in big trouble, the both of you.

He leaves. A second later, he comes back.

<PETER>

(very calmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would it be asking too much of you to shut your big mouth for a few seconds? There is a child here who's trying to sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's another thing! I will not have a baby in this house! Babies are not part of our agreement!

<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael, please hold me back... or I'll kill him.

Michael takes the basket handle from Peter's hand, places the basket carefully on the bed, and walks without a word towards Jack, who he takes by the arm and steers into the living room. Peter softly shuts the door behind them and follows.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Michael sits Jack down in an armchair. He speaks with forced calm.

<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(his fuse has blown, laughing hysterically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His nerves! Ha. Ha. Ha. His nerves! Michael, his nerves! You wanna talk about nerves! Then just shut up and listen. It so happens we don't want a kid here either, but when someone dumps one on us, we take goddamn care of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, we take goddam care of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We haven't had a decent night's sleep in two weeks. Michael's probably going to lose a $15,000 contract...

	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First, we've got the narcs on our ass, then there's the drug gang threatening to carve us up. Then bottles... bottles... every three hours, bottles.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And diapers. Have you ever tried to do diapers?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'La Paz, Bolivia...' He calls from ... 'I'm onto something hot.' He says. 'Did the package get there?' He says. You asshole!

(cutting him off; embarrassed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never mind about that. Look, Jack, you got us into this mess, and you're going to help us get out of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you guys talking about? What narcs? What gang? And who's that fucking baby?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For your information, the 'fucking' baby's name is Mary. And if I were you, I'd watch what I said about her... because she just so happens to be your daughter!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What??
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it just so happens, we've got a lot better things to do with our lives than wipe a baby's ass, even if she's yours!

Peter and Michael exit, slamming the door.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARY, wearing a bonnet and coat, is lying on one of the couches, CHIRPING merrily. Next to her, also in his coat, Michael is just finishing wrapping a brown package which he puts in a plastic bag, along with a book, a baby rattle, and a clean diaper. Peter and Jack, disguised as punks, each with punk hairstyles and wearing black sunglasses, are climbing out the window leading to the fire escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY Michael exits the building. Mary, wrapped in a little woolen blanket, is in his arms. Michael is also carry- ing his plastic bag. Graton, in his car, is speaking into the radio mike.
</DIRECTION>
<GRATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, he's coming out alone. I'll follow him. Someone else stay here to keep an eye on the other guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY Michael is lying on the grass near the fountain with Mary on her blanket near him. Graton is nearby, also lying casually on the grass, watching them out of the corner of his eye. Michael glances at his watch, then at the passersby. The punk from the day before walks by with his arm around a girl. He strolls by casually. He spots Michael and their eyes meet. The couple sit down on a bench a few yards away and they begin "making out."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael leans over Mary, coochie-coos her and surrepti- tiously takes off her diaper, which he puts down beside him. He puts the clean diaper on her. Graton, nervous and wary, watches Michael and the passersby. Just then, two punks (Peter and Jack) come running up to Michael. He ostensibly takes the brown package out of his plastic bag and gives it to them. The two punks immediately take off with the package. Graton leaps up, shouts "let's get 'em" and takes off after the punks, followed by about 10 other plainclothes detectives, who'd been hiding all around. Michael quickly gets up, picks Mary up and discreetly deposits the dope-filled diaper in a trash can, giving the punk on the bench an intent look. Then he goes off in the direction of the cops. The punk calmly goes over to the trash can, takes out the diaper, which he stuffs into his girl friend's purse, and goes off in the opposite direction. The cops have meanwhile arrested Peter and Jack, who put up no resistance whatsoever. Michael now joins them.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inspector Graton, Narcotics. Do you admit you gave these men this package?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. I gave it to them, just a moment ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRATON>
<DIRECTION>
(to one of the cops)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Officer, will you please open this package in front of these witnesses?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The cop opens the package: it's a box of chocolate Easter bunnies. Graton is mortified. He crushes all the bunnies -- there's absolutely nothing but chocolate inside them.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it against the law to give a box of candy to my friends?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter and Jack take off their glasses.

	Oh, it's you guys!

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly freezes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit! The diaper!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Graton starts running like crazy back to the fountain. He rummages like a sick dog all around the spot where Michael had been lying. Suddenly he dashes toward the trash can and dumps out its contents, throwing the garbage around like a lunatic.
</DIRECTION>
<GRATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The goddam diaper! What a jerk, what a goddam schmuck I am!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter, Michael, Jack and the 10 plainclothes detectives watch Graton going bananas.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>

INT. GRATON'S BOSS'S OFFICE - DAY The Chief is standing behind his desk, red-faced with anger, and Graton sheepishly faces him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's face it... Graton... You've got shit for brains.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure the dope was in the diaper. Can I go on tailing them?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it. I have solid information your three suspects never had anything to do with the dealers or the dope.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure the dope was in the diaper.

INT. APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - EVENING In the devastated living room Peter, still disguised as a punk, and Michael, both very high, are dancing around in circles with each other and laughing. They are singing a lullaby at the top of their lungs, and har- monizing. Peter is holding Mary close, and Michael, holding a near-empty bottle of liquor, staggers over to him and starts turning around in circles with him. MARY, snuggled up warmly between Peter and Michael, is LAUGHING her head off. In the b.g., in the hall, Jack, also still in his punk getup, is on the phone. He's got a glass in his hand and is a little smashed.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul, hi, it's Jack! Hey, listen, I brought you back a little present from South America. Can I see you right away so I can give it to you? ... Yeah, the sooner the better! I can't wait to let you have it. How about 67th and East River?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EAST RIVER - EVENING A broadly smiling Jack arrives at the riverside. Paul is sitting on a bench. When he sees Jack, he gets up and comes to greet him, smiling and extending his hand. Without warning, Jack suddenly jumps him and sends him with a forceful shove flying into the water. Paul lands on his back with a big splash, and comes back up to the surface totally dumbfounded. Jack leans over the water and yells at him, like a madman, still a bit drunk.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was for your 'little' package, and consider yourself lucky I didn't turn you in to the cops! And get one thing into your thick skull: I have never touched dope, and I never will. You and your shit-dealing, you can go straight to hell, and you can take the money you make from it and stick it up your ass! So long.

Jack turns his back on Paul and staggers off.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Sylvia, you've got to come back. I travel, I can't take care of her... Yeah, but you're her mother... I'm her father -- what makes you so sure I'm the father!? The dates coincide! Big deal! That doesn't prove a thing... But she's still your kid, so do me a favor, get your ass back here immediately and take her off our hands... 'Cause we've got a lot better things to do with our lives than wipe a baby's ass, okay? Sylvia?... Hello! Hello! Sylvia, goddam it!

<JACK>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The PHONE RINGS. Michael answers it.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Jesus Christ, Michael, why didn't you let me talk to her!?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She would have just hung up on you again. The important thing is she knows Mary's fine.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON The DOORBELL RINGS. Jack goes to the door. At the door stands a rather distinguished-looking woman, with her hair tied back very properly, a suitcase in her hand. It is MRS. BRETSAWS, who speaks with a British accent.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_BRETSAWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good afternoon. I'm Mathilda Bretsaws, from The Second Mommy agency.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(very eager, very gracious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes, I was expecting you. Won't you come in...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They disappear into the living room. Jack shuts the door behind him. Michael peeks into the hall, then goes and looks into the living room through the crack in the door. Peter, too, peeks in.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must be some nanny he found through an agency.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter shrugs and walks away. Jack comes out of the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(softly, to Michael)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wants to see Mary.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's asleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, she wants to see her anyway!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He heads toward Peter's room.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(returning from the kitchen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing, nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't go into my room, she's asleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but the nanny, Mrs. Bretsaws, she wants to see her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, damn it, no! You're gonna wake her up! It already took me an hour to sing her to sleep...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but she wants to see her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, I'll go explain the situation.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(holding him back with both hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, Peter, please, really, don't go, don't bother, I'll go explain it to her myself...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's no bother, Jack. I'll be glad to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He rushes toward the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(sighing, to Michael)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wanna bet she's out of here in ten minutes slamming the door behind her?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They tiptoe over to the living room door and eavesdrop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... A sleeping child should not be awakened. If you don't know that, then you're not fit to be a nanny.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MRS_BRETSAWS>
<DIRECTION>
(tense, but still calm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never said that I wanted the child to be awakened, sir. I only asked to see her. If I'm going to be taking care of the child on a round-the-clock basis, then...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Round-the-clock'? Whaddya mean 'round the clock'? Are you intending to sleep here?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MRS_BRETSAWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely, sir. A second mommy is a second mommy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And where are you going to sleep?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MRS_BRETSAWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I expect you to show me to my quarters.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't know where Jack intends to stick you... That's his problem... Maybe in his room... But I'm warning you, Mrs. Brestshow.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MRS_BRETSAWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bretsaws.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are three of us sharing this place and we're all real studs.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON Behind the door, Jack rolls his eyes, Michael empathizes with him. They head back to the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_BRETSAWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... And as for screwing, I have all I need at home, thank you very much. With a few days off every month, I'm sure I'll be fine. The only thing I'm interested in is the care of the child and I can tell she needs some.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah? How do you figure that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MRS_BRETSAWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shouldn't I be discussing all this with the father?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, listen, Mrs. Fretsaw, umm... Brainsore...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MRS_BRETSAWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bretsaws, Mrs. Bretsaws.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right... Bratsnot, lemme tell you something. With a child you always know who the mother is, but the father -- that's another kettle of fish. So don't give me that bullshit, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MRS_BRETSAWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well. I won't discuss it any further with you. Will you please show me where the kitchen and the bathroom are?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What for?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MRS_BRETSAWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I can make you a list of the things we need.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, make you a list? -- Don't you do the shopping yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MRS_BRETSAWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No shopping or laundry or housekeeping. I am a professional nanny.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have plenty of everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MRS_BRETSAWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have a sufficient amount of fruit and vegetables for the child?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She only eats milk and cereal.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MRS_BRETSAWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not enough, sir. From the age of three months children should be started on a normal, varied diet.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh that's bullshit. You don't feed a baby like an adult.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MRS_BRETSAWS>
<DIRECTION>
(mockingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, really? And how would you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've read plenty of books. The diet recommended by those quack pediatricians today is way too rich. I'm in favor of natural methods, Mrs. Breathmint.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MRS_BRETSAWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bretsaws, Mrs. Bretsaws.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For instance, if a child is having trouble getting to sleep, what would you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MRS_BRETSAWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Depends, if it was a continuing problem, I might recommend a mild sedative...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(exploding, triumphantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew you'd say something like that, you jerk!
	</DIALOGUE>
<MRS_BRETSAWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. Anything you say, sir. Let me just remind you that I have my diploma and that medicine is a serious matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know the song that goes 'Medicine's a whore and the pharmacist is her pimp'?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MRS_BRETSAWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't. We must listen to different music. Personally I'm very fond of opera.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Breakballs, if you don't get out of here right this minute I'm gonna punch you in the nose! This is my home, now get out!
	</DIALOGUE>
<MRS_BRETSAWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The name's Bretsaws. I am blessed with infinite patience when it comes to children, sir, but I'm not qualified to deal with lunatics. Goodbye and good luck!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Bretsaws grabs her suitcase and exits, dignified and stiff as a broom, slamming the door behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON Michael and Jack are sitting at the table.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did I tell you? Ten minutes to the second!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, listen, you guys... I've tried everything and nothing's working: my mother's off on a cruise; Mrs. Razzolini won't speak to us ever since the whole business with the cops -- we don't want to involve any of our girlfriends; Sylvia's taking it easy in Europe and there's no way she's gonna come back now that Michael went and told her everything's just fine and dandy. Peter did a terrific job getting rid of Mrs. Bretsaws, and all that's left are the daycare centers, but Peter's positive they're a breeding pit for A.I.D.S. So you tell me: What are we suppose to do? You want me to split with the kid? Or dump her in an orphanage?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(pretending to play the violin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, her mother'll be back in less than five months. Let's not waste a shitload of time looking for a solution for such a short time. Let's get organized.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, organized?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you'll have to ask to fly the New York-Washington shuttle for five months, on account of serious personal problems.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Never! I'd rather be a subway conductor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(barking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then dump her in an orphanage, 'cause there's no way we're gonna take care of her all by ourselves anymore!
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, stop arguing, you two! Jack, you're going to have to ask to do the New York-Washington shu...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(stubborn, yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Never.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(unruffled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That way, you can do the 6-10 A.M. shift. That amounts to two bottles and two diaper changes. You do the shopping when you get home in the evening and that's all. Peter, you'll take the 6-10 P.M. shift. That's two bottles and two diaper changes, her bath and her laundry. Since I work at home I'll take the longest shift from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. I'll take her to the park for an hour, but that's it. No shopping, no cooking, no cleaning.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if she gets up at night? Whose shift is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... I thought you might do it...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a chance! I'm not doing the night shift. I absolutely refuse. I have too much work to catch up on for the competition.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, needless to say I refuse, too!
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me, you selfish bastards! My shift is eight hours in a row. No way I'm gonna do nights too. After 6 P.M. she can scream all she wants, I don't give a shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Jack, you're a real slime ball! We give you the easiest shift: the morning. She's always in great shape in the morning, isn't she? We've got to work like crazy to save our jobs and you have the nerve to refuse nights. Goddamit, she's your daughter. Are you that horny?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(extremely pissed off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, horny yourself! I don't give a shit. I don't need you guys. I'll find some other way to do it. And I won't take the New York-Washington shuttle!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He exits, furious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHARTER COMPANY - DAY Jack is coming out of an office that says "EXECUTIVE OFFICES." He is grim and sullen-looking. He runs into his friend Paul, who jumps three feet away to avoid a potential mishap with Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(shyly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Jack, something wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(who hadn't noticed him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hi... Nah, nothing's wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What were you doing in the boss's office?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was asking to do the New York- Washington shuttle for a few months.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, and he said 'no,' huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(barking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a matter of fact, he said 'yes.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul backs up against the wall, protecting his face with his arms. Jack leaves, disgusted. Paul watches him go, totally confused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK'S ROOM - NIGHT Jack is sitting on his bed, wearing a dressing gown. He's got a sleeping Mary in his arms. The basket is on the floor beside the bed. Jack attempts to put Mary back in her basket but she shudders and he immediately sits back down again and doesn't move. Mary falls back asleep. Jack looks at her skin, her hands. Very gently, he kisses her forehead. Mary smiles in her sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - MORNING Michael is working at his drafting table. Jack rushes in, wearing his uniform, ready to go out.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I'm off. She's well fed and she's sleeping now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
We hear MARY CRYING.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, she's crying. I'll go pick her up...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter passes him in the corridor. He, too, is ready to go out to his office.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let her cry, she's just trying to get to sleep, she'll stop in a couple of minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, she needs to burp -- I've gotta rock her for a little...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm telling you, the more you pick her up, the longer it'll take her to get to sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for the advice -- now why don't you just shove it? I know you let her scream for hours but I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(in a state of shock)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never let her scream for hours!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd resort to any theory to not take care of her. Just because you've read some books...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you believe what he just said to me... I read those books bec...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not your shift, anyway. Piss off, will ya?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, guys, cool it! It's my shift now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll rock her for a few minutes...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Peter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and then I'll put her right to bed. So off to work, both of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes them both out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - DAY It's noon, the sun is shining brightly. Michael is diapering Mary on her changing table. She's naked. He tickles her, bites her toes, neck and ears; she bursts out laughing. Michael is totally gaga over her.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coochie, coochie, coo... woo, woo, woo... bippity, boppity boo...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter comes rushing into the apartment and runs toward his room. He stops short in the corridor -- he hears Mary's laughter and Michael's coochie-coo's. Noiselessly he tiptoes over to the living room door and listens, troubled. Then he walks away and shouts, as though he were just coming out of his room.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Michael, I just came back to get a file I forgot...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael stops his baby-talk immediately, as though sud- denly paralyzed, embarrassed, guilty. Peter enters the room.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(without looking at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(not moving)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I guess I'll be going now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(not moving either)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They're both uneasy.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The baby okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(not budging an inch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - EVENING Peter enters the bathroom. He's carrying Mary, who's naked and wrapped in a towel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peter carefully locks the door behind him. He removes Mary's towel and sits her in her little tub, filled with warm water. Mary quivers as she comes in contact with the water. Peter kneels down and very gently pours glasses of water on her shoulders and head. The water streams down her face. She blinks and laughs. Peter whispers lovingly to her in a barely audible, very low voice. Mary stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<FADE_OUT>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAME SCENE - MONTHS LATER Peter is wearing a different suit and Mary is almost one-year-old, with a lot more hair on her head, and able to sit up a lot better.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK'S ROOM - NIGHT Although it is dark, we can distinguish in Jack's bed a rather bulky shape, which is moving around under the comforter and doesn't exactly seem to be sleeping... Suddenly, from the direction of the living room, we can hear MARY CRYING. Jack emerges from under the comforter and switches on the light: he has a female guest in his bed, a pretty BRUNETTE this time.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, she's crying...
	</DIALOGUE>
<BRUNETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing, nothing. I'll be right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up, slips on a bathrobe and goes out of the bedroom, carefully closing the door behind him. He goes into the living room, picks Mary up, and showers her with kisses. Mary stops crying immediately and lays her head on Jack's shoulder, sucking her thumb. Jack rocks her for a moment then puts her back to bed. Mary instantly starts crying again. Jack very quickly picks her up again and kisses her. Mary is delighted by his tenderness. Jack puts her back to bed again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary cries again.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It' beddy-bye time now, honey, beddy-bye, don't cry, sweetheart...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Mary keeps crying, Jack picks her up again. Peter and Michael in their pajamas, their faces swollen with sleep, enter the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(in a soft voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's crying.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(hushed voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, every time I try to put her back to bed...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(hushed voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe she's thirsty?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, her back teeth must be starting to bother her...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What should I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've bought some stuff for her gums.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He rubs some of the medication on Mary's gums.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try and put her back to bed; we'll sing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack puts Mary back to bed. Michael, as a routine, sings a major chord, giving each of them their notes. They start singing a lullabye in three-part harmony, as they lean over the crib. Mary is in seventh heaven. She looks up at them, she stops crying, she sucks her thumb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK'S ROOM - NIGHT The Brunette is listening to the male chorus, totally amazed.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This guy's totally whacko.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She gets up, slips on a T-shirt, and exits the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stops at the door to the living room and contemplates the three men who are singing earnestly around the crib.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNETTE>
<DIRECTION>
(in a loud voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, choir boys, you gonna keep it up all night?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter and Michael stare at her, scandalized. Jack gestures wildly to her to shut up and go away.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God! There's a baby in there! I'm sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She goes back to Jack's room.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(hissing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the hell's that broad?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch your mouth, will you? I'm in love with that young lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't she speak softly like everyone else?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(getting angry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, at night I'm in charge. So get off my back, will you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(exasperated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you quit fighting all the time? She just fell asleep, for Chrissake.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Michael, go to hell! I'm sick and tired of your little 'Father Knows Best' number!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you're right, I'm fed up with it, too!
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(terribly upset)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, that's it. Into the kitchen.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He exits, furious. Peter and Jack follow after him. Fuming, they file one after the other down the corridor past the stunned Brunette in her T-shirt who was waiting
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
for Jack by the door to his room. The three guys close the kitchen door and start yelling at each other. They all talk at once.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've had it with you assholes! I won't be the buffer between you two anymore...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't ask you to get up, I know what I have to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mind getting up, that's not the point...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not a punching bag! You assholes!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I can't bring a girl back here anymore, just say so. And I'm gone. I'm outta here. With Mary.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can bring whoever you want as long as they speak softly like everyone else!
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One thing I know: I can't goddamn wait till Sylvia gets back!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you can say that again!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And again, and again, and again...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, the Brunette has put her clothes back on and gathered up her belongings. Now she enters the kitchen.

<JACK>

(running after her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Wait, please don't go... it's all over now, I'm coming back to bed...

<BRUNETTE>

	You're very nice, but I don't feel like it anymore now. Some other time, okay? 'Bye.

She kisses him goodbye and leaves.

Jack is very depressed.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT Peter, Michael and Jack have guests over for dinner. CLASSICAL MUSIC, a very fancy table, candles: they're at the tail-end of the dinner, before dessert. Everyone is very fashionably dressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie is sitting between Peter and Carl. Jay and Jerry, Peter's partners, are also there with their wives. Michael and Sophia are having a vehement discussion as usual, Jack is between two gorgeous models: CHRISTIE and CAROLINE.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you seen the latest bi-annual at the Whitney? Incredible! Have you seen it, Peter?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I haven't had the time lately.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah... working hard on the competition, are you? You may as well throw in the T-square, old friend, you haven't got a chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(somewhat harshly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I only wish he was working hard on the competition, but unfortunately, that's not the case...
	</DIALOGUE>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? What's he doing then? He's always so busy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe he's working hard on women! Some people have to work really hard to get anything!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie bursts out laughing. Peter's about to respond, but stops himself suddenly. In the b.g., a BABY can be
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
heard CRYING. Peter, Jack, and Michael exchange glances. Jack rushes out. The guests haven't heard anything.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering to Natalie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you always have to bring Carl along with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you like him?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, c'mon -- I love him! Only, I'd like to see you alone for once, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's extremely talented -- in fact, I hate to tell you this, but I think he and his group are gonna win the competition.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we'll see about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack returns to the table. Peter's eyes follow him nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(in a low tone, to Jack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you give her something to drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHRISTIE>
<DIRECTION>
(drunkenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, cut it out! No more for me! I've had eight glasses!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(in a low tone, to Michael)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tried, but she doesn't want anything --
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHRISTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do so want some, but if I have anymore I'll pass out!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Save room for dessert -- it's a three-tiered cake from Balducci's!
	</DIALOGUE>
<EVERYONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! Wow!
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHRISTIE>
<DIRECTION>
(greedily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love three-tiered cakes!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JAY_S_WIFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's it made of?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
In the b.g., the BABY starts CRYING again.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Umm, it's made with whipped cream and loads of nipples on top -- I mean, loads of... raspberries ... I'll be right back...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter rushes out of the room. Michael and Jack exchange glances. The CRYING CONTINUES.
</DIRECTION>
<SOPHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you saying that's not art? Are you really saying that's not art? Well, then, you explain what it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's... art. I'll be right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and goes out. Jack watches him.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack, tell me about those exotic places, what is Caracas like?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(his mind elsewhere)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, actually... uh, lately I've been to Washington a lot... and uh... I'll be right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and goes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PETER'S ROOM - NIGHT The three men are talking. Jack is holding Mary, whose eyes are swollen with tears.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try and put her back to bed...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm warning you, she'll scream...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure she's cutting a tooth...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
From the living room, Christie's voice can be heard.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTIE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yoo-hoo! What are you guys doing in there? It's fucking boring without you...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit -- the guests...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You two go... I'm staying with her. It can't be worse than listening to Carl.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not fair -- let's take Mary out there...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the hell with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT The three men enter the living room; Jack is carrying Mary.
</DIRECTION>
<GUESTS>

	Oh, it's a baby!
	</DIALOGUE>
<GUESTS>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where the hell did that come from? Wow! Is it a boy or a girl? Who does it belong to? So you've got a kid now? Incredible! Does that come from Balducci's? No kidding, whose baby is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen, I would like you to meet my daughter, Mary.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(muttering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your daughter... your daughter...
	</DIALOGUE>
<GUESTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're kidding! Congratulations! She's adorable! She looks just like you... Oh, what a cute little girl!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Overwhelmed by all the people, MARY bursts out CRYING.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(walking her back and forth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't cry, Mary, don't cry...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's too much noise.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He shuts the MUSIC OFF. MARY keeps on SCREAMING.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(to everyone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's teething, that's why she's cranky.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give her to me, I'll try and calm her down.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter takes MARY on his lap. The SCREAMING CONTINUES.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(very tense)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't sit down -- it'll get worse. You have to walk around.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter gets up and walks around. Jack and Michael, standing, watch him walk. MARY SCREAMS even LOUDER as Peter walks back and forth in the room with her. The guests watch in uncomfortable silence.
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long have you had this kid?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A few months...
	</DIALOGUE>
<NATALIE>
<DIRECTION>
(somewhat sharply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's her mother, anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's in Europe, she'll be back in a few days.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does she always cry like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's only because she's teething, she's usually very sweet...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guests remain silent.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLINE>
<DIRECTION>
(to break the silence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd never think something so small could make a noise so big.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
MARY'S CRYING fills the room.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if you just put her back to bed?
	</DIALOGUE>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right -- she's just throwing a temper tantrum, put her to bed...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We already tried...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's her teeth...
	</DIALOGUE>
<NATALIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jerry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have any kids?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JERRY_S_WIFE>

	</DIALOGUE>
<CHRISTIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jay)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And do you have kids, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHRISTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said... and do you have kids, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we both have careers.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guests remain silent, MARY CONTINUES to CRY.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, do you think we'll get to taste that three-tiered cake tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CARL>
<DIRECTION>
(to Natalie, sarcastically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, nothing, nothing -- I was just trying to liven up the conversation...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHRISTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gosh, my ears are ringing, I can't hear anybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CAROLINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must say, a crying kid is kind of hard to take...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CARL>
<DIRECTION>
(loudly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were just saying that this baby's conversation is actually rather limited... and a touch annoying. Don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, she's not the only one with a limited conversation. At least she has an excuse, she's a baby! What's yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I frankly don't know what you mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, I've been listening to your pompous drivel about the latest trends for the last two hours, and frankly, it's a crock of horseshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Peter, be nice...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, go put the baby to bed and you guys cool it, will you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. I'm used to it. Peter's always been a sore loser.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(totally out of control)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You motherfucker, get out of here! Get out of my house right now or I'll kick the shit out of you! You snobbish scum- sucking snake!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peter, cut it out!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it, Peter. Give her to me, I'll put her to bed...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(beside himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'll go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to all the guests)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you can all go fuck yourselves! Go back to your asinine conversations!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He exits with Mary. Jack, embarrassed, follows him.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to recover)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... umm... How 'bout if I get the cake now, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He exits.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. It seems our beloved hosts are going to be busy playing mother for a while, so if you'll excuse me, I'll just slip away...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Natalie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Natalie, may I invite you to spend the rest of the evening in a more hospitable place?

They exit.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he out of his mind or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JERRY>

	He was absolutely obnoxious.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHRISTIE>

	Hey, Caroline, I think we should go, too. I don't feel so good... I think I'm gonna barf...

Michael, very playful, comes back in carrying an enormous three-tiered cake.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>

<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, could you make a little room for me on the table so I can...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's because of the kid. They can't stand kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't stand kids either but that's not a reason to leave! Dipshits, they're all a bunch of dipshits, every one of 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, fuck it -- I'm sitting down.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He sits down on a chair with the cake on his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And did you hear Natalie: 'She's throwing a temper tantrum, just put her to bed.' What a pain-in- the-ass that broad is!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(pissed off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you're the pain-in-the-ass! First you dump a baby on us, then you scare everyone away from the party, then...

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I scared everyone aw... Just cut the crap, will you? My whole life is diapers, shuttles and bottles. I do the graveyard shift, I'm the one who never gets any sleep. I...

	Listen, we all have two full-time jobs! That's for sure!
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what about me? I'm a prisoner in this house all day long, forget about chasing ass, I haven't gotten laid in six months. When the hell is your friggin' Sylvia gonna come back?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's been gone for six months and four days.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>

	If she's not back by the end of next week, I'm kicking her kid out!

	Don't worry, she's gonna get it but good!

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you can tell her we have a lot better things to do with our lives than wipe a baby's ass, goddamn it!

He exits. So does Jack. Michael is buried under the three-tiered cake, unable to see around it.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT In her crib Mary is sleeping. She's beautiful, she looks happy.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY Mary is in her playpen, playing with a SQUEAKY rubber giraffe. The DOORBELL RINGS. Peter opens it: standing there before him is a very, very, young, gorgeous girl.

He stands there, frozen.

<SYLVIA>

	How's Mary doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(as if he were dreaming)

	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah, sure, she's in there...

<DIRECTION>
They both enter the living room. Mary stares at Sylvia. When she spots Mary, Sylvia suddenly breaks down in tears. Peter is dumbfounded.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe how much she's grown!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Recovering, wiping away her tears, she walks over to the playpen.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Mary, hello my darling...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She picks her up, hugs her tightly, showers kisses on her. MARY LAUGHS. Sylvia starts crying again.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How beautiful she is... Her hair has grown... Look how much she changed, I missed it all. I missed her so much!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter, in a kind of daze, stares at Sylvia. Without looking at Peter, she dries her eyes and tries to stop crying.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted to make life difficult for Jack but I never thought I'd miss her so much...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>

Peter sits down on the edge of Michael's bed and gently shakes him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't have a blender.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, you can have ours.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He stuffs the blender into the bag. Mary has now finished her bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Peter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want me to take her?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I have to burp her first.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
With dexterity, he places Mary face down on his shoulder and walks around in the kitchen, patting her on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(to Sylvia)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, could you give these to Michael so he can pack them with the clothes?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He hands two bibs to Sylvia. Sylvia walks through the apartment, and stops in front of Michael's room, where she looks strangely at the changing table with its mattress, its pretty sheet, and the baby's toilet articles. Sylvia enters the living room. Michael has spread all of Mary's clothes, neatly folded and ironed on the couch. He is packing them in a big bag.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here are the bibs. Jack told me to give them...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(taking the bibs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks... I put the woolen things on the bottom and the diapers and lighter things on top, because you'll need those first...
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
<DIRECTION>
(her mind is elsewhere)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, sure...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael bustles about. Sylvia's gaze comes to rest on the crib which stands imposingly in the middle of the living room. Music boxes, little booties and stuffed animals are hanging from the bars, and a pretty white tulle frames the crib.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll have to come back and get the crib later.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY A taxi is there. Behind the wheel the driver sits waiting. Sylvia is sitting in the back, on the side nearest the sidewalk, and on her lap is Mary, whom she's gently fondling. On the sidewalk, beside the open trunk of the cab, are all Mary's belongings: some bags, the playpen, a stroller, the baby bathtub, the changing table, etc. Peter is attempting to pack it all in the trunk. Michael is handing the things to him.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(tense)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me the playpen first...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(equally tense)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then where are you gonna put the tub?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just give me the playpen.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Need some help?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no thanks... I'd rather do it myself...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack is standing beside the back door of the cab, leaning over toward Sylvia, who is holding Mary. He is trying unsuccessfully to sound angry.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really screwed us over but good -- you know that...
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really. Our lives have been out of control for the past six months.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I bet... Actually, that was kind of the point... But I'm the one who really got screwed...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to cry again.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't cry, c'mon... you're taking her back now, it's great...
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
<DIRECTION>
(wiping her eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it's great...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	D'you have enough money? Can you manage all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, sure... I'm not loaded, but it's okay -- I'm working, I've got modeling jobs lined up...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have a boyfriend?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. That's the last thing I need. I've got my work. And now I've got her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She rubs noses with Mary. Peter and Michael approach.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it, we fit it all in...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, then... well, 'bye...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The three men are lined up on the sidewalk. Mary stares at them, looking a little lost. They wave their hands and:
</DIRECTION>
<PETER_MICHAEL_AND_JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Bye, Mary!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
MARY LAUGHS and waves.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
<DIRECTION>
(with a big, sad smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, well, thanks again -- 'Bye!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER_MICHAEL_AND_JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Bye!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The CAR STARTS up, pulls away, and disappears FROM VIEW.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(playfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's that!
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right... That's that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They head back to their apartment building.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit -- I forgot to explain about the cereal!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She'll figure it out by herself...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, she'll manage...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now it's back to the good life for us!
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sleeping late! Different women every night! I can't wait!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget about the New York-Washington shuttle! I'm off to Caracas!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm gonna be able to get back to work, so Carl better watch it -- I'm gonna slaughter that son-of-a-bitch! First with this goddam competition... and then with Natalie.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I've got six months' worth of sex to catch up on with Cathy, Nora, Frances, Susan, Barbra...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They have entered the elevator. The doors close. They come out of the elevator, in front of their apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Christie, Paula, Sheila, Lisa, Kimberly, Rhonda, Rebecca, Louisa... But not necessarily in that order!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They enter the apartment and Peter walks on something that lets out a TERRIBLE SQUEAK.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, she forgot her squeaky giraffe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He picks it up and throws it onto an armchair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LUXURY HOTEL - DAY Jack takes a running jump and does a cannonball into the pool of a luxury hotel somewhere in the world. He splashes two girls who find it very funny...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY Peter, with a bouquet of flowers, runs like mad down a street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ART GALLERY - DAY Michael and Sophia are having a big discussion about contemporary art in the midst of a sophisticated crowd at an opening. Michael is vehement, gesturing wildly, and so is Sophia. They're both talking at once, not listening to each other, and enjoying it immensely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE - DAY Peter, all out of breath, comes rushing into the office where Natalie works. She is very surprised. He puts the flowers down on her desk.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are for you... I'm not supposed to leave the office.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They think I'm in the bathroom. So I can't stay. 'Bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He dashes back out. Natalie cracks up, laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIRPORT - DAY Jack is running on the tarmac; he quickly mounts the stairs to his plane as he waves a heartrending goodbye to a young woman he's left behind in the airport. At the top step, he bumps into another young woman: it's
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
love at first sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - DAY Michael is in bed. It's noon, the sun's shining brightly, and a BLONDE is asleep beside him. Michael is on the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peter? Yeah? What? Yow-ee! Hooray! Terrific! That's fantastic! I'll call Jack -- We're gonna celebrate tonight!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up. The Blonde is now awake.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They won! They won!
	</DIALOGUE>
<BLONDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who won?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peter. He won the competition!
	</DIALOGUE>
<BLONDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great! Who's Peter?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - EVENING Peter enters the apartment with Natalie. A bunch of crepe paper streamers are hanging in the hall, as well as posters with various things written on them: PETER'S #1! CONGRATULATIONS, PETER! HURRAY, HURRAY, HURRAY! Jack comes running in with a bottle of champagne, he POPS the CORK. Jack hugs Peter tightly as Michael comes in with glasses and tries to catch the champagne that's flowing all over. They all shout and go bananas celebrating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT Peter has his arm around Natalie's waist. She's a little drunk. He kisses her and leads her into his room, clos- ing the door behind him. Michael and Jack, who were spying on them, tiptoe over to the door. They are silently exulting over Peter's second victory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY OF OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael enters a fancy building on 5th Avenue. He's carrying a big portfolio and is full of beans. In the lobby, he pushes the button for the elevator and looks around absentmindedly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His gaze suddenly freezes on something. By the guard's desk he notices a stroller. Inside, look- ing pretty bored, is MARY. Michael is overwhelmed. He walks toward Mary and through the sea of people -- they exchange an intense look. He looks around and suddenly sees Sylvia and two men deep in discussion coming out of an elevator. Michael, startled, runs and hides behind one of the elevators, staring out wide-eyed. Sylvia is dressed in a very chic, tight black suit, with a veiled little black hat and spiked heels. One of the men is carrying a bunch of cameras. They walk out toward the front door, and Sylvia suddenly stops. She seems to have forgotten something. She kisses them goodbye and heads toward the elevator. Once she's out of their sight, she turns and waits for them to leave. When they're gone for sure, she rushes toward Mary and showers her with kisses.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here you are, my angel... Are you okay, honey? Mommy's finished now, you've been a very, very good girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Guard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks a lot for looking after her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, she's been great!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She wheels the stroller over to the door and quickly takes off her high heels, and her hat, and stuffs them into a big bag. She takes out a pair of old shoes and a comfortable jacket, and slips them on. She removes the pins from her hair -- she looks like her normal self again. She leaves, pushing the stroller out the door. Michael stands frozen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL - NIGHT Jack, in the corridor of a large modern hotel somewhere
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in the world. He is full of energy and playful excite- ment. He's with a few of his colleagues, both men and women. They say good night to each other. Everyone goes into his or her own room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack's the last one, he goes into his room alone. His smile drops. For a moment he stands there just looking. He sits down on the bed: on the pillow is a little chocolate Santa Claus with a card that reads "Merry Christmas. The Marriott Hotels." Jack contemplates it forlornly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael and Sophia, both in kimonos, are sitting in front of the last bits of an elegant midnight supper, in Michael's room. The bed in unmade. Sophia, a glass of champagne in her hand, is yakking away nonstop, like a real motor-mouth. Michael, silent, is doodling on a paper napkin. His pen is making little squares and circles; the circles come together and start looking like a baby lying in a crib. Sophia is absorbed in her monologue. Suddenly Michael realizes what he has drawn. He crumples the napkin and throws it in the wastebasket. Sophia hasn't noticed anything. Michael is bored stiff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT Peter comes home with Natalie. They take off their coats. They look tired.
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>
<DIRECTION>
(in a bad mood)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my feet are killing me!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She takes off her shoes and collapses in the armchair in the hall. There is a LOUD SQUEAKING noise. She reaches underneath her and brings out a rubber giraffe.
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is this? Oh, it's a giraffe...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(tosses it away and walks off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Oh, by the way, have you heard anything about that kid, you know, the one you had here for a while?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter stares at the giraffe, horrified. He feels the tears coming to his eyes. Grabbing the giraffe, he hurls it with all his might against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PLANE - DAY Jack's in his plane, at the controls, waiting for takeoff. He's daydreaming. His CO-PILOT comes in and joins him.
</DIRECTION>
<CO_PILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, what's the matter with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>

<CO_PILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Jack! Didn't you see who we've got on board today?

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
<CO_PILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... look...

<JACK>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it's the Rockettes, so what?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CO_PILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you're just sitting there like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whaddaya mean, sitting there? I happen to be getting ready to fly this airplane.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CO_PILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, forget it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, alone in his room, with his back to us, is facing his full-length mirror. He's looking at himself, with one fist on his hip and the other hand clutching a half-empty bottle of scotch. He observes himself and slowly turns around -- we can now see him in profile. His hair is disheveled, he's unshaven, and he's put a pillow underneath his sweater. He's pregnant. He takes a big swig of scotch. The DOORBELL RINGS. Jack walks away from the mirror. He staggers dead drunk. But dignified, pregnant. Jack opens the door. Standing there is Graton holding a stuffed animal, a rabbit.
</DIRECTION>
<GRATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(out of it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi?

<GRATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you recognize me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(in a total fog)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait... uh, no...
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the one who was tailing you... Remember, in the park...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah, the park... the diaper and all...
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it, the diaper... But don't worry. This isn't an investigation, I left the force four months ago, and anyway, they've arrested the whole gang since then... I just wanted to ask you something...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you noticed? I'm pregnant.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRATON>
<DIRECTION>
(neutrally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah, I see...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, shall we go for a walk?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY Graton and Jack are sitting on a bench beside the East River. Jack, still pregnant, has brought along his bottle of scotch, and he takes a swig from it occasion- ally. Graton has brought along his rabbit.
</DIRECTION>
<GRATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's something I have to know...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wouldn't you like to be pregnant?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Oh sure... maybe... no... I dunno... Look, there's been something bothering me for a long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, if I was God, and I could create the world all over again, here's what I would do: I would create Adam from Eve's rib, not the other way around.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRATON>
<DIRECTION>
(having trouble following)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRATON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's an interesting idea... Actually, I just wanted to ask you...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least that way things would have been clearer to begin with, y'see. They wouldn't have made us believe that somebody could come out of our rib, y'know? 'Cause nothing ever comes out of our rib, y'know? Ever. Only out of our prick, and even then ... Everything still has to be done after that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRATON>
<DIRECTION>
(very unsure)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's for sure...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What we men know how to make is planes, buildings, cars, and all that stuff... It's useful, mind you...
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's driving me crazy! This thing keeps going around and around in my head...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you know what, it's not even like they wanted us to believe it -- it might have been us who wanted to believe it... But let's face it, nobody comes out of our rib...
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRATON>
<DIRECTION>
(dives right in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was the dope in the diaper, yes or no?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still, that's hard to take, goddam it!
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was it in the diaper, or not?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The dope? It was in the diaper, why?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRATON>
<DIRECTION>
(getting up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, thanks a lot. I feel so much better now. Here, this is a rabbit for your baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes both Jack's hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks again, 'bye, I'm so happy.
	</DIALOGUE>

Graton goes off, floating on cloud nine.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING Jack and Michael, slumped in their chairs, are having breakfast. It's a gray day. It's POURING out. Peter, bending over a bowl of steaming water, with a towel over his head, is inhaling the steam. When he looks up to speak, we see his swollen tear-streaked

INT. SYLVIA'S STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT Jack, holding a bouquet of flowers and Graton's rabbit, rings the doorbell of an apartment. On the door a card reads "SYLVIA AND MARY." A chubby YOUNG MAN with thick glasses opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. Is Sylvia in?
	</DIALOGUE>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, she'll be back in a couple of hours -- around midnight, she said...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(disappointed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wanna come in and wait for her?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure... Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He follows the Young Man in Sylvia's studio. It's very messy. On the table there's a big heap of books and papers. Mary, sitting on the floor, is wearing a diaper and a sweater, but her legs are bare. She's playing with an empty pack of cigarettes. She looks at Jack with a serious, unruffled expression.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sylvia doing okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know -- I'm a med student. I'm just babysitting. I only met her a couple hours ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I see...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. The Young Man sits down at the table and immerses himself in his books. Mary doesn't look up from her pack of cigarettes anymore.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, on second thought, I don't think I'll wait for her. Just give her this when she gets back, okay? And this is for the baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack hands the bouquet and the rabbit to the Young Man, who plops them down on a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, no problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He immerses himself again in his books. Jack heads toward the door, then turns around.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shouldn't the baby be in bed by now?
	</DIALOGUE>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... I don't know... When I put her to bed she cries so I just let her stay up...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you have any tights to put on her legs?
	</DIALOGUE>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tights?... Well, it's pretty hot in here anyway...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack gets out of there in a hurry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY Jack, in his pilot's uniform, is sitting on the living room couch. Michael is standing before him.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to call them?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you've got to let them know!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm not going anywhere anymore, I've had it with traveling. I quit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, I'll call you a cab, you've still got time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you call anybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the plane's s'posed to take off in half an hour -- They won't have time to replace you. This is serious -- you'll lose your job and you won't be able to pay your share of the apartment anymore... you...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack takes off his pilot's jacket and throws it aside.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be a dishwasher, I'll live in a flophouse.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going, I told you; I'm not going ever again. I'm sick and tired of traveling, sick and tired of broads. They all have the same asses and I can't seem to love them anyway. I can't take another hotel room, and swimming pools and trendy restaurants! I want to know what my life's all about. Do you know what your life's about, Michael?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael has no answer to these questions. He leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - EVENING Michael, wearing an apron and holding a wooden spoon, goes into Jack's room. The latter, lying on his bed, is smoking and staring at the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, I made us a good dinner. I bought some filet mignon and Haagen-Dazs butter pecan. When Peter comes back he'll cheer you up...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's been here all day.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has? I didn't hear him...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's in his room.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael heads towards Peter's room. Jack feebly gets up and follows him. Michael knocks on the door. No answer.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peter! Dinner's ready!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Still no answer. Michael opens the door: Peter's lying face-down on his bed. He's holding the rubber giraffe and sobbing. Michael and Jack, dismayed, stare at him. Peter hides his face in his arm. Jack and Michael go to the kitchen and sit down to their steaks, totally depressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - MORNING The DOORBELL RINGS. A bare-chested Michael, in jeans, drags himself over to the front door and opens it. There stands Sylvia with Mary in her stroller.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sylvia is a disheveled mess.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Jack here? 'Cause I'm a mess. I can't handle it, I'm all alone...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting towards Jack's room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack! Jack, c'mere for Chrissake!
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause my place is tiny, y'know, and my schedule's insane -- and I just finished four days of posing and we ended up every day at...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, bare-chested, comes in pulling on his jeans. He stops short at the front door. Sylvia is about to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, y'see, Jack, I just did four days of posing...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And every day we finished at three in the morning and since Mary always gets up around 5:30...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you can imagine how much sleep I've gotten...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, of course, 'cause after the 5:30 bottle it starts all over again around nine...
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And by the time I change her and play with her a little, it's already eight o'clock...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then that's it -- you get only an hour of sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the babysitters till three A.M. -- all my money is sucked down the tubes!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Plus they don't put the kids to bed, they let them lie around half-naked...
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, so the flowers and the rabbit were from you...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could have strangled that guy...
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean it, I can't cope anymore. My parents and I don't talk to each other and anyway they live in Texas, and the baby needs to get out to the park...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, tell me about it! Finding time to take her to the park every day is a real bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I have to work, I need the money to survive and anyway I love my job...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A distraught Peter, bare-chested and in jeans, comes running in from his room.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But to work I've gotta have a babysitter, and to have a babysitter I need to work, so I run around all day...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she sobs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and I'm not sure I'm taking good care of her...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course you're taking good care of her -- we know what it's like, don't cry, she looks great...
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
<DIRECTION>
(sobbing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just 'cause I haven't slept in four nights -- she must be teething or something, I don't know but I can't manage...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, it's nothing, she's cutting a tooth -- you just have to put some stuff on her gums...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She pulled the same thing on us. We lost all our friends in one night -- on account of one tooth!
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And just look at my face! Nobody's going to want me to model for them with the way my face looks... And what'll happen to me if they don't want me anymore?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you're beautiful -- At your age all you need is a good night's sleep and you'll look like new.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, a good night's sleep -- but when?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, why don't you leave the baby with us for a few days, till you recuperate... I mean, if you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're old pros -- it's not a big deal for us...
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
<DIRECTION>
(blowing her nose, wiping her eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? I can leave her with you for a little while?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. Leave her with us. Come back whenever you want. Get some rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sylvia, between two sobs, picks up a big bag beside her on the doorstep.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I brought a couple of things for her, just for a few days...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael eagerly takes the bag from her. It's followed by a second, and then a third.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(taking Mary in his arms)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she hungry?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it's time for her bottle -- it's all ready in the bag...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go heat up some water right away. Would you like a cup of coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, okay, thanks...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter, carrying Mary towards the kitchen, is followed by Jack and Michael with the bags. Sylvia blows her nose and walks around aimlessly in the hall. In the kitchen the three men bustle about with the bags, the bottle, the saucepan... They've swallowed all their pride and are kissing Mary all over, on her neck, her hands, her tummy. They're deliriously happy. Michael takes some sheets out of the bag.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go make up her bed!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He exits, and, once in the corridor, prances around, leaping and dancing... He gets to the living room and goes over to the crib: suddenly, he recoils and freezes, a fearful expression on his face. Then he turns and races back to the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(floored)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you guys -- come and see, come and see!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come see, I said.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Peter nervously follow Michael into the living room. They stop short in front of the crib: There is Sylvia, curled up in a fetal position, sucking her thumb and sleeping like an angel.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The poor thing, she's really wiped out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She'll need two or three months to recover, at least... Maybe more!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could set up a room for her here...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A room for her and a room for Mary...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we could have four shifts instead of three!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but I don't think she'll agree. She's got her own life to live.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, she probably wouldn't want to move here. She'd think we'd jump on her any chance we could...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we'd make a rule, she'd just be 'one of the guys!'
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She'll never want to...
	</DIALOGUE>
<SYLVIA>
<DIRECTION>
(very awake)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, I'll take the ten A.M. to three P.M. shift... And I'll take every other night... plus the walk in the park in the afternoon before I go to work... and we split the rent equally... and I'll just be 'one of the guys'... deal?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER_MICHAEL_AND_JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling broadly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Mary suddenly comes in from the kitchen, walking unstead- ily but determinedly. She's dragging Graton's rabbit by its ear. She looks at the four of them and laughs her head off. FREEZE FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END!
</DIRECTION>
