:SC: CYBERSPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We have a sense of cyberspace-travel as we hurtle through a sky that's just beginning to get light. There are a few stars but they fade and the sky turns a milky blue and a big computer sun starts to rise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We continue hurtling through space and see that we're heading over a computer version of the New York City skyline. We move over Central Park. It's fall and the leaves are glorious reds and yellows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We reach the West Side of Manhattan and move swiftly down Broadway with its stores and gyms and movies theatres and turn onto a street in the West 80s.

Hold in front of a New York brownstone.

<DIRECTION>
At the bottom of the screen a small rectangle appears and the words:

As the rectangle starts to fill with color, we see a percentage increase from 0% to 100%. When it hits 100% the image pops and we are in real life.

KATHLEEN KELLY is asleep. Kathleen, 30, is as pretty and fresh as a spring day. Her bedroom cozy, has a queen-sized bed and a desk with a computer on it. Bookshelves line every inch of wall space and overflow with books. Framed on the children's classic. Madeleine.
</DIRECTION>

As Kathleen wakes up, her boyfriend FRANK NAVASKY walks into the room. He wears blue jeans and a workshirt. He's carrying the New York Times.

Kathleen gets out of bed and goes to brush her teeth in the bathroom, and we stay with Frank.

As we see the logo for America On Line come up and Kathleen's code name: Shopgirl. She logs on and the computer makes all its little modem noises as the computer dials the access number and connects and we hear the machine:

Kathleen hits the "delete" key and the first three letters -- all of them junk-mail -- are deleted and drop offscreen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she selects the "Read Mail" key for "NY 152 Brinkley".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the letter comes up: To: Shopgirl From: NY152 Re: Brinkley

Kathleen starts to read the letter aloud:

<JOE>

A dog is sitting on a large green pillow on the floor. This is BRINKLEY. The pillow has "Brinkley" embroidered on it. Brinkley's master, JOE FOX, a great-looking guy, full of charm and irony, comes into the kitchen and pours himself some orange juice. He's half-dressed.

<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- but he chose to stay with me so that he could spend 18 hours a day sleeping on a large green pillow the size of an inner tube. Don't you love New York in the fall? It makes me want to buy school supplies. I would send you a bouquet of newly-sharpened pencils if I knew your name and address. On the other hand, this not knowing has its charms.

As Kathleen and Joe make their way down Broadway we see the West Side of Manhattan in the morning. Mothers and fathers taking their kids to school, people on their way to work, dogs being walked. School buses picking up kids, bakery trucks dropping off brown bags of bread in the doorframes of unopened restaurants.

Kathleen unlocks the shop and cranks the grate, which rises, making a horrible noise. Two cabs almost collide in front of the store, with a screech, and one cabdriver starts yelling obscenities at the other. Kathleen unlocks the door to the store.

:SC: INT. DRIP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drip is a cafe on Amsterdam Avenue with Fifties-style couches and chairs in cozy seating arrangements. Kathleen is standing at the front counter with Christina, getting drinks.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I went to the Foxbooks Website and you can buy anything. They ship it to you in a day. Maybe we should get a website.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINA>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother would never have wanted us to have a website. "Every book you sell is a gift from your heart." She always said that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
As they walk toward the back of the cafe, Kathleen notices a stack of loose-leaf binders on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if they put us out of business?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINA>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's out of the question. We're a fixture in the neighborhood. We're practically a landmark.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating the binders)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Men For Women, Women for Men, Women for Women -- what is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<CHRISTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fill out one of these forms and they file it in the book and if someone wants to meet you, they arrange it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINA>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a stupid way to meet someone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<CHRISTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Compared to the Internet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINA>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My little thing on the Internet is just a lark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<CHRISTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it's still going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINA>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I do not plan to meet him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating the book)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do I get the feeling that you are in here somewhere?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
Christina flips the book open to her application.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came in here one night and drank too much coffee and filled one out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Kathleen's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well how am I supposed to meet someone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINA>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are a runner. Some day you will make eye contact with another runner and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<CHRISTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one ever even looks at me. They don't. On top of which, who are they? They could like the symphony. I could never fall in love with someone who likes to go to the symphony --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINA>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. What are you supposed to do there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<CHRISTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINA>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit. You're supposed to sit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<CHRISTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could never fall in love with anyone who smokes cigars either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINA>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you what I hate. Big fat legs like stumps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<CHRISTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I hate that too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINA>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The worst, the worst -- I could never, under any circumstances, love anybody who had a sailboat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<CHRISTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither could I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINA>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I had to get up on Saturday morning knowing that I was about to go down to the pier and unravel all those ropes and put on all that sunblock --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<CHRISTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All that talk about the wind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINA>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then you have to go out on the boat, and you sail and sail and sail until you are bored witless, and then, only then, do they say, let's turn around and you realize the trip is only half over, only it's not, because the wind has changed --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<CHRISTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It hasn't changed. It's died.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINA>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So then there's more talk about the wind. While you just float up and down trying not to get nauseous. And when you finally get back, you have to clean up the boat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<CHRISTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't people have boat maids?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINA>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. There're all these people who wouldn't be caught dead polishing a doorknob in their house but put them on a boat and they want to rub down everything in sight.

Matt is sitting on the floor reading a book. Kathleen is showing Annabel a copy of a book called Betsy-Tacy.

<KATHLEEN>

	This is her best friend Tacy, whose real name is Anastasia, and then in the next book Betsy and Tacy become friends with Tib, whose real name, I am sorry to tell you, is Thelma.

<DIRECTION>
In another section of the store:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George is showing Joe a first edition of Swiss Family Robinson from the glass case.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The illustrations are hand-tipped, which is why --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It costs so much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's why it's worth so much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe smiles and turns to see Kathleen and Annabel at a whole shelf of Betsy-Tacy books.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want all of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNABEL>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That might be an awful lot for your dad to buy at one time.

Annabel nods solemnly.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm his brother.

</MATT>
<JOE>

	Annabel is my grandfather's daughter. And Matt is my father's son. We are an American family.

</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles at Kathleen, who finds herself smiling back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Annabel suddenly sneezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathleen takes a handkerchief from her sleeve. It's an old fashioned hankie that's embroidered. She offers it to Annabel, who instead wipes her nose with her hand and then looks at the handkerchief, a little puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNABEL>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A handkerchief. Oh my, do children not even know what handkerchiefs are? A handkerchief is a Kleenex you don't throw away. My mother embroidered it for me -- you see? My initials and a daisy, because daisies are my favorite flower.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<ANNABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Orchids are my favorite flower.

</ANNABEL>
<KATHLEEN>

Joe is looking at Kathleen.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?

<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll take these books.

</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He gets the one Matt is reading. And the two other Kathleen has gotten for Annabel.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are wonderful books. As Annabel gets older the characters in the books do, too.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You can grow up with Betsy.

	F-O-X.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Matt, look at this dinosaur book. Wouldn't you like a dinosaur book? Annabel, maybe you could read this to Matt while I wrap things up here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moves them to a corner, to them quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down, read, and don't listen to anything I say.

Returns to counter and gives Kathleen some cash.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the dinosaur book too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The world is not driven by discounts, believe me. I've been in business forever. I started helping my mother here after school when I was six years old. I used to watch her, and it wasn't that she was selling books, it was that she was helping people become whoever they were going to turn out to be. When you read a book as a child it becomes part of your identity in a way that no other reading in your life does.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stops herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I've gotten carried away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have, and you've made me feel...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>

He can't finish the sentence. He looks at her and sees, behind her on the shelf, a picture of a woman who is unmistakably Kathleen's mother, with a young Kathleen.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enchanting, your mother was enchanting.

</KATHLEEN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucky guess.

</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway. She left the store to me, and I'm going to leave it to my daughter.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just kidding, but seriously, it's all here: poverty, addiction, divorce, tracheotomies --

</DIRECTION>
<PATRICIA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This book is fabulous. And even if it weren't, it would sell like crazy, because Veronica is going to plug it to death on every talk show in America. This book...

</PATRICIA>
<DIRECTION>
Patricia bursts into tears.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICIA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I can't talk about it without crying. Veronica and I have so much in common -- well, not all the sad parts -- but we were both famous by the time we were 29 and, believe me, that's rough.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(wipes her nose with a Kleenex, pulling herself together)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, I just want to say that I'm especially thrilled to be publishing it. Veronica lives in my building and we met in the elevator. By the time we had traveled from the eighth floor to the first, we had a deal. First printing: one million copies.

	What if she has a really high, squeaky voice? I hate that. It reminds me of those mice in Cinderella.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What mice in Cinderella?

</KEVIN>
<JOE>

	Gus-gus and oh shit, I can't remember the other one. Why am I compelled to meet her? I'm just ruining a good thing.

<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're taking it to the next level. I always do that. I always take a relationship to the next level, and if it works okay I take it to the next level after that, until I can finally get to the level where it becomes absolutely necessary for me to leave.

Joe stops and looks at Kevin.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kevin, this woman is the most adorable creature I have ever come in contact with. If she turns out to be even as good-looking as a mailbox, I will be crazy not to turn my life upside down and marry her.

<KEVIN>

	There's a beautiful, whoa, a very beautiful girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But no book. Let me see, let me see... Wait a minute. There's a book with a flower, so it must be her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does he look like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a waiter blocking, I can't see her face. He's serving her a cup of tea and she's putting in three spoonfuls of sugar --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, why shouldn't she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No reason. Unless she has hypoglycemia. Oh, he's moving.

(clearly frustrated)

	<DIALOGUE>
	She's very pretty.

</KEVIN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is. I knew she would be. She had to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She looks... I would say she has a little of the coloring of that Kathleen Kelly person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kathleen Kelly of the bookstore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not? You said you thought she was attractive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what? Who cares about Kathleen Kelly?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you don't like Kathleen Kelly, I can tell you right now you ain't gonna like this girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it is Kathleen Kelly.

Joe elbows Kevin aside and looks.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>

</KEVIN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.

</JOE>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to let her just wait there?

</KEVIN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Yes I am. That's exactly what I'm going to do. Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But she wrote the letters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night, Kevin. I'll see you tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He walks away, leaving Kevin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kevin stares after him. Then he walks away in the other direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CAFE LALO - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathleen, sitting alone, at a table for two, is drinking her tea. She's starting to feel a little foolish. She checks her watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A loud, boisterous group comes in and sits at the table next to hers. They're laughing. A man from the group grabs the empty chair at Kathleen's table.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kathleen jumps up.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes. I'm expecting someone. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the chair back. Sits down again. She watches the group as they playfully fight over the menus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She checks her watch again. Then she opens her copy of Pride and Prejudice and looks at it. She can't focus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man comes into the restaurant and she looks up hopefully at him. But he's going to meet another group of people.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he passes her table, he knocks the book and the flower onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
She jumps up and rescues the book and flower as if they were precious china.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the window, now, behind her, Joe appears. He watches, as she rearranges the book and the flower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He disappears from sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks in the door.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kathleen Kelly. Hello. What a coincidence. Mind if I sit down?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I do. I'm expecting someone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
Joe picks up her book, looks at it.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pride and Prejudice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Kathleen grabs it back.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
She places it back on the table, puts the rose into it.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know you were a Jane Austen fan. Not that it's a surprise. I bet you read it every year. I bet you just love Mr. Darcy, and that your sentimental heart beats wildly at the thought that he and whatever her name is are really, honestly and truly going to end up together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you please leave?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
Joe sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get up as soon as your friend comes. Is he late?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The heroine of Pride and Prejudice is Elizabeth Bennet and she's one of the greatest, most complex characters ever written, not that you would know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a matter of fact I've read it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, good for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you'd discover a lot of things if you really knew me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I really knew you, I know what I would find -- instead of a brain, a cash register, instead of a heart, a bottom line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
Kathleen is shocked at herself.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just had a breakthrough, and I have to thank you for it. For the first time in my life, when confronted with a horrible, insensitive person I actually knew what I wanted to say and I said it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you have a gift for it. It was a splendid mixture of poetry and meanness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Meanness? Let me tell you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't misunderstand me, I'm just paying you a compliment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He lifts the book off the table. Kathleen grabs for it.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you doing this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
She manages to get the book, leaving Joe with the rose.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have we have? A red, no, crimson rose, tucked into the pages. Something you read about in a book, no doubt. One of those books with a lady in a nightgown on the cover about to throw herself off a cliff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
She holds her hand out for it.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give it to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
Joe puts it between his mouth and his nose like a mustache.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a joke to you, isn't it? Everything's a joke to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs the rose. Puts it back in the book.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please leave. I beg you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
He stands up, walks from the table, sits down at the very next table, with his back to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the restaurant opens. Kathleen looks at it hopefully. A pleasant looking man, who's immediately joined by a pleasant looking woman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, Kathleen looks just a little droopy, as if the wind has just gone out of her sails. She takes out her compact, looks into her mirror. She slides it over to look behind her, at him, just as he's looking sideways at her. He turns away suddenly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she blots her lipstick with her handkerchief.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what the handkerchief reminds me of? The first day I met you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first day you lied to me --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't lie to you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did too --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did not --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought all that Fox stuff was so charming. F-O-X.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never lied about it --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Joe. Just call me Joe." As if you were one of those stupid 22-year-old girls with no last name. "Hi, I'm Kimberley." "Hi, I'm Janice." What's wrong with them? Don't they know you're supposed to have last names? It's like they're a whole generation of cocktail waitresses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
She stops herself -- it's a tangent she never meant to go off on. But Joe has stood up and seated himself back at her table.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not a stupid 22-year-old girl --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not what I meant --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And when I said the thing about the Price Club and cans of olive oil, that wasn't what I meant either --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you poor sad multimillionaire. I feel so sorry for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and a large and very attractive TRANSVESTITE in a boa comes in the door.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am going to take a wild guess that this isn't him, either. Who is he, I wonder. Not, I gather, the world's greatest living expert on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, but someone else entirely. Will you be you be mean to him too? Will you start out sweet as sugar candy and then suddenly, miraculously, like a bolt from the blue, find that sharp little tongue of yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I won't. Because the man who's coming here tonight is completely unlike you. The man who is coming here is kind and funny -- he has the most wonderful sense of humor --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he's not here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If he's not here, he has a reason, because there is not a cruel or careless bone in his body. I can't expect you to know anything about a person like that. You've nothing but a suit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Joe gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is my cue. Good night.

Joe leaves.

Kathleen comes in, drops the book on the table, takes off her coat and goes immediately to the computer. She clicks on American Online. Waits impatiently to connect. Looks with anticipation at the mail box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COMPUTER SCREEN - NO MAIL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hold on Kathleen as a tear starts down her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes her handkerchief out of her sleeve and wipes her face and blows her nose. Then looks at her handkerchief and tosses it over her shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes over to the bed and turns it down and slips out of her shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she lies down on the bed, fully clothed. She reaches up to turn out the light.

	And as I waited, someone else showed up, a man who has made my professional life a misery, and an amazing thing happened -- I was able, for the first time in my life, to say the exact thing I wanted to say it. And of course, afterwards, I felt terrible. Just as you said I would.

	I was cruel, and I'm never cruel. And even though I can hardly believe what I said mattered to this man -- to him, I'm just a bug to be crushed -- but what if it did? No matter what he's done to me, there's no excuse for my behavior. Anyway, you are my dear friend, and I so wanted to talk to you. I hope you have a good reason for not being there last night, but if you don't, and if we never really connect again, I just want to tell you how much it has meant to me to know you were there.

</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they walk uptown, eating their hot dogs and drinking papaya drinks.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He could be the Zipper Man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This guy on Amsterdam who repairs zippers. You'll never have to buy new luggage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop teasing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Timing is everything. He waited until you were primed. Until you knew there was no other man you could ever love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
(almost believe it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes I wonder...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
They stop walking, they look at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I hadn't been Foxbooks and you hadn't been The Shop Around the Corner and we'd just met --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would have asked for your phone number and I wouldn't have been able to wait 24 hours before calling and asking, "How about coffee, drinks, dinner, a movie, for as long as we both shall live?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
(almost a swoon)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then we would never have been at war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only fight we'd ever have is what video to rent on Saturday night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who fights about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some people. Not us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We would never.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If only...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. I have to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me ask you something? How come you'll forgive him for standing you up and you won't forgive me for a little tiny thing like putting you out of business?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Kathleen looks at him. Shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh how I wish you would.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
It's all Kathleen can do not to forgive him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's all Joe can do not to kiss her.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really do have to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want to be late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
She's in agony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, she does too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we see Kathleen come down the street and walk into her house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she comes out of the apartment house, having changed her clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE - LATER AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she comes toward the entrance to the park.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE PARK - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Kathleen comes down a path in the park, near 88th Street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She comes to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A young woman in running clothes passes by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A young father pushing a baby in one of those strollers runners use to push babies in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathleen looks at her watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly she hears a noise. A dog barking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Brinkley comes around the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brinkley! Brinkley!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
And hold on Kathleen as she sees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And she starts to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And he comes to her. And puts his arms around her.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't cry, Shopgirl, don't cry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KATHLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted it to be you. I wanted it to be you so badly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
And as they kiss, we hold on them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And crane up and away as we see them, a couple kissing in the park on a beautiful spring day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dog is leaping around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And as we get further and further away from them, the screen turns into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CYBERSPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the dog turns cartwheels and flipflops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we tilt up to see the clouds and the sky
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and hear the sound of computer keys, clicking, clicking, clicking
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
