INT WELTON ACADAMY DINING HALL - DAY - VARIOUS SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREDITS ROLL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the left is a life-sized mural depicting a group of young school boys looking up adoringly at a woman who represents liberty. On the right is a mural showing young men gathered around an industrialist in a corporate boardroom. Between the murals stands a boy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An odd, blaring MUSICAL SOUND starts and stops, interrupted by the noise of pumping. A teacher hurries to the boy, adjusts his tie, and leads him off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On another wall is a full-sized portrait of a 19th century Scotsman in a kilt. In front at this, young boys carrying banners, and several elderly men in old-fashioned costumes assembling into a processional formation. Nervous younger boys (7th graders) are shown their places in line and handed candles. They light each others.' candles until all their candles are lit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the MUSIC BLASTS FORTH in its full splendor. It is a BAGPIPE. The bagpiper, in a kilt like the one in the portrait, begins a processional march.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR ADJACENT THE DINING ROOM - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bagpiper enters a long slate and stone hallway. The haunting timbre of his antiquated instrument reverberates through the building. Momentarily, he is followed by the other processional marchers. He leads them down the corridor and down a threshold staircase into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WELTON'S OLD, STONE CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where two hundred high school-aged boys--most of whom wear black blazers--sit on either side of the central aisle watching the procession move onto the dais in front. Beside most of these boys are their parents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS ANGLES ON THE PROCESSION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOUR 16-YEAR-OLD Boys CARRY BANNERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each boy is dressed in an archaic, turn-of-the-century outfit. On each banner is emblazoned a different word. One reads "TRADITION," another reads "HONOR",' a third reads DISCIPLINE, the last reads 'EXCELLENCE."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ELDERLY MEN in their 70s and SOS, obviously the school's oldest alumni, each wearing a name tag and the uniform of his day, make their way toward the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SEVENTH GRADERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
carrying candles are nervous and self-conscious. Most concentrate intently on keeping their candles lit while they march. One young boy's candle has gone cut and he can barely keep from crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bagpiper stands at the corner of the dais, marching in place. Behind him, in black robes, sit the school's 30-odd teachers. The processional's elderly alumni fill the chairs of honor on the dais.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The four young BANNER CARRIERS peel off from the main aisle and take seats beside their parents in the audience. The 7th graders take seats with their parents too. A purple and black robed man who brings up the rear of the procession walks up to the podium. Me is HEADMASTER GALE NOLAN, a big man, in his mid-60s. The music stops.
</DIRECTION>
<NOLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished alumni, and students: This year marks the one hundredth year that Welton Academy has been in existence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NOLAN>
<DIRECTION>
Applause begins. Soon the whole room is standing in a thunderous ovation. After an appropriate amount of time, Nolan motions for everyone to be seated.
</DIRECTION>
<NOLAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) One hundred years ago, in 1859, forty-one boys sat in this room and were asked the same question that now greets you at the start of each semester: Gentlemen, what are the four pillars?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All of the students stand at attention. Find TODD ANDERSON sitting between his parents. Todd is 16, good looking, but he seems beaten down, lacking confidence, unhappy. He wears a name tag and no Welton blazer. When the others stand, Todd's mother nudges him. Todd stands. He watches as the other students:

	In her first year, Welton Academy graduated five students. Last year we graduated fifty-one and over seventy-five percent of those went to the Ivy League!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NOLAN>
<DIRECTION>
Applause. During it we rind KNOX OVERSTREET and CHARLIE DALTON, both 16, and both in Welton blazers. Knox (sitting between his parents) carries a banner. He has curly hair, looks outgoing, is short but well built. Charlie, also with his parents, has a handsome yet friendly face. He carries no banner but, when Nolan mentions Ivy League, both these boys fit the bill.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
In the audience, not far from Todd is Richard CAMERON, one of the banner carriers, 16, his father's little clone. He stands eagerly to attention. Too eagerly.

	Thank you, Mr. Overstress. Honor Candidate Neil Perry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NOLAN>
<DIRECTION>
Knox sits. Knox's proud father and mother give him pats of encouragement. NEIL PERRY stands. Whereas some boys have two or three achievement pins an the lapels of their coats, Neil has a huge cluster of them on the pocket of his jacket. Neil is 16, intense, a born leader. However, there is more than a hint of anger and dissatisfaction in his eyes. Beside him sits his unsmiling father, MR. PERRY.

EXT. THE WELTON ACADEMY - MAIN LAWN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welton Academy is a cluster of traditional weathered stone buildings. The time is 1959 but at Welton this is irrelevant. This school with its traditions is completely isolated from the politics or trends of the outside world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The students stand with their parents under a giant tent. Finger food, coffee, tea and punch are laid cut on white clothed tables.

Charlie's mother stands dotingly fixing Charlie's hair. Then she kisses him.

Knox's father has his hand affectionately around his son.

<DIRECTION>
ACROSS THE LAWN a black-robed teacher stands with his back to us, staring at the beautiful Welton LAKE. As if he sensed he was being watched, he turns and faces us. This is JOHN KEATING, late 30s, sparkling eyes.

Nolan puts his arm on Mr. Perry's shoulder and leads him off.
</DIRECTION>
<NOLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come meet him. You'll like him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NOLAN>
<DIRECTION>
We watch Nolan escort Mr. Perry across the lawn and introduce him to Mr. Keating who walks up to greet them. Todd stands alone, looking around. Neil Perry, now left alone, does the same. Both watch the other students saying good-byes to their parents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE WELTON ACADEMY PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The 7th graders are saying good-bye to their parents. Chins quiver. Young eyes hold back tears. Some boys sob. For most of these young boys this is the first time in their lives that they will be away from their parents and their homes, and it is a devastating experience.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT, WELTON ACADEMY - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welton Academy sits in a lonely and isolated valley in woods of Vermont. Though the setting is beautiful, its isolation only highlights the loneliness that most of the 7th graders feel at this moment.

<DIRECTION>
INT. THE WELTON ACADEMY OAK PANELED HONOR ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The 50 or so members of the junior class sit in chairs or stand around the room. The students that were featured earlier are here: Todd Anderson, Neil Perry, Knox Overstress, Charlie Dalton, Richard Cameron. All except Todd wear Welton blazers. Todd sticks out and he knows it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A staircase against a wall leads to a 2nd-floor door. That door opens and down the stairs file five boys. An old teacher (DR. HAGER) comes to the door and calls out five names.
</DIRECTION>
<HAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Overstreet, Perry, Dalton, Anderson, Cameron.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAGER>

These boys file up the staircase. As they do, a seated boy (PITTS) leans to the boy next to him (STEVEN MEEKS). Meeks has sweet egghead looks and very short hair. He wears a pocket watch and chain.

And the little toy soldier is red with rust, And his musket moulds in his hands; Time was when the little toy dog was new, And the soldier was passing fair; And that was the time when our Little Boy Blue, Kissed them and put them there. 'Now don't you go till I come,' he said, 'And don't you make any noise!' So toddling off to his trundle bed He dreampt of pretty toys; And as he was dreaming, an angel song, Awakened our Little Boy Blue-- Oh the years are many, the years are long, But the little toy friends are true. Ay, faithful to Little Boy Blue they stand,

Mr. McAllister, the Scottish Latin teacher, exits his room and walks across the hall to Keating's classroom. He peeks in the door window and sees boys ripping pages out of their books. Alarmed, McAllister opens the door and enters Keating's room.

	<DIALOGUE>
	This is battle, boys. War! You are souls at a critical juncture. Either you will succumb to the will of hoi polloi and the fruit will die on the vine--or you will triumph as individuals. It may be a coincidence that part of my duties are to teach you about Romanticism, but let me assure you that I take the task quite seriously. You will learn what this school wants you to learn in my class, but if I do my job properly, you will also learn a great deal more. You will learn to savor language and words because they are the stepping stones to everything you might endeavor to do in life and do well. A moment ago I used the term 'hoi polloi.' Who knows what it means? Come on, Overstreet, you twirp.

	Well, I say drivel! One reads poetry because he is a member of the human race and the human race is filled with passion! Medicine, Law, Banking-these are necessary to sustain life-but poetry, romance, love, beauty! These are what we stay alive for. I read from Whitman. Oh me, Oh life of the questions of these recurring. OF the endless trains of the faithless of cities filled with the foolish... skipping... What good amid these O me, O life?

An instant sea of nods.
</DIRECTION>
<KEATING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Dead Poets Society was dedicating to sucking the marrow out of life. That phrase is by Thoreau and was invoked at every meeting. A small group of us would meet at a cave and there we would take turns reading Shelley, Thoreau, Whitman, our own verse-any number of poets-and, in the enchantment of the moment, let them work their magic on us.

	Try never to think about anything the same way twice. If you're sure about something, force yourself to think about it another way, even if you know it's wrong or silly. When you read, don't consider only what the author thinks, but take the time to consider what you think. You must strive to find your own voice, boys, and the longer you wait to begin, the less likely you are to find it at all. Thoreau said, "Most men lead lives of quiet desperation." I ask, why be resigned to that? Risk walking new ground. Now. A flame in your hearts could change the world, lads. Nurture it.

A soccer ball careens off a kicking foot. Beethoven's Ninth symphony, fourth movement, "Ode To Joy," blares forth. Keating stands on the sidelines beside his portable record player, watching the boys play soccer, waving his arms like an orchestra conductor. In front of Keating the boys play soccer to this spectacular music. They run, kick, pass, fall, block, head, dribble, take--all to the overpowering chorus of one of the most inspirational pieces of music ever written.

	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, stop. You way have noticed how at the beginning Mister Overstress and Pitts: seemed to have a different stride than the others, but soon they were all walking in the same cadence. Our encouragement made it even more marked. Now this experiment was not to single out Pitts or Overstress. What it demonstrates is how difficult it is for any of us to listen to our own voice or maintain our own beliefs in the presence of others. If any of you believe you would have marched differently, then ask yourself why you participated in the clapping. Lads, there is a great need in all of us to be accepted. However, that need can be like a nasty current, whisking us away unless we're strong and determined swimmers. Don't insist on the separate path simply to be different or contrary, but trust what is unique about yourselves even if it's odd or unpopular. As Mr. Robert Frost said, "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I... I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference."

INT. THE DANBURRY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Music by the Drifters is playing loudly. Every light in the room is out. The only illumination is moonlight through the windows. Only after our eyes get adjusted to the dark can we see that the room is filled with couples making out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knox, carrying another drink and looking tipsy, enters. He walks a bit, then trips over a couple on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGRY_GUY_S_VOICE>

</ANGRY_GUY_S_VOICE>
<KNOX>

	Sorry.

</KNOX>
<DIRECTION>
Knox falls onto the sofa. To his left sit a couple making out heavily. Their breathing is like that of some giant beast. To Knox' right is another couple, making out too. Knox tries to get up but the couple he tripped aver has now rolled against his shins, pinning him. Knox tries to get comfortable in his little spot on the sofa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music stops. The room sounds like an artificial respiration ward. The couple to Knox' right look and sound as if they are going to chew each other's lips off. Knox glances at the couple to his left. He hears:
</DIRECTION>
<BOY_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Chris, you're so beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The couple are Chris and Chet. Chris is sitting right next to Knox. Music starts again. It's "This Magic Moment" by the Drifters. Chris and Chet continue petting heavily. Knox tries to look away but can't keep his eyes off Chris.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chris, you are so gorgeous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<DIRECTION>
Chet kisses Chris hard and she leans against Knox. In the moonlight-filled room, Knox sees the outline of Chris' face, the nape of her neck, the curves of her breasts. He downs the rest of his drink and tries to look away.
</DIRECTION>
<KNOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God help me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNOX>
<DIRECTION>
Chris obliviously continues to lean against Knox. Knox is struggling with temptation--trying not to even look--but he's losing. Suddenly, he turns and looks at Chris again. Every rational thing inside of him says "no" but his emotions are saying yes.

Chet and Chris continue to kiss. As though his hand were being drawn by a magnet too powerful to resist, Knox' hand reaches out and begins to ever so lightly stroke the nape of Chris' neck down toward her breast. Chris obviously thinks that the hand is Chet's and she lets it continue. Knox moves his hand up and down her, sensuously. He closes his eyes, breathing heavily.

We can see Chet's silhouette pausing over Chris, trying to figure out what she is talking about. Giving up, he goes back to kissing her. Chris continues to show her pleasure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knox leans his head back on the sofa and his breathing becomes heavy. The music builds. Unable to resist, he rubs Chris' chest, getting dangerously close to her breast. Chris is breathing hard. Knox is slipping into ecstasy. His drink falls out of his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Chet's hand grabs Knox's hand and a lamp light flicks on. Knox is face to face with a furious Chet and a confused Chris.

	Gentlemen, today we will consider a skill which I consider indispensable for getting the most out of college analyzing books you haven't read. College will probably destroy your love for poetry. Hours of boring analysis, dissection and criticism will see to that. College will also expose you to all manner of literature--much of it transcendent works of magic which you must devour; some of it utter drek which you must avoid like the plague.

Begin your essay by disclaiming the need to restate the plot while at the same time regurgitating enough of it to convince the professor that you've read his book. Next shift to something pretentious and familiar. For instance, you might write, "What is remarkable to note are the similarities between the author's dire picture of parental love and modern Freudian theory. Christine is Electra, her father is a fallen Oedipus.' Finally, skip to the obscure and elaborate like this:

<KEATING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world. Seeing a student like you take root and bloom. It's worth everything. That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.

	Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall. When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison! I mean, I can see his point. We're not a rich family like Charlie's. But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!

</KEATING>
<NEIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what he'll say. He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it. He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIL>
<KEATING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him. You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do. If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.

</DIRECTION>
<KEATING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now we mustn't be glum. Neil wouldn't want it that way. He did something special tonight and worth celebrating. Let us join with the howling night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEATING>
<DIRECTION>
Keating exits the cave. The others follow. Chris and Ginny look at Knox and Charlie.

</CHRIS>
<KNOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just for a little while. You promised.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNOX>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie leads Ginny off. Chris reluctantly follows Knox. The moon is full, the stars are out, the night is clear and cold. Every tree is covered with icicles. A freeze has turned the otherwise barren forest into a wintertime marvel. Mother Nature has covered the world with sparkling diamonds. Keating leads the group up a wooded path to a spot on a cliff overlooking the creek. The boys and girls look around. It's an especially scenic place. All stand in silence for a moment, taking it in.
</DIRECTION>
<KEATING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting?

Todd's volunteering surprises everyone. Todd steps forward and takes out some papers from his pocket. He passes slips of paper to each of the others.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody read this between verses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
Todd opens his poem and reads.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"We are dreaming of tomorrow and tomorrow isn't coming, We are dreaming of a glory that we don't really want. We are dreaming of a new day when the new day's here already. We are running from the battle when it's one that must be fought."
	</DIALOGUE>

Todd nods. All read:

Todd closes his poem. There is a big applause.
</DIRECTION>
<MEEKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was great!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEEKS>
<DIRECTION>
Todd beams, taking it all in. As he steps down, he gets congratulatory slaps on the back. Keating smiles with great pride at his student's progress. He plucks a ball-shaped icicle from a tree.
</DIRECTION>
<KEATING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hold in my hand a crystal ball. In it I see great things for Todd Anderson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEATING>
<DIRECTION>
Todd faces Mr. Keating, then suddenly, powerfully, they hug. They break, then Keating strikes a match to light the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scene with Keating and the boys continues, interspersed with Neil's final scenes.

The group follows Keating through the woods, past icy trees, over snow-covered hills, reciting Vachel Lindsay's poem.
</DIRECTION>
<KEATING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Walking lepers followed rank on rank, Lurching bravos from the ditches dank, Drabs from the alleyways and drug fiends pale-- Minds still passion ridden, soul-powers frail:"

	"Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?"

Keating stands before a towering, frozen waterfall. This gorgeous, icy sculpture seems to defy the laws of gravity. The night sky is incredibly clear. The people in the group are lit by moonlight off the snow.
</DIRECTION>
<KEATING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Christ came gently with a robe and crown, For Booth the soldier, while the throng knelt down. He saw King Jesus. They were face to face, And he knelt a-weeping in that holy place."

Keating stops. He turns and looks at the fields, valley, and the magnificent sky that surrounds them. All are out of breath, but exhilarated.
</DIRECTION>
<KEATING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"We may or may not be the stuff of eternity, people, but, while we are here, we are part of a vast, awesome magnificence."

He holds his head back and shouts to the heavens.
</DIRECTION>
<KEATING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ALIVE!! ALIVE!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEATING>
<DIRECTION>
The others do the same. Shouts go up, cries of joy and ecstasy. Knox looks at Chris. Tears are streaming down both their faces. They turn to each other and kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Todd learns of Neil's death, he runs to the bathroom instead of outside into the snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After Charlie decks Cameron, there is a scene at the cemetery for Neil's burial. After everyone places flowers on the coffin, Mr. Perry walks up to Mr. Keating and says "I hold you responsible for this!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd refuses to sign the paper that implicates Mr. Keating in Neil's death.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all right! We don't need his signature. Let him suffer the consequences.

Nolan walks around his desk to Todd.
</DIRECTION>
<NOLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think you can save Mr. Keating? You saw it, boy, we have the signatures of all the others. But, if you don't sign, you're on disciplinary probation for the rest of the year. You'll do work duty every afternoon and every Saturday. And, if you set foot off campus, you'll be expelled.
