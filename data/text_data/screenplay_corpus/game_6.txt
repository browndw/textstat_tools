INT. LOFT APARTMENT - MANHATTAN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STEVEN SCHWIMMER, a drama critic, asleep on his bed. He wears a sleep mask.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bed is a mattress on a makeshift platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Papers strewn on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An exercise bike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A desk with and old manual typewriter, reference works, periodicals, Styrofoam cups.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cast-off sofa with pants, shirts, sweater, underwear and socks tossed haphazardly on the cushions and arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A counter that sets apart the kitchen area. A portable TV set on the counter. The remains of dinner for one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A row of stacked cardboard boxes with mail spilling out on the floor. Boxes are labeled in crayon: HATE MAIL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A coffee table with a candle nub in a saucer and six gleaming rounds of ammunition scattered next to a Llama Comanche .357 Magnum with a checkered walnut stock -- overall length, nine and a quarter inches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Port-O-San toilet, about seven feet high, orange, scarred and dented -- scavenged from a construction site.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A snapshot on the bedside table. It's a blurry picture of Steven holding a cat. Steven wears a peaked cap, and a shadow falls across his face. Next to the picture is a clock radio, which comes on with a buzz as the clock shows nine AM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RADIO ANNOUNCER begins to speak --
</DIRECTION>
<LONE_EAGLE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Traffic flowing smoothly on the Deegan right now but if you're lucky enough to have a ticket for tonight's game, be sure to leave early because it's going to be bumper to bumper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONE_EAGLE>
<DIRECTION>
Steven does not stir.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOFT BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven's loft is in an old squat building on 47th Street near Twelfth Avenue. The structure looks abandoned. Graffiti everywhere. Entranceway filled with debris.
</DIRECTION>
<LONE_EAGLE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another day of traffic. Traffic everywhere I look. Cars stop and move and stop again. People sit at the wheel thinking their thoughts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONE_EAGLE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNITED NATIONS PLAZA APTS - - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shimmering glass facade of the United Nations Plaza Apartments at 48th Street and First Avenue. A man visible at a window on one of the high floors, a cup of coffee in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<LONE_EAGLE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Day in, day out. Red light, green light. Traffic on the major arteries and traffic in the little veins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONE_EAGLE>
<DIRECTION>
From his POV we see the traffic below creeping along, nearly at a standstill.
</DIRECTION>
<LONE_EAGLE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cars, vans, taxis, trucks, limos, Mopeds, bikes and buses. Emergency vehicles screaming and wailing. Birth and death, walk and don't walk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONE_EAGLE>
<DIRECTION>
The man takes a sip of coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<LONE_EAGLE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)

EXT. 47TH STREET AND FIRST AVENUE - A LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same man -- the playwright Nicky Rogan with his hand in the air, hailing a cab. He is forty-five, vigorous, wearing well-made sporty clothes.

In a corner of the screen --

INT. TAXI

Stalled in traffic.

Nicky glances at the driver's name plate: KAGANOVICH ANATOLI.

<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to drive a taxi.

</NICKY>
<DRIVER>

</NICKY>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big mess every time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET CORNER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
47th Street and Third Avenue. A man is dancing with a life- size cloth doll. His tape player is on the sidewalk, playing and instrumental version of "Beautiful Dreamer" and there is a cigar box for donations. A few people look on from a distance. The man wearing an old cutaway, with running shoes, and the doll has long red tresses and wears a frilly gown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky emerges from a taxi at the corner and walks rapidly past the dancing man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky crosses the courtyard to Buchanan Apartments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FOYER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOANNA BOURNE reaching for the door. Joanna is fifty-ish, handsome, stylishly dressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUCHANAN APARTMENT - SECONDS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky and Joanna embracing with wordless abandon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are in the hallway clutching each other, stumbling. The walls on either side are hung with expensive art.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They grapple past the living room. Fleeting look at the paintings by Longo and Fischl, a poster by the Guerilla Girls. The edge of the bedroom. Nicky is crawling into the room and Joanna is hanging on to him, being dragged. They are fully dressed except for one of Joanna's shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bedroom. A Lichtenstein, a Hockney, a silk-screen of Joanna by Andy Warhol. A Jeff Koons piece. Nicky and Joanna roll on the floor until they are halfway under the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Muffled sounds from the bedroom. We track to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The maid's room. The maid is smoking a cigarette and reading New York magazine. The cover is partly obscured by her hand but we can see a blurry black-and-white photo of a man hurrying along a street with a newspaper over his face, shielding himself from the camera. Over the photo, three words visible: THE PHANTOM WHO -- A second line of type is too small to be legible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky and Joanna are undressing after the fact, very slowly and distractedly. Joanna stands by a chair near the window. Nicky is on the other side of the bed and he alternates between standing and sitting as he takes off his clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hear Alan's sick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know about Adele.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's dying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She died.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I talked to her two days ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our Peter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can he get through it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<NICKY>
<DIRECTION>
(hiding his concern)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Red Sox
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It can't be all that personal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Joanna enters the walk-in closet to finish undressing and get a nightdress.
</DIRECTION>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you have a team you've followed all your life, and they raise your hopes and crush them, and lift them and crush them, do you want me to tell you what it's like? It's like feeling your childhood die over and over. J
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean Nicky, really, no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky follows her into the closet, still in his shirt and boxer shorts.
</DIRECTION>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is how we've managed to last.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're able to surprise each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In and out of bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because we're completely mismatched.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't even like each other, do we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky walks out of the closet, takes off his shirt, gets into bed.
</DIRECTION>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<DIRECTION>
Joanna emerges from the closet in her nightdress and gets into bed.
</DIRECTION>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your best play, Nicky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNA>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll lose because they're my team.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<JOANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He will absolutely hate it.

INT. STEVEN SCHWIMMER'S LOFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven is just waking up. The radio plays soft music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches over and hits the off button, then activates the cassette player. He struggles out of bed and Sufi music begins to fill the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands at the foot of the bed, a man in his mid-twenties, hollow-chested, slightly potbellied, wearing rumpled pajama bottoms and a Mostly Mozart T-shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He does not remove the sleep mask.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music has a sensuous, driving beat. Voices begin to chant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven holds his arms parallel to the floor. Slowly he begins to turn, clockwise. The beat picks up and he whirls more quickly, his mouth coming open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now he begins to whirl about the room. The chanting grows in intensity. Although he is blindfolded, Steve deftly avoids running into furniture and other objects.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven stops whirling at the precise moment the music stops playing. He is back at the foot of the bed, arms stretched wide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TAXI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creeping along. Nicky leaning toward the driver.
</DIRECTION>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are going where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cleaned out the ashtrays religiously.

</NICKY>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am sitting here five years in traffic. It is one continuous traffic since I arrive. Why must it be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
A taxi pulls up alongside. Nicky notices the young woman in the rear seat. It is his daughter Laurel. He opens his window.
</DIRECTION>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Laurel, stay there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to his driver)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</NICKY>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky leaves his taxi and gets into Laurel's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND TAXI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky pushes in next to her. Laurel is eighteen, slightly overweight, with a pleasant and expressive face. She is carrying books in a nylon haversack.
</DIRECTION>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<LAUREL>

Nicky lifts a small radio and headset out of her bag.

</LAUREL>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you need a radio?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<LAUREL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAUREL>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's completely crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<LAUREL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAUREL>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?

Nicky stands alongside the first taxi and pays his original driver. Laurel reluctantly exits the second taxi.

<DIRECTION>
INT. COFFEE SHOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
47th Street between First and Second Avenue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky and Laurel enter the coffee shop they are greeted by the owner, a hefty Greek named GEORGE.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nicky, you don't come in for a while. Everything's okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello George. You're so healthy and thick-bodied I want to punch you in the chest. This is my daughter Laurel. Just to hear the sound it makes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw your picture in the paper. Two papers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That means they're getting ready to kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<GEORGE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	He doesn't want to hear it.

</LAUREL>
<DIRECTION>
He leads them toward a booth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky is launched into a full breakfast. Laurel has a tea bag in a cup -- no water.
</DIRECTION>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<LAUREL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAUREL>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<DIRECTION>
A young waiter recognizes Nicky and unobtrusively points him out to another waiter.
</DIRECTION>
<LAUREL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAUREL>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.

</NICKY>
<LAUREL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh please. Not now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAUREL>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<LAUREL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is kicking you out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAUREL>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<LAUREL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullshit, Daddy.
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. COFFEE SHOP - NEAR THE CASH REGISTER - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky and Laurel stand on a short line at the cash register, each holding a check.
</DIRECTION>
<LAUREL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAUREL>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<LAUREL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAUREL>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky takes Laurel's check away from her, intending to pay himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laurel snatches it back.
</DIRECTION>
<LAUREL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know what Mother said to me? Daddy's demons are so intense he doesn't even know he's lying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAUREL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bank towers. The Bank of India, Banco di Napoli, Bear Stearns, the Bank of New York, The Chemical Bank, Manufacturers Hanover. A sense of real institutions looming over the busy street. The bank names engraved on bronze markers, carved in granite, incised on glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Street level. A glimpse of the bronze statue called "Taxi on Park Avenue" -- a man with and attache case and raincoat, hailing a cab. The real people hailing cabs, well-dressed men and women striding along with briefcases -- purposeful, successful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TAXI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky rides again.
</DIRECTION>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's life, it's taxis. People trying to make contacts, make deals, meet their lovers. Taxis are sexy. You can't have Manhattan without taxis. I was proud of my taxi. I kept my taxi clean.

Nicky shifts his gaze. He sees Elliot Litvak slinking across the street, looking faintly unclean and shows a trace of a smile. He watches Elliot enter the lobby of the Chemical Bank.

Elliot is at a cash machine, making an elaborate transaction.

Nicky takes his cash and begins to move away.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't appreciate what they've built for us. We're artists who are too dumb to see that this is the peak moment of Western culture.

The driver flees eastward. Nicky and Elliot run across Madison Avenue. A snowstorm of asbestos is shooting out of a man hole cover west of Fifth Avenue, reducing visibility to near zero. Cars and people are white shadows.

A small narrow room. Handsome wall paintings -- a Tuscan hill town. Very slow day.

INT. RESTAURANT - LATER - SAME TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The food has arrived. Nicky is eating compulsively -- in contrast to Elliot, who sips his mineral water, dabs his mouth with a napkin, looks around the restaurant between bites. When Nicky is finished with his food, he begins picking among the items on Elliot's plate. Elliot uses his fork to deflect Nicky's fork and the two men have a brief duel with utensils, fencing silently but intently, using knives and spoons to vary action.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET

The asbestos mist still clings. Men in protective suits and masks move slowly, like moon walkers. Halted traffic, abandoned cars. Mud covering the sidewalks and shop windows. A gauzy stillness, dreamlike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STEVEN SCHWIMMER'S LOFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stillness. A slow whirling 360-degree shot. The kitchen area is empty. The door of the portable toilet is open and no one is inside. The makeshift wardrobe is empty except for four or five hangers with shirts and jackets. There is no one at the desk or exercise bike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sound, faint but persistent, like an intake of air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bathroom. The toilet bowl has been ripped out and taken away, leaving a hole in the floor. Brownish water drips from the tap into the wash basin, which is indelibly stained. The drip makes a two-part sound and it matches the rhythm of the intake of air. One-two. Pause. One-two. The bathtub has been sprayed by a graffiti artist. Multi-colored swirls and arabesques. Steven is sitting on a mat in the tub, arms in the air and folded so that his fists are close to his ears. He is in lotus position, breathing in serious meditation -- a deep intake of breath followed by a softer expulsion, matching the beat of the dripping faucet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is still wearing the sleep mask.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RESTAURANT - MAIN ROOM - LATER

The kitchen staff is eating at a group of tables pushed together. Nicky's table has been absorbed by this cluster and he sits reading the sports section in a tabloid and having an espresso with his cigar.

Paisley walks across the room toward the kitchen. Nicky pauses to watch her, then resumes speaking.

EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The street is deserted. Nicky holds the newspaper over his face for protection. Each man has an arm in the air, trying to hail a taxi. They are standing near a trash receptacle that carries an advertisement for "New York Magazine". It is a reproduction of the cover that we'd glimpsed earlier in Joanna's apartment when her maid was reading the magazine. A furtive man shielding his face with the newspaper -- and a headline about a Phantom. Nicky and Elliot do not see the receptacle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bus comes down the street with a large horizontal ad covering its right side. It is the same ad -- five of them actually, five "New York Magazine" covers side by side. Elliot is trying to hail a cab and doesn't notice the ad. As the bus bears down, Nicky steps out of the way, removing the newspaper from his face and getting a clear look at the five photos on the side of the bus -- a man concealing his face with a newspaper.

He walks to the rear of the store, where the office is located. The door is open, the room is empty.

	I can't take this anymore. He forgets simple lines. He forgets where to stand. We tell him and tell him and tell him. I know he's a sweet man. I love Peter. It's not his fault. But I've never worked in a show where the leading man has parasites in his brain.

He drags one of the boxes to the ratty armchair. He sits in the chair by the filthy window that looks west toward the early-setting sun.

He takes a letter from the box, opens it, reads it, lets it fall to the floor. Takes another letter, opens it --

</PAISLEY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.

	Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.

</PAISLEY>
<STEVEN>

TV SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley delivers to Wilson. Sound fades away. Action is in super slow motion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wilson swings and hits a bouncing ball toward first base. Stanley moves off the mound to cover first. Wilson drops his bat and races down the line. Bill Buckner, the first baseman, ranges to his left to field the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MANION'S OLD TIMER TAVERN - THE TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky watches as if in a trance. Complete silence around him. He is separate from everybody else, the only clearly defined figure in a group of shadowy and indistinct people.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TV SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky's viewpoint. An image of Bill Buckner in silvery light expanding out of the TV screen to fill the larger environment. Moving soundlessly in slow motion, Buckner fields the bouncing ball and heads toward the bag. He beats Wilson to the base by an eyelash and the inning ends with the teams tied at 5-5.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frozen moment: Buckner holding his glove hand aloft, the ball securely gripped. In the drama of the moment, Buckner seems to be crying out a word or name, but his face is twisted with tension and exertion and we can't make out what he is saying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BARRYMORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laurel Rogan, seen from behind, is somewhat slumped in her seat. She turns off the radio, removes the headset and rises. She moves along the row toward the aisle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She appears to be the only person in the theater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She moves trudgingly up the aisle toward the exit. At the head of the aisle she is startled by a figure standing in dimness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is Steven Schwimmer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other. Sound of the cleaning crew in the lobby and then a door opening at the rear of the orchestra. Light from a flashlight plays across the seats and walls. The beam hits Laurel first and then Steven.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beam holds on Steven. What Laurel sees is a strikingly handsome young man, dramatically lighted . He takes off his dark glasses, so she can see his eyes.

Cramped space. Nicky at the washbasin, disheveled but happy, washing his face.

INT. MANION'S OLD TIMER TAVERN - THE BAR AREA - A LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>

The crowd is slowly breaking up. A few people still clustered near the TV sets, which are showing replays.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky is standing alone near a small set at the back on the room. His clothing torn and stained. One shoe and pants leg dripping wet. A bruise on his forehead.

He is watching a replay.

TV SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wilson hits the ball. It bounces twice, then goes under Buckner's glove. Knight scores from the third with the winning run. A 6-5 victory for the Mets.

The main light in the tavern goes out. The TV sets keep replaying Buckner's error. Regular speed, slow motion, color, black and white.

INT. THE ENTRANCEWAY
</DIRECTION>

Nicky makes his way past the debris. The front door is gone, the inner door smashed and battered -- door knobs gone and locking mechanism ripped out.
</DIRECTION>

He starts up the stairs past a dead or sleeping body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LOFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the sofa, Laurel is straddling Steven, whose shirt is almost completely off, exposing his bulletproof vest. Laurel is blouseless and barefoot, with her unzipped skirt still on and her bra dangling from one shoulder.

Steven maneuvers himself into a sitting position so that he and Laurel face each other at equal height and at close quarters.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even if the truth requires a certain adjustment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
Steven begins removing the cosmetic putty around his naturally shallow chin. He uses Laurel's hair clip to scrape his jaw clean. Then he peels off his fake mustache. And borrows Laurel's dangling bra cup to wipe the bronzing agent off his face.

<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LANDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky stands with his back to Steven's door. His gun is out. He holds it up near his face, muzzle pointed up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at the gun as if it had feelings and personality, and he speaks to it as to a sympathetic friend.
</DIRECTION>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to go to the movies all the time. I saw a hundred situations like this. A man and a gun -- and a locked door. Lee Marvin or Steve McQueen. And I used to say to Lillian because we went to a hundred movies that we saw together or that I saw because she had seen them, and I'd say, `Watch him kick in the door with one kick,' And it might be Steve McQueen or Jeff Chandler, holding the gun up like this, and he would turn and kick the door and it would fly open at once, and I would say to Lillian, `How completely phony. Whoever made this movie has no idea how hard it is to kick in an actual door in real life.' I still love Lillian. But it's not easy to kick in a door. I knew they would lose and they lost, so what are we so upset about? They lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's written on the wind.

<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LOFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laurel is on her feet, backing away slightly. Steven removed his shoes and stands in his stocking feet, noticeably shorter than he'd been earlier.
</DIRECTION>

He begins to unstrap the bulletproof vest, causing Laurel to retreat further.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LANDING
</DIRECTION>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These wives named Lillian. I used to say to her, `You don't kick a door once or twice and expect it to open. It's only in the movies a man can kick in a door with such amazing ease. Because a real door requires a tremendous and prolonged pounding before it finally gives way.' He's a great player...how could that ball go through his legs?

</NICKY>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky turns, steps back and kicks the door. It opens at once.

INT. THE LOFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven and Laurel are briefly immobilized by shock as the door comes flying open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky moves toward the candle-lit couple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laurel realizes who he is and stands by the sofa. She zips her skirt.

Nicky is trying to understand what he sees, then he gets it.

<DIRECTION>
Nicky holds his gun hand aloft, repeating the image of Bill Buckner with the baseball in his glove -- Nicky's hallucination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Nicky issues a cry, a sound from the time before humans acquired language. It is the audible anguish of his life, from the fetus onward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear what he is saying in overlapping echoes and we realize he is crying out a name. We recognize the look on his face and the formation of syllables on his lips as elements we'd seen earlier -- on Buckner's face when he shouted something as he made N

Laurel reacts with horror to the revelation of Steven's identity. She rearranges her bra.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky stumbles, drops his gun. It goes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven flees toward the shadows at the back of the loft, his hand moving toward the gun in his shoulder holster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky picks up his gun and begins to stalk him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven fires twice striking a nearby lamp. The room is dark now. Lit only by the blue glow of the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TV sports roundup, which has been showing football highlights, has switched to baseball -- highlights of the Red Sox-Mets.

Nicky reaches Laurel.

Nicky starts into the darkness only to see Steven emerge from the shadows, his gun lowered. Oddly, he seems distracted by something on another part of the room. He is looking at the TV set on the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky watches him approach the kitchen area. He follows, gun raised.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven sits on a stool to watch TV.

Nicky approaches warily, his gun aimed at Steven's head, which is blue-lit by the TV screen.

	They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'

	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore.

Nicky lowers the gun.

Nicky takes Steven's head and moves it tenderly against his chest. When Nicky releases the head, he has Steven's toupee in his hand. He looks at it briefly, then hands it to Laurel.

EXT. 48TH STREET NEAR ELEVENTH AVENUE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A yellow taxi comes speeding past, moving eastward on 48th Street. We see it from various perspectives and elevations. It is a large checkered cab, the only thing moving in the night. Steam comes billowing from funnel vents. The taxi catches every light just before it turns red.

EXT. 48TH STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The taxi crosses Park Avenue, speeding past the bronze statue of a man hailing a cab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It approaches First Avenue, where a road divider bisects the thoroughfare. Nicky swings into a sharp turns, barely averting contact with the divider, and stops abruptly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three doors open. On the empty street, Nicky hands the driver a wad of bills. Then he and Laurel step over the divider. He puts his arm around her shoulders and they cross the avenue to the glass tower where they live.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun begins to climb out of the East River.

THE END
