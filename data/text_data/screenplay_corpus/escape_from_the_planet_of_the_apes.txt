Chaos and pandemonium inside. We multiply normal air turbulence a thousandfold and are bashed, buffeted, whirled, twirled, lifted a hundred miles and dropped fifty, before slowly flattening out to some semblance of equilibrium on (presumably) a new orbit.

	Let us hope and pray that you are right, General. But I think we should be alert to a remoter possibility: that the Russians retrieved one of our missing space- ships and remanned it with astronauts who have now accidentally splashed down in our own territorial waters. If they're alive, you may tell Colonel Winthrop at El Palomar to welcome them with caution. Whether they're alive or not, have NASA go over that ship with whatever's the scientific equivalent of a fine tooth comb. And until we know more, I want a full security clampdown on the entire operation.

Its rear section (behind bars) is furnished with austere but serviceable beds, chairs, tables and a washing sink with plates and cutlery in rack above. On the floor: a capacious rawhide valise, from which ZIRA (gloved and shod) has extracted a robe into which she is changing. Her discarded space suit lies at her feet. MILO and CORNELIUS have already changed. Their space suits are hanging neatly from wall hooks. At COLONEL'S entry, MILO and CORNELIUS rise courteously to their feet, while ZIRA struggles hastily into her robe. From the threshold:

We START on CLOSE SHOT of the deer with pneumonia, cradled under ultraviolet lamps which (as we PULL BACK) prove to be the huge, clinically furnished room's only light source -- for the sick animals must get their rest. We PAN past a recumbent camel and the mauled fox cub, into whose small sleeping body the rubber tube of a suspended flask is intravenously dripping plasma; and END on a white-coated KEEPER (with flashlamp) inspecting our APE TRIO, now installed in one of two large, contiguous cages at the dim room's center: straw for them to lie on; a bowl of water for drinking; and a generous supply of oranges and bananas, one of which he cautiously proffers to ZIRA through the bars, while playfully patting her head.

	Okay, I'll be careful. We'll start with the Wisconsin Multiphasic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<DIRECTION>
STEVIE opens the cage.
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go easy, Stevie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<STEVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They look pretty docile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVIE>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but don't take any chances.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<DIRECTION>
The Wisconsin Multiphasic is a screen which can be lowered and raised (like a window shade) between the Investigator on one side and the Subject on the other. ZIRA winks knowledgeably at CORNELIUS. MILO gestures her into more discreet behavior. KEEPER sets up apparatus during:

<DIRECTION>
(to Stevie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unless the spacecraft was remotely controlled, they must have been conditioned to press at least some of the right buttons. They can't be morons.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Keeper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The female first, Arthur. And set up Tic-Tac-Toe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<DIRECTION>
To everyone's surprise and KEEPER's relief, ZIRA promptly squats down on her side of the raised screen. The hyper-cautious MILO disapprovingly shakes his head. LEWIS raises screen and displays a single red cube for three seconds before lowering screen to mask ZIRA's view. When he raises it again, he is simultaneously displaying a blue pyramid, a green cone, a yellow sphere, a blue cube, a red octahedron and the red cube. ZIRA instantly selects the red cube, which she offers courteously back to LEWIS. LEWIS gives an astonished whistle. STEVIE, too, reacts in amazement.
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She seems to be pretty smart. All right -- let's make it difficult.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<DIRECTION>
He lowers the screen, and readies an assortment of five colored blocks, then raises the screen only for a second, then lowers it. He now adds additional blocks to make it an even dozen, and breaks up the pattern of five previously seen by ZIRA. Now, almost smugly, he raises the screen, but any superiority he may have felt is quickly erased as ZIRA swiftly selects the original five blocks. LEWIS is dumbfounded, STEVIE drops her notebook and the KEEPER stares in utter disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, LEWIS pulls the drawer out from the table, and we see that slots for all twelve blocks have been carved in the bottom. No slouch ZIRA. She deftly and swiftly fits all twelve blocks into their proper niches. Whereat she rises to her feet, clasps hands over her head like a boxer acknowledging victory. CORNELIUS responds with mirth, but MILO shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LEWIS has risen at this interplay between the apes and now questions the KEEPER quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They haven't eaten this morning?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a bite....just as you ordered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. We'll go for the banana...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<DIRECTION>
Scattered about the cage are a number of oddly constructed wooden boxes, all gaily painted. STEVIE now adds several more, as ARTHUR tugs on a rope pulley to lower a banana from the top of the cage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a test unfamiliar to ZIRA, who responds to its challenge. She speculatively eyes the banana; then stoops to prowl among the boxes, which she carefully examines without touching them. Then she straightens... and thinks. The tension is insupportable. Suddenly ZIRA, moving into action, interlocks all the boxes so that they form a somewhat eccentric staircase leading to the banana. Having done so, she ascends the "stairs," sits on the top, and stares smugly at the banana, now only inches from her nose.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why doesn't she take it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVIE>
<ZIRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I loathe and detest bananas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZIRA>
<CORNELIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zira!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORNELIUS>
<DIRECTION>
As though in a slow nightmare, STEVIE sags and faints. Somehow, LEWIS catches her and lowers her to the cage floor. Somehow, KEEPER sluices water from the drinking bowl over her upturned race. As she recovers:
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIS>
<DIRECTION>
(sweating)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me get her away. I'll come back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<DIRECTION>
Jointly supporting STEVIE, they leave the cage, which KEEPER locks. We STAY with:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
APE TRIO
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zira, are you mad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CORNELIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORNELIUS>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(evenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did not call her mad. I merely asked her if she was. And I repeat the question.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Zira)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you mad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<ZIRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate deceit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZIRA>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is a time for truth and a time, not for lies, but for silence. Until we know who i8 our friend and who our enemy--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<ZIRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And how in the name of God are we to know that, unless we communicate? We can speak. So I spoke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZIRA>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can also listen
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CORNELIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To a lot of psychiatric small talk --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORNELIUS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And we can watch ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CORNELIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A display of primitive apparatus --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORNELIUS>
<ZIRA>
<DIRECTION>
(kicking the apparatus)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Primitive? Its prehistoric. It couldn't test the intelligence of a newt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZIRA>
<DIRECTION>
She kicks the apparatus again, and it collapses. The GORILLA in the next cage gives a disturbed grunt.
</DIRECTION>
<CORNELIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zira, calm yourself --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORNELIUS>
<ZIRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am calm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZIRA>
<DIRECTION>
She knocks another piece of apparatus endways. Now even MILO's self-control snaps. He stalks to the side bars and (with eyes screwed shut in frustration) briefly but fiercely shakes them before spinning round, with back pressed against the bars, to glare at his two tormentors. We SHOOT AT AND PAST HIM into the next cage where the GORILLA now shambles to its feet and slowly advances from b.g., during:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop arguing. It's too late for that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
His body masking the GORILLA's crouched and stealthy approach from them -- but not from us.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Use your heads and start thinking. Now that they know we can speak, how much shall we tell them? ow--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<ZIRA>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Milo-o-o!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZIRA>
<DIRECTION>
Through the bars two hairy hands converge on MILO's throat and strangle him to death. The roaring of the GORILLA, the throttled cries of MILO and ZIRA's screams combine to launch:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS ZOO SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of alarmed birds and beasts as panic briefly infects the Zoo. E.g., a sleeping owl opens huge eyes; cranes cry; mallards take off from pool; seals cough; apes gibber; tigers snarl; lions roar, and elephants trumpet. We might (instead of separating each cry) overlay sound cumulatively so that each new noise is added to its predecessors, as we build visually and aurally to a massive and bestial crescendo before:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "panic" is over. Outside, STEVIE (shaken but recovered) confers with LEWIS. As KEEPERS 1 and 2 lift a blanketed stretcher and carry MILO's body out of shot:
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We shall want a full autopsy ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<STEVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVIE>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep him in cold storage till the reports in. Then send him to Taxidermy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(wryly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a museum piece.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<DIRECTION>
A low moan turns their heads toward the cage's interior. ZIRA sits crouched in a corner, her head in her hands and rocking from side to side. CORNELIUS is comforting her.
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIS>
<DIRECTION>
(to Stevie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd better do this alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<DIRECTION>
She nods and stays outside the cage, which LEWIS enters. He looks compassionately at the two huddled APES, the straw, the orange peel, the bananas, the abandoned Intelligence Test apparatus.
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIS>
<DIRECTION>
(gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We mean you no harm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<DIRECTION>
Silence and stillness.
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you understand? We mean you no harm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly and bitterly, ZIRA points an ironic and accusing finger at the next cage, where an anesthetized and chained GORILLA slumps in the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he isn't us. He's your own kind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<ZIRA>
<DIRECTION>
(angrily on her feet in a flash)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a gorilla.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZIRA>
<DIRECTION>
As CORNELIUS soothes her:
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean he's of your race. He's an Ape. Look. You don't have to be afraid. We've put him in chains and under sedation. Do you understand that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<ZIRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should. I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZIRA>
<LEWIS>
<DIRECTION>
(dumbfounded)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Humans?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<ZIRA>
<DIRECTION>
(as though this explained everything)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a psychiatrist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZIRA>
<DIRECTION>
A second shock. LEWIS covers dazed eyes with his hand and, after a struggle, regains his self-control.
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So am I. And I mean you no harm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<CORNELIUS>
<DIRECTION>
(at last)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORNELIUS>
<DIRECTION>
LEWIS, over one hurdle, exhales.
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have a name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<CORNELIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Cornelius. And this is Zira -- my wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORNELIUS>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Lewis -- Lewis Dixon .
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<DIRECTION>
He diffidently extends a hand, CORNELIUS takes it. ZIRA doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody's going to believe it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<CORNELIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believe what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORNELIUS>
<LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That primitive apes can talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<ZIRA>
<DIRECTION>
(furious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Primitive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZIRA>
<LEWIS>
<DIRECTION>
(quick smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<DIRECTION>
ZIRA gives him a long, searching look ... and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ZIRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I say something personal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZIRA>
<LEWIS>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEWIS>
<ZIRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZIRA>
<DIRECTION>
LEWIS look gratefully from her to:
</DIRECTION>
<CORNELIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did from the beginning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORNELIUS>
<DIRECTION>
BE CONTINUED...
