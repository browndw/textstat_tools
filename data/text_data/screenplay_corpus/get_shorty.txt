INT. VESUVIO'S RESTAURANT -- SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHILI PALMER, late thirties, sits in a booth with TOMMY CARLO, a low level mob type. Chili smokes a cigarette, stares out the window at the people on the street.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guy on the radio said it's gonna get down to thirty-four.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Chili watches a woman on the sidewalk pause to tighten the scarf around her neck . . . She looks in the window, sees Chili looking out.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirty-four -- that's freezing, for Christ sake.

<DIRECTION>

Chili turns and studies Tommy a moment, then . . .

<CHILI>

Tommy looks at him.

<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Chili looks back out the window again.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
We hear LAUGHTER O. S. and then FOCUS on the window so that Chili can now see a GROUP OF MEN reflected there, sitting at a table nearby. We hear MORE LAUGHTER and now Chili turns and looks over at . . .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAY "BONES" BARBONI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mob guy tall, loud suit with lots of jewelry. As he gets up from the table, the other men around the table follow his lead as he finishes up some jokes . . .
</DIRECTION>
<MOB_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . so the guy says, I'm not the tailor, I'm the undertaker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOB_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
The men laugh again, more out of respect than appreciation. Ray Bones turns, sees . . .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHILI and Tommy sitting in their booth. Tommy, sucking on a toothpick, waves.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray. How you doing?

</RAY_BONES>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Bones focuses on Chili, waits for acknowledgement. But Chili turns back to the window. Always the peacemaker, Tommy smiles at Bones again . . .
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You believe this weather, Ray? Miami Beach, for Christ's sake.

	Chilly outside. Chili inside. It's a regular fuckin' chili-fest. Hey, waiter -- give Mr. Chili Pepper a big fuckin' bowl of chili!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY_BONES>
<DIRECTION>
Again the men all laugh respectfully at Ray Bone's stupid joke. Chili smiles the best he can at the idiot . . .
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good to see you, Ray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back to the window, watches Ray Bones in the reflection, still cracking up as he and his men head for the front of the restaurant. Tommy looks at Chili for a moment, then stands up . . .
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You done starin' out the window, I'll see you back at the office.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Chili nods, but still doesn't turn from the window. He merely watches in the glass as Tommy turns up his collar and steps out into the cold Miami day.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus. It's freezin'!

</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Chili then puts out the cigarette, nods to the waiter who comes over with the check.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RESTAURANT COATROOM -- A FEW MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From inside the tiny room. A couple of ratty rain coats and an old flight jacket hang to one side in immediate f.g. as Chili steps into the doorway and freezes. He looks o.s. and whistles . . .
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.

A moment later the MANAGER, an old Italian guy in a black suit, joins him in the doorway.

<CHILI>

</CHILI>
<MANAGER>

	Maybe you don't see my sign?

The manager points to a sign on the wall 'WE CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST ARTICLES.'

	Look, I didn't come down to sunny Florida to freeze my ass. You follow me? You get the coat back or you give me the three seventy-nine my ex-wife paid for it at Alexander's.
	</DIALOGUE>

The Manager looks o.s., and begins speaking in Italian. Chili reacts as we hear the name RAY BARBONI mentioned a couple of times.
</DIRECTION>
<MANAGER>

</MANAGER>
<CHILI>

Tommy looks up at the hotel as Chili takes a pair of leather gloves from top of the dash, opens the door. Tommy looks over at him.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Chili.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Chili pauses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>

	Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.

Chili pulls on the gloves as he goes up the stairs to the third floor.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOOR -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Chili knocks on the door three times. He waits, pulls the right-hand glove on tight, so that when RAY BONES opens the door, Chili nails him. One punch. No need to throw the left.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY_BONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus . . . Oh, God . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY_BONES>
<DIRECTION>
Chili then steps over him into the room and grabs his coat from a chair. He looks over at Ray Bones bent over, blood running from his nose and mouth, blood all over his hands, his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY_BONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck, man . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY_BONES>
<DIRECTION>
Chili walks out. Doesn't say one word to Ray Bones.

EXT. BARBER SHOP -- DAY

A warmer day. The sun is shining. All is quiet.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BARBER SHOP BACKROOM -- SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A room Tommy and Chili use as an office. Chili sits at the desk making entries in the collection book. We can hear the two old barbers talling o.s. . .

	What're you talking about, Paris, Kentucky, or Paris, Tennessee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED_O_S>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. No answer to the question. Chili look up from the collection book, listens a moment to nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the desk drawer and pulls out a .38. He aims the gun at the open doorway . . .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER CHILI'S SHOULDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Ray Bones, a bandage on his nose, appears in the back hall, then the doorway to the office, his face showing surprise to see a gun aimed at him . . .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray Bones begins firing the big Colt auto in his hand, maybe before he's ready, the gun making an awful racket, when Chili pulls the trigger, shooting Ray Bones along the top of his head, creasing him from hairline to crown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chili calmly gets to his feet. Aims once more -- probably lower this time -- but doesn't fire as Ray Bones grabs his head and stumbles out of there.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>

	Whatta you want me to do Ray? Go to war over a fuckin coat? You're lucky the guy didn't kill you. The coat was a Christmas present for Christ's sake.

Two big guys, BODYGUARDS, get out of the car. One of them opens the back door for a huge man, MOMO, who gets out of the car and looks up at the dark building . . .

Momo eyes the bodyguards -- both nervous -- then starts up the steps. We follow Momo as he enters the building, goes up the dark stairwell . . . up one flight . . . we're behind him the whole time . . .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he gets to the top floor, Momo pauses to catch his breath, before moving on down the hall to a door. Momo knocks.

Momo slowly opens the door . . . when, suddenly, the apartment is FLOODED WITH LIGHT so that we see a room full of PEOPLE, a banner on the back wall reading 'HAPPY SIXTY-FIFTH, MOMO!'

<EVERYONE>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
A sign on the door reads "DICK ALLEN, CUSTOMER RELATIONS." A bank of video monitors show the floor of the casino. Chili sits across the desk from DICK ALLEN -- lots of jewelry, a giant NEON COWGIRL out the window behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Called himself Larry DeMille. Hit on every showgirl in town. Would tell 'em he was the 'Martinizing King of Miami'. What a moron.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
He returns the snapshot to Chili.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leo spanked a waitress?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>

Chili nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.

EXT. LAX RENTAL CAR LOT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's raining as we TILT DOWN from a LANDING AIRPLANE to a National Car Rental BUS arriving next to a tan MINIVAN. Chili eyes the car a moment, then turns to the driver.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this?

	Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATTENDANT>
<DIRECTION>
Chili gives the driver a look then gets out of the bus, standing there in the rain, his seat getting wet, nowhere to go. He turns and stares at the minivan . . .

<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry, God damn it, somebody's downstairs.

</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
The shape stirs, rolls over, and we see HARRY ZIMM, balding, overweight; a movie producer. He sits up.

She looks at him . . .

<DIRECTION>

	Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have a dog.

</KAREN>
<HARRY>

</HARRY>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?

</KAREN>

He grunts, gets out of bed. Starts looking around the room for his clothes. Harry looks out the window . . .

INT. HALLWAY -- SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MONOTONE VOICES become louder and more distinct as Harry moves down the curved staircase in his shirt and boxer shorts. One of the voices is familiar . . .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can see this is a nice place as Harry crosses the entry hall to a doorway, the FLICKERING LIGHT of the television emitting from inside the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry listens at the door. Yeah, it's David Letterman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KAREN'S STUDY -- SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry moves into the glow of the big Sony, the rest of the room dark. On the tube, Dave is interviewing actor Martin Weir when suddenly the screen goes black and the desk lamp comes on. Harry jumps . . .
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ!

Harry presses a hand against his chest.

<CHILI>

Harry lets his hand slide down over his belly, taking his time, wanting to show that he has it together now.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have we met? I don't recall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Harry stares back, trying to figure out who this guy is.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're in pictures, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Chili smiles. Doesn't say anything.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Harry takes one of the canvas director's chairs by the desk. He looks at a bottle of Dewars sitting there, runs a hand through his hair, thinks about a drink . . .
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry, look at me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Harry brings his hand down.

</HARRY>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to keep looking right here, okay?

</CHILI>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I'm doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Harry looks at Chili.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ, what're you, a collector for a fucking casino? You come in here, walk in the house in the middle of the fucking night? I thought you were an actor, auditioning, for Christ's sake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Chili nods, almost smiles . . .
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that right? That's interesting. You thought I was acting, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Harry pushes out of the chair, looks down at Chili.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll see about this . . .

</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry grabs the phone, punches the 'O'.

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry, lemme give you some advice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Chili leans forward, hangs up the phone with his index finger, casually reaches for the rereiver . . .
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want to act like a hard-on, you're standing there in your undies. You know what I'm saying? What you want to do is sit down and talk to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Harry sits down. Chili hangs up the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A marker's like a check, Harry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what a marker is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Harry's gaze moves to the bottle of scotch on the desk . . .
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not looking at me, Harry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do I have to keep looking at you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Harry -- Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuckin' basketball game.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry reaches for the bottle of scotch and pours himself drink.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell Dick Allen I'll cover the markers in the next sixty days at the most. He doesn't like it, that's his problem. The prick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry starts to take another drink, looks at Chili, not moving.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you want me to call you a cab?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Chili shakes his head, keeps staring at Harry, but with a different expression now, more thoughtful, curious.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You make movies, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Chili nods, leans forward on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I got an idea for a movie.

Chili sits with Harry at a butcher block table, a bottle of Dewars and a couple of glasses now between them.

	Yeah, Leo wore these little plaid hats -- Miami, middle of the summer, this guy thinks no one's gonna notice he's balding, he wears a fuckin' hat.

Harry looks up past Chili, smiles.

</CHILI>
<KAREN>

	What if it was?

</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
Chili doesn't say anything, just watches her, likes the way she's handling it.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.

</HARRY>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just did.

</CHILI>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Chili looks at Karen. She leans in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what a vig is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.

	You tell 'em the movie's been postponed. Say, till next year, if you want. But don't tell 'em why or what you're doing. Understand, Harry? You don't tell 'em anything about Mr. Lovejoy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
And the door opens. Chili sits behind the desk, watching the two of them come into the office. Ronnie singing . . .
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They may find . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks about the office . . . at the old photographs . . .
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry, what year is it, man? We enter a time warp? I feel like I'm back in Hollywood of yesteryear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Harry waves them right into the two cracked red leather chairs facing the desk. Chili watches as Catlett comes first. Sitting down, he nods to Chili who ignores him.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a seat . . . right over here . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie sits down in the chair and hooks one leg over the arm, swings it up and down, his motor running on some chemical. He too stares at Chili.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is my associate, Chili Palmer, who'll be working with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry already forgetting his instructions. Chili can't believe it. The limo guys nod to Chili and Chili nods back, trying to catch Harry's eye.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to make sure there's no misunderstanding here. Despite rumors you might have heard, your investment in Freaks is as sound as the day you signed your participation agreement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie has his face raised to the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<BO_CATLETT>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at Chili)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I been wondering is where's he been.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Harry comes around to stand at one side of the desk, his back to the window . . .
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been off scouting locations. Interviewing actors in New York.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Chili's gaze moves from Ronnie the fool to Bo Catlett the dude, the man composed, elbows on the chair arms, his hands steepled in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The main thing I want to tell you, the start date for Freaks is being pushed back a little, a few months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie stops bouncing his leg.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A few months?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe longer. We need prep time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Harry? Bullshit. We have an agreement with you, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're gonna make the picture. I've just got another project to do first, that's all. One I promised this guy years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Chili shakes his head, he can't believe he's hearing this. Ronnie sits up straight.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to see your books, Harry. Show me where it is, a two with five zeroes after it in black and white, man. I want to see your books and your bank statements.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Ronnie? Look at me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Boom. Ronnie looks over. So does Bo Catlett for that matter.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a piece of a movie, that's all. You don't have a piece of Harry. He told you we're doing another movie first. And that's the way it's gonna be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. But who the fuck are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the one telling you how it is. That's not too hard to figure out, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie turns to Bo Catlett, the man not having moved or changed his expression the last few minutes.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Bo Catlett takes his time, gives it some thought. He looks at Harry . . .
</DIRECTION>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this movie you're doing first?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry, let me answer that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Catlett looks at Chili again.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<BO_CATLETT>
<DIRECTION>
(beat, smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can talk to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I thought. So let me put it this way
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Now it's between them. The guy studies Chili, thinks about whether or not to make a move, when Harry steps in, reaches over the desk and picks up a script . . .
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the project, Mr. Lovejoy. I'm not trying to pull anything on you guys. This is it, right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Chili looks at Harry, wonders if there's a way to shut him up without punching him in the mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Loveboy? What is it, Harry, a porno flick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches for the script. Harry backs away, holds the script to his chest. Bo Catlett notices this.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's nothing. It's fluff. Nothing you'd be interested in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Bo Catlett eyes him a beat, then pushes out of his chair . . .
</DIRECTION>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of Freaks and put 'em in this other one, Mr. Loverboy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You positive about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a different kind of deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Bo Catlett nods, gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie opens his coat so that Harry can see a gun tucked in his belt . . .
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hear me?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Bo Catlett gives Ronnie a look.

<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>

(closes Ronnie's jacket)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not animals. Are we, Ronnie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<DIRECTION>
Bo Catlett glances once more at Chili then follows Ronnie out the door. Harry stares at the door a moment, senses Chili staring at him . . .
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought . . . I told you to keep your mouth shut.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had to tell 'em something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never say anything unless you have to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Chili shakes his head as Harry sits down in one of the chairs, fumbles for his cigarettes.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His shrink's trainer.

Leo sits down in the arm chair, stares sadly at the briefcase.

<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how you got this far, you're so fuckin' dumb. But now you're through. I'm gonna explain to you why and I hope you're not too dumb to understand what I'm saying. Okay?

Leo nods.

	Ray Bones is now the man you're dealing with. Ray Bones finds out what you did, he's gonna want everything you have. And when I say everything, I mean even that sporty little hat if he wants it. Then after he takes all you got, he'll most likely hit you with some kind of heavy object if he doesn't shoot you, just so you won't tell on him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Chili lets that sink in a minute.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't do that. Take your stuff or hurt you. You have three-ten in the case, right? I'm gonna take the three hundred you scammed off the airline, but the rest of it, the ten grand? I'm gonna borrow that and pay you back sometime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>

Leo's squinting at him now . . .

He picks up the briefrase as he rises from the sofa and Leo gets out of his chair.

As Chili starts for the elevator. Leo steps into his doorway . . .
</DIRECTION>
<LEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. What's this eighteen-percent-a-year shit? You want to borrow ten, the vig's three bills a week. Fifteen for the vig plus the ten, that's twenty-five big ones you go a whole year, buddy! You hear me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEO>
<DIRECTION>
Chili stops, turns around. As he starts back, he sees Leo's scared look just before he slams the door shut. Chili shakes his head, starts back for the elevator.

A MOVIE SET

Chili pulls in behind a row of trailers. He gets out of the car and heads for the set where Harry is now looking up at the sky and yelling at someone . . .

Harry tosses Chili a key-ring.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the red one. Take it off the ring.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Chili sits down in one of the director's chairs that sits off to one side. He starts to take the key off the ring . . .
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your name Vicky Vespa?

Chili looks up at a bored-looking ACTRESS standing there in a blood-soaked nightie.

<ACTRESS>

Chili sits forward, sees her name printed on the back. He gets up. As she sits down, we see an ICE PICK sticking out the other side of her head. Chili sits back down next to her in the chair with HARRY ZIMM on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(to the director)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you doing? I thought I told you to get down here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
The kid nods to the camera operator who lowers the crane as we BOOM WAY UP. . .
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What 'emotion?' Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's scared! Fear is an emotion!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, kid, if you remember anything from your time working with Harry Zimm, let it be the three key words to filmmaking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
The kid fiddles with the crane controls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? What three words, Harry?

</DIRECTOR>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry turns so the rest of the crew can hear him . . .
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I'm gonna tell you a little story, happened to me years ago when I was so broke I had to go to the Pick 'n' Save over on Vine to buy a lousy candybar for my dinner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Chili watches the crew stop what they're doing and listen.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm standing in line waiting to pay my two bits when I overhear this lady, call her Mildred, talking to the cashier about a movie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
The Director gives a look to his assistant like 'Jesus, you believe this shit?'
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gets into it the way Mildred did)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so . . . romantic.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's great, Harry. So what's the --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry's right in the guy's face now . . .
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So . . . keep this fuckin' camera down here on the ground and shoot this scene, so we can see what the fuck is goin' on, before I get someone over sixteen to fuckin' shoot it for you!
	</DIALOGUE>

Harry walks over to Chili, sees Chili sitting there. Chili tosses Harry his key ring.

Bo Catlett, reading glasses, script open in front of him, looks up from Harry's desk as Chili steps into the office.
</DIRECTION>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This ain't bad, you know it? This Mr. Lovejoy. Needs a better ending but yeah, I can see why Harry wants to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<DIRECTION>
Chili says nothing, sits down in one of the red leather chairs.
</DIRECTION>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Bo Catlett smiles at him, doesn't give up the script.
</DIRECTION>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Bo Catlett sits back in the chair a moment, watches Chili light a cigarette . . .
</DIRECTION>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's what he said, I'm his associate.

Bo Catlett picks up a piece of paper off the desk . . .
</DIRECTION>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, we're getting Martin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?

<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wonder, would that work?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie Fingers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what? Where's it say in this script he's white? Color is what the part needs, man, somebody to do it has some style. The way it is now, Ronnie could do it, play himself, some cracked out asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So whatta you think of the script?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<DIRECTION>
Bo watches as Chili picks up a copy of the script, begins flipping through it.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than Lovejoy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<DIRECTION>
Chili flips through the script, sees a name . . .
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's Ilona.

</CHILI>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about her?

</BO_CATLETT>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get something going there.

<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?

</BO_CATLETT>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's . . . young.

</CHILI>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<CHILI>

Bo Catlett studies Chili a moment, smiles . . .

<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I'm thinkin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(leans forward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna make the girl older. I don't like the ending. We could do that, you and me, sit down and write the script over where it needs it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<DIRECTION>
Chili fips through the script a moment . . .
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know how to write one of these?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words . . . although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all there is to it, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all.

Chili sits forward, stabs out his cigarette, exhales into Bo Catlett's face . . .

</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Bo Catlett starts for the door.

	Wow, huh?

<CHILI>

	<DIALOGUE>
	And you think the movie business is any different?

	Yeah well . . . I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.

</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Harry moves to the door and opens it to reveal DORIS SAFFRIN -- fiftyish, fur coat, hair up so that we can see the nifty necklare. She leans in the doorway . . .
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Doris.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DORIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIS>
<DIRECTION>
And she plants one on him. Walks into the apartment. Looking good for her age. Hell, for any age.
</DIRECTION>
<DORIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIS>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Doris goes to the window. Harry goes to the bar, pours them each a drink . . .
</DIRECTION>
<DORIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a spectacular view.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIS>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camero down on the corner of Argyle there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hands her the drink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want, Doris?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She drinks, never taking her eyes off him.
</DIRECTION>
<DORIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I miss Murray, Harry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIS>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DORIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Harry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIS>
<DIRECTION>
Harry finishes his drink, pours himself another . . .
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, twenty-twenty hindsight and all that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry takes a big, noisy pull off his drink as she moves to the bar . . .
</DIRECTION>
<DORIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate being alone. The house is so quiet. So lonely. It needs . . .

<DIRECTION>
(studies him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A man's touch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIS>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, she opens up the fur coat to reveal that she's wearing nothing but a garter belt and high heels.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice garter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She sets her drink down, moves in, wraps her arms around his neck . . .
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DORIS>
<DIRECTION>
(reaching down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You seem to feel fine about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIS>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DORIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Murray's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIS>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him . . . Harry pulls back . . .
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DORIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day . . . who just happened to get his hands on the script.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIS>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, what'd he have to say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DORIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIS>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How honorable of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Now she backs away, gives him a hurt look.
</DIRECTION>
<DORIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry. If you want me to go, just say the word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIS>
<DIRECTION>
Harry looks at her a moment, decides . . .
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
. . . And pulls her as close as we then . . .

EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOME -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear laughter, rock and roll as a NUDE WOMAN dives into a blue-lit swimming pool and swims the length . . .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We then TILT UP to a HOUSE ON STILTS above this one and see the lone figure of Bo Catlett standing on his deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BO CATLETT'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shimmering yellow grid of the city in the b.g., Bo Catlett, barefoot, bathrobe, leans on the rail of his deck, watching the folks frolic twelve stories down.
</DIRECTION>
<YAYO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me, man, I don't wan' no focking key. I wan' the money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YAYO>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BO CATLETT'S DECK -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bo Catlett looks inside where Yayo paces back and forth. The Bear reclines on a chaise lounge.
</DIRECTION>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Yayo? You gonna smoke, get the hell off my seventy-bucks-a-yard carpet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<DIRECTION>
Yayo steps out on to the deck . . .
</DIRECTION>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you where the money is. All you gotta do is go get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<YAYO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'll tell you something
	</DIALOGUE>
</YAYO>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all you know, huh? Wait here a minute, Yayo, I be back directly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<DIRECTION>
Yayo leans against the railing, cuts a 'now that's the way you get things done' look at the Bear. He lights a cigarette, looks o.s. and freezes . . .
</DIRECTION>
<YAYO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fock you doing with that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YAYO>
<DIRECTION>
Bo Catlett holds a big .45 out in front of him . . .
</DIRECTION>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm taking you out, Yahoo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<DIRECTION>
. . . and shoots Yayo in the chest, the gun going off loud, the round knocking the little Latin man back against the railing.
</DIRECTION>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dead focking center, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<DIRECTION>
Yayo, a stupid look on his face, stumbles backwards, over the railing. The Bear reaches for him, but it's too late . . .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE DOWN BELOW -- SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The group down here is too stoned to notice the little Colombian who falls from the deck high above like a sack of dirt, then slides partway down the slope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BO CATLETT'S DECK -- SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bear looks over at Bo Catlett . . . who now calmly stares down at the motionless form of Yayo.
</DIRECTION>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<BEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAR>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see that? The way the man just went right over?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<DIRECTION>
Bo Catlett takes a sip of his drink, looks at the railing.
</DIRECTION>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we can get Chili Palmer up here. You fix my railing to give way like they do in the movies. Then I invite the man out here, have a look at my view. Get him to lean over the railing, see all the naked people down there . . . a tragic accident, officer . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<DIRECTION>
Bear looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<BEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAR>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<DIRECTION>
Bear looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, what's the point of living in L.A. if you're not in the movie business?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<DIRECTION>
Bo Catlett leans on the railing, looks down at Yayo again.
</DIRECTION>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I mean high up in it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns to Bear)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<BEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAR>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BO_CATLETT>
<BEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They all sound big at the talking stage.

EXT. MARTIN WEIR'S HOUSE -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karen pulls into the driveway in a convertible BMW. As she checks her make-up in the REARVIEW MIRROR, we see Chili pull up behind her in his rented minivan. She turns aronnd, frowns, and quickly gets out of her car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets out of the van . . . holds up a Star Map . . .
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.

Chili points to a star on the map . . .

<CHILI>

	See, here it is . . . Martin Weir's house . . . right across the steet from George Hamilton.

</CHILI>
<VOICE>

They both look to the front door where a tall, skinny WOMAN with wild, jet black hair stands.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is you . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She comes bounding down the steps, runs over and gives him a hug . . . Karen can't believe what she sees.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nicole?

</CHILI>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Nicki now. I don't believe this.

Karen smiles 'How 'bout that.' Then looks at Nicki.
</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Nicki.

</KAREN>
<NICKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Karen. Shit. I didn't see you there. How are you?

Karen starts to answer, but Nicki's already hustling Chili inside . . .

INT. MARTIN WEIR'S HOUSE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
White everything. Way off in the b.g., a view on to the huge backyard. A pool man cleans the pool. A gardener blows the leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin's extensive photography collection lines the walls. Chili steps inside, checks some of them out most of the photographs are of Martin.
</DIRECTION>
<NICKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin will be out in a minute.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Black like this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKI>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's nice. Especially under your arms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Somehow this makes Karen feel better.
</DIRECTION>
<NICKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin won't let me shave. I guess I fill some need. Brings him back to the sixties or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKI>
<DIRECTION>
Karen turns as we hear a TOILET FLUSH somewhere o.s.
</DIRECTION>
<NICKI>
<DIRECTION>
(looks o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Speak of the devil . . .

</NICKI>
<DIRECTION>
Chili follows her gaze and we see . . .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he comes down the stairs, checking the front of his trousers. He and Karen spot each other. Both look uncomfortable for a fraction of a second, then Martin hurries over to her . . .
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Karen. Wow. Look at you . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Martin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
He hugs her and hangs on, leaving Nicki and Chili standing there like idiots.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmmm. You smell terrific.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She always smelled so good.

</MARTIN>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yesh, a pleasure, Martin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<NICKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chili's a gangster. Ran a club I used to play at for another gangster back in Miami. How is Momo these days anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKI>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Karen fights a smile. Nicki nods solemnly . . .
</DIRECTION>
<NICKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bummer.

Martin, Karen and Chili all sit on white couches. Martin is checking out Karen, nodding . . .
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(touches her hair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all . . . slip away?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did . . . when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
Martin brings his hand back, nods, lost in thought . . .
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. That was a good party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Karen looks like she wants to throw up.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We talk different?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean like we don't give a shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Chili exchanges a look with Karen who sits back now. Ready to give up.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I'm one of those guys you mentioned. I'm actually one of 'em. What am I thinking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Martin looks at Chili . . .
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying an actual metamorphosis takes place. That wouldn't be acting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Karen looks at Martin, shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you don't know what I'm thinking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you want to know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm thinking of a movie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of mine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One we're producing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With what? Wiseguy money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Martin cracks himself up. Karen and Chili crack up with him, Karen leaning into Chili . . .
</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe this was a bad idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
But Chili keeps looking at Martin.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loan-shark Operation in Miami.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened? The pressure got to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Chili sits back. Karen is starting to enjoy Chili's handling of Martin . . .
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're an actor, you like to pretend. Imagine you're the shylock. A guy owes you fifteen grand and he skips, leaves town. What do you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Chili watches as the movie star hunches over, narrows his shoulders. For a few moments he holds his hands together in front of him, getting a shifty look in his eyes. Karen shakes her head . . .
</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, for Christ's sake --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Karen watches as Martin stares at Chili, his expression gradually becoming deadpan, sleepy . . .
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin, look at me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm looking at you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
So is Karen, for that matter.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. How about this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Karen looks away now, fighting a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at me. I'm thinking, You're mine. I fuckin' own you. What I'm not doing is feeling anything about it one way or the other. You understand? You're not a person to me, you're a name in my collection book, a guy owes me money, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Martin nods, gives Chili a nice dead-eyed look. Karen is thoroughly enjoying Chili's manipulation of Martin.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I turn it on when I confront the guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The guy took off for Las Vegas.

	<DIALOGUE>
	How do I know that?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?

Another glance at the Bear, then . . .

<BO_CATLETT>

	That's why I was thinking you could send your boy Chili Palmer. He gets busted or hit on the head you aren't out nothing.

<CHILI>

	Wait here.

<DIRECTION>
Chili moves to the staircase, now sees the Bear in his Hawaiian shirt standing a few steps from the top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chili gets within three steps of the guy and stops, but doesn't look up, keeps his eyes fixed on the man's gut.
</DIRECTION>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like you to meet my associate, the Bear. Movie stuntman and champion weightlifter, as you might've noticed. Picks up and throws out things I don't want.

Chili doesn't move, keeps his eyes on the man's crotch.

<BEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We think you ought to turn around and go back to Miami.

<DIRECTION>
Chili slowly moves his gaze up through hibiscus until he's looking at the man's bearded face . . .
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're a stuntman. Are you any good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
The Bear grins and turns his head to the side, as if too modest to answer and will let Bo Catlett speak for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This makes the next move easier . . . the guy not even looking as Chili grabs a handful of his crotch, steps aside and yanks him off the fucking stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bear yells out of pain and fear as the beefy guy rolls all the way down the stairs to land on the main floor, a few feet away from where Karen now stands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chili keeps watching until he sees the guy move, then looks up at Bo Catlett who's now coming down . . .
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not bad for a guy his size.

<DIRECTION>
Chili continues up the stairs to where Bo Catlett stands beside the table. Chili unbuttons his coat . . .
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll make you a deal. If you can get out of here before I take my coat off, I won't clean the floor with you, get your little costume all messed up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
Karen watches now as Bo Catlett puts a hand in his coat packet, steps right up to Chili . . .
</DIRECTION>
<BO_CATLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know me. You only think you do.

</BO_CATLETT>
<DIRECTION>
Bo walks past Chili, goes down the stairs. Chili watches as Bo Catlett helps the Bear get to his feet. They leave the restaurant, the Bear looking over his shoulder at Chili.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even Karen is looking at him differently now as they slide into the booth with a now shocked, rapidly sobering Harry.

	Rough business this movie business. I may have to go back to loan sharking for a rest.

</CHILI>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, is that right? I'm being set up? Then how come Catlett said I should send you out to get it, since you haven't done a fucking thing for me since you got into this . . . except showing Bo Catlett my script?

Chili looks at Karen, smiles, shakes his head . . .

<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.

Okay, he turns and walks down the aisle now to the bank of lockers three high where C-18 is just about in the middle.

He looks both ways, takes his time until a group of people pass behind, giving him a screen, giving him just time enough to open C-17, grab the black athletic bag, and close the locker.

Chili gets about ten yards down the aisle, heading for daylight, when a BLACK GUY IN A SUIT comes towards him and stops right in his path . . .

Chili shakes his head, tired of this, but still feeling a little sorry for the guy. He looks off in a kind of thoughtful way, turns to the Bear again and kicks him in the left knee, hard.

The Bear stumbles, hunching over. Chili grabs him by the hair with both hands, pulls his head down and brings his own knee up into the guy's face. This straightens him and now Chili hits him high in the belly as hard as he can, right under the rib cage.

Harry can't speak; his jaw is broken. He looks sad lying there pinned beneath Ray Bones' shoe, wondering how it all went so wrong.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bones pulls a 9mm from his coat pocket and aims it down at Harry's face . . .

	Harry. I'm gonna ask you one more time, then I'm gonna shoot you, you don't tell me what I wanna know . . .

<DIRECTION>
Ronnie goes for his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boom. Boom. Boom. Harry closes his eyes as Ray Bones shoots Ronnie over and over, knocking the guy backwards until he hits the door, and slumps to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray Bones stares at Ronnie a moment, then comes out of his trance, looks down . . . quickly steps back . . .
</DIRECTION>
<BONES>

Ray Bones crouches down beside him. Harry winces as Ray puts the gun in Harry's broken hand.

</KAREN>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Depends, who pays?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number.

Chili looks at Karen a moment.

<CHILI>

	You don't like Martin much, do you?

</KAREN>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I like him. I just think he's . . . short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.

</KAREN>

Feeling him staring, she keeps her eyes on the sunset, and tries to change the subject . . .

<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?

	<DIALOGUE>
	You thought I was faking?

The're both quiet a moment. Then . . .

	Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
But Chili can't stop thinking about this now . . .
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute --

Harry watches Karen and Chili a moment longer, turns to Martin . . .
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you rejected me ten years ago when I auditioned for Eddie Solomon, the pedophile clown in Birthday Boy. Had I gotten the part. I might've gotten typecast.

Martin smiles at his own joke, looks up as the Maitre D' approaches. Harry turns back to Chili and Karen.

</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think the romance angle in your story is critically important, that isn't simply a jump in the sack for either of them. These two become deeply in love.

Harry looks up . . . mumbles through his wired jaw . . .

<HARRY>

</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Martin looks at his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?

</MARTIN>

Harry turns to Chili, and back to Martin again. Just now getting it . . .

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<BONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -- I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -- forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
