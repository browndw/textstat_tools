:SC: LIGHT SLEEPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN LETOUR, forty, light sleeper. Never meant to be a drug dealer, it just came along. He's been other things: messenger boy, cab driver, model, postal clerk, doorman, nightclub shill -- never meant to be them either. Now he's a D.D. Drug dealer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN LETOUR, well-groomed, khaki slacks, leather jacket, tippet-like scarf, belt pouch, "Beatle" boots, a shadow drifting in and out of other shadows, New York, day, night: watching, listening, rarely speaking -- nonexistent, seen only by those he sees. His face an affable blank. Make of it what you will. The eyes flicker; the hands shift discreetly. A map of calculation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once he had a drug problem. Life turned a page. Today he follows instructions: he sleeps light -- one eye open, anticipating. JOHN LETOUR, D.D., loner, voyeur, has been drifting toward an unknown destination. At mid-life the destination draws near. The circle tightens. The dealer is anxious. The destination is love.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: NIGHT IN THE LIFE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREDIT SEQUENCE: New York by night. JOHN LETOUR nestles in back of a blue car service sedan, face reflected in the window. Neon mixes with steam, street people with tourists, young dates: each with a different agenda, a hidden purpose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His beeper goes off. He clicks it, checks the digital message. The DRIVER stops at an uptown corner. LETOUR opens the curbside door, motions to the DRIVER he'll be back in "ten" minutes. He enters the video laundromat, a twenty-four-hour video rental/laundromat/tanning salon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, he meets a RETRO-YUPPIE (J. Crew Division) in the "Classics" section. They exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the sidewalk, money is exchanged for a packet. LETOUR pockets the uncounted cash. The YUPPIE mouths goodbye, eager to put distance between him and LETOUR. JOHN checks his beeper, stops at a pay phone, dials.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN LETOUR re-enters the sedan; the DRIVER heads downtown. High-rises give way to Tudor City. Uncollected trash lines the curbs. LETOUR eyes a PEDESTRIAN; PEDESTRIAN looks back. Later. Three a.m. The streets are dark. LeTour's car passes a glowing Korean market.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LETOUR narrates from diary:
</DIRECTION>
<LETOUR>
<DIRECTION>
(voice over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Labor Day weekend. Some time for a sanitation strike. Everybody crazy to stock up. They decide to score at the last minute and want it now. Never fails. The faces look alike. You gotta use memory tricks: each has some peculiarity -- it keeps you sharp. A D.D. told me when a drug dealer starts writing a diary it's time to quit. I started writing after that. Not every night -- now and then. Just to burn off the night. Fill up one book, throw it out, start another.

:SC: HOMEBASE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four a.m.: streets empty. LeTour's sedan drops him off near a ten-story West 80s apartment building. JOHN gives the DRIVER a forty-dollar tip (standard procedure), turns the corner. He presses the intercom; a buzzer unlocks the door. He enters the lobby, walks past English reproduction furniture toward the elevators. Presses the button.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penthouse C door opens. ANN lets JOHN in with a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANN, forty-four, striking in a tailored dress, greets him with a wet kiss. Her hair is coiffured, her face made up. She is John's employer, mentor, confidante, Mother Hen: she keeps the books. Her ingenuous demeanor belies sterner stuff: she's been in the drug business fifteen years.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ann's apartment is a jumble of sensibilities: dark green walls, zebra-skin sofa, Haitian wall friezes, framed magazine photos of Paramahansa Yogananda, Liz Taylor, the Duke of Windsor -- paintings stacked behind an oversized urn. A bird flits in its cage. One corner of the living area is devoted to a fledgling cosmetics business: Macintosh computer, billboard of trade paper clippings and ads, herbal samples, reference books, color charts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROBERT, fifty, slight, waves hello as JOHN locks the door. Gay, hip, worn, he's John's "co-runner."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They work -- and eat -- out of Ann's apartment. Take-out tins of Indian food are stacked amid crystals, tarot cards, glasses, and vitamin bottles. No sign of drugs, drug paraphernalia, or money.

:SC: JOHN'S APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
First light reflects across the Hudson as LETOUR walks west on 22nd Street toward his Chelsea apartment building. A delivery truck passes uncollected garbage. He enters a nondescript doorway. Inside his studio apartment, JOHN sits at a second-hand table writing in a composition book. He drinks from an eight-ounce glass of white wine, continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room has little personality; Ann's apartment has enough for two. Nails indicate where pictures once hung; a boombox sits on the linoleum floor amid cassettes, books (Autobiography of a Yogi, The Secret Doctrine), fashion magazines, a stack of unopened CDs. A futon is unrolled beneath the room's sole decoration, a poster of a human foot advertising a forgotten photo exhibit. Wine bottles -- Chenin Blanc. Precious little to show for forty years.

LeTour's narration resumes as he writes:

	"Labor Day." "Union Movement" -- there's a contradiction in terms. I know about long hours. It's worse when I'm off -- I just walk and walk. Where am I going? There's an element of providence to it all. Like rolling numbers. Luck. You're walking down the street, some guy that looks maybe a little like you does a stick-up four hours ago, there's an APB description out and a cop pulls you in cause he's cold and wants to go inside -- they grab your stash. Your number's up. You're busted for nothing. For bad luck.

Later. LETOUR sits in an Upper West Side apartment as an earnest MID-TWENTIESH MAN, wearing undershorts, snorts a hefty line, offers a rolled dollar bill as he talks. LETOUR declines.

LETOUR's mind drifts. His diary voice overlaps:
</DIRECTION>
<LETOUR>
<DIRECTION>
(Voice over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody wants to talk. It's like a compulsion. My philosophy is: you got nothing to say, don't say it. They figure you can tell a D.D. anything, things they would never tell anyone else. He understands. Of course they're stoned to start. If I could tie together all the hours of coke talk I've heard, that would be a lot of string. It was Robert's idea to add twenty-five dollars to home deliveries cause it's such a hassle. Fifty is more like it.

Later. Narration continues as sedan drives through rain. Later. A Tribeca loft. LETOUR swaps drug jargon with TWO N.Y.U. STUDENTS at an impromptu party. Attractive ingenues drift by. TRENDY TWOSOME, blasted, sways, to techno-rap.

LeTour's sedan heads down Lexington Avenue. It rains unabated. Puddles glisten; red taillights refract on the windshield. JOHN rests in back, a bag from Enhancements beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pedestrians, well-dressed and casual, desperately wave for taxis amid sacks of garbage. No use: nothing for blocks.

John's sedan stops for a midtown light. LETOUR looks out the window, sees a WOMAN vainly hailing a cab. He looks again. She turns her head. He recognizes her.

JOHN accepts a coffee mug, sits on a sofa across from TERESA. Sunlight falls through crocheted curtains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TERESA ARONOW, fortyish, professionally young, is compact, demure; she wears business jacket and skirt, patterned blouse. Nothing about her is remotely paranormal -- nothing except, of course, her "aura." The "Other Side." Her voice is at the same time soothing, piercing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Teresa's West Village consultation room is startlingly mundane: a bourgeois walk-up. Upholstered furniture, Tiffany objêts d'art, framed photos of her husband and children -- a trip to Capri. A twenties portrait of Madame Blavatsky, above the fireplace, centers the room.

	You took off for three months without telling me and called once. That's how magical we were. You were an encyclopedia of suicidal fantasies -- I heard them all. Nobody could clear a room like you, John. And the friends, you may have noticed, turned out to be mine, not yours. I envy you. A convenient memory is a gift from God.

He fills his glass with wine:

	<DIALOGUE>
	I can always find another way to make a living. I never planned this in the first place -- not like Ann. She came up to sell, have parties, make contacts. She was so glamorous.

Inside the hospital room, MRS. JOST, sixty-five, lies sedated, attached to IV tubes and a respirator. Flowers wreathe the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RANDI sleeps in a chair by the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LETOUR looks from MRS. JOST to RANDI and back again: a vibrant woman reduced to a shell. He soundlessly eases into a vacant chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His mind goes back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RANDI twists fitfully in her chair. A stuffed bear peeks over family photos on the window sill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARIANNE steps into the doorway, stops, frozen -- watching the tableau: JOHN, RANDI, her mother. Her face is ravaged: the death watch has taken its toll. LETOUR reaches his arm, touches the hospital bed.
</DIRECTION>

MARIANNE tiptoes behind JOHN. He turns, stands.

They kiss deeper, bodies grinding. The painful present fades. A NURSE approaches with WHEELCHAIR PATIENT. She tries to pass one side of JOHN and MARIANNE, tries the other side, is blocked again. The NURSE stops, stares at their soap opera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sensing her glare, JOHN and MARIANNE, hands over and under each other, stop, look to the NURSE: embarrassed -- yet blissful.

LETOUR and MARIANNE are all over each other. The pain of the moment, the pain of the past are subsumed by passion. Blind, welcome sexuality.

Naked, they kneel facing each other on the bed, faded bleeding heart tattoo on his bicep:

Later: night. They lie nude in a scramble of twisted sheets and mattresses. Street lights cast horizontal shadows. LETOUR crawls over, falls upon Marianne's breast. She wakes up, looks at JOHN, looks out the window, returns to slow sad reality.

MARIANNE stands, pulls on her panties.

LETOUR is alone. He pulls his pants on. Looking for his socks, he peruses Marianne's personal things. He examines her cosmetics, her underclothes. He dabs her perfume on his cheek.

LeTour's sedan waits between limos.

Inside, JOHN passes the MAÎTRE D', looks around: he's known here. Au Bar, a restaurant/club open 9:00 p. m. to 4:00 a. m., caters to the young, the rich, the European.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spots TIS with THOMAS, twenty-five, his handsome trainer, and TWO MODELS at a second-floor table. They exchange nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LETOUR scans the room: suspicion is second nature.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A laughing man (GUIDONE) at the bar catches his eye. He seems to blend: Italian, twenty-eight, silk suit, impeccable hair, accent -- but something's not right. His black shoes have rubber soles. LETOUR looks for a gun bulge, dirty hands. The ITALIAN turns; LETOUR glimpses his face: too pale. The ITALIAN averts his eyes. Glancing back, LETOUR walks up the stairs to Tis' table.

<DIRECTION>
Six p.m. LETOUR, shaved and bathed, rides a cab uptown, past Harlem, past 158th Street. He motions to the DRIVER; the taxi stops at a blue door between retail stores begging for renovation. TEENAGE LATINOS hang out. LETOUR gives the CABBIE a twenty. LETOUR walks to the blue door; the YOUTHS stop, watch. He knocks on the door. A PUERTO RICAN DOORMAN in white leather pants and a heart-shaped diamond ring opens the door, looks him over. JOHN reaches into his pouch, removes a gram envelope, hands it to him. The DOORMAN takes a taste, buzzes him through a door hand-lettered "Jump-Offs."
</DIRECTION>

Inside Jump-Offs, a cocaine "spot," every eye turns to JOHN: the only Anglo in a Hispanic after-hours club. Tough young faces, each with a style and two inches of attitude. Willie Colon plays on the jukebox.

He takes a bottle of cologne from the bathroom, pours it over his hair, face, and torso, rubs it in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Licking his finger, he removes Marianne's gold and onyx ring with a tug. His finger stings. He opens a window, throws the ring full force into the junk-strewn courtyard. He shakes his torso; cologne glistens.

He straps the gun to his back, wraps duct tape around his chest, end to end over the .38. He tucks in his shirt, puts on the jacket, checks the mirror to see if the gun shows: it doesn't. A pause to appreciate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LETOUR closes his diary, throws it out the window: a trifle. He slaps cologne on his cheeks -- annointing; heads toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, LETOUR emerges, walks quickly to the car, plops beside ANN. The sedan drives off. Back seat:
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That took long enough. What did you do, douche while you were at it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<LETOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ann, you got some mouth on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want to know where it's been.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sniffs him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cologne?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<LETOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Phew. It smells like that stuff they give you on airplanes. It's no good for your skin. All chemicals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
LETOUR pulls out a slip of paper, writes a name and address: "Linda Wichel, 1012B-2 A Street, Sacramento, California."
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<LETOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do me a favor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<LETOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't ask why, just promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<LETOUR>
<DIRECTION>
(testing again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If anything happens to me -- if I should like, you know, fucking die -- write and tell her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<DIRECTION>
Extends slip of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANN starts to speak, stops.
</DIRECTION>
<LETOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my sister. Her husband's in San Quentin. She worries, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the name and address.
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
<DIRECTION>
(eye contact)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
ANN, sad, looks out the window. She touches his knee. The car pulls in front of the Pennsylvania Hotel, 34th and 7th.
</DIRECTION>
<LETOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought we were going to Tis'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are. He's here. He can't very well work out of his apartment after what happened yesterday, can he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
They get out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: SHOOT-OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pennsylvania lobby: a baseball card convention is in progress. ANN squeezes through, goes to the house phone. JOHN follows, scans the tacky lobby: what's up?
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
<DIRECTION>
(on phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mathis Bruge, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tis? Ann. I'm here with Tour.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hangs up)
</DIRECTION>
<LETOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tis there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twelve-oh-four.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
They go to the elevators, wait with CHATTY CARD COLLECTORS [Pete Rose this, Pete Rose that].
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Twelfth floor. ANN and JOHN step out of the elevator, look for 1204.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LETOUR, a step behind, is all eyes, all ears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANN checks the number, rings the bell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THOMAS lets them in the standard issue suite, locks the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LETOUR was right: it's a set-up. THOMAS and a TEENAGE CUBAN stand either side of them, waistbands conspicuously bulging. No TIS. JOHN turns to ANN:
</DIRECTION>
<LETOUR>
<DIRECTION>
(Jesus-to-Judas)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ann.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<DIRECTION>
ANN's confused, then furious: she had no part in the "set- up." In fact, she doesn't even know it's a set-up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bursting rage, she turns on THOMAS, YELLS:
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you greasy fucks I don't deal with guns! I see guns, I walk! How dare you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
She slaps THOMAS, pulls the 9mm from his waistband, throws it to the carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CUBAN watches bewildered, gun drawn, awaiting instructions. Now ANN's on him:
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you, beaner, whoever the fuck you are, kiss my fat ass!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she spits on his
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	shirt, knees him in the crotch, yanks his gun, throws it beside the gut- clutching CUBAN. She crosses the room,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
YELLING:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it! TIS! Shitball! I know you're fucking there! Let this be a lesson! You wanna deal, you gonna apologize for this!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to LETOUR)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
THOMAS and the CUBAN TEEN retrieve their guns; ANN unlocks the door.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing gun)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it! Stop right there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
She turns defiantly. TIS enters from bedroom:
</DIRECTION>
<TIS>
<DIRECTION>
(to THOMAS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to ANN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about the guns. My fuck-up. I was just trying to make a point -- I apologize.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIS>
<DIRECTION>
TIS looks to THOMAS and the CUBAN: they lower their weapons. He only means to threaten LETOUR.
</DIRECTION>
<TIS>
<DIRECTION>
(about THOMAS and CUBAN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Assholes. What a nightmare.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to ANN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll make the deal tomorrow -- same terms. Ann. Sorry. Go on, leave, you're upset. I just need to talk to Tour a second. About a police matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to LETOUR)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIS>
<LETOUR>
<DIRECTION>
(to ANN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<DIRECTION>
She hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<TIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tour and I need to get our stories straight. Somebody's talking to the police. The guns were for emphasis, to make a point, dumb --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIS>
<DIRECTION>
ANN gets it. Fear hits:
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
<DIRECTION>
(to TIS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We came together, we're leaving together.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to LETOUR)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnny, come with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
Opens door.
</DIRECTION>
<TIS>
<DIRECTION>
(a command)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thomas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIS>
<DIRECTION>
THOMAS fixes his gun on ANN.
</DIRECTION>
<TIS>
<DIRECTION>
(to ANN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be stupid. Get out. Leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to LETOUR)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had nothing to do with Marianne -- she jumped: she was there, then she was gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(nods ANN to leave)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing will happen to Tour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIS>
<DIRECTION>
ANN computes, bolts out, flees, SCREAMING at the top of her lungs:
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
<DIRECTION>
(out of shot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fire! Fire! Fire!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
The fire bell rings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THOMAS, TIS, and the CUBAN stare dumbfounded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LETOUR reaches behind his shirt in the confusion, yanks out the .38 with a painful rip, turning, fires point-blank into the Cuban's chest. BLAM! Shirt fabric flares, flies: the CUBAN falls with blank expression.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THOMAS, off guard, wheels and fires wildly at LETOUR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN fires back. Both are hit. TIS ducks into the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THOMAS and LETOUR fire again, again -- hitting, missing. A bullet hits its mark: THOMAS, frozen, grabs his blood-spurting throat, slumps to floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LETOUR bleeds from the stomach and shoulder. His shirt soaks red; he struggles to stand. CUBAN and THOMAS -- both dead. LETOUR checks the .38: five rounds fired -- one left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LETOUR staggers into the bedroom, finds TIS frantically searching an open suitcase. Off-screen VOICES under the fire bell.
</DIRECTION>
<TIS>
<DIRECTION>
(desperate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIS>
<DIRECTION>
LETOUR steps to TIS, aims, shoots him barrel to forehead. Exit debris hits the wall. He is dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Off-screen screams of guests are countered by commands from hotel security: "Get down!" "Get back!" Fire horns and sirens reverb from the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LETOUR, losing consciousness, sits bedside. Gun slips from his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deflating, he drifts back-first to the bedspread. Blood spreads. His eyes are open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POLICE VOICES approach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVERY GRAIN OF SAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Prison waiting area. ANN, wearing a wool suit, waits among black/Hispanic FRIENDS and RELATIVES. The first scene without LETOUR: she sits quietly. A CORRECTIONS OFFICER instructs the visitors to proceed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANN walks through a concrete corridor, finds the visiting area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LETOUR, in prison fatigues, sits at a table. He sees her, smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANN sits down. This is not her first visit.
</DIRECTION>
<LETOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
Checks watch.
</DIRECTION>
<LETOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty minutes. You look terrific.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I look respectable. Any news?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<LETOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sentencing's in ten days -- supposed to be. Because of the extenuating circumstances -- our cooperation -- they say it won't be more than five years -- maybe seven. With time served, good behavior, parole, I could be out in two years -- maybe. I hope.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It feels like forever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<LETOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not so bad. It's a relief in a way -- at least so far. I've been writing, reading.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love your letters.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
<LETOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's business?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Robert quit. He went back to dealing. I think he thought it would be less work, more money. It's lucky in a way I got mixed up in it -- now I have to see this thing through. So it's cosmetics after all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<LETOUR>
<DIRECTION>
(affectionate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I miss you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<LETOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did we ever fuck?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<LETOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, make love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<ANN>
<DIRECTION>
(thinks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was that party when everybody was so stoned, but -- oh yeah, that night you came over and crashed and we slept together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<LETOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were naked, but did we --?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had a hard-on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<LETOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You tried...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<LETOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was thinking about it and I realized we never really did. It's one of the things I think about. It's one of the things I look forward to. I've been looking forward.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<LETOUR>
<DIRECTION>
(touches her hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something can be right in front of you and you can't see it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LETOUR>
<ANN>
<DIRECTION>
(kisses his hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strange how things work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
The tableau fades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
