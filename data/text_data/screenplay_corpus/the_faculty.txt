Outside on the football field Coach Willis screams at his football players as they do the plays he wrote up himself. However, on the field, nothing is going as he planned. Nothing is good for him. Nothing is perfect. He screams at them how they're going to die on Friday when they play the only team that can kick their ass. After the practice he yells at the star quarterback Stan on how he needs to open his eyes and play better. Stan's friend Gabe tells him to shake it off and the two head for the locker room. In a fit of rage, the coach heaves over the bench knocking down the huge tubs of water for the players. He kicks a sprinkler and it flickers on...he puts his foot over it and then kneels down and places his hand over it. A large shadow appears behind him. The coach turns around.

A few hours after school ended, a few teachers including Principal Drake, Mr. Tate, Mrs. Olson, and Mrs. Brummel, get together in the faculty lounge to have a faculty meeting.
</DIRECTION>
<DRAKE>

There's a moment of silence and all the teachers look sadly at each other. Mr. Tate lights up a cigarette.

<TATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I bet the football team gets their new jerseys and their new equipment.

	Have you seen the football stadium on a Friday night, Mr. Tate? The entire town is here.
	</DIALOGUE>

(She starts to gather her things, ready to leave.)
</DIRECTION>
<DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a football town, let me remind you, and yes, the team will get new jerseys, new knee pads, new jock straps, and everything else they want in the name of education because that is what the school board wants. As well as what the parents in this town want. My frustrated hands are tied.

Outside the school, after the meeting, Mr. Tate and Mrs. Brummel walk down the stairs talking to vent their frustration.

Mrs. Olson stands at the top of the stairs with Principal Drake as she searches her bag for her keys.

In the school again. Drake re-enters the pitch-dark school and walks towards her office, humming a little tune. She finds her keys and as she turns to leave she runs into Coach Willis, who blocked her exit from the office.
</DIRECTION>

Willis, obviously looking for an excuse, sees a set of pencils on Drake's desk. He's master of the situation now.
</DIRECTION>
<COACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry to bother you but I... can't seem to find a... pencil.

Drake tries to move past him again, but again he blocks her path.

<COACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have a pencil?

</COACH>
<DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ! Yes I have a pencil! I have plenty of pencils!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
She walks towards her desk and grabs a long, sharp pencil and gives it to the coach.
</DIRECTION>
<DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. Why don't you and your pencil go home? It's late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAKE>

Drake tries to move past him, but yet again he blocks her.
</DIRECTION>
<COACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look very, very pretty tonight.

<DIRECTION>
Principal Drake is now, to say the least, upset.
</DIRECTION>
<DRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(threatening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harassment has a very fine line coach. Haven't you read your handbook?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the coach grabs her hand and shoves the pencil all the way through. Drake cries out in pain. The coach rips the pencil from her hand and admires the blood on it.
</DIRECTION>
<COACH>
<DIRECTION>
(half to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always wanted to do that....
	</DIALOGUE>
</COACH>
<DIRECTION>
Drake rakes her keys against his face, making two large cuts that instantly begin to bleed. She accidently drops them, and runs out of the room. As she runs through the hallway the coach gets on the loud speaker.
</DIRECTION>
<COACH>
<DIRECTION>
(Through PA System)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would Ms. Drake please report to the principal's office?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COACH>
<DIRECTION>
Drake runs into a Science room trying to find a hiding spot. The coach quickly spots her runs into the room and tries to grab her. Drake bashes him in the head with a large class beaker. She then runs out of the room and towards the main door of the school. Mrs. Olson stands there wondering what the confusion is about.

Drake looks toward her office which is only a few yards away.

She starts to walk towards her office cautiously, fully aware that a killer is in her vicinity, but not knowing where.

(Through closed door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Ms. Drake, please be careful!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLSON>
<DIRECTION>
Drake fetches her keys nervously humming a tune and grabs a pair of scissors for protection. She then hears Mrs. Olson screaming for her.
</DIRECTION>
<OLSON>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms Drake! He's coming! He's coming! Hurry!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLSON>
<DIRECTION>
Drake darts out of her office noticing the coach, who is at the end of the hallway picking pieces of glass from his skull. He gives Ms. Drake an admiring look. She races towards the front door fumbling with her keys. The coach starts to walk towards her, Mrs. Olson panics, warning Ms Drake. The coach then starts to run towards Drake. Drake drops the keys and gets them up off the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
She gets the lock opened and outside right as the coach reaches the door. She wraps the chain around and tries to lock it to trap the coach inside. She drops the scissors while attempting to close the lock. She kicks them behind her before the coach can get to them. Mrs. Olson picks them up. Ms. Drake gets the lock closed and pauses.
</DIRECTION>
<DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prick!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at Mrs. Olson, who stares at her in a deadly trance. Mrs. Olson holds the scissors high in her hand and starts to slash Drake to the ground. Every cut gives birth to a new wound, each bleeding continuously. Drake falls down. Coach Willis looks at Mrs. Olson in an approving waythrough the window of the door. She smiles sarcastically.

Outside Herrington High School kids are just arriving to start the day. Friends meet up with friends, girls gossip on the latest news, busses arrive and are quickly emptied with kids; the typical morning madness. A girl carelessly slides her car into a parallel parking spot crashing into the person in front of her. The girl who owns the now smashed car gets out quickly and pulls the girl in the other car from behind the wheel onto the ground. The other girl reacts by pushing the first onto the hood of her car. The fight continues. All of a sudden a black 1970 Pontiac GTO with two broad, red stripes running over the hood, roof and trunk speeds into the school parking lot, making lots of noise, accompanied by some music, which can't be heard clearly until Zeke, the high school bad boy, gets out. He pops open the trunk and takes a few pens filled with white powder. He quickly stuffs them in his pocket and walks toward the school. Casey, a nerdy photographer for the school paper, departs the school bus

Again the frame freezes for a few seconds as the name "STOKELY" is displayed. Stokely walks towards the main entrance of the school trying to avoid the eyes that were upon her. She takes notice to a girl screaming vulgar language at her boyfriend to get out of the car. Without realizing it she bumps into Stan, the head quarterback of the school football team. Stan quickly makes sure she's okay but without listening Stokely gets cocky with him.

Back outside the school the jocks that ganged up on Casey ram him into the flagpole, legs open. A blond girl in a flowered dress named Mary- Beth watches the act cautiously as she walks toward the main building. Today is her first day of school. She just moved into Herrington, Ohio from Atlanta. She approaches two nose pierced and tattooed girls sitting by the main entrance of the school. One has a chain from her nose ring that connects to her earring. They are just staring ahead, ignoring the world around them.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me? Could you please tell me where the office is? It's my first day here.

The girl with the chain doesn't answer for a moment but finally points her thumb into the school building.

	Thank you. I'm Mary-Beth Louise Hutchinson. I love what you've done with you're nose ring. It really brings out the color in your eyes.

Yet again, the frame stops for a minute as the name "MARY-BETH" appears on-screen. She quickly heads inside the school watching a girl cussing out her boyfriend, slapping him walking down the hallway until they both leave the building. This is a normal routine for this couple.

As he gives them the pens, the image freezes again. The name "ZEKE" is displayed. The two customers take the drug and give Zeke his money. They exit the bathroom.

The two of them enter the lounge.

</CASEY>
<DELILAH>

She looks through someone's bag.

	Hmm...Nurse Harper's medicated. Big surprise.

Casey looks into a cupboard and pulls out a bottle of alcohol and shows it to Delilah.

</CASEY>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other longingly for a moment, until they hear Mrs. Olson and Coach Willis entering the office. They quickly rush into the faculty closet to hide, looking through the blinds to see what was going on. The two teachers head directly to the water dispenser. The Coach fills a paper cup and drinks from it. Mrs. Olson fills a cup also but just splashes it onto her face, hard.

<OLSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to Mrs. Brummel?

</OLSON>

	Soon.

</OLSON>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and the two teachers turn to see Nurse Harper walk in. She blows her nose for what seems like the millionth time today and feels her head. Warm. When is this terrible cold going to pass? She goes to her bag to get her pills.
</DIRECTION>
<HARPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you two still doing here? I thought I was the only one left?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARPER>

She takes her medication out out of her purse.

<HARPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's not enough drugs in this world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARPER>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Olson nods to the Coach as Nurse Harper walks over to the fridge and gets her tomato juice and takes a sip. The coach walks up to Nurse Harper. He stands behind her, very close. When she turns around she bumps into him and is startled. She gives him a scared, avoiding smile.

<NURSE>

	I have a pain... right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COACH>
<DIRECTION>
He points to his neck then grabs the Nurse and flings her onto the sofa and gets on top of her. The Coach's eyes turn totally white, and his face is covered by what look like very thick veins. He moves his face close to Nurse Harper's ear. Casey and Delilah watch from behind the door of the closet in horror as something comes out of the coach's mouth and squirmed into the Nurse's ear. Some blood is sprayed onto Nurse Harper's cheek, and her face is now also covered by the same 'veins' as the Coach's. Mrs. Olson doesn't even try to help the Nurse. In the closet, Delilah backs into something causing the corpse of Mrs. Brummel to fall over on her. She yelps as she struggles to get the stinking body off her. The Coach looks up at the closet. Mrs. Olson motions for him to check the closet. As he opens the door Casey plunges a broom into the Coach's groin causing him to fall down. Delilah pushes Mrs. Olson onto the table and they both attempt to run out of the room and into the hallway when the commuted Nurse Harp

Delilah spots the Nurse come out of the lounge along with the coach and Mrs. Olson, unscratched.

They both take off down the hallway to the nearest exit. Casey falls down and calls for Delilah's help but she keeps going out the door. He gets up and runs all the way home to call his parents and the police.

A few minutes later Casey is back in the school with his parents and two cops. Principal Drake, Mrs. Olson and Coach Willis are also there, pretending to be innocence itself.

<COP_1>

Principal Drake opens the closet for the cops to examine. Their flashlights search the closet and come across a life like doll face. Drake pulls out the life size doll and puts it on the table. Casey's eyes dart form the closet and back to the doll, confused.

Casey remembers Delilah finding medication in the nurses bag and replacing it.

They both leave... after a moment Casey messes with his computer to make some noise then sneaks out the window to go to Delilah. As soon as he's on the roof he sees the faculty outside on the sidewalk. Losing his balance, Casey falls off the roof and into a bush. The teachers swarm around him. Getting to his feet he runs into his dad.

Casey slowly gets out of the car and walks towards the school. He looks back and notices the coach talking to his dad. The coach waves to him and Casey keeps walking. He walks through the busy halls and runs into Delilah who's normally styled hair is up in a pony tail and isn't hair- sprayed at all today...and she actually has glasses on.

The bell ring and Mr. Tate walks in. He looked tired and it's obvious he won't take any shit. Seeing a student listen to music through head phones, he yanked them out of his ear and smashed a large file of papers onto his desk. The students gasp, turn around, and pay close attention.

	If you were going to take over the world, would you blow up the White House, Independence Day style, or sneak in through the back door?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there's a scream causing the 4 students to jump as Zeke staggers in holding his chest. Then he laughs followed by Mary-Beth and swaggers over to Casey.
</DIRECTION>
<ZEKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Casey. Man the only person in this school that's an alien... is you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZEKE>
<CASEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you, Zeke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEY>
<DIRECTION>
Zeke pretends to look hurt. Mr. Furlong walks in.
</DIRECTION>
<FURLONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on here? Shouldn't you people be in class?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURLONG>
<ZEKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, its like this Mr. Ferlone...Casey, here, thinks you're an alien.

</ZEKE>
<FURLONG>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that true Casey?

</FURLONG>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The whole faculty actually.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Furlong goes from amused to grim and pulls down the shade over the door window.
</DIRECTION>
<FURLONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that true... Casey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURLONG>
<CASEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The uh - the thing I found yesterday...where is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEY>
<FURLONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sent it to the university.

</FURLONG>
<STOKELY>

</STOKELY>
<DIRECTION>
Furlong shrugs his shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<ZEKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, sorry to impose and disrupt, Mr. Furlong
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZEKE>
<DIRECTION>
Zeke walks toward the door but science teacher takes his arm and holds tight.
</DIRECTION>
<FURLONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you would kindly take your seats, this will be over quite quickly. Now sit down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURLONG>
<DIRECTION>
Furlong pushes Zeke to the ground and starts to get the other people. When he tries to get Delilah, Casey runs up to push the science teacher but instead he grabs Casey by the throat with one hand, in a strangle- hold. Zeke rushes to the paper cutter, puts his foot on it and pulls the blade off, sending bolts flying around the room. Holding it like a baseball bat he approaches the teacher who still has Casey by the throat.
</DIRECTION>
<ZEKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put him the fuck down, Furlong!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZEKE>
<FURLONG>
<DIRECTION>
(still holding Casey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is for the best, Zeke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURLONG>
<DIRECTION>
Furlong throws Casey backwards in to the grasp of Stan who gladly catches his fall. Zeke swings the blade cutting off the teacher's fingers. The teacher screams in pain. Red feelers quirm from the wound. His fingers start to move on the ground and chase the remaining students. Stokely and Delilah scream as the fingers squirm up their legs. The science teacher starts to fight Zeke, knocking the large blade out of his hand. Zeke reached into his pocket and pulls out the pen full of his home-made drug, scat and plunges it deep into the eye of the teacher. Furlong heaves Zeke into the water tank, shattering it to a million pieces. Zeke arms another scat pen. White foam squirts out of the eye and eventually the teacher falls down, dead. The students gather around him, to confirm what they've just seen and to make sure he's really dead.
</DIRECTION>
<STOKELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't this usually the point where someone says 'Let's get the fuck outta here'?

</STOKELY>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get the fuck outta here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<DIRECTION>
They head to the door and Casey gets a jar and puts one of Mr. Ferlone's fingers inside which now looked morelike the thing he found the day before.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>

	Alright everybody, here's the deal Run straight to the parking lot. We'll all go together and try to stay calm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<DIRECTION>
They open the science door and walk out into the hallway. The kids all stare at them oddly whispering their names. They are all drinking water bottle after bottle. They get to the parking lot and to Zeke's car.
</DIRECTION>
<ZEKE>

Stan gets in the car and Zeke starts to peel away.

Zeke's house. They walk into Zeke's garage. There's a table covered with test tubes full of gold-colored and green liquid. Next to it are a few dozen capsules. Beside that is a cage with a white experiment rat named Oscar. On the table is a gun.

<CASEY>

He starts to mess with the test tubes. The others admire the hundreds of test tubes, full of experimental fluids.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is some serious shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<DIRECTION>
Mary-Beth takes notice to the capsules and some boxes. On the boxes are the words "NO SLEEP" and an image of a truck. They are merely caffeine pills.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_BETH>

Stan looks down. Casey spots the gun and looks at it suspiciously.
</DIRECTION>
<ZEKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's called a gun, man...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZEKE>
<DIRECTION>
Zeke takes the bottle that Casey put one of the teacher's finger in. Now it looked more like the thing Casey found on the field, instead of a finger.
</DIRECTION>
<CASEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEY>
<ZEKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

He cuts off a small piece of the organism and places it in the rat's cage.
</DIRECTION>
<ZEKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, come here, Oscar...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZEKE>
<DIRECTION>
He drips a bit of water on it. The rat approaches it and the thing sucks itself into the rats ear. The rat squeals, is fazed for a minute and then proceeds to the other side of its cage to drink water.
</DIRECTION>
<ZEKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Geez!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZEKE>

Zeke puts his hand in the cage and grabs the rat.

<ZEKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry buddy...

<DIRECTION>
Zeke uses two fingers to break the rat's neck, killing it. A few minutes later, the rat is cut open. Zeke takes the creature out of the rat's body and places it under a microscope.
</DIRECTION>
<ZEKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See it's a parasite. It attaches itself to a host and then it controls it.

He slits the side of the creature open with a scalpel revealing body parts.

Drake darts up reaching for them. They all scream. Mary-Beth pours the main supply of scat on the principal causing her to convulse and shrivel up in a disgusting sucking noise. She was an alien.

Outside in the pouring rain Stan runs to the football field. The team and the Coach look up to the sky and red feelers extend from their faces catching the falling rain. The Coach smiles, thoroughly enjoying the weather. His face is the same as the face on the creature released into the tank in the Biology room. The feelers go back into his face and he glares at Stan.

Casey gets up from under the bus and bolts leading the troops behind him so Zeke could get to his car. To hide Casey gets inside a bus. Its windows are plastered with slogans like 'Changos Suck' so it has to be a Herrington bus. Casey heads towards the back. The players don't notice him. Suddenly Delilah appears out of the dark at the back of the bus.

A football player smashes through one of the back windows. Casey jumps and climbs through the port hole on the top of the bus, jumps off the bus and ran as fast as he could with a trail of football players behind him. In the parking lot Zeke opens the trunk of his car frantically searching for scat. Senses something. Looks up..Ms Burke is standing near him in a sexy, red dress.

Quickly, Zeke darts into the drivers seat of the car and starts it. As he floors it, she jumps through his passenger window. She tries to pass a parasite into Zeke's ear so he swerves back and forth trying to throw her off. He frantically searches for the capsules. Once he has them he puts his seat belt on and drives as fast as he can into a bus causing the unprotected teacher to fly out the window. The engine catches on fire but Zeke manages to squirm out. He then saw Ms Burke's head slithering towards her searching body. Confused and bewildered, Zeke gives up.

He gets a pool cleaner net and runs to the side of the pool trying to throw it to Stokely. Underwater Stokely tries to get away from the beast that is dominating her. She manages to get to the surface and grabs a hold of the net Casey had thrown in and he pulls her to safety. They both run into the boys locker room.

	First of all, answer me this, Mary-Beth... Why are you naked?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZEKE>
<DIRECTION>
Marybeth starts to walk closer to Zeke, revealing her breasts.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does it bother you, Zeke? My body? I'm getting used to it myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_BETH>
<ZEKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw you take the test.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZEKE>
<MARY_BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Zeke. How the hell can you be sure what you saw? It was sweet of you to bond with me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_BETH>
<DIRECTION>
We see a flashback of how she fooled him and the others. A film covers her nostrils, then her finger slithers over the bottom of the capsule knocking all the scat out onto the floor. She then pretends to sniff the scat.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... to be nice to me...was sweet. Will it work again baby? Do you like what you see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_BETH>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Stokely grabs Zeke. Her face is crawling underneath. She tries to bite him, to infest him with the alien. Luckily, Casey grabs her and throws her into a fence-enclosed storage area which stored the football equipment. Zeke throws Casey some scat.
</DIRECTION>
<ZEKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZEKE>
<CASEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For Mary-Beth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEY>
<ZEKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sniff it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZEKE>
<CASEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're out of your fuckin mind!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEY>
<ZEKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not taking your shit. I leave for five minutes and when I come back everyone's a fucking alien. Don't make me fucking Men-In-Black your ass, you're gonna fuckin sniff it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZEKE>
<DIRECTION>
Casey sniffs it, nothing happens to him.
</DIRECTION>
<CASEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEY>
<DIRECTION>
They run away from the creatured Mary-Beth. Casey tries to keep up with Zeke, but he's having harmful effects from the scat. He sits against a locker.
</DIRECTION>
<CASEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck, I'm seeing two of everything!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there's a scream and Zeke flies over some aisles, is thrown head-first into a locker and falls to the floor unconsious. Casey rushes over to him and when Zeke doesn't wake up, he runs away to hide. He stops briefly by the cage Stokely is in. She grabs his hair from inside the fence links holding him.
</DIRECTION>
<STOKELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's over here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOKELY>
<DIRECTION>
Casey rips away from her grasp leaving her with a handful of hair. The creature morphs back into the form of Marybeth.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_BETH>
<DIRECTION>
(evilly playful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Caaaassseeey...Come out, come out where ever you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_BETH>
<DIRECTION>
She walks through the aisles as she talks very calmly.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know in my world Casey there were limitless oceans as far as the eye can see. Beautiful huh? Till it started to dry out. So I escaped, came here, and I met you, all of you, and all of you were different from the others.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_BETH>
<DIRECTION>
Casey makes his way to Zeke and grabs some scat.
</DIRECTION>
<CASEY>
<DIRECTION>
(to unconscious Zeke)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks,buddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEY>
<MARY_BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were lost and lonely, just like me. And I thought that maybe I could give you a taste of my world. A world without anger, without fear, without attitude. Where the underachiever goes home at night to parents that care. The jock can be smart, the ugly duckling beautiful, and the class wuss doesn't have to live in terror. The new girl - well - the new girl she can just fit right in with anybody. people who are just like her. You see Casey, even Mary-Beth's feelings can be hurt by a bunch of pathetic, lost, little outcasts who truly believe that their disaffected lonely life is the only way they can survive. I can make you a part of something so special Casey, so perfect, so fearless....Don't you want that, Casey?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(peers around a corner into an empty aisle she thought Casey was in)
</DIRECTION>
<CASEY>
<DIRECTION>
(shouts from somewhere)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd rather be afraid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEY>
<MARY_BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. Alright. Have it your way. Cause this is where your land of fiction gets it right. We win. End of story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_BETH>
<DIRECTION>
She turns back into the large creature and starts to knock down locker by locker. Casey runs out into the gym, waits for the creature to show up and then pushes the button that retracts the bleachers. He then runs through the bleachers as they close, the creature following. He gets to the end but the creature doesnt make it. The bleachers close on it. Only its head is out right in front of Casey. Casey gets the scat out of his pocket, and holds it up, preparing to strike.
</DIRECTION>
<CASEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guaranteed to jack you up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEY>
<DIRECTION>
He plunges the scat into the creatures eye. It squeals in pain, shooting the small parasites into Casey's face as a last act. They squirm into his face as he screams. Finally the creature dies and the leech-like creatures fall from his face and onto the ground. He sinks to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<CASEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wouldn't have liked it here anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEY>
<DIRECTION>
Casey gets up and walks back into the locker room, as the creature dries up. He walks past the cage Stokely is in. The leech-like things that were beside her, dry up. He shakes her awake.
</DIRECTION>
<CASEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stokes... Stokely... are you... you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEY>
<STOKELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so. I hope so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOKELY>
<DIRECTION>
They hug. Suddenly, they're startled as Zeke crashes into the chain- link fence that makes up the cage.
</DIRECTION>
<ZEKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it over?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZEKE>
<CASEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEY>
<DIRECTION>
They all get out of the locker room.

	Life has turned back to normal at Herrington High. On the field, during practice, Coach Willis is the usual hard ass he always was and all the students are back to normal. Well almost... We see a football player take off his helmet. It's Zeke. He lights a cigarette.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ONE_MONTH_LATER>
<COACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Zeke, move your ass! Just because you're the new kid doesn't mean we're gonna cut you any slack, you hear me?! Now put out that butt and get on the pitch!

Stan stands looking over a fence towards the football team. Stokely walks up to him and puts her arm around him. Her normally gothic outfit has transformed into a flowered dress.
</DIRECTION>
<STOKELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When do you think they're gonna find a new story? Haven't they milked our little high school invasion to death?

She stares over to a reporter.

</STAN>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles and they kiss. Meanwhile, Delilah approaches Casey who is busy taking a picture of a butterfly. She drops a bunch of magazines with his picture on the cover onto the ground in front of him, including the school paper that she wrote with an article on him...front cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DELILAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how does it feel to be a hero?

</DELILAH>
<CASEY>

</CASEY>
<CASEY>

She looks over his shoulder and notices news reporters heading their way.

</DELILAH>
<CASEY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEY>

He puts his arms around her and they kiss. School has turned back to normal, and the jocks have found a new victim for the flagpole. THE END-Credits Roll
