<MR_SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Catherine is right. The story's a piece of shit. You express nothing but banalities and, formally speaking, are unable to construct a single compelling sentence. You ride on a wave of clichés so worn, in fact, it actually approaches a level of grotesquerie. Ad your subtitle, 'the rawness of truth' is that supposed to be a joke of some sort? Or are you just being pretentious?

	I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.

	It was confessional, yet dishonest. Jane pretends to be horrified by the sexuality that she in fact fetishizes. She subsumes herself to the myth of black male potency, but then doesn't follow through. She thinks she 'respects Afro-Americans,' she thinks they're 'cool,' 'exotic,' what a notch he 'd make in her belt, but, of course, it all comes down to mandingo cliché, and he calls her on it. In classic racist tradition she demonizes, then runs for cover. But then, how could she behave otherwise? She's just a spoiled suburban white girl with a Benneton rainbow complex. It's just my opinion, and what do I know...but I think it's a callow piece of writing.

	I don't know why this is so hard for you to comprehend. I had a terrific time in college. I've got a terrific job, a comfortable salary, terrific wife, three terrific kids…and every year I give to the alumni fund. Now why are you trying to make college out to be a bad thing, a negative experience? You were unhappy? Well, to bad! Get over it! Stop trying to impose your misery on others by going around saying, 'Life is bad, life is horrible.' Life is tough on you? Well, boo hoo!
