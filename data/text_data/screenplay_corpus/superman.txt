CAMERA TRACKS UP past a boarded-up store window with a "For Rent" sign on it, PAST trash cans being investigated by foraging dogs, PAST the stoop of brownstone where some care has been taken to keep things clean, PAST the parlor floor where an undershirted MAN argues with a bathrobed WOMAN, PAST the second Floor windows where a YOUNG COUPLE bend over a crib, shaking a rattle and cooing at a new-born BABY wrapped in a pink blanket, UP PAST the roof of the brownstone, higher and higher, PAST the distant skyscrapers: the Chrysler Building, the Fuller building, the great- neon globe symbol atop the Daily Planet Building.

JOR-EL stands on the dark edge of a circular white ring of light thrusting down from the ceiling of the chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The domed roof rises, cathedral-like above, imprinted with giant projections of the faces of the COUNCIL OF ELDERS (eleven, besides JOR-EL) Who watch the proceedings in judgement, presumably from some other location. Each ELDER is bathed in a specific aura similar to that of JOR-EL. Trapped inside the central dazzling white ring of light are THREE FIGURES. JOR-EL circles the edge of the ring.

	And finally on General Zod - Once trusted by this Council, charged with maintaining the defenses of the planet Krypton itself - the chief architect of this intended revolution, the author of this insidious plot to establish a new order among Us - with himself as absolute ruler.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOR_EL>
<ZOD>
<DIRECTION>
(cold stare)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The vote must be unanimous, Jor-El. It has therefore now become your decision. You alone will condemn us if you wish. And you alone will be held responsible by me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(JOR-EL stares blankly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Join us. You have been known to disagree with the Council before. Yours could become an important voice in the New Order - second only to my own. I offer you a chance for greatness, Jor-El. Take it. Join us.

A pristinely immaculate chamber that overlooks the city of Kryptonopolis. Austere, dominated by concentric circles around which the TWELVE ELDERS sit or stand. In the center of the inner circle revolved an intelligence source on which various information may be presented. JOR-EL enters the chamber, appearing almost through motivational volition than through physical propulsion. The ELDERS turn, look at him. JOR-EL is deeply concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_ELDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An unpleasant duty has been masterfully performed, Jor-El. They have received the fate they deserved - isolation in the Phantom Zone - an eternal living death.

<JOR_EL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A... chance for life, nonetheless. As opposed to us.

Consternation from the ELDERS. A suddenly angry JOR-EL gestures at the revolving intelligence source in the center - various unfathomable equations appear.

VOND-AH gestures at the intelligence source. JOR-EL'S equations disappear, are immediately replaced by a new series. VOND-AH smiles thinly.

<VOND_AH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your conclusions I find unsupportable.

	Any attempt by you to create A Climate of fear and panic among the populace must be deemed by us an act of ... insurrection.

EXT. SMALLVILLE HIGH FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA LOOKS DOWN on a typical midwestern small town high school football field in the 1950's. A coach's whistle signals the end of the team's practice session. A group or GIRL CHEERLEADERS run through their routines nearby. Several PLAYERS practice "extra points" by kicking the ball through the goalposts from the 2 1/2-yard line, now stop, congregate around the bench with the other PLAYERS as they turn in their equipment, prepare to go home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON BENCH - TRACKING SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA TRACKS along the bench as the PLAYERS drop their pads, towels. kicking tees, footballs, etc. on the bench. Picking them up, stacking them neatly and methodically is a bookish-looking TEENAGER of 15. With dark, unstylish hair, heavy-rimmed glasses, and an air of social unease, he is the perfect candidate for team manager - the young CLARK KENT. CLARK nears the end of the bench, looks off at the CHEERLEADERS: five or six wholesomely cute teenagers in their uniforms of sweater, tiny skirt, sneakers, and white socks. They have finished rehearsing their final routine now laugh, applaud themselves, drop their megaphones and run off to join several of the departing PLAYERS. One CHEERLEADER (SUSIE) with an attractive, sensitive face -pauses, sees the megaphones strewn around the ground, begins 'to collect them.

CAMERA PANS as CLARK turns: the mass of equipment he had neatly piled on the bench has been tossed all over the field. Water buckets overturned, etc. In B.G. several other PLAYERS and CHEERLEADERS are crammed into an open , convertible car, snigger to themselves, pretend not to look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>

CLARK'S face falls. He stares at the Grinning FOOTBALL PLAYER as we see a momentary flash of anger pass through his eyes. Will he...? No. Regaining his former composure, CLARK smiles faintly.

<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm ... sorry, Susie. I guess I'd better clean it up.

The FOOTBALL PLAYER puts a victorious arm around the reluctant SUSIE, prods her off toward the open convertible. They get in. The car roars off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON CLARK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLARK is left totally alone on the football field, his face downcast with anger and hurt born of humiliation. He approaches a football sitting on the extra-point tee at the 2 1/2 yard line, is about to pick it up, suddenly gives it a frustrated kick. The ball takes off like a tiny rocket.
</DIRECTION>

CLARK turns, looks at the mess left by the players. He reaches down for the first towel, suddenly grits his teeth, accelerates into SUPER SPEED. His image is only a blur on the screen as towels, pads, buckets, etc. disappear from the field and miraculously reappear on the bench.

EXT. NEAR NORTH POLE - DAY

A flat, desolate plain. off to one side is a huge out-cropping of rock jutting out of the barren, snow-covered landscape. A blizzard rages. CAMERA PANS to reveal CLARK, the rucksack on the ground beside him. The wind rips across the plain. CLARK looks around, seems to be in the process of selecting a specific area. He marks its perimeters with heat vision, burning deep lines into the snow and ice. Once the boundaries are drawn, CLARK concentrates on the area within. The entire mass of snow' begins to melt away as huge flames shoot around the gigantic excavation.

An enormous crater has been carved out of the rock and ice. CLARK stands in the center, reaches into his rucksack, places the green stone on the ground. Climbing back quickly to the edge, he focuses into the crater. As his heat vision hits the stone a crystalline foundation begins to solidify and expand. Green radiation glows all around the excavation site - a wall is formed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another burst of energy intensifies and constructs a second side joined at a right angle. In the bright cone of green light, multi-colored molecules explode and expand into a third impregnable wall. Through the blaze of sparkling light this wall increases in size, spreads out to cover the fourth remaining side.

The tiny figure of' CLARK enters the Fortress, looks up at a multi-leveled white fantasy. Stabbing spurs of crystal cut across the levels at a severe angle. The decor is spartan, minimal. The central area with its complicated memory crystal energy banks where SUPERMAN will communicate with his dead father is overlooked by a series of different levels which lead off to hidden corridors, rooms, etc. The entire dazzling interior is strongly reminiscent of what we have seen earlier on Krypton.
</DIRECTION>

A crystal bench sits next to the energy bank which is lined with rows of smaller glowing crystals. CLARK approaches mesmerized, knowing what he must do but unsure of how and why. He reaches out for the first crystal, places it inside a mechanism in the energy bank, takes his seat on the bench, waits, suddenly:
</DIRECTION>

The light in the Fortress changes dramatically. The walls and jagged planes of the structure seem to come alive with energy. The wall directly opposite vibrates with a special intensity: A giant face appears: It is JOR-EL. His head rises massively up and across the wall, burning with light, looking down, dwarfing the tiny figure of CLARK on the bench. JOR-EL'S eyes flash, focus on him. JOR-EL speaks.

Here in this Fortress of Solitude we shall try to find the answers together. How does a Good man live? What is virtue'? When does a man's obligation to those around him exceed his obligation to himself'? These are not simple questions - even on Krypton there is no precise science which provides us with the answers. I can only tell you what I myself believe. To this end, I have tried to anticipate your questions, and in -the order of their importance to you.

CLARK KENT walks a crowded street in Metropolis, attaché case in hand, conservative suit, heavy-rimmed glasses, etc. A brisk breeze blows. CLARK reaches the street corner, looks around, admires the skyline, fascinated by the big city. He starts across the street to a building marked DAILY PLANET, oblivious to the red light turning green and the oncoming traffic. A taxi hurtles across the intersection.

CLARK waves a cheery farewell to the non-plussed DRIVER, mouths another friendly "sorry", crosses the street, walks through the doors of The Daily Planet.

The city room of a large newspaper. Rows of desks. REPORTERS, EDITORS, COPY BOYS scurry back and forth.

Seated at the typewriter, working with intense concentration punctuated by occasional smiles, is a YOUNG WOMAN. Physically she is a knockout: long brunette hair, smart clothes on a smart figure. Mentally, she's just as good: bright, talented, ambitious.

A girl with a wry sense of humor, a snappy reporter with an instinct for a big story, the grown-up version of that little girl last seen at the train window as it sped through Smallville: This is LOIS LANE.

The office of a working editor. Copy pinned up on bulletin boards, photos piled on the desk, wire service tear sheets, plaques, awards, signed photos on the walls, etc. Behind the desk, rol1ed-up shirt sleeves, tie loosened, is PERRY WHITE, the no-nonsense, hard-working 50'ish editor of the paper. Beneath his gruffness is a nice guy who loves his grandchildren. PERRY struggles vainly with the screw-on top of a pop bottle as LOIS marches in, lays her story on his desk.

PERRY hands CLARK the pop bottle as LOIS continues. CLARK struggles with it mightily, but to no avail.

CLARK tries the bottle cap. It opens, suddenly fizzes out in a squirt from the agitation by LOIS. PERRY and LOIS turn, stare. CLARK winces shyly as the liquid dribbles down his pants leg. LOIS can't resist a smile, but sympathizes.

	Of course you didn't, Lois. Why would anyone want a total stranger look like a fool?

CLARK smiles. LOIS looks back, unsure of how he meant that, as PERRY takes the bottle, from CLARK.

INT. TRACK 23 - CLOSE ON INDENTATION (DAY)

<DIRECTION>
OFFICER #2 has stepped inside the indentation, now waits. The train roars down the track towards him. Suddenly - the rear wall of the indentation pushes forward, shoving him out in the direction of the track. He fights vainly for a moment, then catapults onto the track with a scream as the train rushes past.

INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - NIGHT (DAY)

<DIRECTION>
OTIS proceeds down an even narrow tunnel. Water drips from the rock ceiling above. A couple of rats scamper past and through some rusted heating and electrical ducts which line the sides. CAMERA PANS with OTIS. He heads for a rusty, bolted metal door marked: DANGER - NO ENTRY - CONDEMED.

<DIRECTION>
CAMERA. FOLLOWS another train (this one a model) as it snakes its way around mountains and through deserts in a made-to-scale U.S. western-type landscape. Emerging from a tunnel it heads out onto a bridge which is only half-completed, suddenly tumbles off, the falling cars demolishing a papier-mâché model of a hospital directly below. A low chuckle is heard O. S. CAMERA PANS UP: A few feet away, a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN (EVE TESCHMCHER) reclines with her feet up in a deep, luxurious sofa. working on a needlepoint pillow. A projected blue-sky backdrop shimmers on the wall behind her, looking quite real from this angle and distance. EVE is open, straightforward if slightly dim, with an unmistakable honest sexiness about her which matches her personality. She looks up INTO CAMERA, wide-eyed, disapproving.

WIDE ANGLE ON LEX LUTHOR AND LAIR - EVE'S POV (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LEX LUTHOR sits behind a massive desk in his palatial underground lair, now seen for the first time as CAMERA PANS: At first glance - breathtaking, with its multi-level1ed areas, only some of which are immediately visible. The entire wall behind him which rises to a high ceiling is completely covered with full bookcases bulging with periodicals, papers, etc. Another separate area has a complicated laboratory with viewing theater, banks of electronic gadgets which have been connected to underground electrical lines exposed in portions of the rock-faced walls. In the same manner we will discover exposed heating ducts and water mains. One higher level near the ceiling is completely blocked from view. Off to another side - a large and colourful aviary, stocked with live birds of prey: eagles, falcons, hawks, etc. The walls and ceilings, as we will discover, are almost all canvas on which projections can and will be made, different ones servicing different specific parts of the lair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One other aspect of this underground kingdom will soon become apparent: whether through the architecture which strangely resembles that of Metropolis Station, or the row of bookcases which curiously look like old ticket windows, or the odd, faded track marker which signals the way off into one or another of the hidden corridors of the lair - it is clear we are in an abandoned railroad station, drastically remodeled, but nonetheless a fact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PUSHES IN ON LEX LUTHOR: His face is a task of elegant demonic Genius, for this is a man with an infinite capacity for sadistic evil. Cutting, given to rapidly changing moods, but always thinking - the master criminal incarnate. He stares at EVE, the only person he allows to "nag" him, loving her in spite of all. LUTHOR shakes his head sadly disappointed.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - WIDE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The warehouse is cordoned off. Fire trucks and police cars are drawn up. BOMB SQUAD PERSONNEL stand nearby strapping on their protective gear; now look up as they suddenly hear a "whooshing " sound O . S .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON WAREHOUSE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN lands directly in front of the warehouse door, waves the POLICE back. He turns to face the warehouse. The massive metal doors are linked with a giant padlock.

<DIRECTION>
INT. LUTHOR'S LAIR VIEWING THEATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUTHOR, EVE and OTIS sit in comfortable seats in an elegant viewing theater somewhere inside the underground complex. A bank of large TV screens faces them. One screen projects the live image of SUPERMAN. (NOTE: As the action progresses through the warehouse, different screens will be activated presumably from different cameras). LUTHOR sips a tall drink, smugly adjusts several knobs on a large console next to him. EVE chews gum, stares curiously at SUPERMAN. OTIS munches a large candy bar, excited.

EXT.WAREHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN jerks the padlock backwards off the doors. They open with a huge explosion - the SCREEN is filled with smoke and flame. As the smoke clears: SUPERMAN stands in the doorway, unharmed. He tears apart what's left of the doors like tinfoil, steps inside. A bright row of arrows painted on the warehouse floor points the way for him.

<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE ROOM #1 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN follows the painted arrows into a bare room. The door suddenly slams shut behind him. Instantly: wall panels slide open on all sides filled with machine gun barrels. They all open fire at once in a withering deafening, blinding barrage. SUPERMAN stands erect, arms folded, as thousands of bullets ricochet of him. The barrage finally ends. The floor of the room is totally covered with spent shells. Brushing them aside with his boot to find the painted arrows, SUPERMAN calmly proceeds on his way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

INT. WAREHOUSE ROOM #2 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN enters the second room, has reached the center when: the walls and ceiling suddenly come alive with flaming gas jets. The room becomes a blinding inferno. SUPERMAN stands in the center serenely, waits until the holocaust dies down. Then, adjusting his cape, he nonchalantly starts off for the third room.

INT. WAREHOUSE ROOM # 3 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blizzard stops. The air slowly clears. In the middle of the room: a large cone of ice-has formed. Suddenly, a thin crack appears, running down the center. The crack breaks open. SUPERMAN steps out, rubs his hands together briskly, then starts off.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE CIRCULAR ALCOVE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN has exited the third room into a circular alcove with four lead doors leading off from it. Each is sealed by a huge tumbler lock similar to those on bank vaults. The painted arrows lead off to all four doors. SUPERMAN stops, stares hard at the doors, momentarily mystified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LUTHOR'S VIEWING THEATER - DAY

LUTHOR leans in toward the screen, fascinated for once by what he sees.

If SUPERMAN did have a problem, he solves it quickly. He rips off all four lend doors in super-speed. They crash to the ground, twisted. Finding the doorway he wants, SUPERMAN enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE ACID ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The central area of the room has been blocked off by a ceiling-high thick wire mesh fence. Behind it: the propane lithium pellet hangs suspended by a thin cord over a beaker of acid. SUPERMAN glances O.S.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

A timer clock on the wall indicates eight seconds left.

<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN approaches the fence. It starts to hum. His hands reach out, grab hold of the wire: Fierce electric sparks shoot out like lightening bolts, the current passing through him harmlessly. He rips through the fence as: the pellet suddenly drops. SUPERMAN dives at it with super-speed, catches it at the last second. Staring at it curiously he shrugs, pops it in his mouth, swallows it. He looks down at the beaker of acid, lifts it, swallows it. He looks down at the beaker of acid, lifts it, then quaffs it down as a chaser. Tapping his chest lightly with his fist, he lets out a discreet "burp."

SUPERMAN deposits LOIS Gently on the terrace once again. She is absolutely struck dumb with wonder, stares at him.

INT. LUJTHOR'S LAIR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA CLOSE on the front of a newspaper held by EVE who reads it intently, OTIS peering over her shoulder. The banner headline is clearly visible: I SPENT THE NIGHT WITH SUPERMAN - an exclusive interview by Lois Lane. CAMERA PANS to the desk. LUTHOR sits behind a massive pile of books, notations, calculators, etc. He works feverishly with a slide rule, his face aglow with demonic inspiration.
</DIRECTION>
<LUTHOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now then ... given the location of the galaxy he mentions . . .

LUTHOR suddenly slams the slide rule down on the desk in a rage. It breaks in two, part of it whizzing across the room. EVE looks up, terrified. LUTHOR manages a patient smile, rises.
</DIRECTION>
<LUTHOR>
	<DIALOGUE>

LUTHOR crosses to the massive wall of books behind him, climbs a large rolling wooden ladder attached to the shelves. He turns to OTIS .
</DIRECTION>
<LUTHOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Onward to the letter N. Otis. Let's roll!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHOR>

OTIS crosses to the ladder.

The staircase stops. LUTHOR looks down.

(turns)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think, people, think! Deductive reasoning, that's the name of the game!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHOR>
<DIRECTION>
LUTHOR turns dramatically, pulls out a specific periodical, starts to leaf through it.
</DIRECTION>
<LUTHOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since .fragments of Krypton must have been shot out into space by the explosion, it's reasonable to assume some of the debris would have landed here on Earth.
	</DIALOGUE>

<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean meteorites?

LUTHOR lets the periodical sail down to the floor. EVE and OTIS pick it-up eagerly, looks.

INSERT SHOT - PERIODICAL PHOTO
</DIRECTION>

The photo shows an ETHOPIAN FARMER holding a wedge-shaped green rock about a foot long and five inches high. The FARMER grins at the camera. The caption beneath reads: Meteorite Lands near Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, June, 1951.

EVE and OTIS stare at the picture, mystified.

	I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but - so what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<LUTHOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So -what? You mean to us it's just a meteorite? Fair enough. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHOR>
<LUTHOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But because of its high level of specific radioactivity - to someone from the planet Krypton - this substance would be lethal!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHOR>
<OTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean bullets and .fire can't hurt him, but this kind of rock
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTIS>
<LUTHOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will kill him!

</LUTHOR>
<DIRECTION>
LUTHOR steps off the ladder, beams proudly at EVE.
</DIRECTION>
<LUTHOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At times like these you must experience a certain shudder of ecstasy just being in the same room with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHOR>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not like the kind of shudder you're going to feel when you try and lay that rock on him. He can spot you coming miles away with those super-peepers of his.

ANGLE ON CONCORDE - SUPERMAN'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The super-sonic Concorde airliner streaks through the sky below and just ahead of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ON CONCORDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PILOT is visible in the cockpit. He glances out the side, momentarily blinks in disbelief as SUPERMAN pulls up parallel to him. Suddenly realizing who it is, the PILOT grins, gives SUPERMAN a friendly salute which the Man of Steel returns. Then, accelerating, SUPERMAN passes the plane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKY NEAR U.S. COASTLINE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN nears the eastern coast of America, looks down, suddenly concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON OIL RIG - SUPERMAN'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An offshore oil rig, seen from the air. WORKERS scramble about quickly in all directions as a black oil spill begins to appear around the rig, spreading rapidly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OIL RIG - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WORKERS run back and forth across the deck of the rig, looking over the side desperately. A loud alarm blares ominously. One WORKER yells up at another in the cab of the drilling rig.
</DIRECTION>
<WORKER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut it down! Shut it down!

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A blue streak knifes into the water next to them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER SHOT - CLOSE ON SUPERMAN AND DRILLING PIPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN shoots through the water with the same ease as he does though the air. He reaches the disconnected drilling pipe, which dances wildly around the open bit to the drilling hole from which oil now spews forth. Grabbing the pipe, he straightens it, then forces it back into the bit hole, securing it. SUPERMAN checks his work, heads up quickly for the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKY NEAR RIG - LOOKING DOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERMAN breaks the waterline, wheels in mid-air, blows hard across the surface with his super-breath. He forces the mass of heavy oil across the water and away from the rig, circling it as he goes, compressing it. Rising higher into the air, he trains his x-ray vision on the gooey oil clot. It turns white-hot, explodes, then completely disappears. A cheer is heard O.S. from the WORKERS on the rig.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON SUPERMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is about to start off again, then notices something wrong near the base of the rig.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BASE OF OIL RIG - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sea eagle is perched forlornly on one of the lower cross-struts of the rig. Its feathers are heavily matted with oil. Its body trembles, unable to fly. SUPERMAN lands next to it, slowly reaches out, meticulously starts to clean the feathers by blowing warmth into his hands and melting the coated-on oil with them. The process completed, SUPERMAN takes the bird in his hands, tosses it gently upwards. The sea eagle takes off, heading higher into the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKY - TOP OF CLOUD BANK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The eagle bursts through a white cloud bank up once more into the clean blue air. After a short moment SUPERMAN does likewise, trailing the bird. For a few moments we are privileged to witness this real beauty and poetry of flying as the eagle and SUPERMAN chase each other through the air doing banks, loops, and dives, swooping closely together like two beautiful fighter planes in tight formation. The unspoken ceremony over, they silently acknowledge each other, then head off in different directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A country landscape with a winding, undulating road. CAMERA PANS OFF a sign marked: DANFORTH MISSILE PROVING GROUNDS - 12 MILES to a rise in the road. Heading for it is a military convoy. Two jeeps of MP's are in front and one is behind - a huge bulldozer towing a flatbed truck bearing the enormous XK101 rocket. The large missile is covered by a thick, tied-down tarpaulin. The convoy rolls on, crossing the SCREEN from right to left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OTHER PART OF ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sleek car speeds quickly down another part of the road, heading across the SCREEN from left to right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SPEEDING CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA LOOKS OUT the windshield of the speeding car from the rear. To our amazement there is no DRIVER in the vehicle - no one at all, in fact. The riderless car continues to roar down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOTTOM RISE IN ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA CLOSE on an electronic guidance box being held by OTIS who tries to manipulate the speeding car, which is presently out of sight. A complicated tool belt is strapped around his waist. LUTHOR stands next to him, curiously dressed in an all-white outfit, looks at the box, alarmed at the signals it is giving off.
</DIRECTION>
<LUTHOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you 1ive.1n England, Otis?

LUTHOR snatches the box away angrily, adjusts it.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SPEEDING CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The drone car shifts over to the right of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO LUTHOR - ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUTHOR waits expectantly. From this ANGLE we can see EVE in the trees behind him. She is dressed in a hopelessly slinky and revealing outfit, adjust her makeup in a had mirror. LUTHOR turns to OTIS.
</DIRECTION>
<LUTHOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Otis! Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHOR>
<DIRECTION>
OTIS runs off through the brush and trees to the right. LUTHOR checks the box, looks over his shoulder at EVE.

LUTHOR looks up as the drone car speeds at him around a corner. He presses a button on the box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON DRONE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The drone car suddenly flips all by itself, rolls over and over, bursting into flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OTHER SIDE OF RISE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first jeep in the military convoy stops as the sound of the explosion echoes over the top of the rise. The alarmed OFFICER inside gestures the vehicle forward again. It reaches the top. The MP's look down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT SHOT - COMPASS DIAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OTIS puts back his screwdriver, takes out a small wrench, starts to adjust various needles from one set position to another training a flashlight on his arm from time to time where a set of numbers is printed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOTTOM OF RISE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MP's now surround the fallen EVE who is completely obscured from view. Only her legs stick out, twitching as a result of the over-attention being paid her.

<EVE_SVOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks a lot...fine now...Hey! What did You have for lunch, Ace!

LUTHOR drives, EVE next to him. OTIS leans in from the rear section, excited.
