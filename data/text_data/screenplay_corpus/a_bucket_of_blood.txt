INT JABBERJAW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cavernous CLUB is packed with a cross section of ARTISTS, POETS, ACTORS, MODELS, ROCKERS, GRUNGERS, PUNKS, ADDICTS, and other assorted characters, standing at the bar and seated at tables - bizarre PAINTINGS and SCULPTURES adorn the walls -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on a BOOM BOX on a stage - the tape rolls, and soon strange industrial music begins to blare from the box -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAXWELL, an eccentric - looking man with a goatee and various PIERCINGS on his face, stands on the stage in front of a microphone - an abstract PORTRAIT hangs on the wall behind him -
</DIRECTION>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will talk to you of art, for there is nothing else to talk about, for there is nothing else...life is nothing but homeless traveler on the RTD of art...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
We pull back to see PATRONS sitting at tables amid various sculptures, paintings, and displays of questionable artistic promise -
</DIRECTION>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Burn gas on the freeways, and whip your sour cream of circumstance...flip at your channels and plod at your monitors...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
Soon we see WALTER PAISLEY, a meek, unassuming bus boy, work his way around the tables, taking empty drinks, emptying ashtrays, all the time listening to the performer on stage -
</DIRECTION>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creation is, all else is not... what is not creation is meatless sausage, and rice cake, let it all crumble to feed the artist -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
Walter passes a table where an upscale ART DEALER with a ponytail interrupts his prospective client to answer his cellular phone -
</DIRECTION>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The artist is, all others are not, a canvas is a canvas or a painting, a rock is a rock or a statue, a sound is a sound or it is music, a preacher is a preacher or an artist -
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Walter passes ART, seated with two attractive women - he rolls himself a cigarette, nodding in approval to Maxwell -
</DIRECTION>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are John Joe Jake Jim Jerk, dead dead dead, they were not born before they were born, they were not born, where are Leonardo, Mozart, Shakespeare, alive alive alive, they were born -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
Walter continues to bus the room - he pauses to stop and listen to Maxwell - he then looks over a MAN'S shoulder - he is sketching - Walter observes the SKETCH -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV It is a fairly good sketch of the room -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LEONARD, the artsy manager of the club, notices Walter pausing to listen -
</DIRECTION>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring on the multitudes and the multitude of fishes - feed them that you will be satisfied, nourish the artist, stretch their skin upon an easel, crush their bones into a paste, so that he may mold them, let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark - that he might take you in his magic hands and wring from your marrow wonder - all that is comes through the eye of the artist -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
Walter moves on - sees an attractive woman, CARLA, who opens a MANILA ENVELOPE and removes some HEAD SHOTS of herself -
</DIRECTION>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The rest are blind fish, swimming in the cave of aloneness- swim on you mortal and muddling maddened souls - and dream, of one bright and sunny island - some artist will bait a hook, and let you bite upon it, bite hard, and die -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
Walter looks at Carla's picture -
</DIRECTION>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In his stomach, you will feed creation!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
Maxwell turns off the tape, and the audience applauds -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carla then looks up to see Walter looking at her picture - he awkwardly smiles at her and she smiles back -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard then approaches Walter -
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter, what are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just looking at Carla's picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I was uh, just looking...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well do some looking around the room. I see cups, ashtrays - let's go...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Walter slinks away - Leonard gets close to Carla, very close, all the time admiring her head shot -
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, your new head shot...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like it, very much...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have to be so cold to him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard smiles, and strokes Carla's hair -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter watches this, the turns and walks away -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the entrance of the club stands LOU, a man in a designer suit, no tie - he scans the room as Walter passes him -
</DIRECTION>
<LOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How ya doin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOU>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter slinks away, and Lou looks around some more -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Art sees Lou -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lou subtly gestures to Art and heads into the club -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Art gets up, addressing the two girls -
</DIRECTION>
<ART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ART>
<DIRECTION>
Art and Lou head toward the MEN'S ROOM -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Art and Lou check the stalls to see the room is empty -
</DIRECTION>
<ART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright we're clear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ART>
<LOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything new?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOU>
<ART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not really. One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ART>
<LOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is the manager cooperating?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOU>
<ART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ART>
<LOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright I got you, man. It's my turn for freak patrol.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOU>
<ART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ART>
<DIRECTION>
Art heads out, and Lou checks himself in the mirror -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT JABBERJAW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maxwell sits at a table with Carla, MAYOLIA, a skinny yet buxom woman, and CHARLIE, a long-haired hanger-on - Maxwell is looking at Carla's head shot -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, do you like it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
(bored)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's perfectly adequate, as far as those type of things go...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
Walter approaches, with a tray of glasses in his hand -
</DIRECTION>
<MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
(changing subject)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
(condescending)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I'm overjoyed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -"
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Carla looks at Walter -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's word for word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it? I've forgotten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<MAYOLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean you don't remember your own poem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOLIA>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I refuse to say anything twice - repetition is death!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you repeat something, you are reliving a moment, wasting it, looking at a shed skin - I only want new impression, new sensations -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I worked in one of them. Back in Alaska.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles meekly)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The people at the table look at Walter, then laugh cynically -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the background, Leonard glares at Walter -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter, Leonard's looking at you again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Walter grabs up a cup and saucer off the table, almost spilling the contents before heading off -
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That guy's a class-A cracker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter's got a clear mind. Probably something will enter it, feel lonely, and leave again...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone at the table laughs weakly -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At another table two eccentrically dressed ARTISTS, CUFF and LINK, talk to an upscale older couple - Cuff has a series of MATTED PHOTOGRAPHS in his hand -
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've heard you can find some cutting edge pieces here if you keep an eye out -
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_MAN>
<OLDER_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to find something for our den, something unusual -
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_WOMAN>
<CUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well maybe these works might interest you -
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUFF>
<DIRECTION>
Cuff shows the woman the photographs - she reacts to them with disdain -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV they are pictures of various ROAD KILLS - squirrels, skunks, possums -
</DIRECTION>
<CUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's our road kill series. I take the pictures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUFF>
<LINK>
<DIRECTION>
(proudly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do the research.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINK>
<DIRECTION>
The woman hands back the photographs -
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not quite what I was looking for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_WOMAN>
<OLDER_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, we're interested in something with some investment potential -
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_MAN>
<CUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, this is no supermarket, there are no aisles, it's all in the attitude -
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUFF>
<DIRECTION>
Walter approaches -
</DIRECTION>
<LINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah that's a dead soul way to look at it -
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINK>
<OLDER_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nonsense. We have developed many a rapport with struggling artists - we're very supportive -
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_WOMAN>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"All that is comes through the eye of the artist - the rest are blind fish, swimming in the cave of aloneness."
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
The four people stare at Walter -
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's very deep, and coming from a bus boy too -
	</DIALOGUE>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Feed them that you will be satisfied - the artist is, all others are not -"
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_WOMAN>
<OLDER_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where have I heard that before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_MAN>
<OLDER_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you a poet also?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_WOMAN>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh...no. No I'm not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<OLDER_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_MAN>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, uh, I'm...working, I've been working on something, it's not ready yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it, a crying clown?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUFF>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter must have bought himself some crayons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINK>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard approaches, looking exasperated -
</DIRECTION>
<CUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of here, man. We're negotiating a deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUFF>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am working on something! I'm going to show you soon!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard gets close to him -
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
(under his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're starting to try my patience!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Walter sheepishly heads off - the two artists laugh -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The older woman looks at Leonard -
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he, uh?...
	</DIALOGUE>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About to be out of a job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Walter returns to Maxwell's table, where Carla, Mayolia, and Charlie are still sitting - he gestures to some empty glasses -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you done with these?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, get rid of them...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
In the split second when no one is looking, Walter snatches up one of Carla's head shots, keeping it under his tray, as he cleans up the empty glasses -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO EXT JABBERJAW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter passes an alley where a group of THUGS hastily strips down a car parked on the street -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter walks the streets alone - soon he stops and looks ahead -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a PARKED CAR with the windows open - A COUPLE is making out in the front seat -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter smiles meekly -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soon the man in the car, a mean-looking character spots Walter - the two stop making out and the man stares at Walter -
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you looking at? You want to get shot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Walter's smile fades, and he stuffs his hands in his pockets, and heads down the street, alone, inadvertently bumping into some GARBAGE CANS -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT COURTYARD APARTMENTS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter unlocks a creaky iron gate covered with dead ivy -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Walter heads in, he runs into MRS. SWICKER, the landlady -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<MRS_SWICKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello Walter. I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_SWICKER>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, OK.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<MRS_SWICKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_SWICKER>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<MRS_SWICKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_SWICKER>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no, that's OK, I can fix myself something. Besides, I got something important to do...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter goes to unlock his door -
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_SWICKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh by the way did you happen to see Frankie out here, by any chance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_SWICKER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter thinks for a second -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, no, I didn't see him at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<MRS_SWICKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's got into that cat? Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_SWICKER>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	T-tell him that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<MRS_SWICKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you see him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_SWICKER>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK Mrs. Swicker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Swicker heads off -
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_SWICKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night Walter...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_SWICKER>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night, Mrs. Swicker -
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter opens his door and heads in -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter closes the door and turns on a LIGHT hanging over a kitchen TABLE - a CLOTH covers an object roughly the size of a bowling ball on the table -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He removes Carla's head shot, tucked inside his shirt, and places it on the table after looking at it for a beat -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter heads over to the STOVE, stopping to notice a freshly plastered area on the wall, a bag of PLASTER still on the ground -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter opens himself up a can of BEANS - he looks around and finds an old, dented metal POT, pouring the beans into the pot -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He throws the empty can in the direction of an overflowing GARBAGE CAN, lights the stove and puts the pot on the burner -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter then takes a seat at the table - he lifts the cloth, revealing a mound of CLAY -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cat meows in the distance as Walter looks at Carla's picture, appreciating her beauty -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I have my muse...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter then turns and begins to mold the clay -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO INT WALTER'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A half-hour later. Walter has attempted to sculpt a bust - he looks at Carla's picture, then back at his sculpture -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter's POV it is a badly sculpted HEAD, that not only looks nothing like Carla but has a hard time passing for anything human -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter looks at it, knowing that much work is needed on his creation -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs a blob of fresh clay from an adjacent pile and begins to form a nose - the cat meows again - Walter looks around -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frankie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter continues enthusiastically sculpting the blob of clay -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A canvas is a canvas or a painting. A rock is a rock or a statue...a sound is a sound or is music...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter looks at the sculpture -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter then attaches the nose - smoothing it on -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It looks RIDICULOUS, something out of grammar school art class - he's having difficulty forming anything that resembles a nose -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on...you're supposed to be a nose...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
The malformed face stares dumbly back at him as he fights to shape the nose -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cat meows again - Walter is getting increasingly frustrated - he backs up to look at the head -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN the photograph of Carla, over to the sculpture - one of the ears falls off -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter squints at the head, failing to convince himself it's looking better - frustrated, Walter yanks the nose off and grabs a little more clay -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why can't I make a nose!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
On the stove, the beans begin to boil -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter shapes the clay and sticks the nose back on, his tongue sticking out of his mouth as he fumbles with it -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nose has changed shape and juts perpendicularly off the head, resembling Pinocchio -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter begins to sculpt with increasing fury -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs up more clay, starts mushing the face -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soon the object begins to lose resemblance to anything close to a human head, or anything for that matter -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter stands up and backs up, looking at the sculpture - getting angry he begins to mush the sculpture -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No no no no -
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
The cat meows again, louder - Walter looks around, irritated - he begins to SQUASH the sculpture -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally losing his patience Walter kicks back the chair, grabs the clay head and HURLS it across the room -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clay hits the wall with a dull THUD, stays there for a beat, then falls to the ground -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter pushes back his hair with his hand - the cat meows -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beans begin to OVERFLOW on the stove - Walter runs toward the stove, smacking his head on the overhead light -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light swings back and forth as Walter rushes over to the pot, grabbing it hastily off the stove before SHRIEKING in pain and dropping the pot into the sink, splattering beans in all directions -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter clutches his hand in pain as the light swings, the cat meowing louder -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter begins to look around furiously -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frankie shut up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter then focuses his frustrated mind toward the direction of the patched up wall -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter gets closer -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears the meowing coming from inside the wall -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frankie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter puts his ear to the wall - he hears SCRATCHING noises -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter turns away from the wall -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe this!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling at the wall)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you get stuck in the wall!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
The meowing persists -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright alright - calm down, I'll get you out -
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter looks around, goes toward a drawer by the sink, and produces a long, narrow CARVING KNIFE - he heads back to the wall -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang tight Frankie, ol' Walter's gonna get you out...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter then feels the wall as if he does this type of thing professionally - when the determines the proper area of entry he carefully aims the knife and - WHAM! -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCREECH! Frankie makes a comical screech of pain which ends abruptly -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter FREEZES - his eyes wide open with panic - he stands back -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wall is silent -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frankie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Frankie how're ya doin' in there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
There is no response -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter begins to BEAT the wall, until the thin material begins to give way -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He RIPS a big chunk of the wall off, confirming the worst -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The knife IMPALED Frankie into a wooden stud in the wall - the cat is no more -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter pulls and tugs at the knife until it is freed from the wall - he gingerly cradles Frankie, still impaled by the knife -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have I done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter walks over to the kitchen table -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Frankie I'm so sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
He lowers the cat down -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor Mrs. Swicker...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She had a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter walks backward toward the kitchen, looking forlornly at the cat -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches for another can of beans, but his eyes focus on the clay head on the floor -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter picks up what used to be a head and sits back down at the kitchen table -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at Carla looking back at him from the picture - he then stares blankly ahead -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>

Silhouetted buildings in the early light -

Still dressed, Walter tosses and turns on his bed -

<DIRECTION>
MAXWELL(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nourish the artist, stretch their skin upon an easel, crush their bones into a paste, so that he may mold them, let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark - that he might take you in his magic hands and wring from your marrow wonder - all that is comes through the eye of the artist -
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Walter bolts upright, waking from his dream -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(beat, then almost imperceptibly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are the John Joe Jake Jim... Jerk...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter gets up out of bed - he heads toward the kitchen table -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at a now stiff Frankie -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAXWELL(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dead...dead...dead...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Walter stares at Frankie for a beat and turns off the overhead lamp - he then looks up, as if getting an idea -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over at the floor -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sees the BAG OF PLASTER -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter's feet are visible as he walks down the street - as we pan up, we see Walter cradling a PACKAGE wrapped in brown paper and string -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT JABBERJAW - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard stands very close to Carla, who is wearing tight, red velvet bell-bottoms - she flips through several canvases of SCRIBBLE PAINTINGS she has brought over -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm trying to find a style of my own. Do you really like them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Walter then approaches with his package -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carla sees him - so does Leonard -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi Walter...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing here so early?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I brought something, I wanted to show you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it, your laundry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about him...what have you got?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(enthusiastically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A thing I made.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter lowers it to the ground and undoes the string - he then opens the paper and reveals what he brought -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is FRANKIE, encased in plaster along with the knife -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter grins like a simpleton at his creation, but Carla is impressed -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Carla picks up the statue -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leonard...look at this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard puffs on his cigarette -
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd ya buy that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't buy it I made it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard takes another puff -
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
(incredulous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You...made that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said I did, didn't I!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's very good, Walter -
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what's it called?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Walter looks up at Leonard -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dead Cat!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dead Cat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well it sure looks dead enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Walter stands up -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to buy it, put it in the club?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to buy Dead Cat?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll scare people away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you feel it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard and Walter look at Carla -
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD_AND_WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(simultaneously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feel what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD_AND_WALTER>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you feel what it's giving off? It's...presence... come take a closer look...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard gets closer -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at the detail, it's so alive, and yet...so dead...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Carla turns the statue's face toward Leonard -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at the expression on its face...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Walter puffs his cigarette and stares at Walter -
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...why did you put a knife in it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got carried away, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard inspects the statue -
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty. How's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Beat, then to Carla)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I guess that means I'm an artist after all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles politely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe so...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't give up your day job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter heads off then turns and faces Leonard and Carla -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really like it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course...it's wonderful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can barely contain myself. Now chop chop!

</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Walter heads into the back -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT JABBERJAW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scene is happening, strange music plays in the background -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Art walks into the club - Walter passes him -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you see my cat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<ART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, is he lost?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ART>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I uh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter walks away -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the alcove sits Dead Cat - a young man wearing a beret and leather jacket inspects the work - he seems zonked out on some chemical - Walter approaches him -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like my cat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...it's like out there, you understand what I'm saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. You want to buy it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No man, I don't have the funds to be buying various pieces of artwork, you understand what I'm saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard approaches -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
The young man heads off - Walter faces Leonard -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People seem to like my cat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough already about it - get to work!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Walter heads off - Leonard lights a cigarette and looks at the sculpture -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter busses a table -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Walter, come here!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Walter heads over to a table - seated are Maxwell, Carla, Charlie, and another attractive blonde woman - Maxwell appears clearly intoxicated -
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congrats, Walter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter everyone's talking about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Maxwell turns and focuses on Walter -
</DIRECTION>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw your...cat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you like it Mister Brock?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call me...Maxwell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd ya do it Walter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I just got some plaster, and fixed it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Papier mache?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, no. Plaster.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie laughs - Maxwell stares at Walter, then staggers to his feet - looks at the room -
</DIRECTION>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Attention everyone! Everybody!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
Some people pay attention -
</DIRECTION>
<MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
(drunkenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you pass through these yellow portals I am sure you noticed on your right a small plaster figure, and assumed this transfixed effigy to be the work of a master sculptor. Indeed, so it is. And that bright, new creator is in our midst. He's none other than Walter Paisley, our very own bus boy, whose undiscovered hands of genius have been carrying away your empty cups of frustration!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
People look at Walter, who sheepishly accepts the praise -
</DIRECTION>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember him. His is the silent voice of creation. Within the dark rich soil of humility, he blossoms as the hope of our nearly sterile times.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie and Carla clap -
</DIRECTION>
<MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
(to Walter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring me a gimlet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
Maxwell sits back down -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter passes a table where Cuff, Link and Mayolia are sitting -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cuff stops him -
</DIRECTION>
<CUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey congrats on the cat Walter. I wonder where you got the idea of dead animals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUFF>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINK>
<CUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not only that, he copied us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUFF>
<MAYOLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh nonsense! Your works hit the viewer over the head. They're so...obvious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOLIA>
<DIRECTION>
Mayolia then looks up at Walter -
</DIRECTION>
<MAYOLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I get it Walter. I get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOLIA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you get?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<MAYOLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your work, the layers of irony.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOLIA>
<DIRECTION>
Just then several people approach Walter and begin asking him questions -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Art watches the commotion -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard also watches the commotion with a completely dumbfounded expression on his face -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Art dealers talk to Walter, as well as artists -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then Lou walks in, stands next to Art -
</DIRECTION>
<LOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOU>
<ART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ART>
<LOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did he do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOU>
<ART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He made a cat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ART>
<DIRECTION>
Lou looks at Art, who returns the stare -
</DIRECTION>
<ART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Outta plaster.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ART>
<DIRECTION>
Lou walks in -
</DIRECTION>
<LOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you later -
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOU>
<ART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Righto.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ART>
<DIRECTION>
Art leaves - Leonard looks at Walter -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter uncomfortably enjoys the attention -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then the old couple chimes in - the older man looks around -
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's my mocha latte double grande!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard drops his cigarette and crushes it with his foot - He heads over to Walter and escorts him away from the people - Walter accepts someone's BUSINESS CARD -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard takes him aside -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes they are, aren't they? Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I don't know -
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's Ok...you came in early.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have another cat!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A parakeet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard begins to lose his patience - he yanks the tray out of Walter's hand -
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK...good night Mr. De Santis!

<DIRECTION>
MAYOLIA(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait - Walter!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Walter begins to head out the door but is stopped by Mayolia - Walter turns around and faces her - she gets close -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello Mayolia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<MAYOLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOLIA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With Dead Cat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<MAYOLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With Dead Cat. Like a breath of fresh air. I could just - babble on about it for hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOLIA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Mayolia gives him "that" look -
</DIRECTION>
<MAYOLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I really could. I'm not just saying that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOLIA>
<DIRECTION>
Mayolia gets closer making her heaving cleavage more accessible to Walter's eyes -
</DIRECTION>
<MAYOLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's like...you've turned on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOLIA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	T-turned on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<MAYOLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to be warmed by it.

</MAYOLIA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's really nice of you Mayolia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<MAYOLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOLIA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't. I gotta go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Mayolia presses herself against Walter, who awkwardly reacts -
</DIRECTION>
<MAYOLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'll go home with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no, I couldn't do that. Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Art sits at a table, watching the encounter -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAYOLIA(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't there anything I can do for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Mayolia reaches out and touches Walter -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so Mayolia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<MAYOLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOLIA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to do anything!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<MAYOLIA>
<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then let me give you something then...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOLIA>
<DIRECTION>
Walter watches, perplexed, as Mayolia reaches into her cleavage -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lou watches the transaction carefully -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mayolia takes out a CAMEO NECKLACE, takes it off her neck -
</DIRECTION>
<MAYOLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe this will give you some inspiration, change your perception of reality...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOLIA>
<DIRECTION>
Mayolia looks around, and hands the necklace to Walter -
</DIRECTION>
<MAYOLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to have it. There's a little something for you in here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOLIA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<MAYOLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let it inspire you. Maybe it will let you think of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOLIA>
<DIRECTION>
She wraps Walter's hand around the necklace -
</DIRECTION>
<MAYOLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you have to go, go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOLIA>
<DIRECTION>
Walter backs out -
</DIRECTION>
<MAYOLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go and don't look back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Walter leaves -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lou waits for a beat, then gets up -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT JABBERJAW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter leaves the club, passing some incoming people -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he leaves, Lou exits the club -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He heads over to the payphone and picks up the receiver, about to make a call -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, he changes his mind - he hangs the receiver up, and decides instead to follow Walter -

INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter closes the door and turns on the overhead lamp - He looks at the medallion Mayolia gave him and places it on the table - he then picks it up again, inspects it -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He notices the medallion has a clasp -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT WALTER'S WINDOW - NIGHT

Lou is outside, watching Walter -

He then checks his .45 HANDGUN and stuff it back in his shoulder holster under his jacket -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter notices the medallion has a clasp - he pops it open and notices a twisted-off corner of a PLASTIC BAG containing a white powder inside - he opens the bag and smells the powder, no knowing what it is - he dabs his finger in it and puts it on his tongue, GRIMACING at the taste of the substance - he puts the open medallion down on the kitchen table -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT WALTER'S WINDOW - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Lou heads off -

Walter then picks up the picture of Carla, looks at it for a beat -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I love you too Carla...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter sighs, then heads over to his cabinets, opens them up -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A box of PANCAKE MIX is the only item -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter takes out the box and grabs a round, sharp-edged GRIDDLE out of the lower cabinets -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soon the door knocks - Walter walks over to the door carrying the griddle -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the door - Lou is standing there -

Walter watches Lou take a dab of the white powdery contents and put it on his tongue -

Lou SPRINGS for Walter -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAMMM! Walter SINKS the griddle into Lou's skull - Lou grunts and crashes to the floor -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter cringes back in terror - as he steps back we see the BLOODY EDGE of the griddle -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter staggers back, witnessing what he has done -

Soon there is a KNOCKING on his door -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.

Mrs. Swicker begins to snoop around the place -
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_SWICKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_SWICKER>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(wringing his hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker. Somebody's got to.

<DIRECTION>
(exasperated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter, you know what you need is a girl!

Mrs. Swicker continues to inspect the place, with Walter following close behind her -
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_SWICKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...

<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swicker!

Mrs. Swicker continues to look around the cluttered room -
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_SWICKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah I can see that! Look at this place!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_SWICKER>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment Lou's BLOODY ARM drops into view in the background, having been stuffed in a crawl space above the sink -
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_SWICKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's terrible! Why don't you ever clean it up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_SWICKER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter notices the arm as Mrs. Swicker directs her attention in the opposite direction, grabbing a sheet -
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_SWICKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And when did you change these sheets last! It looks like they're alive!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_SWICKER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter panics, and gently leads Mrs. Swicker to the door -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some friends later, and I have to take a shower!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<MRS_SWICKER>
	<DIALOGUE>

Walter shoves her out the door and closes it behind him -

<DIRECTION>
Pressing his back against the door he looks ahead -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood begins to trickle down Lou's arm -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter approaches the bloody arm, caught in a total panic -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood begins to drop on the floor -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter looks around frantically, and finds a big metal POT -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He places it under the dripping blood, lowering it to the ground -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He then steps back, listening to the rhythmic trickle of blood hitting the pot -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter staggers back, grabbing a sponge -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He heads over to a PUDDLE of smeared blood on the floor -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets on his knees and begins to wipe up the blood -
</DIRECTION>

Walter continues to mop up the stain -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't help it if I got scared. I didn't mean it!

Walter stops to listen to the trickling blood - something dawns on him -

</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said go home and make something Walter! Make another cat...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Walter looks down at the pot filling with blood -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I told him I didn't have another cat...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter then gets an idea, and looks up toward Lou's body -

He heads over to the alcove, something catches his eye -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is the Dead Cat sculpture -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard stops to look at it, laughing faintly to himself - he then picks it up and inspects it, shaking his head -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts it back, positioning it just so - as he turns his back the cat leans forward and crashes to the ground -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard turns around and sees what happened - he picks it up and examines it -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a FRACTURE in the plaster - Leonard runs his finger over it -

Carla looks at Walter -

<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, Mr. De Santis?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It proves I've underestimated Walter's ability. His work has hit a nerve in the collective zeitgeist of the art community. It has enormous realism - you can hardly tell it from the real thing!

Leonard gets close to Walter - puts his hand on his shoulder -

Leonard heads over to the other end of the club -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PLUMP MAN enters the club, looking around -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spots Leonard, and makes his way toward him -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard takes a deep breath - the plump man approaches -
</DIRECTION>
<PLUMP_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...

</PLUMP_MAN>
<LEONARD>

</LEONARD>
<PLUMP_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded. I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLUMP_MAN>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't talk right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<PLUMP_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want for it? Two thousand? Three thousand?
	</DIALOGUE>

<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...look I'm busy...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<PLUMP_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something. This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands. Are you listening to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLUMP_MAN>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't you see I'm busy here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>

The plump man reaches inside his jacket -
</DIRECTION>
<PLUMP_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright you want to play hard... to insure I get that cat I'll give you five thousand dollars - cash, right here, right now...
	</DIALOGUE>

The plump man pulls an envelope out of his jacket - this gets Leonard's attention -
</DIRECTION>
<PLUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two thousand for the cat, and a first look at the kid's next stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>

Leonard looks at the plump man -

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lieutenant Beldere.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard hangs up and faces the plump man -

<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone has the cat just now but I'll have him back in a few days.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you can have it for five thousand dollars.

<DIRECTION>
The plump man breaks into a smile, pats Leonard on the arm and shakes his hand -
</DIRECTION>
<PLUMP_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright...thank you sir, I consider it a bargain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLUMP_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The plump man gives Leonard his card, and heads out -
</DIRECTION>
<PLUMP_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call me when you're ready... good night.

</PLUMP_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard watches him leave - Leonard takes a deep breath as carla approaches him -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you feeling better Leonard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard looks at her -
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes. I want to get a look at Murdered Man. Do you want to come along?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard looks at her for a beat, then nods -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Onstage, the industrial musician finishes up his song, and the crowd applauds - DISSOLVE TO INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and Walter walks in, followed by Carla and Leonard -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter turns on the overhead lamp - Int the center of the room is a TALL OBJECT covered by a sheet - Leonard closes the door behind him -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carla looks at the object -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at the size of it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can do anything you want if you set your mind to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard leans back against the door and swallows -
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's hot in here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to open a window or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on Walter, take off the sheet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Walter obliges, pulling down the sheet to reveal his creation -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is LOU, standing upright and looking down at the three spectators - his skull is CLEAVED right down the middle from the top of his head to the bridge of his nose -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard and Carla stare in dumbstruck silence -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter looks at their expressions, clutching the sheet -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you like it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Carla continues to stare for a beat -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a masterpiece. I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Carla walks around the statue -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it in...in it's eloquence... modern man in all his...self pity...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard drops down onto a hardwood chair -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Carla looks back at Leonard, who has an ashen look on his face -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing...nothing at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't ask.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh come on! Even you can see its value.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
The head stares back at the two -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think you or I could have conceived of such a thing, much less have executed it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard says nothing -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I admit it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Walter heads over to Leonard -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can bring it down to the Jabberjaw.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard gets up -
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Why don't you cover it up Walter...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you cover it up, Walter!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Walter throws the sheet back over the sculpture -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I've been thinking...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had. It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dead wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. We should build a collection first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard backs up, looking at the two of them -
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it...that's the idea! Maybe when it's big enough we can have a show!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Walter rushes over to Leonard -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A show?! Like this Sunday?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	N-no! Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard looks at the sculpture, composing himself -
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It will take years to make that many statues.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But your work would be featured.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the idea, Walter. It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah then you could unload - sell this stuff for a lot more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A show..how soon can we go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard heads over to Carla -
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Abstract? With his talent for realism?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look you said I was a genius! If I'm a genius I don't want to be a bus boy anymore!
	</DIALOGUE>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well maybe you have a point there, you shouldn't keep working at the Jabberjaw. Look...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard digs into his pocket and peels off TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS -
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now look - Dead Cat's money in the bank, I'm sure that man's going to buy it, so here's your half in advance - twenty five dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard hands the money to an ecstatic Walter -
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if you need more, I've got it, don't worry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have faith in you Walter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Walter heads over to Carla holding up the money and smiling like a simpleton -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you're a professional!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard heads over to the door and opens it -
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Carla gives a look of attraction to Walter and heads toward the door -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night, Walter. And keep up the good work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Walter smiles at her as Leonard gently takes her arm -
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But don't burn yourself out, Walter. You've got all the time in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard pulls Carla into the courtyard -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter heads over to the door -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter closes the door and gazes at the money again - he is truly thrilled, and begins to JUMP around the room, HOOTING and HOLLERING -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Swicker walks by Walter's door, overhearing him carrying on -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Swicker opens the door watching Walter jumping around -
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_SWICKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_SWICKER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter SPINS around and stops jumping - he runs over to Mrs. Swicker holding the money -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm an artist Mrs. Swicker! A professional artist!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter YANKS the sheet off the statue -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Swicker stares at the apparition, looking as if she's about to lose her lunch -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gently back up into the hall -
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_SWICKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_SWICKER>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Swicker closes the door abruptly -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter turns around, and gleefully continues to stare at the money - DISSOLVE TO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT JABBERJAW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another busy night at the club - a DJ spins a hybrid assortment of records resulting in a most irritating sound -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard sits close to Carla, smoking, as she nurses a glass of wine -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Art arrives again, looking around the room -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He passes Maxwell, who sits at a table with Mayolia, Charlie, and an attractive blond girl - once again, Maxwell is somewhat intoxicated -
</DIRECTION>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of the greatest advantages to modern poetry is the overload of sensations from which to draw, everywhere in our minute lives, our TV's and our information traffic jam! The goal is to filter those sensations to articulate our awareness! And I'm proud to say my poetry is understood only by that small minority which is...aware!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<ATTRACTIVE_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aware of what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATTRACTIVE_GIRL>
<MAYOLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not of anything stupid! Just aware!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOLIA>
<DIRECTION>
Art passes Cuff and Link, sitting at a table smoking cigarettes -
</DIRECTION>
<CUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's that weird dude again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUFF>
<LINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man if this place doesn't cool out I'm gonna hang out somewhere else...
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The singer continues to sing his song - Link then sees something -
</DIRECTION>
<LINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get a load of this -
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINK>
<DIRECTION>
Then Walter walks through the front door - his look has changed considerably - he's dressed like an eccentric artist, wearing unusual clothes, and looking somewhat ridiculous - he strides into the club -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People notice him and greet him as he nods to various people -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A couple points, and talks about him -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He passes Leonard and Carla - Leonard does a double-take -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi Walter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carla...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter sits down at a table next to Leonard and Carla - a waiter approaches -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have a Taft's-Sorrel mineral water, a piece of papaya cheese cake, and, and a grande cappuccino.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter lights up a small CIGAR, looking at Carla confidently - a piece of TOBACCO gets stuck on his lip, which he has to spit off -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maxwell approaches Walter's table and extends his hand -
</DIRECTION>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
Walter shakes his hand -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maxwell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
Maxwell sits down -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I am starting to have some success now, with my pieces...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Cuff and Link witness the encounter -
</DIRECTION>
<CUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man look at that get up !
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUFF>
<LINK>
	<DIALOGUE>

<CUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>

</CUFF>
<DIRECTION>
Cuff gets up -
</DIRECTION>
<LINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINK>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard stands and addresses Maxwell and Walter -
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just suggesting to Walter that he experiment with more abstract themes.

Walter then POUNCES on the man, choking him -

Carla suddenly feels very awkward - she takes a deep breath and prepares for the rejection -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter, I really do like you. And I did kiss you. But... that was because of your work.
	</DIALOGUE>

Walter listens intently to every word -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's more to being in love than just that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Carla gives a sympathetic look to Walter - Walter doesn't react for a beat, as if putting two and two together -

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hoi polloi of the art community mingle at the private party -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On display are Walter's creations - Dead Cat, Murdered Man, Strangled Girl and his bust of the carpenter's head -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People talk about the works in muted voices, as if they are serious works of art -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Art, the undercover cop, is also there, eyeing the room -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maxwell takes an hors d'oeurve off a passing tray, and nods to someone offscreen -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter sits alone, dejected - a waitress presents him with a tray of champagne glasses -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter looks up at the tray -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
The waitress walks away -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The plump man talks to an ART CRITIC -
</DIRECTION>
<CRITIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have many artists about but no craftsmen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRITIC>
<DIRECTION>
The critic gestures to the voluptuous figure of Strangled Girl -

<CRITIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This man knows his anatomy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PLUMP_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd give five thousand for this.

<CRITIC>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CRITIC>
<DIRECTION>
The critic and the plump man laugh -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maxwell swaggers over to Walter, putting his empty glass of champagne on a passing tray and grabbing up another -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his hand on Walter's shoulder -
</DIRECTION>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's the problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXWELL>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard watches them from across the room -
</DIRECTION>
<MAXWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why on Earth should you be so depressed? Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
He gets up and heads over to her -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carla glares back at him - Walter looks at her with a strange gaze in his eyes -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry about what I said before.

</CARLA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>

<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you really like to? That would make me very happy.

</CARLA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>

<CUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess we're not good enough to get a private show.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right! And we're not open for business! This is an art exhibit! No bums!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUFF>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard pushes them out the door as Cuff grabs his cigarette back -
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, you're the worst.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah right right - goodbye!

Leonard closes the door behind them -

<DIRECTION>
Carla is looking at the collection - she inspects Dead Cat, the carpenter's head -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She then approaches Strangled Girl - She smiles, drinking in the sculpture -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she sees something that troubles her -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh - oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
She looks closely at one of the hands - a FRACTURE has formed on one of her fingers -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carla gently goes to touch it when the piece CRACKS OFF -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carla picks up the piece and goes to put it back -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees a HUMAN FINGER protruding from the sculpture -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carla stands back, in shock -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around the room - soon shock turns to horror -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She makes a bee-line for the front door but is stopped by Walter -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going Carla? Whatsamatter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Carla is mute with terror for a beat, but manages to get out the words -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter...there's...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>

</WALTER>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Walter smiles innocently -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's Alice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Carla is speechless -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's alright, Carla.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maxwell said it's alright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter takes a few steps closer -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let them become clay in his hands so that he might mold them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Carla is clearly frightened -
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter...stay away from me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you see Carla? I made them immortal.

Walter takes a few steps closer -
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you see? I can do the same for you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Carla waits for a second, then SHOVES Walter out of the way, fleeing out the door -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter looks around to see if anyone is looking -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nobody is -

</CRITIC>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My Heavens! It looks...like a real finger.

<CRITIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's unparalleled...reality cased in layers...concealed in a shield of whiteness, blankness...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRITIC>

Art scrutinizes the finger - several other people begin to approach, admiring the discovery -
</DIRECTION>
<ART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...that's reality alright -
	</DIALOGUE>
</ART>
<DIRECTION>
Art does not like what he sees -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Art heads over to murdered man -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He inspects the hand - sees a RING shape on one of the fingers -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A horrible realization forms in Art's mind - he grabs a BUTTER KNIFE off a table and begins to chip away at the hand -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maxwell sees this, begins to stumble over to it -
</DIRECTION>
