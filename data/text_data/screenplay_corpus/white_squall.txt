CREDITS OVER

<DIRECTION>
Wind on the water. Soaring gulls and sand pipers glide over the pilings and sagging bulkheads.

	Though I hadn't seen or spoken to Sheldrake in over thirty years, it seemed impossible that his heart was the thing that had finally failed him...

INT. LATE MODEL CAR - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHUCK GIEG, 49, thin, windswept and handsome, is behind the wheel. He pulls down a narrow cobble stone street that leads to the wharf.
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_CHUCK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never got close to him, nobody did. But by the time we made Tampa, I was sure I knew who he was, that I understood what he saw, what nourished his soul and tested his faith...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_CHUCK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHARF - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck stares out across the harbor. In the distance, the echoes of singing masts. Shrouds and canvas softly ping. The small boats of Mystic tug restlessly at their moorings.
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_CHUCK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He had taken us to worship, where, what was for him, the holiest of holies. And, for us too by the end...

<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOCTORS OFFICE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck stands silently on the periphery of a gathering of people. They surround a small building, a neighborhood clinic. A worn gray stone, long in the earth, dedicates the structure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN MEMORY OF NATALIE "ALICE" SHELDRAKE M.D., CAPTAIN'S WIFE AND SHIP'S SURGEON OF THE BRIGANTINE ALBATROSS - MAY 2, 1961.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next to the stone a funeral urn. A YOUNG MINISTER gropes for meaning.
</DIRECTION>
<MINISTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know Richard Sheldrake personally, but his many friends who knew and worked with him, wanted to make sure that he was returned home, here, to be remembered with his beloved wife...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINISTER>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck gazes out at the sleepy harbor, the minister's voice fading away. The afternoon wind is coming up with the tide. He quietly heads towards the water. Drifting, drawn, lost.
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_CHUCK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Though he had moved on with his life, now even for the years, to hear him eulogized by strangers, seemed strange. He had been a hewner of stones, a pilot by the silent stars. Like me, alone among many. But most of all for us, the crew of the brigantine Albatross, he was always and would forever be... our Skipper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_CHUCK>
<DIRECTION>
A SHIP'S BELL turns him around. Ding ding. Ding ding. A beautiful three masted schooner steady on the water slips into port. A picture out of another time, another place. It takes him away...

EXT. FOREST - WATER TOWER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A towering monolith, surrounded by tall oaks and sycamores. The tower is immense. A single ladder runs up to the top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE TOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just above the tree tops, the view is spectacular. CHUCK GIEG, 16, sits thin and unsteady. Chuck's gaze is drawn upward -- to the building spring cumulus clouds. Chuck's older brother WILL, 18, stout, self assured, pulls himself to the top.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gonna jump? Or are you just having a last look?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCK>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not a vacation, it's private school.

</CHUCK>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought this was your dream come true.

</WILL>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not why he's sending me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCK>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it looks good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCK>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck looks out, yearning. Will considers him, troubled.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just not like you. Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale. I'm never going to be "William".
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCK>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody says you have to be like me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He does.

</CHUCK>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't give him enough credit Chas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck takes a last look at the building clouds. The sky rumbles. Distant thunder.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We better go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>

EXT. GIEG HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maple street, USA, tree lined and quaint. The Gieg home is a modest two story house with a covered porch. The family station wagon is poised for departure. CHARLES, 45, a generally serious man broods as MIDDY, their mother, 40, soft and thoughtful, exits the house. Chuck and Will appear from the woods.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Will shoves out a hand at Chuck.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And lighten up will ya.

</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck hugs him anyway and walks to the passenger side. Charles tosses him the keys, like he's doing him a big favor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck sits in the drivers seat. Middy is in the back. Charles slams the trunk and gets in. Before Chuck turns the ignition...

Chuck reacts.

The Giegs drive in silence. Middy reads from a brochure.
</DIRECTION>
<MIDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIDDY>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I didn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCK>
<MIDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine. I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIDDY>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCK>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Appearances aren't everything. Keep your mind on the road.

Chuck pulls over to the side of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck hands him the keys.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't feel like driving. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCK>
<DIRECTION>
Charles regards him oddly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIRPORT GATE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The National Airlines Boeing 707 is bigger than anything Chuck has ever seen. Passengers begin boarding. Charles stands away, detached.
</DIRECTION>
<MIDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have your ticket?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIDDY>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCK>
<DIRECTION>
Charles extends his hand. They shake. Then Chuck hurries away into the crowd. Charles and Middy watch until he is out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PLANE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck settles into his seat next to the window. He watches as the world slips away beneath the wings of the 707.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIRPORT CUSTOMS - BERMUDA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another world. Chuck stands in line at the customs booth. He cranes his neck to see the brilliant blue water and coral reefs beyond the runway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three other boys are ahead of him in line. The CUSTOMS AGENTS go through every piece of luggage. TOD JOHNSTONE, 16, thin and blonde, is in a heated argument with one of the agents about his spear gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RICK MARCH, 17, wise-cracking and confident, shakes his head, smiling. He spots Chuck, moves through the line and shoves out a hand.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Albatross?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gieg, Chuck.

</CHUCK>

	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCK>
<DIRECTION>
One of the agent starts pulling things out of Rick's duffel bag. He finds a dive knife.

	Hey, hey!! That's my stuff!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AUSTIN CAB - MOVING - DAY

The car whizzes through the narrow streets of Bermuda. CALYPSO MUSIC sings from the radio. The streets are lined with small coral houses and exotic palms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys are jammed inside with their things. In addition to Chuck, Rick and Tod, is CHARLIE STRATTON, also sixteen.
</DIRECTION>
<TOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well Ricky boy, spear gun or no, it's sweet to be back in the world of rum and honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOD>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta admit I never thought you'd be back after the great "Bowsprit Affair".
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<TOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me and Skipper had a meeting of the minds.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCK>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<TOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not just any 'local' girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOD>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The 'local' mayor's 'local' daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Tod smiles, reminiscing.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thing is, the net in the basket isn't very comfortable, so Tod-o wraps them up in the jib. After the deed was done...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says they did the deed...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<TOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trust me, we did the deed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOD>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After the "alleged" deed was done, they fell asleep. Big Daddy Lawford comes on deck at four bells and hears Casanova sawing logs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<TOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believe me, I needed the rest...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOD>
<CHARLIE>

	He gets the whole crew on deck, gets us on the halyard, and orders the old "heave ho...".
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up goes the jib and out roll Tod-o and the mayor's daughter, naked as pilot whales...
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know who was more surprised, you or Big Daddy.

	To tell you the truth, I think it was her father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOD>
<DIRECTION>
At the top of a hill, the harbor comes into view.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well gentlemen, there she is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
The cab stops. Besides many colorful fishing boats, is the ALBATROSS. At ninety-two feet, she dwarfs everything in the harbor. Her white hull glows like ivory and her twin masts and yard arms tower above her deck. Breathtaking.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Home sweet hell on the water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys pile out of the taxi. What seemed like a pristine ship from the hill looks like a rust bucket up close. The white paint is streaked and barnacles cover the hull. Looks of disappointment.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCK>
<DIRECTION>
A voice from behind turns Chuck.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She cleans up. We'll have her ship shape before we shove off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
This is BILL BUTLER, 15, removed, the youngest of the crew and... first mate. Bill gives Chuck a friendly slap on the back and climbs aboard. He is greeted by a Viking giant of a man, LAWFORD, 37, and bearded, the ship's English professor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Puffing on a huge Havana cigar, he stares coolly down at Tod and the others. He speaks with the voice of Moses.
</DIRECTION>
<LAWFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"That this same child of honor and renown, This gallant Hotspur, this all praised knight, And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet. For every honor sitting on his helm, Would they were multitudes, and on my head. My shames redoubled! For the time will come...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck feels something and looks up where he meets the intense stare of a man standing between the deck cabins. Their eyes lock.
</DIRECTION>
<LAWFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... That I shall make this northern youth exchange, his glorious deeds for my indignities."
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Then, the man is gone. Haunting. Only Chuck has seen him. Tod smiles back at Lawford impishly.
</DIRECTION>
<TOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you be addressing me, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOD>
<LAWFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would.

Lawford sneers and walks away. It's all a show.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It means Shakespeare. B-o-r-i-n-g.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It means if he catches anybody basket-napping on watch this passage, he's gonna use their lizard for 'cuda' bait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(lightly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well that's a hell of a how-do-you- do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop your gear, go below and pick yourself some bunks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck and the others climb aboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN CABIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck makes his way down the companionway into the main cabin. Other crew members are already unpacking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sleeping arrangement is Pullman-style with two rows of bunks on each side of the cabin. In the middle of the room is a gimbaled table. This is where the crew will eat and study.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen up. This is Chuck Gieg.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Among the crew -- feature ROBIN WEATHERS, 16, a cherub with soft puffy cheeks and TERRY LAPCHICK, 17, skinny and rodent-like.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robin approaches with a hand extended. He carries a 8x10 photo of a young man in a football uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Robin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck regards the photo.

<ROBIN>

(flat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my brother. He's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<DIRECTION>
Apprehensively Chuck shakes and retreats to a lower bunk. Robin tacks up the picture above his bunk. Terry unpacks in front of one of the lower berths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A loud "THUD!" turns everyone around. A duffel bag lies at the bottom of the companionway. A large imposing figure climbs into the cabin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is JOHN GOODALL, 17, over six feet, big and broad. His hair is slicked back "Dean" style and wears a full day's growth of bread on his face. Compared to the others, he looks all man. Everybody clears from his path. He stops in front of the lower, center bunk (Terry's bunk) and drops his bag.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take this one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You probably didn't notice, but this bunk has been taken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
John just glares at him, then dumps all of Terry's things onto the blanket on the bunk, gathers it up and tosses it into the remaining upper berth. Terry watches, intimidated.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anybody gotta problem with that?

<RICK>
<DIRECTION>

John climbs into his bunk and closes his eyes. Bill enters, followed by several adults.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DR. ALICE SHELDRAKE, 30, smart, attractive and tough, is ship's surgeon and Skipper's wife. Lawford appears with GEORGE PASCAL, 30's from Brazil, dark, and fit.

Lawford puts a hand on Bill's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<LAWFORD>

	Bill Butler is your first mate. But don't let his size fool you.

Bill gives a half reluctant wave.

</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Snickering.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe he's getting his wooden leg waxed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Laughter. A sound stops the laughter. Almost on cue, the sound of slow methodical footsteps, pace the deck above them. Then a shadow falls across the skylight, blocking the light. Ominous. They all notice and look up.
</DIRECTION>
<LAWFORD>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll meet him. Soon enough.

INT. MAIN CABIN - SUNRISE

Dawn glows orange in the skylights above the cabin. The only sound is the heavy, even breathing of slumber. Suddenly, a booming voice rumbles down the companionway.

	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWFORD>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What question?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck tries to assimilate Lawford's words. Robin swings his feet over the side of his bunk with a tortured look. John rolls over and pulls his pillow over his head.

<DIRECTION>
In crisply pressed shorts and shirt, Bill Butler steps through the aft bulkhead. He raises a bowswain's whistle and blows. OOOWWWEEEEOOO!!!! Chuck and Robin grab their ears. It's a nightmare. Terry jumps and hits his head again.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roll out sailors! All hands on deck! Sixty seconds. Sixty seconds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
He blows the whistle again. This time it brings even John to his feet, staring down at Bill in a blind rage. Bill looks up and casually notices him.

Rick is the first one through the gunnel door, followed by Tod and Charlie. They howl and scream as they hit the water. The rest follow like lemmings. But John stands defiantly with his arms folded.

<BILL>

	Now what's the problem, Goodall? Everybody swims.

The crew are piling back on deck. George stands in the open galley door. The smell of fresh bacon is intoxicating.

George nods, wielding a butchers knife. The crew stand shivering, waiting on John.

<JOHN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gonna swim for your breakfast?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Bill gives John a long look then strips to his shorts, swings into the rigging and climbs up to the first yard arm. He looks down at the water some twenty-five feet below. It's a long way. Robin turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lawford booms in a voice that echoes across the harbor.

With that Bill leaps and hits the water with a huge KERSPLASH! He swims to the boarding ladder, pulls himself up and gets in John's face.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody swims. Now, I've been in twice. So I guess I'll be eating your breakfast too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
John considers him, then strips off his shirt. But instead of walking over to the gunnel door, he jumps into the ratlines, climbs to the foretop and looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He manages a thin smile then climbs to the second set of ratlines past the third yard and continues to the top yard arm -- the topgallant. It's a pissing contest and everybody knows it.

Robin refuses to watch. The others share a look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John makes his way along the foot ropes and stands at the end of the yard. He tosses a look towards Bill but with no way to back down, he launches into the air. Everyone gasps as he thunders through the air in a broad swan dive. Falling, falling, falling...

John hits the water like a bullet. The crew run to the side waiting for him to come up. Nothing. Finally, he breaks the surface. Easy. He climbs up waiting, somehow, to claim victory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, they all feel it. A presence. He has appeared silently on top of the Chart House, like a phantom gazing down at them, back lit by the sun the boys must squint to see him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RICHARD SHELDRAKE, (SKIPPER), ageless and windswept, casually reaches up to a block and tackle with one arm and glides to the deck. He is powerfully built and bronzed from the sea and sun. He carriers the burden of command like a cross. Soft-spoken and remote, he is a man to be reckoned with. The crew know they are in the presence of someone larger than life.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Skipper on deck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
The crew line up clumsily. Skipper has a gaze that blazes right through them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks out to sea. Searching, ominous. He waits until the silence is filled with everyone's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what's out there? Wind and wave and rain. Endless glassy pools that'll hold a sailing ship for weeks and then spit her out into the eye of the kind of hurricane. A blow that could knock the bridge off a battleship. Reefs and rocks and sandbars that'll tear the belly from her and enough fog and night to hide it all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIPPER>
<DIRECTION>
He spits into the water. The crew sheepishly throw glances to the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So look out there... and explain to me why any man in possession of any sense at all, would take on the sea with sail?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIPPER>
<DIRECTION>
Skipper turns his gaze back to the boys. There is a fire in his eyes. Nobody dare answers.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because there's something else out there. It beckons in the wind and sings in the shrouds. Voices. Whispering...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIPPER>
<DIRECTION>
His ear to the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're voices of men. Calling. Men you don't even know. Men you can't even imagine. It's a seed, a wish, that part of you and I that aches to be alive, that was banished by everything we've ever been taught or told. It's a part of us that can only be found on mountain tops and deserts, in the deepest caverns, smoking battle fields and... across oceans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIPPER>

He turns back to the sea, dark.

	He was everything I had expected, part Ahab part Queeg and even Bligh. He spoke in whispers and answered all queries with efficiency and directness. He had gone to sea for the first time at fifteen, the same age as Bill Butler. And as he looked upon us that first day it must have been as though he were staring into a mirror.

Skipper manages a sobering look and climbs on top of the chart house. He pats a small brass sign that is welded to the main mast and reads the inscription.

Lawford coaches the boys, sending two scurrying on top the chart house to loosen the stops which hold the heavy furled canvas to the main boom. He guides another to the midships pinrail where the main halyard, which raises the huge sail, is made fast to a belaying pin. He loosens the halyard and hands it to Robin.

The newcomers watch Bill with new-found respect. George, John and the others climb to the forecourse, and out onto the footropes. It's unsteady work and there's confusion everywhere. But through it all, they continue to sing.

As the tops are released, the giant forecourse drapes into a scalloped pattern. As the bow falls off the wind the snapping main and jib billow. Stiffening to the wind, the ship heels and surges forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before her awakening power, everyone changes their stance and grabs for a handhold. Lawford slowly pays out the mainsheet while the forecourse crew move up the ratlines releasing the stops on the other squaresails.

Tod's group first uncleats the clewlines and buntlines and the great squaresail drops and billows to fullness sending a shudder through the rig. The bow's wake sizzles with the added surge. As each of the squares fall, Alice and Lawford move to their sheets, setting each sail's position.

As the sails billow the Albatross seems transformed. Everyone stops and looks up. The vessel heels and with a powerful surge, launches into the waves. White foam splashes over the bowsprit as the hull thunders through the water. Chuck's face is full of wonder. It is a magical moment. Then the crew begins to cheer.

EXT. THE OPEN SEA - LATER

<DIRECTION>
The bow of the Albatross explodes through the top of a fifteen foot swell. The sky is clear but the wind is fierce. In spite of the seas the ship is trimmed and sailing well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crew has never seen mountains of water like this. Disaster seems imminent. Bill has assembled them in front of the wheel house. They are all holding on for dear life. Even John seems shaken. Skipper magically stands effortlessly before them on the rolling deck. He remains perfectly dry.

He lunges at Skipper but Lawford one arms him.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellent point. As you might have noticed, being out here pretty much puts you in the moment. If you panic, if you lose your head, you die. Maybe you take your mates with you. How'd you like to have to bet on Terry here getting us home today? Each one of you is responsible for the rest. "Where we go one, we go all". If your buddy is asleep at the switch we're all fish food.

He's making his point which is lost on no one.

	The ship beneath you is not a toy and sailing is not a game. The Albatross will take us far gentlemen, but she demands constant attention. Respect her, and we'll do fine. Oh, and one more thing. There is nothing that goes on, on this boat that I don't know about. She speaks to me in the night. So don't test me. Not even a little.

FORETOP - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Skipper stands at the rail, looking out. The seas are up and the masts are pitching widely from side to side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck is high above the deck in the footropes, wrestling with one of the squaresails. The pitching mast catches him by surprise and he slips. He tumbles down, tangled in the lines. A rope wraps around his neck, choking him. Robin looks up and sees him hanging helplessly.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bill!! Skipper!!
	</DIALOGUE>

Robin freezes. Skipper leaps into the rigging like a spider and, in a few seconds, wrestles Chuck free and carries him down to the deck. Chuck coughs, catching his breath. The color is gone from Skipper's face. This was a close call.

Robin clutches the rung with a death grip. Then, he looks down. His bladder releases. Hot urine runs down his legs and splashes, steaming, onto the deck. The crew is horrified. Robin weeps.

EXT. FORETOP - SAME

Dark clouds blot out the sky and stars. Thunder rumbles far away. The seas have built but there's no wind... yet. With no steerage, the ship is tossed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tod hangs high above the heaving deck continuing to furl. The mast swings from side to side, but the air has gone dead calm. Skipper looks up, anticipating.

</SKIPPER>
<DIRECTION>
Bill joins Chuck and takes hold of the wheel. Then it hits.
</DIRECTION>

A wall of torrential rain drums the deck amid a tympany of thunder and flashing lightning. The bow explodes through twelve foot swells. This is what the Albatross was born to do.
</DIRECTION>

INT. MAIN CABIN - SAME

It's all the crew can do to stay in their bunks. Pots crash, books and personals go flying. The guys are scared.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The main and jib sheets tighten. Skipper looks at Chuck and Bill. It all comes down to moments like these and he loves it.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOW - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shredded jib and rigging whip violently in the wind. The block smashes into the gunnel rail, shattering it. No one dares go near it. For a moment, it seems to hang there seductively. John, naive of its power, leaps for the rail and grabs it.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NOOO!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>

Suddenly, the wind cracks the sail instantly hurling John high off the deck and over the side. He holds on for dear life, screaming.

Skipper joins Tod as Alice scrambles along the deck and pulls herself into the bowsprit netting. When the block and jib swing inboard, she grabs for the leach of the sail yelling...
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NOW!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
As John is snapped inboard Alice leaps up, grabbing the sail, leaning out over the open water. Waves explode through the netting. As Tod releases the halyard, John falls to the deck, bruised, humbled, but alive. Lawford and Skipper pull Alice from the bowsprit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Skipper looks her over. Relieved. No broken bones. Good work. But then this is what he expects. He respects her and now, everyone can see why. He looks at John sprawled on the deck.

	The storm lasted sixteen hours and it set us all on equal footing. It was the first time that we shared an episode on an even plane. As we stood our watches we were equally out of control of our situation, regardless of our physical abilities or social backgrounds. And though our real feelings lay hidden beneath bravado and defiance, we were no longer strangers.

EXT. STERN - LATER

Chuck sits alone, away from the others, reading. On cue, half of the crew descend, dragging him kicking and screaming into the bowswain's chair, and over the side. The guys cheer.

Terry goes over the side. Once he gets the hang of it, he gets into it. He maneuvers the chair like a plane, forcing himself deep into the waves and then blasting back to the surface.

</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Skipper comes down to inspect the catch. The shark is longer than Terry is tall and thrashes in the the water, snapping and twisting. Terry stands shaking, freaked. All of them are.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn Terr, you're whiter than Sister Mary Anne's butt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
The guys laugh nervously. Terry just stares at the man eater, but it's infectious. After a moment he's laughing too. Skipper slaps him on the back with a wry smile.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, now you have something to write home about.

Everyone turns around to look. The guys at the stern let go of George and he nearly tumbles overboard. In that instant, the shark slips off of the gaff, and disappears back into the sea. Robin and George share a stunned look.

EXT. ALBATROSS - HARBOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boat moves off leaving the lights of Antigua behind. Chuck watches as the island disappears below the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DECK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind is up and the seas are high. The ship is under full sail driving at top speed. Foam sprays from the bow as it slices through the water -- what she was born to do. The crew line the starboard rail, thrilled to be part of the performance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tod is at the wheel with Chris nearby. The sails tower above him like a mountain of silk. He wrestles the wheel, careful to hold his course against the powerful trade winds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Skipper, making his rounds inspects the heading on the compass and nods.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a good sail boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIPPER>
<DIRECTION>
Tod and Chris beam. Compliments are rare from this man.
</DIRECTION>
<TOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, sir. Shall we trim the main Skipper? I think we could get another knot or two.
	</DIALOGUE>

Skipper turns and looks at Tod, a twinkle in his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>

Gravy. The two gloat as they lighten the mainsheet tackle. Phil joins them.

</PHIL>
<TOD>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</TOD>
<DIRECTION>
They laugh. Phil slinks behind the chart house, hurt, and angry. He spots a spear gun stowed against the chart house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Tod and Chris pull in the main, it strains and stretches against the powerful wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phil aims the spear gun at the mainsail from behind the chart house and silently fires. There is a wicked POP as the spear punctures the sail, passing through it, followed by a loud shredding as the huge sail splits.
</DIRECTION>
<TOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ!! Let it out. Let it out!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOD>

The sound brings Skipper onto the deck like a shot.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hard to port! Hard to port!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIPPER>
<DIRECTION>
Calamity, as Tod cranks the ship into the wind. The canvas goes limp as the ship hauls to a dead stop. People dive everywhere to drop sail.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Start the engine. All ahead full!! Scallop the Square and drop the rest!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIPPER>
<DIRECTION>
He shoots a glare at Tod and Chris.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what happened Skipper. It just blew out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOD>
<DIRECTION>
Skipper turns to the task at hand without a word. What had been praise is now reduced to embarrassment and confusion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phil, still hidden behind the chart house returns the spear gun and smiles to himself at Tod's arrogance turned humility.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DECK - TOBAGO CAYS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Albatross has dropped anchor along a remote group of flat, lush atolls. Tall palm trees grow almost to the waters edge. The crew have the mainsail down and Alice supervises the repair of the sail. Phil sits above it all sunning himself in the bowswain's chair.

George is asleep with a book in his lap. Mike and Chris slip inside. The door squeaks, George stirs. Mike opens a cabinet and removes a fifth of rum.

Silently, Mike passes the bottle to Chris who passes it to Tod who passes it to Charlie who drops it down to Robin who stands in the lowered dory with Chuck.

John out of control pounding Phil's head against the seat of the boat.

Skipper, Alice and Bill watch the shoreline as the boys launch the long boat into the surf. George is struggling. A beautiful tarpon leaps out of the water, but Skipper never takes his eyes off of his boys.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The thing about fishing George, is you need to let 'em run some. Give 'em just enough slack so they don't break the line. But at the same time you've gotta keep enough tension to wear 'em down, bring 'em in slowly so they don't really know they're hooked.

Hound dog and hung over, bloodied and burned, the boys stand before Skipper and the others. Skipper looks dark and angry.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what a loose cannon is? 'Bout the worst thing that could happen to a wooden ship. All it took was one, crashing around the deck in a storm... It'd smash everything in its way, maybe take out a mast or punch a hole right through the hull. Think about it, just one cannon not tied down, not anchored, could take a whole 'Man of War' straight to the bottom.

Skipper turns and faces them.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, if the Skipper were smart, if he could see a storm building, why he'd cut loose every gun on his boat. Even though it would leave him at a disadvantage in battle, he'd push 'em into the sea. Better chance running for port than risk the entire ship, his crew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIPPER>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a pause making sure he has their attention for this part.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People are like that sometimes. They cut loose and before you know it, they're knocking holes in everything. So you gotta ask yourself if it might not be better to just put 'em off before they sink the whole thing. I mean after all, you can always get new cannons.
	</DIALOGUE>

He walks back to his place at the rail.

	Wanna bet? Takes me half a day to get through one chapter of Lawford and I still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about. You know why it takes me so long to write papers? because I can't spell. While everybody else is sleeping, I'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary.

<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeeee Haaaaa!!

He turns and joins Peggy on the dock. Phil is suddenly full of rage. This is an invasion of his privacy. Everyone feels it.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hop to boy. We haven't got all day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCIS>
<DIRECTION>
Phil's anger turns to resigned humiliation. He stops, staring down at his parents. Skipper puts a hand on his shoulder.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Curacao seemed out of a dream, somehow make-believe. But, as Ohio drew further and further away, it was home that began to seem unreal, drifting somewhere in the foggy reaches of our memories. And I knew that each of us was falling in love. But not only with these wonderful women or the swaying palms and porcelain beaches... We were falling in love with the experience we were sharing, and with who we were becoming.

</SKIPPER>

She's sixteen again. There's something about him that still makes her blush.

</CHUCK>
<DIRECTION>
Bregitta smiles and takes Chuck's hand. He's nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not the best at expressing myself. Maybe the only reason I can now is because I know you don't understand me.

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like you so much. Too much. But how could I? I mean, if we can't even communicate, how could I know you? It's confusing. We sail in an hour and I'll never see you again.

The ship is under full-sail driving before a brisk following wind. It takes two on the helm to keep her safely on course. Those not on watch are sprawled about the boat, scraping and 'red-leading' or reading. Chuck and Robin sit forward with John, studying. Lawford paces the deck, chiding the crew.

Everyone rushes to see. Dolphins leaping out of the water. It's a magnificent game they play with ships. The crew cheers as each one explodes out of the sea, close enough to touch.

Isolated, Phil watches. Angry, cut off. Chuck eyes him, worried.

Bill and Charlie rig the bowswain's chair and lower Rick into the water. Suddenly, the dolphins are everywhere. Rick pets them as they swim back and forth. Shear joy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phil reaches for the spear gun. Nobody notices as he loads and takes aim.

Suddenly... with a crack, everyone spins around. A large female dolphin leaps out of the water, bloody foam spraying from her blow hole. She lets out an agonizing scream. Phil holds her fast.

Phil looks up at the crew but one by one they look away. Chuck finds this confusing and inexcusable but is the last to look away. Skipper grimly walks over to one of the deck lockers and pulls out a large wooden mallet and holds it out to Phil.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIPPER>

Phil backs away. Skipper stares at him for a moment, then walks over to the dolphin. Robin looks away. The sickening sound of the mallet crushing the skull of the animal seems to silence the world. There are one of two thumps of her tail and, it's over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Skipper tosses the bloody mallet into the locker and approaches Phil, his face flushed with anger. He grabs the spear gun, and snaps it across his knee and throws the pieces into the sea.

Robin holds his ears as if he can make it all go away. For a brief moment Phil looks as if he might take Skipper up on the challenge. Then the impulse passes.

INT. MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

The sounds of slumber fill the cabin. All seems well with the world. Suddenly, silhouettes in the darkness. A huge bearded figure stands in the center of the cabin with a trident in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck wakes with a start. He bolts upright to see the horrible figure of NEPTUNE himself (Lawford) towering before him. He tries to scream, but hands cover his mouth. He is dragged, struggling, up the companionway.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. DECK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Albatross has been transformed into a ghost ship. Where the sails once were, only shredded fabric. All of the crew have been brought on deck. Powdered faces glow, surreal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John's head has been shaved into a mohawk. Robin, Rick and Chris have been reduced to crew cuts. The shears start over Chuck's head. Neptune and his sidekick, DAVEY JONES (George) and two MERMAIDS (Bill and Alice) emerge with the rest of the crew.

Neptune and his court sit smoking Havana cigars as each member of the crew present themselves. Robin dressed like a pig and crawls around snorting.

John's an Indian brave, whooping and hollering as he does a rain dance. Chuck, with flippers on his hands and feet, hops around like a frog. Rick is in 'drag' as Neptune's girlfriend and must sing everything he says. Charlie is dressed like a sloth and slithers along the deck. Frenetic chaos.

	We had journeyed over six thousand miles to the very edge of the earth. Like Darwin before us, we would witness the bliss of nature in the absence of man. And it was as if the Albatross had forded time, leaving it behind. In the heat of those equatorial days, on the virgin onyx beaches and shifting coral dunes, one could expect to find sunning iguanas, nesting frigates and perchance... the footprints of God.

EXT. BEACH - SHIPWRECK BAY - DAY

The Albatross rests at anchor. On the beach, the crew watch a huge group of penguins dive and frolic from the ancient guano cliffs. So unaccustomed are these creatures to man, that they have no fear.

EXT. BLACK SAND BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lone wild goat grazes on the beach. It looks up, sensing something, unfamiliar, then, returns to it's grazing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tight. Thundering bare feet on the black sand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The goat looks up again, this time it sees five Homosapiens bearing down on him. They come naked, swinging their shredded clothing above their heads like lassos. Shouting, whooping, primal. The goat bolts for its life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pounding through the waterline like the wild horses of Sable, the hunters charge after the hunted, closing. The goat's eyes are full of a terror it has never known.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beach is broad and long with no cover. The hunters are gaining on the goat. Splashing feet pound closer...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly they are upon the goat. But, instead of attacking it, they just run through it, passing it. The goat pulls up and stops, breathless, watching the naked humans run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on the faces of brothers, matching each other, step for step. The music builds as we...

Wild eyes behind the charcoal painted masks of primal man. The rhythmic beat of sticks clacking and voices chanting. The heaping of driftwood into piles. Taught and powerful, the glistening bodies of young men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blue sparks leap from striking flint against stone. A flame is born. Voices howl in guttural triumph.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the flames leap and singe the darkness, silhouettes of men pound the sand and cry out in a ritualistic dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The goat watches from the shadows, bemused, as the dance builds to a frenzy. The night sky is filled with the building sound of raging fire, pounding surf and chanting voices.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALBATROSS - SAME

The wind carries the sounds of ceremony across the water. The flames from the beach reflect off of the water turning the white hull of the ship, a deep flickering orange. The word A-L-B-A-T-R-O-S-S has been spelled in huge flaming letters. Alice joins Skipper at his place by the rail watching.

Chuck feels the ship coming down on top of him but still finds Robin's arm. They clasp tightly, but Chuck just can't budge the door. Then, strangely, Robin releases Chuck's arm and pulls it back through the door. Chuck looks up, startled. The small round window in the door is illuminated from the cabin lights on the inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the glass, Chuck meets Robin's frightened eyes. He fights to stay in a shrinking air pocket. Robin takes a last gulp of air then, a calm comes over him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He meets Chuck's eyes again but this time with a strange acceptance. They both know what's happening. But Robin has refused to take his friend to the bottom with him. He presses his hand to the glass. Chuck does the same. Then with a smile, Robin pushes himself away from the door, disappearing into the darkness and eternity.

Chuck breaks the surface, gasping for air. He looks around, frantic. He sees nothing but the sea swells and debris. All that remains is the sound of the wind and rain on the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, beneath him, a massive rumbling and explosion of foam. Then, the tops of twin masts rise out of the water like shattered lances as the ship rights herself underwater. She holds herself steady for a moment as if in a final attempt at resurrection, the Albatross begins to rise. Faster and faster, until her entire length explodes out of the water in a mountain of foam and wave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE DECK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like Ahab before him, John appears, lashed in a web of tangled line still slashing to free the remaining long boat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And for a moment, it looks as if she might stay there, as if this were just a final surreal lesson of the sea. Some of the boys begin to cheer prematurely. But Skipper knows better. She's filled to the gills with sea water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She shutters. Then, like a stone, she just drops, sucked to the center of the earth, John's hands still slashing, as she finally goes.
</DIRECTION>

Survivors hanging onto the debris that floats in the watery tempest. Strangely, the wind subsides. The sea becomes calm and a stunned silence falls over those in the water.

There is an explosion of bubbles, and then she slips beneath the waves like a stone. The stunned crew can only watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, as if by magic, the second life boat erupts to the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Skipper fights off his emotions. He knows what it means. John died cutting it free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terry and Bill hang onto a life ring. Blood runs from Bill's head. Charlie, Mike and several others hold onto the side of the other freed life boat which has been swamped. Lawford floats on his back, unconscious, but alive. Several of the boys help pull him towards the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Skipper swims to the second boat, desperately looking for those not accounted for. But, they are gone.

The crew stand by the bulkhead. Bill tosses down a newspaper. The headline reads: INVESTIGATION TO PROBE SCHOOL SHIP TRAGEDY.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So what are we supposed to do?

	Easy for you to say.

<TOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that supposed to mean?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOD>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody knows why she went over Tod. You jibed the boat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<TOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam. Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOD>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not what Skipper thought. He was trying to spill air from the main!

</TERRY>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was coming four points off the bow, Terry. He never could have gotten her around.
	</DIALOGUE>

</TERRY>
<TOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOD>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Tod lunges at Terry. Bill and Charlie pull them apart.
</DIRECTION>
<TOD>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was it my fault we were running all that sail?! Was it my fault she wasn't dogged down?!! HUH?!! I couldn't help that the ballast shifted...! You son of a bitch!! It wasn't my fault!! it wasn't.

Tod breaks down, sodding on his knees.

Terry drags on a cigarette, then grinds out the butt.

	Then whose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Tod looks up along with Bill and Charlie, all confused.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After the lightning strike, we tried to go aloft to drop sail. We'd done it a thousand times. We didn't have to wait for an order. But Skipper called us down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If the foremast had taken a strike, everyone in the rigging would've been fried. What would you have done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We would have scalloped the squares from the deck. Right Bill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Bill turns and stares into the water, troubled.
</DIRECTION>
<TOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, that's right! Bleed the sails from the deck and she could've taken a hurricane!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOD>
<DIRECTION>
It's a strong argument. Even Charlie is troubled by the implication. There is a long moment of silence between them.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is crazy. Nothing could have prevented what happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCK>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys are missing the point. This is all because of Phil. Phil and his dear old dad.

</MIKE>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you think they got this together so fast? He's been laying for Skipper since the first day.

Chuck frowns, troubled.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You're wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCK>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm telling you, the only way to change this is to get Phil to call off his old man. And that ain't gonna happen. So the way I see it, it's Skipper or us.

The guys react. It's a no win situation.

He turns again and reaches for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCK>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck hands him something. Phil looks down, disbelieving. It's the ship's bell. Robin's bell. Their symbol of unity, of putting loyalty above fear.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We figured he'd have wanted you to have it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

He leaves Phil standing alone on the porch, full of emotion, trying to grasp it all.

INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small courtroom. The room is filled with the crew members and their families, including the parents of the victims, as well as the media. Phil sits with his father and dodges Chuck's eyes. Coast Guard Officers Tyler, DOWNING and SANDERS head the proceedings.

Bill sits at the table with his parents as questions are leveled at him. Chief petty officers Sanders and Downing ask most of the questions as Tyler oversees the proceedings.

<SANDERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you drop any sail?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDERS>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Skipper called us out of the rigging.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<SANDERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But your instinct was to lose sail?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDERS>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My instinct was to not get electrocuted.

</SANDERS>
<DIRECTION>
Phil doesn't look up and speaks in whispers.

<FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain Sheldrake exhibited an arrogant, controlling attitude in my presence on more than one occasion. I believe he had a personality conflict with my son from the start.

</FRANCIS>
<SANDERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you don't mind my asking, sir, why did you let your son stay?

Francis is stumped for a moment but recovers quickly.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.

Skipper looks over at Francis. Phil stares at the floor. Skipper manages an ironic smile.

	Yes, that's true.

He turns to sit down, then stops.

	Oh, one last thing... Isn't true that your father was a sea Captain?

Skipper bristles.

<SKIPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

	Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket? Lost everyone on board. In fair weather no less.

Skipper reaches for the door. Suddenly a sound stops him cold in his tracks. Phil slowly rises. Tears streaming down his face. Tightly in his hands he grips the ships bell. Ding ding. Ding ding. Ding ding. It is the ringing of the truth. The tolling of their unity.

Phil ignores him. Skipper slowly walks over, his eyes never leaving Phil's. He stops, facing him. He gently takes his hands and silences the bell. Then he smiles and puts a hand on the back of Phil's head fighting his own emotions. He turns to Chuck.

	If you want to judge this man, judge him by his crew. Judge him by Alice and George. Chris and John and Robin. In one way or another each one of them gave their lives saving one of us. This may sound crazy but the Albatross wasn't just a ship, or even a school. It was something that we made, that's inside us. That's who Skipper is. That's what he taught us. I guess what it really was about was... the privilege of sacrifice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCK>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck turns to Skipper.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't that right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCK>
<DIRECTION>
Skipper nods.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIPPER>
<DIRECTION>
The room is silent. Then, a voice. A golden tenor singing like the wind. Everyone turns. It's Bill.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When the sun came up, there was whisky in the cup, and not a one of us was sober...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
One by one the crew members stand and begin to sing. Chuck turns, surprised to see his father rise and stand with him. Words or not.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Jenny thought she saw a picture when it really was the sun, then we knew the party was over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREW_TOGETHER>
<DIRECTION>
They all stand facing Skipper and sing. The voices build, sweeping over everyone like a wave.
</DIRECTION>
<CREW_TOGETHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my heart is sad, for leaving you today, but I know we'll meet again, when the moon is in the valley and the leafs are on the trees, We will come to clearly in the glen...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREW_TOGETHER>
<DIRECTION>
Skipper meets Chuck's eyes and those of his mates. Only now is his job finished. He beams back. The music swells like an anthem, building, like a swell lifting a small wooden boat over a jagged reef, until it rests safely in the calm waters beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crew come together around Skipper one last time. They embrace.

EXT. MYSTIC SEAPORT - HARBOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Older Chuck has returned to the small building where the funeral services were held earlier. The people have gone but the funeral urn remains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PIER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck walks to the dock. He has the funeral urn in his hands. He steps aboard a small sailboat and begins untying her. The HARBOR MASTER notices and steps out of his office.
</DIRECTION>
<HARBOR_MASTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think you're doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARBOR_MASTER>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over to the dock.
</DIRECTION>
<HARBOR_MASTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right friend, out of the boat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARBOR_MASTER>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to board the boat but Chuck greets him with the sharp end of a gaffing hook.
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_CHUCK>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stand away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_CHUCK>
<DIRECTION>
He looks into Chuck's eyes and sees that he means business. He backs off. Chucks pushes away and raises the sail. The harbor master watches, perplexed as the small boat moves off for open water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OPEN SEA - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bathed in the orange glow of the sun, Chuck stands naked against the ivory sail.

	<DIALOGUE>
	They didn't take his ticket that day. But why he never returned to the sea, I'd never know. Perhaps he hadn't been able to free himself from the anchor of grief that had driven him to his knees aboard the Gran Rio, or that he no longer cared for the solitude and isolation of command without his Alice. Or maybe it was just that the waves that had spoken to him for so long, had grown silent. Whatever it was, that thing, it had always troubled me. Because, fate offers up no reasons. And maybe that's what I have traveled these thirty four years to say. Maybe that is all I really know... And, that one man cared.

</OLDER_CHUCK>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck turns to the sea and speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rest easy old salt. For together again, we'll sail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_CHUCK>
<DIRECTION>
With a powerful heave, he hurls the Skipper's remains at the sinking sun and into the arms of Neptune.

EXT. BEACH - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same sunset, but from another time. Four young men walk along a deserted beach. A small boat has beached and rocks gently in the shallows. The boys run up and look at it. On the stern are painted the words: BRIGANTINE ALBATROSS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOWLY PULL BACK to reveal endless white sand, blue water, the young men and the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_CHUCK>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some time later we learned that one of our long boats had been recovered. Several young men found it washed up on a nameless beach somewhere on the island of Hispaniola. No one seemed to know who they were or where they came from, but they seemed to know of the Albatross.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes in my dreams those faceless young men reveal themselves as my lost companions, and on the twilight coral sands of forever, between my slumber and conscious state, we race naked again, so open and in love with those precious moments, running, ever laughing, ever young, ever free.

Young again, their hair sun bleached and skins brown, Chuck, John, Robin, Rick, Chris and Tod, pound through the surf in a grinning footrace. Brothers all. Music builds.
