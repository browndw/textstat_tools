INT. CLASSROOM DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A private day school. Twenty 10th grade boys are sitting in desks in geometry class. They are dressed in school uniform, light blue shirts and khakis. The boys look dazed and sleepy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The teacher, MR. ADAMS, is at the front of the room, finishing a complicated equation on the chalkboard.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Except when the value of the x coordinate is less than or equal to the value of the -- Yes, Isaac?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
A boy named ISAAC has raised his hand
</DIRECTION>
<ISAAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about that problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISAAC>
<DIRECTION>
Isaac points to a startling and intricate arrangement of huge numbers and strange symbols filling up a forgotten corner of the chalkboard. The heading above it says Extra Credit.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I really just put that up there as a joke. That's probably the hardest geometry problem in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_ADAMS>
<ISAAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much extra credit is it worth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISAAC>
<MR_ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I've never seen anyone get it right before, including my mentor, Dr. Leaky at MIT. So I guess if anyone here can do it,

(pause)I'd see to it that none of you ever have to open
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	another math book again for the rest of your lives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
There is some quite murmuring. The name Fischer is repeated over and over. The boys begin to look to a student in the back row.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unlike his classmates, he wears the Rushmore school blazer with insignia on the breast pocket and a Rushmore rep tie knotted tightly. His hair is smartly parted and swept back. He is extremely skinny and pale. He is MAX FISCHER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max has a cup of coffee on his desk and he is reading the Wall Street Journal.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Max ? You want to try it ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
Max looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. Did someone say my name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone laughs. Max smiles slightly. He buttons his blazer and straightens his tie. He picks up his cup of coffee and takes a sip. He goes to the chalkboard and sets to work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys watch with nervous anticipation. Mr. Adams compares Max's progress with e notes in his book. Max's equations quickly fills up most of the chalkboard. He finishes it with a flourish, throws his piece of chalk in the trash, and turns to face the class.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone looks to Mr. Adams. Mr. Adams raises an eyebrow. He nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The classroom erupts into wild, ecstatic applause. Everyone surrounds Max, cheering, as he walks calmly back to his desk. They hoist him into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max with his eyes closed, smiling serenely, listening to the applause. He mutters:
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
A little hand grabs Max's arm and shakes him. Max opens his eyes. The person shaking him is his chapel partner, DIRK CALLOWAY, a fourth grader with neatly white hair. Max looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are in chapel, surrounded by rows of boys in school uniforms. Dirk puts his finger to his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Max rubs his eyes and sits up in the pew. The applause dies down and Max looks to the pulpit as the guest chapel speaker, HERMAN BLUME, steps up to the microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Blume is a tough looking guy about fifty years old in a black suit. He begins his chapel speech.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BLUME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys have it real easy. I never had it like this where I grew up. But I send my kids here. Because, the fact is, whether you deserve it or not: you go to one of the best schools in the country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BLUME>
<DIRECTION>
Max's eyes light's up.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BLUME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rushmore. You lucked out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BLUME>
<DIRECTION>
Max leans forward to the railing and begins to listen intently.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BLUME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, for some of you it doesn't matter. You were born rich, and you're going to stay rich. But here's my advice to the rest of you: take dead aim on the rich boys. Get them in the crosshairs. And take them down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BLUME>
<DIRECTION>
Some of the students and faculty begin to look at each other with puzzled expressions. Max is nodding and taking notes on the flypage of a hymnal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT HYMNAL:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rushmore -- best school in country. rich kids -- bad?
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BLUME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just remember: they can buy anything. But they can't buy backbone. Don't let them forget that. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BLUME>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Blume leaves the podium. Max leaps to his feet and leads the applause. The organ starts and everyone stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. QUADRANGLE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Blume and the headmaster, DR. GUGGENHEIM, come out of the chapel among the throng of students.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Guggenheim wears a wool coat and smokes a pipe. He is very dashing with silver hair and a warmly patronizing manner. He walks with his hands clasped behind his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two Jack Russell terriers follow quickly at his heels.
</DIRECTION>

Max smiles broadly. They each notice that their haircuts are identical, neatly parted on the side.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your speech was excellent. Except I disagree with your ideas about rich kids. Because. After all, we don't choose who our fathers are. But that's really my only criticism.

</MAX>
<MR_BLUME>
<DIRECTION>
(hesitates)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Mr. Blume looks at Dirk staring up at him. Dirk says softly:

<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for coming today, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Max shakes Mr. Blume's hand. Mr. Blume smiles. But Max doesn't go. He just stands there. Searching for the words.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really. I think it is. You're right about Rushmore. Look around. It truly is a great school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Blume nods. A little uneasy.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, nice to have met you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Max goes. Mr. Blume and Dr. Guggenheim watch him walk away with Dirk.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BLUME>

Dr. Guggenheim looks across the lawn at Max and his chapel partner. He says wistfully:

Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Guggenheim. I don't want to tell you how to do your job. But the fact is no matter how hard I try, I still might flunk another class. And if that means I have to stay on for a post-graduate year, then so be it. But if --

<DR_GUGGENHEIM>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not dyslexic.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you remember how I got into this school?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DR_GUGGENHEIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I do. You wrote a play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_GUGGENHEIM>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. A little one act. And my mother read it and felt I should go to Rushmore. And you read it, and you gave me a scholarship, didn't you ?

Dr. Guggenheim nods.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you regret it?

<DR_GUGGENHEIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't regret it. But I still might have to expel you.

Max nods. He smiles sadly and whispers:

A long table in the Rushmore library. Max is reading a library copy of a book about Jacques Cousteau. He is also playing backgammon with a freshman named ALEX.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you hear they're teaching Japanese next year?

<ALEX>

	At least I saved Dirk from the horror.

Max turns the page of his book. There is a little note written in the margin in pencil with an arrow pointing to the text. Max frowns. He turns the book sideways to read it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT FRAGMENT OF NOTE IN BOOK:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
which reminds me of a quote from Henry James: Try to be one of the people whom nothing is lost.

Max's frown disappears. A change comes over his face. His eyes glaze over dreamily. He looks to Alex.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's Henry James?

INT. HALLWAY. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max walks down a hallway in the lower school. He is carrying the little scrap of paper, checking room numbers as he walks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks in some of the rooms. He sees kids sitting at tables with scissors and paste. Kids watching a movie on science. Kids curled up on mats during naptime.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then he sees room 121. He goes up to the door and looks through the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A class of first graders is sitting Indian-style in a little circle on the floor. The teacher is in a tiny little kids' chair, reading aloud from Kidnapped. She is twenty-eight. She wears a cardigan sweater and her hair pulled back like a ballet dancer. She is MISS CROSS.

Half of Buchan's ear was blown-off in a hunting accident.

Mr. Fischer is stricken. Max says quietly:

<MISS_CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Latin-American studies.

</MISS_CROSS>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<MISS_CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? That's too bad. All the Romance Languages come from Latin.

	They do, don't they?

Mr. Blume climbs up the ladder to the high dive. He sets down his cocktail. He slips and falls and bangs his knee hard on the edge of the board. He gets up quickly. There is a bad cut on his knee and he is bleeding. He looks out at the birthday party down below.

<DIRECTION>
People begin to notice him up there.

He sprints down the board, bounces once as high as he can, and sails out long through the air. He tucks into a cannon ball. He nails the water with a huge splash.

Mrs. Blume gets up with a bitter look on her face and heads for the ladies' room.

Kids gather at the edge of the pool to look down at Mr. Blume playing dead at the bottom with golf balls all around him. A little boy in a Speedo underwear swims to examine Mr. Blume. Their eyes meet. The boy turns and swims away.

</DIRECTION>
<MISS_CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>

A look of wonder comes across Max's face. He stares into the blue water.

Max slams the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max stands alone smoking a cigarette in front of a pile of leaves. A LAWN CREW is raking in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max strikes a match, throws it on the leaves, and watches sadly as the leaves burn and smoke rises black into the crisp autumn air. He takes off his Rushmore blazer and throws it on the fire. He looks up at the sky and says quietly:

EXT. PARK. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cold day. Dry leaves fall from the trees in the park.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Blume comes down the path to Max sitting alone on a bench. Max is dressed in blue jeans, a plaid shirt, a ski cap, and huge down parka. Mrs. Blume is wearing a topcoat and gloves. Max stands up to shake hands with her.

Silence. Mrs. Blume looks around the park.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_BLUME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_BLUME>
<DIRECTION>
She sits down. Max takes two sandwiches out of his backpack.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have tuna fish and I have peanut butter and jelly. I'm sorry it's not something more exotic.

Max holds out the two drinks. Mrs. Blume just stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to cut to the chase?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Max puts down his sandwich and gathers his thoughts.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK. As you know, Mr. Blume and I used to be friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<MRS_BLUME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no idea what the relationship is between you and Herman. Honestly, I find it very bizarre.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean to imply?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<MRS_BLUME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not implying anything. You make a very strange couple. It's too bad Herman doesn't have that kind of affection for his own children.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_BLUME>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm sure he does.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<MRS_BLUME>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_BLUME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you telling me this? Are you trying to hurt Mr. Blume? Or are you trying to hurt me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_BLUME>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no reason to want to hurt you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<MRS_BLUME>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A little bug flies around Mr. Blume's head. He swats it away and keeps reading.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two more bugs come buzzing around him. Mr. Blume looks up and frowns. They're bees. Mr. Blume slaps at his neck and jumps to his feet as he gets stung.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. BLUME Shit!

<DIRECTION>
He jerks the steering wheel and bounces up onto the sidewalk. The car pops through a wooden fence and rolls across the grass into the quadrangle.
</DIRECTION>

Miss Cross moves towards Max with her hand outstretched. Max retreats backwards, banging into desks and chairs. Miss Cross stops.

She taps on the glass. Max looks out to her. She waves to him. Max closes the curtains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margaret turns away sadly and walks off down the sidewalk.

</DIRECTION>
<MR_FISCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Max, I like being a barber. I'm good at it and I enjoy it. But I always thought you'd try a different line of work.

<MAX>

Max turns on the radio and goes back into washing the combs and scissors. Mr. Fischer sighs. He puts on his gloves. He goes out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max flips the sign on the door from open to closed. He takes off his barber's jacket and hangs it on the coatrack. He goes into the back room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes back into the room carrying a broom. He stops.
</DIRECTION>

	OK. Sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Dirk sits back down in the barber's chair. Max puts his white jacket back on and starts giving Dirk a haircut. There is just a sound of scissors snipping for a minute.

Dr. Guggenheim is in his hospital bed with his eyes half-shut and a bunch of plastic tubes sticking out of him. Mrs. Guggenheim sits in a chair at the foot of the bed reading a biography on Churchill. She looks exhausted.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine, thanks.

Max starts to shake hands, but Mrs. Guggenheim hugs him and kisses him on the cheek. Max is caught a little offguard by this. There is lipstick on his cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_GUGGENHEIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are glorious. Let me put them in some water. Sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_GUGGENHEIM>

</DIRECTION>
<DR_GUGGENHEIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_GUGGENHEIM>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Guggenheim looks up quickly. Max hesitates.

Dr. Guggenheim tries to spit at Max, but his mouth is too dry. Mrs. Guggenheim comes over to him.

<MRS_GUGGENHEIM>

Dr. Guggenheim mutters deliriously.

Mr. Blume lights a new cigarette. Max points to Mr. Blume's first cigarette, balanced on the handrail.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've already got one going, Mr. Blume.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Blume picks up his first cigarette and puts it in the opposite corner of his mouth from the second. He smiles at Max through the smoke. They get off to the 14th floor and the doors open.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BLUME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adios, amigo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BLUME>
<DIRECTION>
Max waves good-bye. But Mr. Blume does not get off the elevator. He bends over and puts his hands on his knees and takes a series of deep breaths. The door starts to close. He reaches out and holds them open. Max looks concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you OK?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Blume looks up at Max. He laughs and shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BLUME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm kind of lonely these days.

Mr. Blume sighs. He gets off the elevator. The doors close behind him as Max watches him walk down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO DIRK'S BINOCULARS:

She hears someone trying to open the window. She gets up and pulls open the blinds. Max is outside on the roof wearing his parka and ski cap in the falling snow. He waves.

<DIRECTION>

Miss Cross notices a little cut over Max's eye. She lifts up the front of Max's ski cap. There is blood all over his forehead. She looks shocked.

Max goes to Miss Cross' bed. He lies down and stares at the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miss Cross goes into the bathroom. She puts on a white bathrobe and gets some cotton balls and hydrogen peroxide out of the medicine cabinet.
</DIRECTION>

Max looks around the room.

</MISS_CROSS>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know it's not. But I'm a little confused right now. I mean. I thought you dumped me for Blume. Then I hear -

<MISS_CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never dumped you because we were never going out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_CROSS>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it doesn't make any sense. I -

<MISS_CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I am confused, too. But why don't we just deal with getting you -
	</DIALOGUE>

Silence. Miss Cross sits down in a rocking chair beside the bed. She opens the bottle of hydrogen peroxide.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He thinks you dumped him because of Edward Appleby.

</MAX>
<MISS_CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MISS_CROSS>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I mean. You live in this room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>

Max looks around the room. There are trophies and ribbons, a chemistry set, a poster from the Olympics, three large fish tanks, a picture of Jacques Cousteau, and some model planes in dogfights hanging from the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With all his stuff. It's kind of --

	Although I will say Edward has more spark and character and imagination in one fingernail than Herman Blume has in his entire body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_CROSS>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One dead fingernail.

</MISS_CROSS>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK.

</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Miss Cross pushes Max's hair back with her hand. She looks at him for a minute. She touches the blood on his forehead with a cotton ball. She stops.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this fake blood?

Dirk looks down at Max's red hands.

Tear's starts streaming down Max's face. Dirk looks worried.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRK>

</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. One of the skaters begins to circle around Max and Dirk closer and closer. She suddenly scratches to a halt right in front of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The skater is a girl in white skates and grey tights and a short camel's hair coat. She has a scarf over the lower half of her face. She says to Max:
</DIRECTION>
<SKATER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this your handwriting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKATER>
<DIRECTION>
She holds out a little piece of paper torn out from a spiral notebook. Max stands up and takes it. There is a note written on it in blue crayon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT PIECE OF PAPER:

Max looks to Dirk. Dirk is putting a new worm on his hook.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. But it looks familiar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Max gives the piece of paper back to the girl. She lowers her scarf and we see she is Margaret Yang.

<MAX>

</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
Max stares at her. It is as if he is seeing her for the first time. He says quietly:
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's exactly the way I would have handled that situation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. It's nothing to be proud of.

</MARGARET>

Margaret starts skating slowly away backwards. Max waves to her. She spins and skates off full-speed. Max watches her go. Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You set me up.
	</DIALOGUE>

Dirk nods. Max says wistfully:
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not bad, not bad. The child has become the father of the man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Max looks out across the frozen pond. He pulls off his ski cap and feels the cold air against his cheeks. Snowflakes catch in his eyelashes.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We might have to get some hockey skates, Dirk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Dirk reaches into his backpack and takes out a pair of skates. He hands them to Max. Max looks at them for a minute. He nods slowly. Something begins to change in his face. He says with quiet intensity:
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>

Dirk smiles. Max grabs Dirk's fig pole and starts walking. Dirk calls after him:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure you don't want to stay here and feel sorry for yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRK>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>

Dirk grabs his tackle box and follows Max briskly off the ice.

Mr. Fischer is inside reading the sports page.
</DIRECTION>

A cab pulls up and splashes water on Mr. Blume, but he does not appear to notice. Max gets out of the cab. He is dressed in a beautiful green velvet suit and bow tie. He smiles.

</DIRECTION>
<MR_BLUME>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MR_BLUME>
<DIRECTION>
Max shrugs. Mr. Blume starts to open the box. Max flinches away like the box is going to explode. Mr. Blume stops. Max smiles and motions for Mr. Blume to go ahead. Mr. Blume opens the box. There are two little pins inside.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the Perfect Attendance awards and the Punctuality Award. I got those at Rushmore. I thought you could choose which one you like more, and you could wear that one and I could wear the other.

Vietnam. Napalm smolders in the sky above the jungle.

Dirk runs onstage dressed in a Green Beret uniform and sunglasses. He has an M-16. He yells to Max as Max shimmies down out of a palm tree:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRK>

</DIRK>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
There is an explosion and Max and Dirk run through the smoke. Suddenly the stage is swarmed by VC regulars. Everyone starts shooting at once.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bursts of gunfire light-up the audience's faces and smoke floats over their heads as we hear the sounds of jets flying over, bombs exploding, choppers taking off, and a SOLDIER'S voice screaming into his radio:
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mayday! Mayday! Seven niner Almighty! Adjust your coordinates!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
Some members of the audience put on their safety glasses and earplugs. Woody stands nervously in the wings with a fire extinguisher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the extras accidentally clubs Max in the temple with the butt of his rifle. Max's eyes close. He crumples to the floor. The fighting stops. The audience begins to murmur.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max opens his eyes. He sees the frightened soldiers looking down at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs his M-16 and opens fire. The battle resumes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT SIGN WRITTEN IN CALLIGRAPHY:

Actors run around frantically backstage. Max has a band-aid on his forehead. He is touching-up a gory makeup effect over Dirk's eye. He turns to Woody.

<DIRECTION>
The lobby of the auditorium is buzzing with people talking about the play and having drinks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Blume is standing alone outside, smoking a cigarette. It is snowing softly. Miss Cross comes out with a cup of coffee in each hand. Mr. Blume turns around and looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes over to him and hands him one of the coffees.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BLUME>

</DIRECTION>
<MISS_CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what do you think of Max's latest opus?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Blume gives a thumbs up and stares out into the snow.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BLUME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's just hope it's got a happy ending.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BLUME>

Magnus salutes Max and walks off. We hear his voice as he goes into the wings:
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tag 'em and bag 'em, cherries! We're moving out! Let's DD!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNUS>
<DIRECTION>
Max throws down his rifle into a foxhole and begins to cry quietly. Someone moves slowly toward him out of the settling smoke. Max wheels around and whips out his Swiss Army knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then he sees it is Margaret Yang as a Vietnamese villager. She has been through hell.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Esposito.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
Max drops his knife and it stabs into the floor. He puts out his hand. Margaret takes it. He pulls her in and hugs her.

<DIRECTION>
Miss Cross smiles sadly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max looks into Margaret Yang's eyes.

Wagner's Flight of the Walkyries begins to play loudly from behind the stage as Max kisses Margaret and the curtain drops to wild applause.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Guggenheim looks on in amazement as Dr. Guggenheim stands up out of his wheelchair and leads the ovation. The rest of the audience quickly follows suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Indian groundskeeper is laughing hysterically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GYMNASIUM. NIGHT

The gymnasium has been filled with palm trees and decorated like an Army barracks. Flares burn in circles around the tables. A banner at the entrance says The Heaven and Hell Cotillion.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Mrs. Yang. I actually wrote a different version of the play two years ago. But I couldn't get it done over at Rushmore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<MRS_YANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Too political?
	</DIALOGUE>

The Indian groundskeeper is talking with Coach Beck and Mr. Blume's foreman, Ernie.
</DIRECTION>
<COACH_BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm surprised they let him build a real campfire onstage. That's a safety hazard.

	You were incredible tonight, Margaret. You were that poor girl.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. I loved it when you grabbed onto the bottom of the chopper as it was taking off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was totally improvised.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
