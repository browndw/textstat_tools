INT. SETH'S CAR - MORNING

<DIRECTION>
Seth, seventeen, a bit heavyset, in the midst of a sad attempt at growing a goatee and clearly a terrible driver, cruises along while fiddling with the CD player. He pulls out his cell and dials.

INT/EXT. 7-11 STORE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth and Evan walk past a group of smokers, towards the 7-11.

<EVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're being an idiot, man. You really shouldn't park there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVAN>
<SETH>

They walk past DIMITRI (18, big Native American guy) as they enter the store. Dimitri aggressively bumps his shoulder into Seth.

<EVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not fair. I have to hide every erection I get.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVAN>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes I get boners so big I can't hide them. And then I get nervous and my heart starts pounding, and it all just, like, feeds my boner. It just becomes this...thing...that's attached to me. And it won't go away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<EVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just imagine if girls weren't weirded out by our boners and they actually wanted to see `em, like this shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVAN>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know it's been, like, a year and a half since I've seen an actual human female nipple. Besides my mom's. I saw it last month, and it was sick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<EVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit. Liat was two years ago? I guess so. She was insanely hot, though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVAN>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. Too hot. That's what sucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<EVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can that possibly suck? I'd be fuckin' psyched if I'd gotten with a girl that hot. You got, like, two dozen handjobs!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVAN>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And three quarters of a blowjob, But that was fuckin' it. It was the peak of my ass- gettin' career, and it happened way, way, way too early.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<EVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're like Orson Welles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVAN>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly! If I'd built up to it, I'd probably at least be having steady sex with a mediocre-looking girl at this point. I honestly now see why Orson Welles ate his fat ass to death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<EVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll have sex in college. Everyone does. And if not, you'll have the Bang Bus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVAN>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the key is to be good at sex by the time you're in college. You don't want girls to think you suck dick at fucking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<EVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I still think you've got a chance with Jules. She got mad hot over last summer, and clearly hasn't realized it, `cause she still flirts with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVAN>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you joking, man? Let's see here...she dated Dan Remick, Matt Muir, Josh Corber and what's-his-face. All of those were cool guys. She's been hot way longer than you think. Why would she end her high school career with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<EVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Helen got with Ariel Shafir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVAN>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, and he was a complete fucking loser. You're a step up from that. Which is why you should stop being a pussy and do her! You could nailthe shit out of her for, like, two months before you leave. That bitch looks like a good fucker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<EVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! I'm sick of you talking about her like that, man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVAN>
<DIRECTION>
Evan starts to walk out. Seth follows.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, you can talk about that bitch all day every single day, but I can't say one thing about her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<EVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't constantly insult her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVAN>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't insult her! I said she looks like a good fucker! She looks like she can take a dick. That's a good thing. Some women pride themselves on their dick- taking abilities.

Seth wipes the spit off. He looks at Terry and seems as though he's about to say something, but is interrupted when Terry starts hocking up more spit. Seth runs away as Terry and his friends laugh. He catches up to Evan and they head back to school.
</DIRECTION>
<EVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. You really bitched out on that one.

Evan is sitting in math class staring at HELEN'S breasts. She`s a very tall girl and is athletic in a sexy way, wearing volleyball team sweat pants and a tank top. He looks up from her breasts to her face: she is staring right at him. He immediately looks to the front of the class, embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>

The bell rings and everyone leaves. Helen walks up to Evan as they enter the hallway. He's really nervous. She offers him a pen.

</HELEN>
<SETH>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jules)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

There is a moment of silence.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look good with a black eye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
They all chuckle a little.
</DIRECTION>
<JULES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, smart guy. That's why I'm here. I have to go to Macy's to get a shitload of cover-up for the grad photo.

(flirtatiously, joking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you gonna come with me to Macy's and buy me my cover-up, or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULES>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! Definitely. I'd love to. I had such bad acne last year, I became an expert on the stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<EVAN>

</EVAN>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Seth and Evan look at each other, odd smiles on both their faces. They didn't blow it.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, uh, I'll call you later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<EVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</EVAN>
<JULES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Seth. Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULES>
<DIRECTION>
Jules pulls Seth away. Evan and Helen start walking in the opposite direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they walk away from one another, Seth and Evan look back and give each other a small and yet emotionally-charged wave. A SLOW, GUT WRENCHING SOUL SONG STARTS TO PLAY. They look as though they're never going to see each other again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MACY'S ESCALATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jules and Seth walk into Macy's and Helen and Evan descend an escalator, the music swells to a mind-fuckingly awesome crescendo, and we humbly fade to black...

<DIRECTION>
THE END

END CREDIT SEQUENCE:

We flip through Seth's seemingly endless penis drawings from childhood. They are hilarious.
