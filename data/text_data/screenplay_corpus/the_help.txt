	She having bridge club right now. May I take a message?

<DIRECTION>
CELIA FOOTE, 28, peroxide blonde, stands in all her country girl glory. She speaks with a thick, unrefined, Southern accent, mired in insecurity.

Hilly begins squirming in her seat, obviously making a point. Elizabeth leans over.

EXT. FOOTE ESTATE - BACKYARD - SAME DAY

Celia delicately prunes two rosebushes. Her long pink fingernails wrap easily around a pair of sheers. As Celia stands back to admire her work, We widen to see the Foote estate. Ancient oaks dripping in Spanish moss surround a perfectly manicured lawn. "Tara" pales in comparison. Oddly, the two rosebushes have been planted in the center of the lawn, jeopardizing the Antebellum Feng Shui.

Johnny brushes hair from Celia's face.

Aibileen shrugs her shoulders, reeling it all back in. Just then, Elizabeth walks into the kitchen holding papers stapled together. She looks between Aibileen and Skeeter.

<ELIZABETH>

Skeeter looks ahead and sees an OLDER BLACK WOMAN walking with a LITTLE BLONDE GIRL, 6. They hold hands. The black woman smiles and waves as Skeeter passes. When Skeeter looks in her rear view mirror, they're gone. Skeeter suddenly stops the car just short of an intersecting gravel road. Skeeter slowly turns down the old road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONSTANTINE'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Skeeter's car pulls into the overgrown yard of an old shack with a rusted-out tin roof. Two clapboard rooms are separated by an open breezeway. The front door is cracked opened. Skeeter gets out and walks toward Constantine's home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONSTANTINE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Skeeter enters to find only a small bed, dresser, table, rocking chair and a wood burning stove. Past intruders have long since taken anything of value.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Skeeter approaches Constantine's bed, an OPOSSUM scurries out from underneath. Skeeter screams as the opossum runs out the door. Her eyes suddenly catch something. Lying on the bed is an OLD CORN PIPE. Skeeter picks it up and brings it to her face. Her eyes begin to well up.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Skeeter pulls in front of a grand antebellum home and parks to the side of her family's graveyard. Skeeter carries her black dress up the stairs of a covered porch. An old black man with white hair, JAMESO, 70, tightens a porch swing.

Skeeter's mother, CHARLOTTE BOUDREAU CANTELLE PHELAN, 50, glides into the room wearing a wig. Her floral print dress has a gazillion perfectly pressed pleats. Charlotte turns to a mirror and adjusts an auburn-colored, 'pixie' cut.

	<DIALOGUE>
	How could she just take off without telling me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKEETER>
<CHARLOTTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told her not to write you. I didn't want you upset in the middle of final exams. Honey, we were just a job to her. With them it's all about money...Did I tell you Fanny Peatrow got engaged? After she got that teller job, her mother said she was just swimming in proposals.

INT. FARM TRUCK - COUNTRY ROAD - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chunks of mud fly off the tires. The June sun has set the truck's interior at a stubborn 115 degrees. Skeeter has no choice but to lower her window. The Shinolator meets its match. A mangy, STRAY CAT suddenly jumps out in the road. When towing 10,000 pounds of farm equipment, slowing down quickly isn't an option.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A loud thud sounds out from the truck's grill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - PARLOR - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hilly, her husband, WILLIAM, and Skeeter's date, STUART WHITWORTH, drink high balls and eat cheese in the Holbrook parlor. Gold swag curtains hang on the windows. Balding and pudgy, only William's family money once made him a desirable bachelor. Stuart, on the other hand, is very handsome, the "Marlboro Man" in a well-tailored suit. Yule May (who we met earlier at church with Aibileen) now works for Hilly. She clears empty glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>

	With your daddy's endorsement, I can win that Senate seat.

Stuart feigns interest.
</DIRECTION>
<STUART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll talk to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Ice slams against Stuart's teeth as he downs his drink. Hilly pats William's leg then turns with concern to a grandfather clock announcing half past the hour. The front door flies open. Skeeter enters completely out of breath and sweaty. Her HAIR HAS TRIPLED IN SIZE. She waves.
</DIRECTION>
<SKEETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As Hilly races toward Skeeter, William and Stuart stand. Stuart is as tall as he is handsome.
</DIRECTION>
<HILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boys, we'll be right back. Y'all talk about quarterbacks or something. Yule May, get Miss Skeeter a Coca Cola.

Yule May runs off. Hilly pulls Skeeter down the hall.

INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hilly, William, Stuart and Skeeter sit at a round table adorned with white linens, silver and fine china. The room buzzes with Jackson's elite all trying to be noticed as a JAZZ QUARTET plays softly in a corner. A WAITER approaches. Stuart leans into Skeeter without making eye contact.

<STUART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what do you do with your time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUART>
<SKEETER>

Stuart smirks, taking a huge sip of his drink.

Celia and Johnny walk up. Hilly stiffens.

</STUART>
<SKEETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, but were you dropped on your head as an infant?

Stuart blinks and then smiles, somewhat impressed. Desperate to change the subject, Hilly claps her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<HILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who? Is? Hungry?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Skeeter stands.
</DIRECTION>
<SKEETER>

Tables begin to stare.

INT. WHITE GROCERY STORE - LATER THAT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Minny and Aibileen, in uniform, push carts side by side in the grocery store. The white shoppers are dressed casually. Other maids in the store (all required to be in uniform while shopping) keep quietly to themselves. White women smile and chat with one another as they meander down the aisles as if the black maids aren't even there. Minny suddenly spots Celia in the produce section. She pulls Aibileen close as they peer around the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<MINNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's her.

Minny and Aibileen watch as Celia exits the store with her groceries and prances toward her car.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aibileen has come along to aid Yule May with Elizabeth's baby shower. A table is set in the middle of the yard covered in white linens and Hilly's best sliver. Hilly's son sits on her lap. The other girls' children wear bathing suits jumping noisily in and out of two plastic kiddy pools. Yule May clears cake plates while Aibileen removes crumbs with a sterling crumb scraper. Mae Mobley wanders up to the table. Her belly almost looks distended crammed inside last year's one piece.

Yule May vacuums. She pulls the sofa away from the wall to clean beneath it. Noticing something on the floor, Yule May leans over. She rises holding a SMALL RUBY RING. Years of dust and hair blanket the pitiful gem set in ten karat gold. The vacuum seems to roar louder now. Yule May breathes heavily. She shoves the ring into her uniform pocket.

Constantine wets herself. Slowly the women begin realizing what's happening. The two women closest to Constantine gasp and quickly move away from her. Another woman rises from the table covering her mouth with a napkin and leaves the room. Just now realizing what has happened, Constantine looks down at her soiled dress. No one says a word. No one comes to Constantine's aid. Constantine looks to Charlotte.

She sets the book down on her desk and picks up the phone. The book's cover reads: "All My Babies" By Aibileen Clark. Next to the book is a glass box. Constantine's corn pipe rests inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: AIBILEEN'S NEW HOME - LIVING ROOM - FIFTEEN YEARS LATER Aibileen, 70, rises from a sofa. Her hair is gray. Reading glasses hang on a chain from around her neck. As she begins a slow walk down the hall, we see the surroundings of her new home for the first time. It's much bigger, well furnished and beautiful. She passes a study lined with shelves of books. A copy of "The Help" and "All My Babies" are placed side by side. At the end of the hall, Aibileen approaches the opened door of a brightly lit, sparkling white, bathroom. She enters the bathroom and closes the door.
