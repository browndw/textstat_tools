</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One sweep slices her bindings and she scrambles to safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The distraction is enough for Machete to gain the upper hand and slash Torrez across the front.
</DIRECTION>

On the edge of death Torrez seems to soften.

DESERT - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A family of illegals crossing the border in the desert, see a WATER STATION up ahead. They make for it, opening it up and drinking heavily from the water supply. A BULLET brings one of them down and the others scramble for safety but there's someone out there, shooting at them.

</MILITIA_MAN>
<2ND_MINUTEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. They're like brown jackrabbits. Let's see if they'll show their little white tails.
	</DIALOGUE>
</2ND_MINUTEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Flicks on a highpowered light by the side mirrors on the JEEP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light is on long enough to illuminate a MACHETE BLADE coming straight for them.
</DIRECTION>
<MILITIA_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILITIA_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
His words gurgle in his throat as his head is severed from his body. 2nd MINUTEMAN freaks and makes a run for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stumbles in the dark, in the dust. Scrambles but can't get to his feet as he sees the outline of a DARK FIGURE above him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young illegals' prayers continue as the MACHETE comes down on 2nd MINUTEMAN.

<DIRECTION>
Young illegal opens eyes...
</DIRECTION>

There's a glass candle in his hands, but no one else around. Instead of Christ or a Virgin on the candle is a silhouette of MACHETE...

CUT TO BLACK.
