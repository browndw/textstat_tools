:SC: MR BROOKS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on a Polaroid of a dimly lit COUPLE locked in a sexual embrace. We cannot see their faces.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (tortured)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
Our view travels sensuously down the Woman's naked torso to find the Man's head buried between her legs.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHALL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you fight it so hard, Earl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Courage to change the things I can...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<MARSHALL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, you've been a good boy for a long time, you deserve a little fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<DIRECTION>
Our view moves back up to the Woman's breasts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE THROUGH THIS TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EARL BROOKS' reflection in a mirror. Earl, in his 40's, has on a tuxedo. He's in front of a sink in a Public Bathroom and he's whispering to his image.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and Wisdom to know the difference.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
Picking up speed against the hunger in his head:
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Living one day at a time, Enjoying one moment at a time, Accepting hardship as a pathway to peace...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
From far away comes the sound of applause.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEN in tuxedos and WOMEN in gowns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks is seated at one of the front tables with his wife, EMMA, also 40's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The audience's hands are coming together for what a MAN at the microphone has just said.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks is smiling but not clapping; and although his lips don't move we can hear:
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (even faster now)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Taking, as He did, this sinful world as it is, not as I would have it. Trusting that He will make all things right if I surrender to His will. That I may be reasonably happy in this life, And supremely happy with Him forever in the next. Amen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
The Man at the microphone raises his arms to quiet the Audience.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could go on and on about what a great guy Earl is, how he cuts his toe nails...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... how he gives freely of his time and money, but let's get Earl up here to speak for himself. Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you a businessman, a philanthropist, a great friend and the Evanston Chamber of Commerce Man of the Year... Mr. Earl Brooks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks kisses Emma, stands and after accepting congratulations along the way, arrives at the podium.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you all very much. The first thing I would like to say is... I don't even know how I cut my toe nails.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
Applause and laughter from the Audience.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty years ago when I started the Brooks Box Factory I never dreamed I would one day be standing here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A silver Lexus LS 430 glides past us.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you see Sis Wallace's dress?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LEXUS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks is driving. Emma is in the passenger seat. They're holding hands.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could see her nipples. At her age she should keep those things hidden.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks is only listening to his Wife with one ear and underneath what she is saying we can barely hear:
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God grant me the Serenity to accept...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only thing that would have made this evening more perfect is if Jane had been here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She called. She has mid terms coming up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's dropping out, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing she does is wrong to you, is it?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks doesn't rise to the bait.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well she missed a good party...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
As she continues, we look at Mr. Brooks and Emma's voice fades to a murmur.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the back seat, a Man leans out from behind Mr. Brooks's head. This is MARSHALL. He's 50 plus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emma can neither see nor hear him. Marshall exists only in Mr. Brooks's mind.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Earl, give yourself a break, you know you want to do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the fucking 'man of the year', you deserve it. It's not like it's not set up. You already know how to by-pass the alarm, you know how to pick the locks. Tonight's the perfect night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
(over his shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Marshall, I said 'no'!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard you, Earl, but you don't mean 'no'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<DIRECTION>
Emma feels Mr. Brooks's distance.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks pulls himself back into the moment.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were frowning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was thinking of what I didn't say in the speech.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They laughed, they were touched, I don't think anyone felt left out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<MARSHALL>
<DIRECTION>
(from the back seat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They have their dance class tonight. What if we go by and just look at them. There's no harm in just having a look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No means 'no', Marshall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please... pretty please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
(to Emma)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The food tonight was very good, but I wasn't crazy about the dessert. Would you like to stop somewhere and get something sweet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ICE CREAM PARLOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a booth, Mr. Brooks and Emma are sharing a Sundae. Mr. Brooks steals a look at the Arthur Murray dance class that is taking place behind the full-length windows fronting the second floor of the Building across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Labradors are supposed to be nice, or maybe a rescue mutt...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Pound's a pretty sad place; if you want me to, I'll go with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's an Irish Lab I read about, and I think the breeder is...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks turns his attention back to the Dancers and again Emma's voice fades to a murmur.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both Mr. Brooks and Marshall who is seated on the other side of Emma are focused on one particular COUPLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Man and Woman are not great dancers nor are they especially attractive, but Mr. Brooks and Marshall are fascinated with them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marshall leans forward and looking slyly around Emma at Mr. Brooks:
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet your dick's getting hard, isn't it, just imagining what they would look like dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<DIRECTION>
Savoring the ice-cream, Mr. Brooks nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BROOKS HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two story modern. Not ostentatious, but the elegance of the line and the grounds say there's big money here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the door of the DRESSING AREA, Emma can be seen taking off her evening clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hidden by the darkness on the other side of the bed, Mr. Brooks is hunched forward on a chair, his head in his hands. His bow tie is undone, but he's still wearing his Tuxedo. In obvious torment, he is whispering to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I can't do this, I can't do this, I can't do this, please don't let me do this, God grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
In the DRESSING AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emma is putting on her sleep-wear. Mr. Brooks steps into the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to stay up a while, maybe go to the studio and play with some glazes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I'm going to read. If I'm not awake, wake me when you come back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks comes forward, puts his arms around Emma and hugs her, then easing back, kisses her.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you were wonderful tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BROOKS HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks exits the back door and starts down a path that leads away from the house.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do this, don't do this, please don't do this, don't do this, don't do, please don't do this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
He passes through a screen of trees and arrives at a small beautiful industrial-looking Building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No windows except for a narrow strip on three sides just under the edge of the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks lets himself in with a key.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exquisitely unique handmade handglazed bowls, vases, cups, plates are scattered haphazardly on shelves and tables around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is Mr. Brooks's CERAMICS STUDIO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks turns on the big industrial kiln and sets the temperature, then in a series of quick cuts changes out of his tuxedo into his work clothes which he selects from a dozen identical pairs of khaki shirts and pants hanging in a closet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below the pants and shirts are a dozen pairs of identical leather work shoes. The windbreaker he puts on is also from a dozen identical windbreakers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a set of car keys off a hook next to a door which opens into a garage. Under the light is an older model non- descript Toyota.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CERAMICS STUDIO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Toyota backs into an alley and with the garage door closing behind it, pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOYOTA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marshall is up front with Mr. Brooks.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Lordy, Earl my boy, I've missed this! We are going to have so much fun!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the last time, Marshall. Understand me?! The very last time!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mixture of modest houses and apartment buildings. Mr. Brooks's Toyota is parked in the semi-dark cast by a tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We rise over the car, over the trees, over the houses to the other side of the block and come down to find Mr. Brooks working the lock on the side door of a small BUNGALOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has on surgical gloves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pick is extracted, the handle turned. The door opens. There's a chain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks removes a pair of bent rubber tipped forceps from a pocket, inserts it in the chain, pulls the door to, gives the tool a twist and gently pushes the door inward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chain has been released.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks quietly closes the door and holding his breath stands very still and listens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a faint indistinct sound coming from the recesses of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks's feet glide out of the PANTRY. Now coming slightly behind him is another pair of legs encased in dark slacks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Move up; the person in the black slacks is Marshall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the middle of the KITCHEN, the sound is now recognizable. It's the moans of a Couple fucking. This disturbs Mr. Brooks, he hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marshall leans in and hisses fiercely in his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you dare quit on me, you piece of shit. I want to see what they're doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks's spine stiffens and he's going forward again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Entering a HALLWAY, he reaches into his jacket. When his hand reappears it's inside a Ziplock bag, his fingers around the butt of a silenced pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He brings the hand and bag to his mouth and tightens the Ziplock against his wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two Men arrive at a door that's slightly ajar. Behind it the sounds of the love-making are becoming more intense.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks nudges the door with his foot. It opens enough for he and Marshall to see the Couple inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Man and Woman from the Arthur Murray dance class are naked on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As much as Mr. Brooks hates himself for it he loves watching. He can now hear his heart beating in his ears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to breathe in unison with the Couple, but his expression is distant almost clinical.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the Couple climaxes, when they come, Mr. Brooks's face goes blank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the bed the Woman rolls off her Partner and the two of them lie there basking in the afterglow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them Mr. Brooks pushes the door fully open and slips into the ROOM. They don't know he's there until he speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
Both the Man and Woman jump with surprise and look. The Woman screams and scrabbles at the sheet to cover herself.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Then he sees the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, man, don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Woman)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be quiet and sit up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
In an attempt to get away, the Woman pushes herself back against the wall. She can't take her eyes off Mr. Brooks and she can't stop screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POP! A hole appears above her left eye. The impact of Mr. Brooks's High Velocity .22 slug bounces her head off the wall. The screaming stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Man opens his mouth and begins to shake. POP! The bullet through his brain makes him instantly dead and he crumples onto the Girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks looks at what he's done. His nostrils flare at the scent of death. Then he moves, he's got work to do. On his way to the bed, the pistol goes into his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHALL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (barks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa, Earl, what the fuck is this?!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks snaps a look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The curtains of the bedroom window are open; and over half of the Apartments in a four story Building on the other side of an alley can see into this room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Most of their windows are dark. And there's no one looking out of the windows that are lit.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These pigs liked to fuck with the blinds open, you should have known that, Earl. This is a big mistake for you, Earl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
(going to the window)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Almost like I want to get caught, huh, Marshall?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, don't fucking do that. I don't think either of us would enjoy spending the rest of our lives in jail or a lethal injection.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs a side of cloth in either hand and yanks the curtains closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on a Polaroid of the dance Couple in a sexual pose. The attitude of the bodies is awkward and very reminiscent of the ones in the Polaroid we opened the movie with.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CERAMICS STUDIO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks is kneeling naked in front of the kiln where his murder clothes are being reduced to ash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Arranged on the floor are Polaroids of the dance Couple in sexual positions.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please forgive me... Please forgive me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
As we look closer at the Photographs we realize by a smear of blood here and there and the distortion of the limbs that these tableaus were arranged after the Couple was killed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One by one, Mr. Brooks picks up his souvenirs. He lingers over the last image; and from where he's sitting on the edge of a table:
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't even think about it. You know the rules.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<DIRECTION>
Reluctantly Mr. Brooks throws the Polaroids into the fire of the kiln.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now go up and make love to your beautiful wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves. In the kiln, the Polaroids burst into flame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MURDER HOUSE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sunlight exposes its charm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
If it weren't for the Police tape, the UNIFORMED OFFICERS, and the PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVES, it looks like it would be a cool place to live.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An OLDER DETECTIVE, an African-American, comes out on the porch and calls to two other DETECTIVES who are drinking coffee on the lawn:
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where the fuck is Atwood?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_DETECTIVE>
<YOUNG_DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I called ten minutes ago, they said she was on her way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_DETECTIVE>
<OLDER_DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She doesn't get here soon, these bodies won't even be dead anymore?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
A Uniformed Cop standing guard at the tape:
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You looking for the lady Cop?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<OLDER_DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_DETECTIVE>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's here. She's been sitting in her car right over there for the last half hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<OLDER_DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Christ.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ATWOOD'S CAR - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Special Detective TRACY ATWOOD, somewhere in her 30's, is behind the wheel. The door is open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By the expression on her face we might guess that Detective Atwood has simply forgotten to get out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the seat next to her is a copy of the Chicago Tribune. The headline of a middle article on the first page reads: THE HANGMAN ESCAPES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Move up to Atwood's face. The Older Detective followed by the Younger Detective approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You thinking of joining us anytime soon, Atwood?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood doesn't look at the Detectives for a long beat and when she does her expression is not friendly.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really hated yesterday, Snyder, and then today came along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
As she gets out of the car, the Men notice the bandages on her wrists and falling into step with her on the way to the house.
</DIRECTION>
<SNYDER>
<DIRECTION>
(OLDER DETECTIVE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to your wrists?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNYDER>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood holds up her hands to reveal the extent of the bandages.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tried to commit suicide.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
The Young Detective laughs. Atwood whirls on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's so funny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<YOUNG_DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eh... I... I don't know, I heard it was because you were drunk and got into a fight with a fish tank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood sticks her finger into the Young Detective's chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you gonna believe? Me or the fucking fish?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<YOUNG_DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eh... you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_DETECTIVE>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood turns and leaves the Men.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
(under his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's nuts!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_DETECTIVE>
<SNYDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And rich.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNYDER>
<DIRECTION>
They catch up to Atwood who has squatted down to examine the lock on the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<SNYDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are some scratches in the side door cylinder. Other than that no signs of forced entry. The alarm was armed and we even had to cut the security chains to get in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNYDER>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
(straightens up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This guy hasn't been active for over two years...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
She enters the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MURDER HOUSE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the way Atwood looks at her surroundings as she crosses the Living Room we get the feel that this Woman misses nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... we think he's either dead or in jail on some other charge. This is probably a copycat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
Detective Snyder points her down the Hall toward the Bedroom and follows.
</DIRECTION>
<SNYDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why we called you. You're the God that tells us peons if we have a simple murder here or something we can dump on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNYDER>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>

<DIRECTION>
Atwood arrives in the doorway of the BEDROOM where the murders took place and stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bodies of the dance Couple are now on the floor. The Man is propped up against the bed in a sitting position. The Woman has her head in the Man's crotch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almost like Mr. Brooks, Atwood's nostrils flare, but in Atwood's case it's not the scent of death that arouses her but it's like she's searching for the scent of her prey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a glance she memorizes the Room, then steps inside.

The Crime Scene TECHNICIANS shift to accommodate Atwood's inspection.

	<DIALOGUE>
	He always rearranges the bodies, but this is out of character. He has never left them in such a crude position. Usually it's more romantic with their arms around each other, kissing, their mouths open, their tongues touching.

<SNYDER>

	So we have a copycat?

</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
Snyder points to a bare space of wall above the bed. Atwood leans in to look at two bloody 'thumbprints' placed side by side.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One his one hers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<SNYDER>

</SNYDER>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
There are two holes gouged into the plaster of the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<SNYDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bullets went completely through the victims. The killer recovered the slugs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNYDER>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood unfolds and after another look around the room goes to the window and cracks the curtains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's the four story Apartment Building across the alley, its windows staring down at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were these open or closed when you got here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<SNYDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Closed.

Atwood tries the cord, the curtains are stuck.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
She returns her attention to the murder scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It has never been revealed to the public that the Thumbprint Killer retrieves the slugs.

</SNYDER>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't fucking need this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
She doubles back and cracks the curtains for another look at the four story Apartment Building.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you checked the tenants of that building?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<SNYDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only a few of them are home, they say they didn't see anything. We checked the whole neighborhood, so far nobody saw a thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNYDER>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood nods and turns back to the bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leaving them like this, he must have been angry at them for some reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches down and runs a hand over the carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where would they keep their vacuum cleaner.

</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
A puzzled Snyder follows her out of the room.

INT. PANTRY - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood opens a service closet. There's the Vacuum Cleaner.

<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>

	I'll bet you a hundred bucks, Snyder, there is no bag in that vacuum cleaner.

</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<SNYDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no idea what you're looking for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNYDER>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood unzips the cover. There is no bag inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He vacuumed the house and took the bag.

	Oh, shit. That is scary smart.

Detective Atwood is standing on an empty capped plastic gallon milk carton looking over the fence into the back yard of the Murder House. Snyder has his hand on her back to steady her.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
He releases her. She hops down and directs her attention at the four story Apartment Building.

<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our best hope is if someone in there saw something.

</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
When he rejoins the circle, Marshall is there to greet him.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're such a fucking hypocrite. If you were honest you would step out there and say 'Hi, I'm Earl. I killed two people last night and I really got off on it, but I need your help to be cured.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm different Marshall, I won't argue that with you. This is the only place that has ever helped me be normal and I've been straight up until last night for the past two years. I'm not going to kill again and I'm not going to quit coming here because it upsets you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah but for the next 29 days you're going to have to step out there and say 'Hi, I'm Earl, I'm an addict.' And everybody will know you fell off the wagon. Don't you feel stupid doing that?

INT. BROOKS BOX FACTORY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's loud. We follow a thin piece of cardboard as one machine deals it off the bottom of a stack into the maw of another machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That machine prints one side of the cardboard blue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is handed off to the third machine which cuts the flaps. The fourth machine folds and glues those flaps and spits the piece of cardboard out onto a conveyor belt as a box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wearing safety glasses and ear protectors along with his business suit, Mr. Brooks picks up the box and hands it to one of three similarly attired MEN, standing nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is not the top of the line or the bottom, but for the money we're talking about this is the quality I can provide you.

</MR_BROOKS>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just listen to me. What would happen to the business if, God forbid, something happened to you? Mom would probably have to sell to strangers. I'm willing to start at the bottom, you can treat me as a regular employee, I want to learn everything there is to know about running the box business, and then when the time comes, the business would stay in the family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's sweet, but you're talking about emotion, not business. In fact your mother and I came very close to selling out last year.

Mr. Brooks can now see the contents of the envelope.

Two snapshot-size PHOTOS taken with a high speed digital camera. One shows the right side of Mr. Brooks's cheek.

He is in no way identifiable, but that blur of flesh appears to be looking at the dead dance Couple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second Photo is a clear shot of Mr. Brooks closing the curtains with the dead dance Couple behind him.

Neither Mr. Brooks's voice or his face betray the enormity of what he's looking at.

<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucky me. What is it that I can help you with?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been watching that Couple for months, they liked to make love with the blinds open. Sometimes I would take pictures, you know, visual aides for later. It was fun, it was a great way to get off; I thought, until I saw you kill them. I have to tell you I have never ever felt a rush like that ever. I know you're the Thumbprint killer, you've done this before. What I want is to go with you the next time you kill someone. And I would like that to be soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
From the end of the table, Marshall cackles a laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you were worried that this was going to be unpleasant. The answer is simple. Just tell him you've decided never to kill again and he'll go away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You enjoy watching me suffer, don't you?

</MR_BROOKS>
<MARSHALL>

	He put them in a safety deposit box but I'll bet the box is at the bank where he has his checking account and the key is on his keychain. He really wants to do this, he's not going to go to the cops.

EXT. DOWNTOWN CHICAGO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Detective Atwood comes out of the CROWD on the sidewalk and enters a Highrise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LAW OFFICES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood and her ATTORNEYS, a gray-haired Man in his 60's, and an Asian Woman about the same age as Atwood are on one side of the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JESSE, Atwood's soon to be ex-husband, very handsome, slightly younger than Atwood, and SHEILA, his attractive divorce lawyer, sit across from them.
</DIRECTION>
<ASIAN_ATTORNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've talked to our client and we've come up with a number that we feel is more than fair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASIAN_ATTORNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood is not happy with this. The Attorney slides a sheet of paper to Sheila. She turns it over. On it is written: $750,000 -.
</DIRECTION>
<ASIAN_ATTORNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can have a check for that amount in your office by 6 o'clock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASIAN_ATTORNEY>
<SHEILA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We told you at the beginning what we want and that hasn't changed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEILA>
<GRAY_HAIRED_ATTORNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know as well as I do, Counselor, if we go to court you're not going to get a million five.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAY_HAIRED_ATTORNEY>
<SHEILA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Let's see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEILA>
<DIRECTION>
She holds up the front page of the Chicago Tribune. "THE HANGMAN ESCAPES" story is circled in red.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEILA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the front page of yesterday's paper...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reads)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Hangman Escapes'... eh... now, here it is... 'after torturing the young women, Thorton Meeks would hang them in public places - church steeples, balconies, Freeway overpasses'... Your client captured Mr. Meeks. This is just one example of the cases my client lived through when he was married to your client.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEILA>
<ASIAN_ATTORNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your client knew Detective Atwood was a homicide detective when he married her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASIAN_ATTORNEY>
<SHEILA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he had no idea of the mental anguish that being in close proximity to her work would cause him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEILA>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the mental anguish I went through being in close proximity to him. Who's gonna pay me for that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<ASIAN_ATTORNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't need to get into this, Tracy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASIAN_ATTORNEY>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, we do. I was the one who paid for everything while we were married, and now I'm being asked to give him a bonus for spending time with me when I've already paid for it in the first place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Atwood)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tracy, this is not a lot of money for you, and you know how upset I was when Meeks said that he was going to escape and he would come back and kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<SHEILA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're quite willing to find out what a court would think that mental anguish is worth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEILA>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesse... Darling?... you know the best thing that could happen to me right now? That you get hit by a truck and die.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You've threatened my client, we're going to ask for a restraining order, and we'll see you in court.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEILA>
<DIRECTION>
The door closes behind them.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moonlight seeps around the blinds to reveal Mr. Smith asleep in bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beyond the open BEDROOM door down the hall is only darkness until the eruption of illumination from a penlight momentarily outlines the figure of a Man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then we're looking at what the penlight sees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A keyring. Hands in surgical gloves isolate the - safety deposit key - and press it into a soft wax block where it leaves its impression. The light goes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the BEDROOM at the end of the hallway, Mr. Smith begins to snore. The Figure coasts silently toward the sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Smith's face is sideways on the pillow. The snores and a little drool burbles out of the corner of his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOMP!! The impact of something landing on the bed bounces Mr. Smith upright and awake.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahhh!!! Ahhh!!! Ahhh!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
The beam from the penlight hits him in the face. He raises his hands to shield his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, if I were here to kill you, you would already be dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
The penlight leaves Mr. Smith and Mr. Brooks places it deliberately under his own chin casting long sinister shadows up his face. He's sitting on the bed next to Mr. Smith.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After you left today, I realized our friendship was a little one- sided. So when we meet tomorrow night would you be so kind as to bring all of the pictures and the memory card from your camera. That way we can like each other simply for who we are. If you don't show up, I will presume you've gone to the police and I will kill you. Even if I go to jail because of you, someone will find you wherever you are and kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
The penlight goes off. There's total silence.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
(squeaks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Brooks?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
He squints into the black.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Brooks?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
Finally he gathers the courage to extend a shaky hand. The bedside lamp goes on. The room is empty. Cautiously Mr. Smith swings his legs out of bed and stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He forces himself to go to the door and from there curls his arm around the jamb into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The HALL light is dazzling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A peek into the BATHROOM shows there is nobody there. He continues on into the LIVING ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His camera equipment is on the table. The tripod is still set up. There is no sign of Mr. Brooks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Smith eyes the front door. It's closed and the 'security chain' is in place!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another quick scan of the room. It sure seems that he's alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the front door the length of the chain and looks up and down the hallway. It's empty. Slowly he closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing in the light of his LIVING ROOM, Mr. Smith is more scared and strangely more excited than he's ever been in his life.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow!...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BROOKS HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a robe and pajamas, Mr. Brooks comes down the HALLWAY carrying a glass of milk. The door to his Daughter's ROOM is partly open. By the nightlight in the plug at the head of the bed he can see she's asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks walks to the bed, leans over and kisses his Daughter on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>

INT. BROOKS HOUSE - MORNING

<DIRECTION>
Dressed for work and a smile on his face, Mr. Brooks comes down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the BREAKFAST ROOM, the mood is decidedly different. His Wife and Daughter are leaning against opposite walls staring at the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong?

<EMMA>

	Ask your daughter what the real reason is she dropped out of school.

</JANE>
<EMMA>

	I'm pregnant.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to her Mother)

Mr. Brooks's eyes find Emma's. Almost imperceptibly she shakes her head 'no'.

<MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
(to his Daughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. I'm sorry. I said it wrong. I'm not trying to tell you what to do. I'm trying to say that a grandchild would be a wonderful gift for your mother and me.

Large and small Color Photographs pinned to a corkboard create a Collage of the dance Couple murder scene.

	It's not what's here, it's what's not here that's interesting. There's not a trace of anything foreign. If I didn't know better I'd say these people were killed by a ghost.

<DIRECTION>
Atwood is waiting for an elevator. It arrives. The doors open. The car is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood gets in and presses the key for her destination, then slumps into a corner for the ride. The doors close. The elevator begins to move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All at once Atwood screams. Her pent-up anger and frustration rip the air and she goes nuts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She punches the wall of the elevator, kicks it, throws herself to the other side, bangs her head against that wall, punches it, kicks it, all the while screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the tears come. The screams stop and she settles upright against the back wall, where she strikes her chest repeatedly with the flat of her closed hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is wrong with me? What is wrong with me? What is wrong with me?

EXT. MURDER HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's raining. The yellow Police tape that still circles the yard snaps in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up the driveway, out of sight of all the other homes, there's a movement at the side door of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A closer inspection reveals that it's Detective Atwood. From under her umbrella she studies her surroundings and as if she's speaking to the killer, she speaks to herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you choose them because of where they lived or how they looked or what jobs they had? Or did you just pick them because at the instant you saw them, you had decided to kill someone? The side door was perfect. No one could see you pick the lock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
With a key she lets herself in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parked against the curb opposite the driveway of the Murder House is an old green Pontiac Convertible with the top up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver's window is down and from inside a WOMAN, late 20's, is watching the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MURDER HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood stops in the PANTRY almost in the exact spot where Mr. Brooks stopped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The quiet is filled by the rain drumming on the roof. The wind rattles the windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you know where they were in the house?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
She steps into the KITCHEN. On the way across she bumps into a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's darker tonight than it was on your night. But still how did you manage not to bump into the furniture? Did you have a little light? That would be too dangerous. I'll bet you were in the house before. So I should ask the neighbors if they saw a meter reader around the house or a telephone repairman or someone from the gas company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
These musings take her through the LIVING ROOM to the entrance of the HALLWAY where she pauses and looks both ways.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Once again, how did you know where they were? Did you check the rooms before you found them? She had his semen in her vagina, they had just made love, did you hear them or was there a light on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
She steps into the HALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And when did you bag the gun? Because even though I'm sure you're an expert at it, there's still a chance of noise from the plastic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
She continues down the HALL to the BEDROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was the door open or did you have to open it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the door and goes in.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were they asleep or awake? Was the light on, or did you turn it on? Because I know you, you wouldn't risk a shot in the dark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
She turns on the overhead light.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bright. What if it wasn't that light that was on, but this one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
She turns on a bedside light and goes back to the door and turns off the overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
If the dance Couple were on the bed and their blood was not on the wall, the room would look exactly the way it did when Mr. Brooks said 'hello'.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's better... What thrill do you get by killing people? Is it sexual, is it hate, is it power? Do you feel remorse? Probably that part of your brain doesn't exist. Do you have emotions of love or affection or joy? Or have you learned to fake them so you won't stand out in a crowd.

She's at the window now, feeling the curtains.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if these are stuck closed because you yanked them closed? Which means they were open when you came into the room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
She separates the fabric and looks out the rain-streaked window at the four story building across the alley. There are lights on in almost all the apartment windows.

<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If Mr. and Miss Normal made love with the curtains open and the lights on, someone in that building noticed them and may have seen you.

She allows the fabric to drop back into place and turns to look at the bed.

</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
A door is closed. We come to the corner and are looking down a HALLWAY at Atwood coming toward us. We move to her and arrive just as she raises her fist to knock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before she can, the door opens and she and Mr. Smith who is on his way out of his Apartment are surprised that the other one is suddenly there. Each one takes a half step back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phwap! The manila envelope that was wedged under Mr. Smith's left arm hits the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! You scared me.

Through the open door, Atwood can see Mr. Smith's camera on a table and the collapsed tripod leaning against the wall.

	Oh, yes in the house across the alley...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you happen to see anything unusual or suspicious that night around that house? Anything at all?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Smith puts on his thinking expression and pauses a little bit before:
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... I wondered that when I heard what happened, but... no.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, I'm meeting someone and I don't want to be late.

He moves into the Hallway closing the door behind him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish I could be of more help, but sorry.

</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
Watching him walk away amid the crinkle of his raincoat, Detective Atwood, maybe because of her woman's intuition or maybe because she's a good cop, wonders what is in that manila envelope under his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The thought is gone almost as soon as it comes and she faces about to the next door.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Hunched against the rain, Mr. Smith is acutely aware of the traffic. His eyes strain to see the Occupants of each passing car. He doesn't give a second thought to the older non- descript Toyota parked against the far curb.

Mr. Brooks is in the driver's seat. Marshall is in the back. They're both tracking the progress of Mr. Smith.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Honk!! Honk!! Mr. Smith looks around. He's not sure that sound was for him. But when the Toyota honks again and flashes it's lights, Mr. Smith waves and splashes to the center of the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even though he stops to let it pass, a car sounds its horn and swerves to avoid him. Mr. Smith crosses behind the Toyota and opens the passenger door.

Mr. Smith fumbles with the buttons and zipper on his raincoat.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>

	I never trust those guys, when they say it's going to be clear it always rains and when they say it's going to rain, it's sunny.

He comes up with the manila envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>

Mr. Brooks takes it and hefts it.

Mr. Brooks favors him with a wolfish smile.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I do. But it's my hope that once you get to know me better you'll feel comfortable in giving me all that I've asked for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sounds fair. Oh, I almost forgot. I thought you might be interested in this.

His hand comes forward with a card.

<MR_SMITH>

	It's the policewoman who's looking for you.

Marshall snaps forward from the back seat.

	Wow! We've never known anyone who's looking for us before.

Mr. Brooks pinches the rectangle of paper away from Mr. Smith for a closer view.

Mr. Smith interrupts Mr. Brooks's focus on Detective Atwood's card.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what do we do now? What's the plan for the evening?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks slips the envelope under the seat and starts the car.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We drive around until we see someone we think we might enjoy killing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? That's it? I thought you might already have someone in mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't enjoy this, Mr. Smith. I do it because I'm addicted to it. And before you entered my life I had vowed I would never kill again. So this is your party, you can chose anyone you want and we'll do it together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can it be someone I know?
	</DIALOGUE>

Detective Atwood is on her way out the Outer Door when the hair on the back of her neck stands on end.

<DIRECTION>
Footsteps can be heard running toward her through the rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her hand goes under her jacket and comes out holding a Glock 9mm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sidesteps out of the light into the grayness at the edge of the doorway.
</DIRECTION>

Now she sees the RUNNER. A hood hides the face. She can't tell if it's a Man or a Woman.
</DIRECTION>

Detective Atwood thumbs the Glock's safety to the 'off' position.

The Runner passes, white breath coming from an unseen mouth.

Mr. Brooks and Mr. Smith watch the DRIVER come around the front of another car before entering the store.

Detective Atwood is the only one in the water. Up and down she goes with a long smooth stroke flipping the turns. She's not swimming for pleasure, she's working out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The underwater lights cast rippling shadows on the walls and ceiling and since they are the only illumination, the room feels spooky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood's fingers touch the wall. She raises her head to check her time, then takes off her goggles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hanging onto the gutter she tries to catch her breath, lowers herself under the surface, blows a lungful of bubbles, comes up to face LARRY, a Man slightly younger than she is, in a beautiful suit, perched on the edge of the deck looking down at her.

He has a dress on a hangar over one shoulder and a pair of shoes dangling from the fingers of his other hand.

</LARRY>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>

	I did something like that except I was the one who took the test. It wasn't math, a friend of mine was a theology major and needed a second language to get into the Master's program...

Atwood smiles, her fingers find Larry's and they intertwine.

The view floats over the balcony.

As it slowly drops, the PEOPLE on the dance floor, Couple by Couple, disappear until there are only three Couples left, one of them is Atwood and Larry. Her head is on his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a slow dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Larry is very good and wherever he leads, Atwood easily follows. The lights begin to dim and we move in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Larry touches his lips to Atwood's neck. She arches back and he kisses her neck again and again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His lips move up and find hers, and we are now close on the kiss. Gently the lips separate and we slowly retreat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking into her eyes, Larry traces her lips with a finger, then replaces that finger with his tongue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His lips brush a cheek, down her neck to where it meets her shoulder, his teeth close softly on the muscle, by now we are far enough away to realize that Atwood and Larry have no clothes on and we are:

What light there is, is coming from a room we can't see.

Larry nibbles at Atwood collarbone, kisses a breast, strokes his hands down her sides. She shivers. He brushes his lips back and forth across her stomach and then down to where the flesh of her belly meets her pubic hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's watching all of this in a mirror on the opposite wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he sinks to his knees and buries his head between her legs. From low in her throat, Atwood moans. We lose sight of the Couple as we move around a corner.

It's dark. Atwood is propped up against the headboard, the sheet pulled up over her breasts.

INT. OFFICE - CERAMICS STUDIO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's crammed with file cabinets. Sketches for pottery pieces are taped to the walls along with photos of Mr. Brooks, Jane and Emma.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks, clad only in a T-shirt and underwear, is sitting in front of a computer. Marshall, dressed as he usually is, is in a chair at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are both staring at the monitor where on one side of the screen is Detective Atwood's Police ID photo, on the other side of the screen, Mr. Brooks is scrolling through her personnel file.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	.... Huh... her father's Gerald Atwood, why does that ring a bell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone you did business with, someone we killed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not someone we killed... MBA... College of William and Mary... she's been a cop for eleven years... Married Doctor Carlson, divorced Dr. Carlson, married Jesse Vialo... restaurateur... separated from Jesse Vialo, sued for support by Jesse Vialo, seeing a shrink because of Jesse Vialo...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellent fitness report though.

	She caught the Hangman, the guy that escaped the other day...

	<DIALOGUE>
	I wonder what the deal was with her and Jesse Vialo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks taps a key that minimizes Atwood's file then drags it to the right hand corner. In the middle of a key stroke it hits him:
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahhhh... now I remember. Her father, Gerald Atwood, never did business with him but Emma and I met him a couple times, big political fundraiser. He owns or owned one of the largest insurance groups in the country and a lot of other stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
Tap, tap, tap. Jesse Vialo's Driver's license comes up.

	Wouldn't she have to declare any outside income and holdings to the Police?

<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
He restores Atwood's file. Tap, tap, tap, tap. Stop. The Men study the screen then look at each other.

<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Opera didn't get much.

	I like that about her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're such a fucking snob, Earl. You like her because she's rich.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I like her because she found something that's hers. It's not the family business. And she's good at it. I'd like Jane to find something that's hers and that she could be good at.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's exactly why Atwood scares the shit out of me. She's a cop who doesn't need the money and she's looking for us. That's one fucking dangerous human being.

	<DIALOGUE>
	The fact that you're not wrong doesn't make me admire her any less.

EXT. SIDEWALK - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood strides toward her car. The PEDESTRIAN traffic is light. It's too early for the stores to be open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead a BROWN VAN is idling at the curb, the sliding side door is open. Atwood can see inside. Empty except for some furniture blankets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Person in the Driver's seat turns to look into the back. It's the Woman who was watching Atwood outside the Murder House. Her hands are unseen in leather gloves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up and their eyes meet. Two strangers. The contact is instantly broken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood takes a deep breath and smiles. After the rain, the air is brisk and clean. It's good to be alive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLAM!!! Atwood is body-checked by a Man who springs out of the recess of a doorway. His arms wrap around her, she's lifted off her feet and the Man throws himself and her into the Van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BROWN VAN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oooff!! The wind is knocked out of Atwood when she lands left shoulder first on the furniture blankets, the Man on top of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Man is Thorton Meeks, the Hangman, six feet, a solid two hundred pounds. He's also wearing tight leather gloves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Brown Van accelerates fast away from the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BROWN VAN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His body crushing hers, Meeks kisses Atwood's cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<MEEKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Surprise, surprise, Tracy. I told you I was coming back to get you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEEKS>
<DIRECTION>
He frees his right hand and pulls his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<MEEKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I already know where I'm gonna hang you. But first I'm gonna watch her...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicates the Driver)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... have some fun with you, then she's gonna watch me have some fun with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEEKS>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her again and puts the gun to Atwood's head.
</DIRECTION>
<MEEKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, don't move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEEKS>
<DIRECTION>
He raises up and straddles her.
</DIRECTION>
<MEEKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know the drill, I'm gonna put the cuffs on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEEKS>
<DIRECTION>
With his left hand he fishes a pair of handcuffs from a back pocket and snaps them on Atwood's right wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<MEEKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now the left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEEKS>
<DIRECTION>
He rolls Atwood on her back and with the chain of the handcuff pulls her right arm toward her left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All Meeks' talk has allowed Atwood to catch her breath and suddenly she jerks her head up into the gun and screams at the top of her lungs.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SHOOT ME!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
At the same time she pulls hard against the handcuff with her right wrist. A startled Meeks is thrown off balance. The gun comes away from Atwood's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her left arm now free, Atwood swings her palm with all of her might into Meeks' right ear. POP!! His eardrum breaks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aaaggh!! He instinctually reaches to cover the damaged ear with his gun hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Driver doubles around to see what's happening. From outside, HOONNNKK!! The Driver's attention returns to the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood swings again. This time she snags the barrel of the gun and using it as a lever bends Meeks' hand back on the wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM! The gun goes off. Neither one of them is hit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the same time Atwood pulls hard on the handcuff that Meeks is holding in his left hand and twists into him. This dislodges Meeks and he's off of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snarling like animals they fight for the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRACK! Atwood's leverage breaks Meeks' trigger finger. His grip loosens on the weapon. She pulls it out of his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A quick push skitters it across the floor. It drops through the open side door into the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood rolls away and reaches for her ankle gun. Now it's Meeks' turn. A sharp tug on the chain of the handcuff stalls her motion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He flicks his other arm and a switchblade is delivered into his right hand. Snap!! The blade comes out. Atwood is reaching again for her ankle gun. She sees the flash of metal and flings her head back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luckily all she receives is a deep gash above her right eye. Blood immediately begins to cascade over her brow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meeks grins and gives another sharp tug on the handcuff to pull Atwood into the range of his knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With one foot Atwood kicks at him, with the other she pushes off and propels herself backward to grab a handful of the Driver's hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood's weight hinges the Driver's head back until she's looking at the ceiling. Her scream is equal parts pain and surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Brown Van veers into the on-coming traffic. The Driver of the car dead ahead swerves. The Van solidly clips the rear of that car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BROWN VAN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sudden deceleration of that impact slingshots Atwood and Meeks forward. She hits the back of the Driver's seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meeks has further to go. He loses his hold on the handcuffs and smashes into the passenger seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her right hand now free, Atwood scratches for the gun on her hip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Careening across its lane, the Van sideswipes a parked car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BROWN VAN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That impact rips Atwood's hand out of the Driver's hair and sends her sliding on her knees toward the side door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On her way she unclips her gun and is bringing it out of her holster when Meeks who has managed to hang onto the passenger seat sees this and slams a foot into her chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood is launched backward out the side door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In slow motion Atwood flies through the air while at normal speed the Van is leaving her behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH! Butt first, Atwood hammers into the back window of a parked car. The shattering glass breaks her fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Groggily she rolls out of the indentation. Gun still in hand and blood covering one side of her face she slides off the car to stand in the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Van is nowhere in sight.

INT. TOYOTA - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Behind the wheel, Mr. Brooks is again wearing his Pottery- Throwing clothes. Mr. Smith is in the passenger seat and Marshall is leaning forward from the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're all focused to varying degrees on the Entrance to the store. Mr. Smith raises his watch for a look at the time.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe he went home with someone else.

<DIRECTION>
The silence returns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All three Men idly observe an old green Pontiac convertible with a frayed top and paint peeling, come into the Lot and park two spaces away facing them. We saw this car last watching Atwood from outside the Murder House.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The headlights go off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Driver's door opens. The Woman who was with Meeks in the Van steps out and hurries toward the Drug Store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She of course means nothing to Mr. Brooks but in the brief seconds the domelight is on, he catches sight of the Man in the passenger seat. A memory tickles his brain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to Marshall.

The Man they are waiting for is coming down the steps of the store. On the way to his Pickup he takes off a Manager's smock.

<MR_SMITH>

<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I was a little abrupt back there, but let me explain. Finding someone you think would be fun to kill is a bit like falling in love. You meet a lot of candidates, and you like some of them and they're nice, but they're not right; and then that special one shows up and your heart beats faster and you know that's the one. The man in the pickup did not make my heart beat faster.

	You see? That's my problem. That makes me feel like I'm being jerked around, Mr. Brooks. I thought it was happening last night, then it was happening tonight. And now it's "Let's see how it plays out". I feel like you're planning to back out on our deal and I don't like that feeling at all.

Mr. Brooks is in a chair off to one side watching everything.

For him the conversation is merely a burble of voices. He studies his daughter while she answers a question.

	It could have been tracked in by a friend.

INT. CERAMICS STUDIO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a hidden lever, Mr. Brooks lowers casters under the kiln and rolls it aside to reveal a Combination Safe imbedded in the concrete floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spins the dial, opens the Safe and extracts four quadruple- pocketed plastic sleeves which he lines up in front of himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each sleeve contains a Driver's License, two Credit cards and cash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pictures on the Driver's Licenses are of Mr. Brooks, but you wouldn't immediately recognize him because of the disguises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he's trying to decide which of the four Identities would be best for what he has in mind, Marshall comes forward to look over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The thing that bothers me about this, besides the fact we're not prepared, and a multitude of other things, is what does Mr. Smith do when he's walking west tonight and you don't show up. That little freak could flip out.

Mr. Brooks chooses the first sleeve and the third sleeve. The other two go back into the Safe.

It's in an Industrial Park.

Mr. Smith exits one of the doors and continues on into the Parking Lot to a moderately expensive foreign car sitting in a space identified by a sign which reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Baffert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He squeezes the 'disarm' button on his key chain. The car chirps twice and he opens the door. Bending his knees to get in, he stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a section of Newspaper wedged in the steering wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When his brain unlocks he straightens up and moving only the top of his body, makes a quick recon of the surrounding area and his back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing threatening seen, he eases into the seat. Slam! The door is closed and locked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Gingerly, Mr. Smith removes the Newspaper. It folds open. On the first page there are words circled in red.

He inserts the key into the ignition.

RAP-RAP!! There's a sudden sharp KNOCK!!, on the Driver's window.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So Mr. Baffert, what is that you have to tell me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean? I don't have anything to tell you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Because I was driving around and I got this sudden feeling that you had something to tell me about the murders.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's disappointing. Because when I left you the last time we talked, I felt I had missed a clue that was right in front of me that would solve this whole case.

<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know why you would feel that.

<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I said I was an amateur photographer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you positive? Because we found potter's clay on the carpet of the murder house and I was sure you said to me that you worked with clay, that you made pots.
	</DIALOGUE>

<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I said my hobby was photography, not pottery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>

	Maybe that was it. The Stewardess upstairs said the victims kept their curtains open when they made love. Could I see some of the pictures you took of that Couple?

</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Smith can only stare at Detective Atwood. His Adam's apple moves up and down though he makes no sound. Should he or shouldn't he?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally he throws his arms up in a shrug but in his half-turn of indecision he happens to spy the Newspaper he tossed at the passenger seat of his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Part of it is draped over the console. The red circles around the words on that page jump out at him.

<MR_SMITH>

	You are harassing me, Detective Atwood. You know very well I'm not a potter and I don't have any pictures! So my feeling is that your feeling is wrong and that you should move your car and let me go home.

In his Pottery-Throwing clothes, Mr. Brooks is behind the wheel.

There's an Ace Hardware Store bag sitting upright and open on the passenger seat. We peek over the edge of the bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A brand new hatchet with a gleaming blade sits at the bottom.

Mr. Brooks adjusts the rearview mirror. Marshall is on the passenger side of the back seat.

It's dark. There's barely enough ambient light to see that we are close on the knob of the Front Door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From outside we hear the muffled sound of a Black & Decker cordless drill and the knob begins to vibrate. Someone is drilling the lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound stops. The knob turns. The door opens. A flashlight is shone into our face.

EXT. HIGH CEILING BUNGALOW - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
From the protection of the doorjamb, a very young UNIFORMED POLICEMAN is the person shining the flashlight into the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's flanked on either side of the door by Detective Atwood and Detective Snyder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Officer's flashlight illuminates a short ENTRYWAY with a HALL immediately off to the left and the LIVING ROOM fading into darkness, straight ahead.

Flashlight in her left hand and the Glock in her right, Detective Atwood is the first one across the threshold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She directs the beam at the wall next to the door; finds the light switch. Click! Click! Click.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lights don't work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
She continues to the Hall. The darkness is so oppressive there, it seems that her stream of light must struggle to pierce it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Room at the end is the KITCHEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With Snyder hanging in the Entryway to protect her back, Atwood eases the hand with the flashlight around the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dishwasher, the sink, the cabinets gleam dully back at her. She steps inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A debris field of empty pharmaceutical boxes and vials trails away from the Refrigerator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her flashlight sweeps the rest of the Room. Beyond an open countertop in the DINING AREA, the light blurs past an oval of white, and then comes back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the face of a WOMAN!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Careful of the litter, Atwood moves forward until she can see that the Woman is sitting in a chair at the far end of the dining table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her throat has been cut. Her head is being held upright by her hair which is taped to the back of the chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She has a pen taped between her fingers, but the Appointment Book in front of her is drenched in blood.
</DIRECTION>

Atwood swings her light back onto the dead Woman. The combined illumination of the flashlights cause the support joists twelve feet up to throw eerie shadows onto the open ceiling.

The smell of blood and the sight of the carnage is too much for him. His gorge rises and he gags.

Atwood retraces her steps in the Kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>

	Meeks is a steroid freak. This Refrigerator was always full of steroids. Mona was Alvin Griffin's niece, receptionist, lover and keeper of the keys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
She focuses her flashlight on an open padlock dangling from a steel band that runs around the Refrigerator. With the barrel of the Glock she opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The only edibles inside are a tomato, half a loaf of bread, a package of hotdogs and some part of a chicken in a KFC box. The rest of the space is vacant.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>

	Well, the steroids are certainly gone.

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood and her flashlight pass us. Three feet to her right and slightly behind is Snyder and his flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two Detectives are leaving the Living Room and entering the HALL toward the bedrooms. The ceiling is low here and it feels very claustrophobic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead is a Door painted red.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But before they get to it, there's a Room on the right. Snyder shines his light in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a BATHROOM. The shower curtain is open. Nobody in the tub.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Door ahead is waiting, but there's another Door on the right. Snyder shines his light in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This one is a Treatment Room with a Therapy table and shelves of oils and unguents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They've come to the red Door. Atwood will open this one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns the knob and pushes. The Door is stuck. She and Snyder exchange a look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snyder shuffles back half a step and flattens himself against the wall. He shuts off his flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood takes a deep breath, levers her weight against the door and pushes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a sudden Snap! Then the door swings freely open. The beam of Atwood's flashlight reveals a large room containing a bed, a dresser, a...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREEEKKK!!! The sound is coming from up in the rafters. Atwood whips her flashlight in that direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For an instant the beam catches a piece of a large shape falling fast right at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then it's lost in the darkness and then picked up again in the reflected light in the Hall. The shape is a naked Man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHACK!! The Man nails Atwood in the shoulder. BANG! Her gun goes off. She bounces into the wall and onto her ass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barely slowed the Man continues in an upward arc. His feet and knees slam into the ceiling. Plaster dust rains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Man swings back, past Snyder. He's lost in the darkness again. Then he swings back into the light and comes to a stop just inside the bedroom Door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Man is hanging from a rope around his neck. He's dead. His Body is festooned with syringes stuck into his bare flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In fact two of the needles hold a sheet of paper to the Man's chest. Printed on the paper in big black letters are the words:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Another suitcase goes down and Atwood finds what she's looking for - a framed color 8 x 10 photo of her husband, Jesse. He's in a business suit and holding some kind of trophy.

The phones stop ringing.

	Meeks' finger-prints were all over the chiropractor, the note, refrigerator, he's the guy we should be looking for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNYDER>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look where? Please tell me. Everyone knows who Meeks is and is looking for him. The chiropractor was the last link to his old life that I know of. The only way we'll find him, now, is if someone turns him in or we trip over him at a bus stop. On the other hand, Detective Snyder, no one knows who the Thumbprint Killer is or where he is. However, I have a fucking hunch this guy Baffert does. I have two days to play that hunch. If you feel like you're wasting your time with me, I'd be happy to do it alone.

</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is my case, what you're doing is fucked. But since I can't stop you, and she won't, here's a tip. James Baffert, you should stake him out, he knows something.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE

Mr. Brooks is at his desk.

The lamp at his elbow throws a yellow cone across his face. His head is in his hands, he's been crying.

Marshall steps out of the shadows behind him.

He reaches into a bottom drawer and as he takes out an envelope, Marshall reads the tear-stained hand written letter resting on the blotter.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear Emma and Jane, my loves, I have a terminal illness and instead of subjecting you to my deterioration, I have decided to disappear. Don't try to find me, I don't want to be found. Please believe that the time I spent with you brought me the greatest joy of my life. Love. Dad.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the sidewalk Mr. Smith is walking toward the on-coming traffic. The headlights make it difficult to tell one car from the other until they pass. That doesn't keep him from looking for Mr. Brooks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The houses stop and he's passing a pocket park. In a dark space between the street lamps, a hand falls on Mr. Smith's shoulder. He jumps and a scream squeaks out of his throat. It's Mr. Brooks, in his Pottery-Throwing clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you ready to rock and roll, Mr. Smith?

	I smell gun oil, a gun oil that's different than yours.
	</DIALOGUE>

	He brought his gun. After he gets what he wants he plans to kill me.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah... now I get it. You were counting on that, weren't you?

</MARSHALL>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It has a certain logic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if your plan is to have him kill you, why do you have to kill someone else first?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll need to see that to get up the courage to kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
Marshall roars with laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not even you believe that, Earl. It makes it more exciting, doesn't it, to think he's going to kill you after you kill someone else. You're getting your rocks off big time, that's why you're doing it.

Coming up the back STAIRS we arrive at a LANDING and make a right. In front of us is Mr. Smith watching Mr. Brooks pick the deadbolt in the Service door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks straightens up, twists the handle and pushes the door inward. It's caught by a chain. He takes the bent rubber- tipped forceps from one pocket, from another he hands Mr. Smith a pair of latex gloves.

The gun with the silencer is already in his right hand. Both are encased in a Ziplock bag.
</DIRECTION>

Beside him, Mr. Smith is wide eyed with fear and anticipation. His teeth are even chattering.

<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks and Mr. Smith come out of the Kitchen. The LIVING ROOM is quite well appointed. There's a fire going in the Fireplace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of a T.V. is coming from a ROOM off a HALL up ahead. That is where Mr. Brooks and Mr. Smith are headed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're more than half way across the LIVING ROOM when DING! DONG!, the doorbell rings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Smith gasps and looks beseechingly at Mr. Brooks. Without an ounce of hurry, Mr. Brooks maneuvers him back into the shadows of the KITCHEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doorbell rings again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wet spot appears in Mr. Smith's crotch and runs down his pant leg. Pee drips onto the linoleum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Man comes out of the Hallway. The Living Room light goes on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Man is Jesse, Detective Atwood's estranged husband.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the Front Door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Woman who comes in is Sheila, his divorce lawyer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss, tongues. His hands brush over her breasts. He begins to unbutton her blouse. The kiss breaks. As he continues unbuttoning.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEILA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I called your wife's lawyer. They're thinking about the five million dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEILA>

Jesse opens the blouse and looks at the breasts under the bra.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Realistically how much do you think we can get?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheila gives him a quick kiss and moves on into the LIVING ROOM where she drops her briefcase on the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEILA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we go to court, best case, two, if she wants to settle, best case, three, but I would be happy with two seven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEILA>
<DIRECTION>
Backlit by the Fireplace, Jesse kisses her again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the KITCHEN, Mr. Brooks and Mr. Smith watch Jesse unzip Sheila's slacks and dropping to his knees peel them off her legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steps out of them. He kisses the inside of her thighs, her crotch, then standing up:
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
On his way out of the LIVING ROOM:
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we should hold firm for three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
He shuts off the light. In the glow of the Fireplace, Sheila removes her jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEILA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's not be piggish, two five, two seven, would be a good deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEILA>
<DIRECTION>
The T.V. goes silent. Jesse returns with a partially full glass of Champagne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hands Sheila a glass from a side table, takes a bottle out of an ice bucket and as he fills her glass:
</DIRECTION>
<SHEILA>

She bops him playfully. He bends and slips a nipple into his mouth. Sheila bites her lip and moans.

In the KITCHEN, Mr. Smith shifts around for a better view. The floor under him CRREEEKKS!

In the LIVING ROOM, both Sheila and Jesse react to the sound.

Detective Atwood hurries down the HALL and out of breath, stops in front of Mr. Smith's door. She raps sharply. Waits a bare three seconds and raps again.

</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<OLDER_WOMAN>

	He skipped out. I heard him leave this evening and a few minutes later there were Movers here. Musta been behind on the rent. He didn't even say good-bye.

<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>

As the Old Lady watches, Atwood tries the knob. It's unlocked. She pushes the door open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The HALLWAY and LIVING ROOM she can see are completely empty. Furniture, T.V., camera equipment, art, gone.

INT. MR. SMITH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

On her way in, Atwood draws her gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keeping close to the walls she audits the KITCHEN. All the Cabinet doors are open. Dishes, pots and pans, cutlery, gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She moves on to the BATHROOM. Soap, shampoo, toilet paper, toothpaste, toothbrushes, towels, washcloths, the contents of the Medicine Cabinet, gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She moves on to the BEDROOM. Bed, night table, lamps, T.V., computer, gone. Clothes closets, empty of everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around. Mr. Smith's entire Apartment has been stripped absolutely clean, except...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... there's a crumpled piece of paper in the far corner of the Bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood goes over and gets down on one knee. With her fingers pulling at the corners she is able to straighten the paper enough to make out that it's a work order from a Moving company.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reading it with the paper pinched between thumb and forefinger of her left hand, Atwood rises. There's the silhouette of a Man in the doorway behind her.
</DIRECTION>

Snyder never sees it coming. WHACK! Atwood's right cross nails him exactly where the jaw meets the neck and down he goes on his ass.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?!

<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're smart enough to figure that out, Mr. Brooks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well we're going sixty five miles an hour, Mr. Smith, if you shoot me now, there's a good chance we'll both die.

<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not now. Take the next off ramp.

He accelerates around a truck into the Fastlane. Mr. Smith can see the Exit coming up, it's quickly left behind.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
(matter of fact)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think about this. You pissed yourself back there, you left your DNA at the scene of a double homicide, and there's nothing to indicate that I was ever there. If the Cops do an analysis of that urine, and they will, you're the Thumbprint Killer.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I still have pictures of you doing the first murder.

Mr. Brooks smiles a knowing smile. Beyond him on the other side of the Divider, cars are zipping by in the opposite direction.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. But what were you doing at the second murder?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Smith doesn't have an answer for that.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me help you with a thought. You say I forced you to come along and if I'm not here or more specifically my body is not here to say different, you might have a chance to beat the rap. Now you're probably asking yourself why I would help you. I'm tired, Mr. Smith, I'm tired of killing. But I'm an addict, I can't quit. I've tried. I can't do it on my own. So I'll let you kill me but I want you to do it smart, in a way that I disappear and my family never knows what I was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<MR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do I do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SMITH>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a cemetery I know about. We find an open grave, you shoot me, I fall in the grave, you shovel in just enough earth to cover me, tomorrow a casket is lowered onto me and I've disappeared. It's a good plan. What do you say?...

	Why should I trust you?

Atwood crosses to the elevator. She pushes the call button. With an arthritic rattle the door opens.

INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

Mr. Brooks reaches into his pocket. Mr. Smith tightens his grip on the gun.

	Uh uh, take your hand out real slow.

INT. OLD DECO BUILDING - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Repeating their arthritic performance the elevator doors open. Atwood steps out into a wide sporadically lit HALLWAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peering at the numbers Atwood goes to her Left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the middle of the Hall behind her a Couple exits a Room and drifts to the other side of the Hall on their way to the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood re-checks the number on the Moving Company's Work Order - 517, she's going the wrong way. She turns around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Atwood and the Couple are walking toward each other on opposite sides of the Hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood steps into an area of light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The reflection off her face catches the attention of the Man who is wearing a wide brimmed hat. He lifts his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Thorton Meeks. The Woman with him was the Driver of the Van. She's wearing a watchcap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meeks gently takes his Companion's arm. They stop. Her eyes go to where he's looking and then back to his. At some unspoken signal they both draw their guns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Intent on finding 517 and Baffert, the Couple hasn't registered on Atwood's radar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! TWOCK! A chunk of plaster blows off the wall next to her head. Startled, Atwood winces away. BANG! The Woman fires. The slug explodes the plaster on the other side of Atwood's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Atwood is turning toward them, gun in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meeks fires. The bullet passes through Atwood's jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instinctively Atwood assumes a classic duelist's pose offering the smallest target possible. Calmly she squeezes off her first shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The plaster explodes from the wall above Meeks' head. The Woman fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hole appears in Atwood's sleeve. Atwood pulls the trigger again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMACK! The Woman screams and falls back into Meeks, a bullet in her hip. Atwood's third shot takes the hat off Meeks head. She now realizes who her attackers are.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Meeks?!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
Dragging the Woman in the direction of the stairs, BANG! Meeks fires. Maybe it's his broken trigger finger that affects his aim. The shots miss. BANG! BANG! The Woman fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood's next two shots miss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meeks and the Woman arrive at the stairs and before rounding the corner, BANG! BANG! BANG!, fire at Atwood who is now moving deliberately at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood doesn't try and dodge the bullets or flinch away from them and her shots are unhurried.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The next one catches the Woman in the side. The one after that nails Meeks in the left shoulder. He's spun into the Woman.

Atwood reaches the stairs and cheats a look around the corner. BANG! BANG! BANG! From the landing below, Meeks and the Woman fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood steps out from behind the wall and shoulders square, shoots. Another sidestep. This shot shatters Meeks' knee. He bellows in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving to the side again, Atwood shoots. But Meeks' knee has collapsed and he and the Woman are already tumbling down the next set of steps. Atwood waits. There's silence, then the murmur of voices.

Meeks and the Woman are propping themselves up against the wall on the LANDING below. Both of them still have their guns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The moment Meeks' eyes meet Atwood's, he puts his gun to the Woman heads. BANG!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood sucks in her breath.

Meeks puts the gun to his temple. BANG!

Atwood clasps a hand to her mouth and exhales in ragged gulps.

Without warning, Mr. Brooks swings the shovel. The force of the blow breaks Mr. Smith's left arm. He howls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The next blow comes almost immediately. It smashes into the left side of Mr. Smith's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screams stop and a misfiring set of neurons causes Mr. Smith to stand up straight and wobbling, look directly at Mr. Brooks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blood streaming down his face is black in the moonlight.

<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks takes a step to the side, cocks his wrists and swings again. His full weight is behind this one.

The blade of the shovel strikes Mr. Smith in the throat very nearly taking off his head. The flesh that was once Mr. Smith falls to the ground.

	Anyone who is good at what they do, wants recognition. But since I'm not going to do it anymore, I'll let Mr. Smith take the credit.

<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't kid yourself, Earl, you're going to kill again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm not. I'll continue the AA meetings and I'll control it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
On the other stool next to Mr. Brooks is a WOMAN. Her large purse hangs open from the back of the stool; the cel phone clearly visible inside. Mr. Brooks looks at the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But there is an answer I would like to have.

INT. POLICE STATION - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Detective Atwood is seated in her CUBICLE reading the same front page Mr. Brooks was reading. A FELLOW OFFICER stops in the door.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good work, Atwood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Tom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
He moves on. From off screen:
</DIRECTION>
<ANOTHER_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should ask the FBI to kiss your ass and buy you a Cadillac.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANOTHER_OFFICER>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like my ass too much for that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
Snyder comes in and holds up the Work Order from the Moving Company.
</DIRECTION>
<SNYDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is bogus. The company doesn't exist in the city, the state, the United States or Canada.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNYDER>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So the whole point of this piece of paper was to give me Meeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<SNYDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what it looks like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNYDER>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Who moved him, where did they move him to, and why did he give me Meeks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<SNYDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what we get paid to find out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNYDER>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood picks up the Newspaper.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to go to the bathroom and think about this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
She stands. The phone rings. She answers it.

EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking out at the city, Mr. Brooks speaks into the cel phone he stole from the Woman.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you a cop?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT with Atwood.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're rich, you have a good education, you could have gone into your father's business, instead you went outside all of that and became successful on your own. Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want something from me if you don't tell me who you are I'm going to hang up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you think your husband's killing was random and I certainly didn't have to give you Meeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Baffert?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
Snyder perks up. She points for him to get on the other line.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the answer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't sound like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a little cold. Are you going to give me the answer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you if you can give me the true answer to my question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
Detective Atwood weighs her options and decides to go for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father was very disappointed I was born a girl and he let me know that. I've spent my whole life trying to prove him wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. You promised to tell me where you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me? I'm on top of a building.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
Atwood and Snyder hear the click as Mr. Brooks hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would he be interested in that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
At the Parking structure, Mr. Brooks holds the phone over the edge and drops it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow the phone down, down, down, until it hits the pavement and disintegrates.

EXT. BROOKS HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everything is as it was.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - BROOKS HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's dark. In his robe and pajamas, Mr. Brooks is standing in front of the open refrigerator gazing blankly at the contents with a glass of milk in one hand. There's nothing he wants in here. He closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - BROOKS HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrying the glass of milk, Mr. Brooks passes Jane's ROOM. The door is ajar. He stops, backs up and looks. His Daughter's asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - BROOKS HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks walks to the bed and leans over to give her a kiss on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His lips have just brushed her flesh when she twists violently under him and stabs upward with a pair of scissors. The blades are driven deep into his throat. Mr. Brooks jerks back, the milk flies out of his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Agghhh!!! Agghhh!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs at the handle of the scissors, but his blood makes them too slippery. He can't pull them out.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Brooks is tossing in his sleep next to Emma. She has a hold of his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wake up, wake up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
On the pillow Mr. Brooks' eyes fly open.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were having a nightmare.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<MR_BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
(breathing hard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... I woke you up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROOKS>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him on the forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here, go back to sleep, I'm here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
Taking his hand, she lies back down. After a moment Mr. Brooks turns over on his side and looks directly at us. His lips begin to move but we can't hear what he's saying, so we move in on his face. It's not until it fills our view that we can hear the words.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... that I may be reasonably happy in this life, And supremely happy with Him forever in the next. Amen. .... God grant me the Serenity to accept...
