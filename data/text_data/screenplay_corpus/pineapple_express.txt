EXT. FARMLAND - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN BLACK AND WHITE, A black 1930s Cadillac speeds down the only visible road amidst endless plains of farmland. The road curves sharply ahead - the car accelerates. Ignoring the turn, the Caddy drives directly off the road and through a massive field of emptiness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car abruptly stops in the middle of the vacant field. GENERAL BRAT (58, a patch covers one of his eyes) and AGENT BLACK SUIT (an agent in a black suit) step out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Although there is clearly nothing in sight for miles, the General scans his surroundings with concern.

INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They descend a metal staircase and walk with great urgency down a narrow corridor. The hallway spills into a hauntingly huge metal room with a lone SCIENTIST standing in the middle. The Scientist immediately begins leading them across the room.

INT. OBSERVATION LAB - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three men enter a large room divided by a one-way mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On their side, numerous SCIENTISTS, utilizing several archaic devices, are busy at work monitoring the subject on the other side of the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The subject: PRIVATE MILLER (22, naive and dutiful) sits at a small table with a microphone on it. Miller raises his hand, REVEALING a smoldering JOINT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a long and awkward hit from the joint and bursts into a coughing fit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scientists begin to scribble profusely as their devices blink manically. General Brat and Agent Black Suit exchange a concerned look. The General lights a cigarette as the Scientist steps up to a small microphone in the corner.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Private Miller, we are now going to ask you several questions. How do you feel?

His voice booms through large speakers on Miller's side of the room. Miller leans towards the microphone.

<SCIENTIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We will send someone in. Now answer the question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCIENTIST>
<DIRECTION>
A door opens beside Private Miller and an AGENT steps out wearing an intricate uniform that resembles an old fashioned diving suit, an air hose leading out the door that he came from. He slowly walks toward the Private, who looks at him in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<SCIENTIST>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (O.S) (through speakers)

<PRIVATE_MILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	COUGH COUGH Fucking shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, now that I think of it, it's strange that they are called my `superiors'. Does that make me their `inferior'? I mean, that's pretty fucked up.

<DIRECTION>
General Brat scowls.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_BRAT>

(curtly to the scientists)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've seen enough. Shut it down. Bury the hatch, sell the land, and dispose of him. This never happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_BRAT>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly, the scientists start packing up their equipment. Staring at Miller, General Brat grabs a RED PHONE and dials. Two Agents in the scuba-like suits emerge from behind Miller and start aggressively dragging him away.

</DIRECTION>
<TALK_RADIO_DJ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let's look at the facts. Financially, coins are better because they're cheaper, and environmentally, forget-about-it, coins win hands down. For those just joining us, we're with caller Dale Denton discussing if America should lose the paper dollar bill.

We see that Dale has a wireless ear piece in.

Dale is driving and smoking a joint. He looks at his check list - it is a list of people he served that day. He's only got a few left. He listens to a different talk radio dj while playing music from a tiny iPod boom box that sits in his passenger seat.

	Everything! They should be able to collect garbage TWICE a week. Why not? As a tax payer, can't I say that? Come get my garbage a bit more! Is that so f- ing crazy? I'm not asking for free beer Tuesday's or anything. And the whole city would be more aesthetically pleasing and smell better. And don't pretend you can't smell it. Ever been to New York? Great place, smells like piss, though.

Dale turns off the radio, takes one last haul, and then snubs out the joint. He then pulls out a small leather kit and sifts through it's contents: handi-wipes, hand sanitizer, a little vial of cologne, Visine, mouthwash and breath mints.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dale vigorously wipes his hands, face, and mouth with wet naps and then starts futilely attempting to put visine in his blazing red eyes. Frustrated, he squirts Visine all over his finger tips and simply rubs them into his eyes. He uses the mouthwash, chews up a mint, dabs on some cologne, and then gets out of the car.

<MR_EDWARDS>

</DIRECTION>
<DALE>

Saul comes back in and puts a small electronic scale on the coffee table.

	Ah, the cross-joint. You've never seen one of these? Not surprising. They are, like, the apex of the vortex of joint engineering. NASA built the first one in the eighties.

Saul chuckles at his joke as he places some weed on the scale.

</DALE>
<DIRECTION>
Saul puts Dale's weed in a baggie.
</DIRECTION>
<SAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You light all three ends at the same time, then, you smoke it as it resonates the main section, creating a "trifecta" of smoking power. It's like, three times as powerful as a normal joint.

Dale hands Saul some money and Saul gives him his weed. Dale lingers for a moment.

Saul gathers three lighters from the coffee table.

	Alright. Firstly you light these two ends. Then I will light the tip, making the trifecta complete. Are you ready?

Dale nods and they light the joint. Saul tokes hard; plumes of smoke fill the air as he bursts into a COUGHING FIT.

</DALE>
<DIRECTION>
Dale takes the joint and hits it, exploding into a coughing fit.
</DIRECTION>
<SAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's...uh, it's good to cough. COUGH It opens the COUGH capillaries...gets you twenty-five percent higher. And that, combined with the pineapple weed, and the cross-joint COUGH you're a good thirty to forty times higher. I don't know the exact math, but, pff, you're pretty fucking gong-showed. You know what I mean?

Saul points to his Scarface poster. The joint ends. After a few moments it seems as though their ability to have a conversation burnt out with the joint. They sit in awkward silence. Dale gets up.

INT. DALE'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dale cruises down side streets and locates Ted's house. It is a large well-to-do home. Having difficulties, Dale parks in between two cars across the street. He turns off the engine and starts smoking a joint. SUDDENLY - FLASH! Two head lights appear up the street. Holy shit! It's a COP CAR!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits still, holding the joint between his legs as the cop car drives past and...parks a few cars down! The FEMALE COP walks up the block - TOWARDS DALE'S CAR!
</DIRECTION>
<DALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit on me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DALE>
<DIRECTION>
Fortunately, the COP crosses the street and walks towards Ted's house. Confused, Dale watches as she is let in. Dale waits a moment and then re-lights the joint. He tries to see into Ted's house as he takes a MASSIVE TOKE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! A SILENCE SHATTERING BLAST comes from Ted's house. Dale holds the toke in and tries to keep quiet as he focuses on the large front window. SUDDENLY, the drapes are torn down by an ASIAN MAN as he falls forwards and crashes through the front window!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dale watches in horror as a LARGE GREY-HAIRED MAN and the Female Cop step forward and shoot the Asian man! BLAM! BLAM! Blood splatters!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dale starts COUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY! He starts the car and, in a panicked fit, tries to pull out. CRASH!!! He smashes directly into the car in front of him! He flicks the roach out onto the grass and slams the car in reverse - CRUNCH!!! He backs into the car behind him! Still hacking his lungs out, Dale drives away!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Grey-Haired Man and the Female Cop sprint out of the house in time to see Dale's distant tail lights vanish into the darkness. Something catches the Grey-Haired Man's eye - a trail of smoke rising from the grass. He lowers his blood-stained hand and picks up...DALE'S ROACH! He brings it to his nose and sniffs, then rips open the paper and examines the weed closely.
