The joint is jumping with musclehead BOUNCERS picking and choosing from the crowd of terminally trendy WANNABE'S gathered around the entrance. A light drizzle is falling.

A parade of swanky cars pulls up one by one as CAR HOPS scurry to keep up with the flow;

A glistening pearlescent Rolls Royce.

A fire engine red Ferrari.

A classic two tone Corniche in tan and burgundy.

And finally a broken down Citroen in rust bucket red and spackle gray RUMBLES up to the front of the club with a disgruntled Stanley behind the wheel.
</DIRECTION>

A car hop attempts to open the door, but it's rusted shut. Stanley throws his shoulder into it and the door finally pops open with a SCREECH of metal. Stanley nearly tumbles out into the street.

He smiles nervously at a high class couple looking with disdain at the eyesore-mobile. He pats the hood.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley slowly rises, smoothing out his disheveled clothing. A horn BLARES and Stanley scrambles to one side as a limo swings into the club's alleyway, splattering him with a wave of muddy water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley wipes the mud from his eyes just in time to see Tina Carlyle escorted from the back of the limo by a CHAUFFEUR carrying an umbrella. She's shoe-horned into a heart-stopping red dress that's fighting a losing battle to restrain her decolletage.

Stanley gestures "no problem" and tries to strike a casual pose against a street lamp, but slips and nearly falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a SQUEAL of grinding gears and the KA-POW of a backfire, the car hop pulls Stanley's battered loaner right up behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley flashes a last nervous smile at Tina, and digs for the car hop's tip money... nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shrugs apologetically to the disgusted car hop and climbs in. The car RATTLES, COUGHS the finally ROARS off in a cloud of noxious exhaust fumes.

:SC: EXT. TAHOOCHIE BRIDGE - NIGHT

Stanley drives along in a miserable daze. Suddenly the engine starts KNOCKING violently and the car dies.

:SC: EXT. BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steam HISSES from the radiator as the car slowly rolls to a stop. Stanley GRINDS the ignition key again and again trying futilely to restart the engine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Stanley fights his way out of the rusted door with a SQUEAL of metal, turns and kicks the bumper... which promptly falls off with a resounding CLUNK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front axle collapses, the tires fall off and the driver's side door CLATTERS to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley stands there staring at the steaming heap of useless metal... his mind a complete blank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slowly turns, looking down at the black brackish water swirling along beneath the Tahoochie Bridge. A wave of melancholy sweeps over him. Stanley plucks a button from his coat and watches as it drops down... down to the river below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, something catches Stanley's eye... a BODY, floating along in the darkness. He snaps back to reality.

Stanley rushes down the slippery embankment beneath the bridge. He spots the body dead ahead, floating along in the moonlight and hurries as fast as he can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA DOLLIES with Stanley as he scrambles down the slope; a black cat YOWLS as it races past him. He steps on and shatters a discarded mirror, and he ducks under an old ladder that leans against the bridge's foundation as he finally reaches the shore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley splashes into the waist deep water just in time to catch the body as it floats by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER - BODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Stanley grabs it, the "body" falls to pieces... revealing that it's nothing but a trash bag, an old tire and some floating bits of garbage all clinging to the "head": an old wooden Mask.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley shakes his head in disgust... some lifesaver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley inspects the Mask more closely; strange ritualistic symbols carved into a puckish face with a leering grin and eerie empty eye holes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The faintest sound of a haunting "Mask SFX Theme" rises as Stanley turns the Mask around and inspects the inside... slowly bringing it closer and closer to his face. The surface of the Mask begins to SHIMMER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then... RIBET! A frog jumps out of it, right into Stanley's face. Stanley nearly loses his footing on the slippery river bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a blinding SPOTLIGHT shines down from the bridge and an amplified voice calls out from a squad car.

All the punkers laugh like the half-wits they are as Death's Head #1 shoves Stanley into Death's Head #2. #2 pushes him back across to #3 and so on. Stanley is roughly bounced back and forth more and more violently within the circle of giggling street toughs. He finally breaks free and scrambles to his front door, still reeling with dizziness. He fumbles with the key and SLAMS the door behind him as the Death's Heads roar with laughter.

Stanley's wet shoes SQUEAK as he tiptoes past -

<DIRECTION>
APARTMENT "A" - MANAGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sign that reads "Quiet Please" hangs from the doorknob. Stanley continues past it to Apartment "B". Just as he removes his keys - the Manager's door flies open and MRS. PEENMAN appears. She's an old dragon in hair curlers who will probably live forever just to spite her relatives.

<DIRECTION>
Small, full of books but very neat. A few cherished animation cels from 1940s cartoons are framed on the wall. As Stanley locks the door behind him - he's greeted by MILO, a happy little terrie sized mutt with a big heart.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Milo.

Milo gets so excited he starts GAGGING and COUGHING.

	</DIALOGUE>

Stanley pats Milo on the rump, crosses his tiny kitchenette and heads straight into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley's prized collection of "golden Age" Looney Tunes tapes are neatly displayed on a simple bookshelf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tosses the Mask down on his bedside table, pops one of his cherished Tex Avery cartoons into the V.C.R., plops down on his bed and starts to strip off his shoes and socks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILO

Stanley tosses the Frisbee into the air. The disk sails...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUT OF THE BEDROOM AND INTO THE HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo runs it down, leaps up, and makes a perfect catch. He trots back to the bedroom, and drops it in Stanley's lap.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy. This is the best part.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
On the screen a cartoon dog ZZZIPS into frame and drops a frizzing stick of dynamite down a bad guy's pants. KA-BOOM! The dog LAUGHS maniacally.
</DIRECTION>

Suddenly there is a POUNDING on the wall that rattles Stanley's framed cartoon cels.

(CONT.) (calls out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry Mrs. Peenman.

With a sigh, he ejects the tape and a much quieter talk show POPS on. Larry King and a guest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley rises and crosses into the bathroom to wash up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON T.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
King's guest, Dr. Arthur Neuman, is replying to a caller.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_NEUMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's correct. The truth is we all wear masks, metaphorically speaking. We repress the Id... our darkest desires and hide behind a more socially acceptable image of ourselves in order to cope with the frustrations of our day to day lives.

Stanley's only half listening though the open bathroom door as he brushes his teeth.

<STANLEY>

</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley tries a couple of fierce expressions in the bathroom mirror, his mouth foaming with toothpaste.

Milo does that doggie-head-cocked-sideways "What the hell?" look.

<LARRY_KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The book is "The Masks We Wear," by Dr. Arthur Neuman. Thank you Dr. Neuman.

Stanley pops off the T.V.with his remote.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thank you, Dr. Neuman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
As he buttons up his P.J.s, Stanley notices Milo warily sniffing at the strange Mask, which is still lying on the bedside table. A subtle SHIMMER crosses its surface. Milo WHIMPERS and quickly hops off the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We now begin to hear the "Mask Theme"... echoes of the POUNDING Viking drums... growing louder. Haunting whispery VOICES seem to call to Stanley as he slowly crosses to the bedside. He picks up the Mask and turns it over in his hands running his fingers across the time work wood. The music builds...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back to the bathroom mirror and slowly raises the Mask to his face. Milo watches apprehensively from beneath the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For an instant - the MASK SHRINK WRAPS like a vacuum over Stanley's head. We hear the PIERCING MASK SFX.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, a beat later, the Mask is off with a POP. The SFX STOP.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa.
	</DIALOGUE>

Stanley studies the old mask, then his own face in the mirror. Everything's status quo. It must have been his imagination.

<STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naw...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the Mask on again - firmly this time. Milo dives under the bed as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN INCREDIBLE METAMORPHOSIS BEGINS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUBBERY WOODEN WHIPS shoot out of the Mask and wrap around Stanley's head - locking the Mask in place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STANLEY'S PAJAMAS magically reweave themselves... growing in all directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS HEAD THROBS AND EXPANDS, turning lime green as it unites with the Mask.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STANLEY GRABS HIS HEAD - His body begins to move uncontrollably.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spinning faster and faster like a gyroscope. The SFX get loonier and loonier as he becomes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HUMAN TORNADO. Stanley's words are almost unintelligible as his voice jumps one, two, five octaves.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hellllllllppppmmmmmmmeeeeeeeee...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
A HAND reaches out of the twister and locks onto the bedpost. The whirlwind SCREECHES to a halt, causing sparks and smoke to rise from the singed carpet. The smoke clears revealing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MASK CREATURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's dressed in a snazzy zoot suit - a distortion of the paisley material of Stanley's pajamas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The head is no longer Stanley's. It's large, bald and bright green. The huge bug-eyes glow with mischief. The nose is small, bony and beaked. The mouth and teeth are enormous and gleaming white as he breaks into a learning grin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The overall effect is devilishly loony, but not altogether unhuman. In fact, there's something downright charming about him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mask checks himself out in the mirror and likes what he sees.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_MASK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	S-s-s-nazzy!

:SC: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trying to ber VERY, VERY quiet, the Mask tiptoes down the darkened corridor. The floor makes a barely audible CREEEEK as the Mask steps with exaggerated care pst APARTMENT "A" with it's little "Quiet Please" sign. He raises a finger to his lip, making the "SHUSH" sign.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly - and unexplicably - a ringing ALARM CLOCK leaps out of Stanley/Mask's pocket and starts jittering down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY_MASK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O, jeepers--!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY_MASK>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley/Mask tries to snag the clock, but it bounces away every time. Frustrated, he pulls a full sized SLEDGEHAMMER from his pocket and starts POUNDING the floor in an effort to stop the clock. Glancing blows shatter the clock face and most of the works, but those bells just keep ringing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hammer, of course, slams craters the size of manhole covers into the floor and reverberates through the building like THUNDERBOLTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door bursts open and Mrs. Peenman's angry face pops out covered in blue mud pack and framed in curlers. She gets one look at the Mask with his oversized carnival mallet raised over his head and SCREAMS bloody murder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mask SCREAMS in response, his eyes bugging out on stalks and his mouth expanding to the size of a tuba in mock horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Peenman's door SLAMS shut and reopens a beat later as she appears cocking an enormous shotgun.
</DIRECTION>
<MASK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy lady! I was just killin' time!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASK>
<DIRECTION>
The Mask starts ricocheting off the walls HOOTING maniacal laughter as Mrs. Peenman lets loose with both barrels. KA-BOOM.

The Mask bounces off walls as Mrs. Peenman continues to blast away, and finally leaps straight out the window. KEE-RASH.

SPLAT. Stanley/Mask lands face up in the middle of the street. He slow... painfully starts to rise as a STREET CLEANING machine turns a corner and RUNS DIRECTLY OVER HIM. The machine disappears down the street as we HOLD on Stanley/Mask's flattened body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He raises one arm, grabs himself by the head and peels himself off the street. He shakes himself out with one sharp CRACK and straightens his zoot suit. He's shocked to find a tiny SPOT on his sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY_MASK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! You missed a spot!
	</DIALOGUE>

As if on cue, a SECOND street cleaning machine SLAMS into him and RUNS OVER HIM AGAIN. This time he reinflates himself back into 3- D by blowing into his thumb and hops up.

<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
He pets his dog, takes his keys and starts out the door... but he pauses to take a last look at the mask... It's eerie black eye holes and devilish grin seem to mock him.

On sudden impulse, he grabs it, hurls it out the balcony's sliding glass door and exits.

As the mask flies out into the sir, a sudden wind kicks up.

The mask arcs back toward the building like a boomerang and lands balanced precariously on a narrow ledge. Its mocking grin seems to glow with triumph.

The place looks like it's been hit by cartoon graffiti guerrillas: Everything's printed in polka-dots, checks, tartan, etc. The "Ripley Auto Finishing" sign hangs askew over the doorway. Letters have been sprayed out to read "Rip Off!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several REPORTERS and curious ONLOOKERS stand nearby as Kellaway and his men take it all in. PARAMEDICS appear wheeling Burt and Irv out of the building on two gurneys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're both in severe discomfort and look more like cars than men: Bodies spray painted metallic colors, hood ornaments glued to their foreheads, wire rims under each limb, and gleaming four foot long mufflers sticking out of their rear ends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They wince in pain at each tiny bump of the gurney.

The empty garage has been turned into a topsy-turvy nightmare. The same cartoon paint job covers the walls. Peggy looks around, sifting through some papers scattered all over the floor. Nothing.

Then she spies the COMPLAINT BOX. Peggy opens it and pulls out a HANDFUL of pink "comment" slips. She looks at them. Almost all of them are from one customer - STANLEY IPKISS.

MR. DICKEY, the smarmy office manager who is younger than Stanley, now appears.
</DIRECTION>
<DICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ipkiss! You're forty minutes late! Every time you do that you're robbing this bank of its time and money!

STANLEY

stands transfixed, staring at the moonlit face. He can almost hear echos of faint whispered VOICES calling his name. A deadly siren song above the pounding drums.

Sweet Eddy lunges at the Dog/Mask. But the canine-creature runs between his legs and CHOMPS DOWN on his butt. The tiny dog picks big Sweet Eddy up and shakes him back and forth, like a rag doll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STANLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watches this, then takes a look at the TICKING DETONATOR. Less than a minute to go. He strains at his bonds -- forcing the rope into a FLAMING VIKING WALL TORCH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tina winces as Stanley's hand-rope begins to burn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOG/MASK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
uses Eddy as a club -- knocking other Thugs down.
</DIRECTION>
<SWEET_EDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get him off me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWEET_EDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Dorian raises his Uzi and SPRAYS THE AREA WITH GUNFIRE! Dog/Mask leaps away in the nick of time.
</DIRECTION>
<ORLANDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon! We've got the money. Let's get the hell out of here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORLANDO>
<DORIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta have that mask!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Dorian chases Dog/Mask into the maze of slot machines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STANLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
burns through his ropes. He frees himself and races to the detonator. 15 - 14 - 13 - 12
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE MAZE OF SLOT MACHINES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dorian stalks Dog/Mask, whistling for him to come. A stream of WATER now trickles down on him from above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dog/Mask is in the chandelier taking a whiz and snorting doggie laughter. Dorian sprays the ceiling with gunfire, but...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOG/MASK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pounces on Dorian, knocking him flat, then races out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKING SHIP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley yanks one wire after another, but the timer still ticks down -- 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 -- Stanley pulls the last wire. The timer stops. Tina exhales, relieved, as Stanley unties her.
</DIRECTION>
<TINA>
<DIRECTION>
(kissing him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TINA>
<DIRECTION>
C.U. - TIMER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it TICKS back to life... 2 - 1 - 0!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A muffled EXPLOSION rumbles from beneath the floorboards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. THE PIER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two front support pilings BLOW UP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CASINO - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire floor TILTS. Gaming tables and slot machines start to slide by. Stanley grabs Tina and hangs onto the prow of the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Milo! Milo, come!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Dog/Mask appears racing up the tilting floor and leaps into the boat as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LAST TWO PILINGS BLOW UP!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire casino floor drops straight down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHIP SLIDES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
straight across the gaming floor towards the huge front doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DORIAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCREAMS as the boat slides right over him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. HARBOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Viking ship CRASHES through the doors and SPLASHES down in the marina as the entire casino sinks into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. VIKING SHIP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It bobs for a moment, then floats! Stanley, Tina and the dog emerge from their hiding place, under one of the dining tables.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They can't quite believe they're alive. Their faces reflect romantically from the light of the Viking torch sconces.
</DIRECTION>
<TINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stanley... we made it. We're alive!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TINA>
<DIRECTION>
Milo lets loose a happy "Whoof!" and leaps into Stanley's arms. Stanley removes the mask with a SCHWOOP and Milo transforms back into a regular dog.
</DIRECTION>
<DORIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIAN>
<DIRECTION>
They turn as DORIAN clamors over the side of the boat. He's got a gun pointed right at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley slides an iron grappling hook through the mask's eye holes and holds it overboard.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it right there or you'll be looking for this on the bottom of the harbor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Dorian stops in his tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DORIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop it and I'll kill you all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIAN>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can have it. But she gets to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DORIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIAN>
<TINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TINA>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swimming. We're still close to shore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DORIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five seconds, Ipkiss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley tosses a wooden barrel overboard and turns to Tina.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead. Hurry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Tina takes the dog and slips overboard. Dorian moves in.
</DIRECTION>
<DORIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Put it down. Right over there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Dorian waves his gun at the nearest dining table. Stanley starts to put down the mask. But at the last instant -- he tosses it
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTO THE PILE OF TNT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Dorian turns to see where it lands, Stanley jumps him. Dorian FIRES but misses. Stanley jumps Dorian -- knocking his gun away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dorian falls into one of the WALL TORCHES -- toppling it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TWO MEN slug it out as a FIRE STARTS. It burns closer and closer to the dynamite -- the mask in the middle of the pile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tina and Milo cling to the floating barrel.
</DIRECTION>
<TINA>
<DIRECTION>
(sees fire)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stanley! The dynamite!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TINA>
<DIRECTION>
BACK ON BOARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dorian pummels Stanley with a flurry of jabs to the head as the FIRE SEARS toward the explosives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Stanley counters with a solid right that rocks Dorian back. Dorian grabs him by the collar to retaliate but sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FIRE licking at the dynamite casing on which the mask lies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dorian lunges for the mask. Stanley jumps overboard. The dynamite explodes!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM THE WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tina and Milo watch as the ship blows up. The fireball burns bright, smoke everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<TINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Stanley?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TINA>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Stanley surfaces gasping for breath. Tina pulls him over to the barrel and Milo licks his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then the smoke parts revealing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DORIAN/MASK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
standing on the remains of the boat. Like Wile E. Coyote, he's charred pitch black, with singed hair and clothes. But like a cartoon -- he just shakes off the soot and stands there in all his fearsome Dorian/Mask glory.
</DIRECTION>
<DORIAN_MASK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a BLAST! This mask makes me a god!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIAN_MASK>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up the last fizzing, but UNDETONATED STICK OF TNT and laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<DORIAN_MASK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm immortal...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIAN_MASK>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his arms and thunders to the heavens. At that moment -- the SUN peaks over the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DORIAN_MASK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you hear? I'm immortal!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIAN_MASK>
<DIRECTION>
The sun's rays hit the Mask. In an instant, he transforms back to regular Dorian. The mask pops off Dorian's face -- useless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dorian stares dumbfounded at the TNT stick in his hand as it --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KA-BOOM! Dorian is blown to smithereens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MARINA - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are cops everywhere. Lt. Kellaway wraps Tina in a dry blanket. Stanley holds out his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back to jail, Lieutenant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<LT_KELLAWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ipkiss, I'd like to lock you up for the rest of my life. But the mayor and a hundred other witnesses say Dorian Tyrel's the bad guy and you're the good guy. So no jail. Just a downtown parade at noon.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(resigned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I've got to be your escort.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_KELLAWAY>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley smiles and puts his arms around Tina. They head down the beach. The two young lovers and Milo walk past --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE SCHUMACHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
standing near the crowd of post-party VICTIMS being helped by the POLICE and MEDICAL PERSONNEL. He's still hitting on that statuesque Valkyrie change girl.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I deck this thug, grab his gun and tell Stanley, "Take cover, Buddy. I'll get these folks out sae and sound." Y'know we should go back to my place so I can tell you the rest of the story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SHORELINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Peenman is walking along grumbling to herself when she notices the mask floating to shore with some of the wreckage from the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_PEENMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just look at this mess...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_PEENMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She picks it up out of the surf and The Mask FX theme begins to pound in her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back to Charlie and his Valkyrie.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what do you say, sweetheart? Let's you and me go back to my place and scramble some eggs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Mrs. Peenman/Mask ZZZIPS up and sweeps Charlie off his feet. She's the most whacked-out Mask creature yet with a huge green Witch Hazel face and Bride of Frankenstein hair.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_PEENMAN_MASK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello short, dark and handsome! C'mere and give Momma a kissy-poo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_PEENMAN_MASK>
<DIRECTION>
She starts SMACKING her king-sized lips horribly.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(terrified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yah! Put me down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She jams a hand down the front of Charlie's pants.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_PEENMAN_MASK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see what caliber pistol you're packing there, soldier boy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_PEENMAN_MASK>
<DIRECTION>
She gets a grip and squeezes. AHOOGA! AHOOGA! Charlie SCREAMS, ttears himself from her grasp and starts running for his life. CAMERA PANS with Mrs. Peenman as she RICOCHETS after him hooting laughter. We ENDFRAME on Stanley and Tina as they watch the bizarre spectacle pass them by. They turn and embrace for a well deserved kiss as Milo yips happily and squirms up between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
