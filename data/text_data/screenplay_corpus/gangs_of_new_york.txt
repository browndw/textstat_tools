INT. ROOM OLD BREWERY DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Half in shadow, a man named VALLON, dressed in black, fastens a clean white clerical collar around his thick neck. He raises a jagged razor to his face, RAKES it across his right cheek, drawing BLOOD. He does not flinch. The sharp SCRAPING of the jagged blade against skin is the first SOUND we hear. VALLON cuts himself similarly on the left cheek, then hands the razor ceremoniously to a BOY standing beside him. The boy, no more than twelve years old, looks at VALLON worshipfully, keen eyes shining with fear and excitement. He starts to wipe the razor blade on the bottom of his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<VALLON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Never. The blood stays on the blade, son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALLON>
<DIRECTION>
He hands the boy a dark red velvet pouch. Very carefully, the boy, known as AMSTERDAM, wraps the razor up, hands it back to his father. From the shadows, VALLON now raises a long pole with a beautiful golden crucifix mounted on the end, then holds his free hand out to his son. Amsterdam squeezes tight. VALLON nods toward the door. Amsterdam pulls it open. Outside is a dim hallway. We hear SOUNDS that might be animal or human. MUSIC begins: a steady, driving cadence somewhere between a march and a hymn.

VALLON strides in long measured steps. Amsterdam has trouble keeping up with him. They are walking down a long corridor that's like a tunnel. Patches of LIGHT stain the darkness. Sometimes Amsterdam glimpses a FACE peering out from the gloom. Once or twice he almost stumbles over a BODY stretched across his path.

INT. ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another room, even smaller. The only decoration is a bizarre rendering of a Madonna and child painted on the wall. A beefy man picks up a home-made PIKE, its iron tip sharpened to a lethal point. He is smiling. The grin is huge, but cockeyed. It occupies only half of his face. The grotesque, unending grin is the result of facial paralysis, and has given him a nickname: HAPPY JACK MULRANEY. Jack lifts the pike carefully, then takes a candle from the wall and bends down over a wooden cage full of rabbits. He slowly moves the candle back and forth across the cage top. Wax falls on the cage, splattering an unlucky rabbit. Jack thrusts the pike between the wooden bars, impaling the rabbit's body. He pulls the pike from the cage and leaves.

<DIRECTION>
Now a WOMAN joins them. She's dressed in man's clothes, her pants held up by suspenders. She wears a set of IRON CLAWS. MUSIC builds, growing more insistent and more ominous. Now a figure looms before them. Over his street clothes, this WARRIOR wears a rig of home-made armor made from fracgments of steel, lengths of chain and bits of leather. He carries a battle-axe as lightly as if it were a twig.

He joins the procession. Another woman, as tough as the first and half again as large, and several more men, all armed with implements of destruction, fall in beside him. Their faces are marked with blood, like Vallan's, or covered with ritual markings made with paint and ink. The group grows ever larger and more forbidding. occasionally PEOPLE dart around them in the tunnel and scamper out of their way like animals frightened in a burrow.

INT. ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vast and dank, like a cavern. We start CLOSE on... ... the body of a dead rat being filled with some pieces of lead. Then a little WIDER to reveal: an eager boy, SHANG DRAPER, about the same age as Amsterdam. He drops the last few pieces of lead into the mouth of the rat, then sews it closed. He hefts the animal by the tail, swinging it as he stands up. He is near a primitive forge where a half-drunk SLACKSMITH hammers crude weapons into shape and distributes them to OTHER MEN and WOMEN. The floor is covered with bits of lead and steel, which Shang has been using to sew into his rat. Shang FOLLOWS the crowd of men and women with their weapons. And now we see this room full. It is huge: the main room of the Old Brewery, crowded with families huddled together for warmth and comfort, or out of fear; men and women, together or separately, drunk or passed out. They are like zoo animals in a pit. There are sticks of furniture jammed in corners, or, more often, arranged at angles in the middle of the room to form tiny enclaves where the ancient brewery machinery forms irregular boundaries. Above Shang's head, VALLON and his gang walk across a plank bridge that spans the room a hundred feet beneath them. Armed men and women from the Brewery are climbing a rope ladder to join them. Shang SCURRIES up after them. The men and women from the Brewery fall in behind VALLON and the others in the lead. Shang SPOTS someone near his own age toward the front: Amsterdam. He presses through the crowd like a hunting dog.

Monk turns to the door with the grace of a dancer and delivers a SHATTERING kick, sending it flying off its hinges.

EXT. STREET DAY (WINTER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WINTER WIND blows across a scene as strange and bleak as an alien planet. VALLON, carrying his cross high, steps through the doorway. The OTHERS slowly follow VALLON out of the building, which is three stories high and maybe a block long. A dilapidated sign identifies it as the 5 Paints Brewery. It is the tallest structure in the midst of low, squalid SHACKS, winding ALLEYS as narrow as a snakels back, and DIRT STREETS filled with ruts, mud and filthy snow. A few PIGS wander forlornly about, rooting for garbage. WASH hangs stiff, in the middle of the square, from a peculiar monument erected to some forgotten war hero. The Brewery occupies one side of a SQUARE surrounded by some storefronts and a couple of collapsed wooden sidewalks. If this place resembles anything at all, it's a horrible hybrid of London's Limehouse and a pioneer town in the American West whose best days have long passed--or never came at all. VALLON stands still, staring across the square past the monument. His battalion of irregulars waits for his signal. Now... very, very slowly...from around both sides of the monument comes ANOTHER GANG, in size the same as VALLON's, men and women both, armed like Visigoths with HOMEMADE WEAPONS: knives, pitchforks, building blocks and bricks, boards with sharp nails protruding from the ends. Every member of this second group is dressed in a long DUSTER which reaches to the ankles. Several MEN in front of the group sport dusters made of leather.

<DIRECTION>
On the side of the square, arranged to get a good view of the impending combat, is a group of STREET KIDS, girls and boys, none older than eight. They talk and laugh excitedly among themselves, picking their own favorites among the gangs as if the warriors were players on a team.

</BILL_THE_BUTCHER>
<DIRECTION>
A pause of a single second. Then HAPPY JACK takes the dead rabbit off the tip of his pike and hurls it across the square. It lands right at BILL THE BUTCHER's feet. In a flash, BILL THE BUTCHER opens his coat. Inside, on a special belt he carries a CLEAVER, a CARVING KNIFE and other instruments of the butcherls trade, all stained with blood and gristle. Now the MAN standing next to him removes the broad BELT from around his coat. The brass buckle is sharpened to a point, the leather studded with glass. The gallery of Street Kids tenses for action: they are thrilled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALLON reaches up to the CROSS, pulls off the top piece, to disclose, underneath, a gleaming sword point. He folds the arms of the cross down, like the blades of a jackknife.
</DIRECTION>
<VALLON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prepare to receive the Lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALLON>
<DIRECTION>
And the air is full of screams and battle cries as the two gangs hurl across Paradise Square into BATTLE. VALLON draws first blood. He impales a Native American on the sword end of his cross and turns to fight again. Amsterdam and Shang exchange a glance of frightened, worried wonder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then a Native American rushes at them, shouting for blood. The boys act together. Amsterdam dives down in front of the man, sending him sprawling. Shang BLUDGEONS the fallen warrior, using his lead-filled rat like a blackjack as Amsterdam kicks him savagely; the Native collapses unconscicus at their feet. Before the boys can thank one another, however, they are separaten by the SURGING GANGS all around them. BILL THE BUTCHER leaves his meat CLEAVER imbedded in the middle of a man's skull, then WADES through the combat as if shielded by a charm. The gallery of Street Kids is thrilled by this display and reacts with CHEERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALLON BATTLES three Natives who come at him at once.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monk Eastman grabs a Native in his arms like a groom hugging a bride. He raises his knee and brings the man crashing down across it, BREAKING his spine like a Thanksgiving wishbone. The gallery of Street Kids is awed by this display of power from a new star in the making.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Rabbit Warrior in the home-made armor grins at an intrepid Native and lowers his battle-axe. The Native rushes as the Rabbit Warrior swings and SEPARATES the man from his legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A NATIVE WOMAN lowers her head and charges her Dead Rabbit adversary, delivering a shattering BUTT to his stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A NATIVE BOY holds a rusty old pistol, which he uses at pointblank range against several Rabbits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RABBIT WOMAN flies into a Native, using her IRON FINGER EXTENSIONS to GOUGE his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The NATIVE with the deadly belt uses it to TEAR a piece out of a Rabbit's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amsterdam, beginning now to be overwhelmed by the hellish fight, looks around in growing PANIC for his father.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHANG uses his lead-rat blackjack to clear an escape back toward the Brewery. The Street Kids can tell he's trying to escape, and start BOOING him... ... as Shang's GRABBED from behind and pulled off his feet by a PEG-LEGGED NATIVE. He THROWS the boy to the ground and pins him by holding the sword-sharp point of his wooden leg against Shang's throat.
</DIRECTION>
<SHANG>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I run with you! I'm one of you! Born a Native American from the blood of five generations!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANG>
<DIRECTION>
PEG-LEG Yeah? Then you oughta be a red Indian.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes down. Shang starts to bleed. But now PEG LEG is distracted by the sudden SOUND of bells and whistles. He watches the BOY trembling on the ground, then moves off him, making for the sound of the bell, leaving the BOY quaking. The SOUND grows louder as TWO HORSE-DRAWN CARTS full of battle ready POLICE tear around the curve of a narrow thoroughfare and stop in Paradise Square. The BELLS on the carts toll loudly and work magic. The fighting stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The POLICE, all carrying clubs and wearing leather helmets, LEAP OFF the wagons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are several moments of ABSOLUTE SILENCE, broken only by the SOUND of the wind and the GROANS of the wounded. Then, as one, the Dead Rabbits and the Native Americans RUSH the police together, hurtling stones and brandishing weapons. Even the Street Kids get into the act, kicking and biting and generally having a fine time. The gangs SWARM all over the police, driving them back. Some lucky cops climb back on the wagons and try to get away. The unlucky police remain behind, dead on the ground. The GANGS cheer, jeer and continue to throw things at the retreating POLICE. When the second wagon disappears from view, the GANGS confront each other once again. Another brief moment of QUIET. The Street Kids settle back into their spectator role. Then the GANGS go at each other with fresh intensity. Amsterdam finally SEES his father and starts to PUSH his way toward him. VALLON and BILL THE BUTCHER stand facing each other in the midst of battle like two titans: then they rush at each other, joining with a terrible fury. Shang, still blindly SWINGING his blackjack, makes his way closer to the relative safety of the Brewery, his face stained with tears of fear. He hits someone. The MAN turns, swats him down. Shang sprawls on the street, which is a SWAMP of mud and blood and dirty snow, and finds himself face to face with a departed PEG LEG. Someone has removed his artificial limb and driven it through his heart. Across the square, Amsterdam has reached his father in time to see a NATIVE AMERICAN sneaking up behind him. Amsterdam grabs a long TRUNCHEON from a fallen warrior and uses it to hit the man a strong blow behind the knees. The MAN falls, howling. AMSTERDAM HITS him again. And again. He is hysterical.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALLON and BILL THE BUTCHER keep fighting. Amsterdam sees, with a single look, that his father is in the fight of his life. He looks for a weapon to help... ... sees a HATCHET lying by the body of the Rabbit he has just beaten senseless. He grabs it and runs forward, looking for an opening between the Butcher and his father... As the two combatants move, Amsterdam MOVES. Bobbing, weaving, feinting, falling back... looking for his chance... ... as Bill deals VALLON a blow that ROCKS him back and throws him off balance...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...just as Amsterdam has made his move. He RUSHES forward, sees his father FALLING, tries to turn but...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... too late. The boy's hatchet SLASHES his father in the leg. VALLON falls to one knee, gestures frantically to the stunned Amsterdam to get away... ... and Bill is upon VALLON, SINKING his knife into his chest. VALLON screams and falls on his back, Bill kneeling over him. He looks into his enemy's eyes ... and VALLON's EYES LOCK ON HIS. For all his suffering, VALLON's eyes HOLD Bill ... he forces himself to look at Bill...it's a terrible struggle... but VALLON will not look away. Amsterdam, hysterical, RUSHES at the Butcher. The Butcher grabs Amsterdam by the arm, making him drop his hatchet.

<BILL_THE_BUTCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>

The Rabbits SCAMPER to collect their dead and wounded before the Natives can get to them to slice off the battle souvenirs. But there are many corpses maimed. The Street Kids DISPERSE. The main battle is over, and the Natives have clearly carried the day. The Rabbits file past Vallon, rorming a protective CIRCLE around him. Amsterdam kneels at his side. Vallon tries to speak. Blood bubbles in his throat.

Amsterdam looks around. None of the Rabbits makes a move. This is clearly something he is meant to do himself. Amsterdam grabs the tortoise handle of the knife, PULLS on it. Vallon tries not to cry out. The knife does not move. Amsterdam tries again. He can't budge the knife. Vallon MOANS. Nearly wild, Amsterdam PULLS with all his strength. Vallon SCREAMS in agony. Amsterdam is pulling so hard he raises his father's back four inches off the ground. Still the knife will not move. Vallon passes out from the pain. Now, finally, someone steps forward: Monk Eastman. He leans over but Amsterdam, berserk with grief, pushes him away, turns back to his father, and, with a last desperate pull, DRAWS the knife from his father's heart. He throws it on the ground. Monk picks it up, wipes the blade on his arm, closes the knife and hands it to Amsterdam.

NEW YORK CITY 1844
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HARBOR DAY WINTER (MATTE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same afternoon. As the sun goes down, we have our first full look (MATTE) at the low pale outlines of the city. The harbor is crowded with the high masts of sailing ships. Just north of the island tip is the steeple of the city's tallest structure, Trinity Church. The buildings of Wall Street are masses of concrete and wood, the streets surrounding them paved with cobblestones. Just above the financial district are the sloping buildings and rutted avenue of the Five Points . The Old Brewery stands tall and forbidding over Paradise Square. Above the Five Points, in the distance, we can glimpse some finer, newer buildings. One wide street--Broadway--seems to run from the very tip of the island clear up into the woods just a few miles north of the harbor. The only SOUNDS are the lapping of the harbor water against the boats, the creaking of masts in the winter WIND.

A closer view - The TITLE fades off. We see an imposing edifice on the edge of the harbor with a wooden sign identifying: "IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA." The sun has nearly set. A boy--about 10 years old--sits on the edge of the Castle Garden dock, gazing down at the frozen Hudson. He can just about make out his reflection in the dull sheen of the ice. His name is JOHNNY SIROCCO, and he watches himself with bewildered seriousness. Abruptly, he reaches down and SMASHES through the ice with his fist. In SLOW MOTION, we watch the ice fragments drift apart in the river current, each bearing away a REFLECTION of Johnnyls face, like pieces of a puzzle.

Although the night's cold, the streets are jammed. WHORES painted like carnival Gypsies sell themselves to any man sober enough to stand up. SOUNDS of laughter and combat filter out from garish SALOONS like the Little Naples, the Hell Hole, the Egyptian Hall. In the midst of all this highlife are BEGGARS and the SICKLY, looking for charity, scrounging garbage in the street. An INDIGENT battles a CRIPPLE for a meager scrap of food. A richly dressed WOMAN, riding by in a carriage, hides her eyes by raising a HUGE BOUQUET OF FLOWERS in front of her face.

Then he NOTICES something else.... .... his FATHER, propped up in a coffin, on public display. There is a large sign beside the body: "The Dead End of Lawlessness. Tammany Abhors Crime. Tammany Means Justice." A sizeable CROWD is goggling at the body. Amsterdam BULLS his way through the people to the street. He looks in the gutter, then looks up quickly.

Amsterdam SHATTERS the window and the Crowd SCATTERS in a blizzard of GLASS.

Mr. Cornelius takes the wagon reins and guides the horses out of the square. The gang FOLLOWS solemnly behind.

The Friend GETS UP and starts across the Brewery floor, acting nonchalant. But she looks around her, across the sleeping, passed-out bodies, past the desperate families and their squalling infants, to see if she's been noticed. A man and two women cast a glance her way. She looks away, but the TRIO keeps watching her... then FANS OUT and starts to FOLLOW her. The Friend looks over her shoulder again. SEES the Man. Locks in another direction, SEES: the woman. And then: the second woman. All closing on her. The Friend starts to RUN. The Trio runs after her. And no one else pays attention. The Friend PLUNGES into one of the warren of TUNNELS that lead off the Brewery floor. CAMERA plunges through the darkness, after her. Her footsteps ECHO; there is the SOUND of stumbling, falling, an angry CURSE and a BLOW being struck. The FRIEND picks herself up out of the darkness and keeps running, CAMERA following down the dank halls. Suddenly the TRIO runs AHEAD of the camera. There is a SCREAM. CAMERA staps. And others SOUNDS follow quickly now: the dull THUD of a heavy object against bone, REPEATED several times; and then, very soon after, the most terrible sound of all: silence. Then Two Women emerge from the darkness of the tunnel, fighting over the penny. The Man, several steps behind them, throws an object to the dirt floor: it's a STONE, and it is covered with blood. He comes up behind the Two Women quickly and GRABS the penny from them with a hand that still DRIPS blood and gore. They CHASE after him across the crowded Brewery floor.

A small slum thoroughfare congested by a splendid FIRE-WAGON labeled "Americus Co./Tammany Hall." Curious SPECTATORS and panic-stricken RESIDENTS crowd around to watch a ramshackle building going up in FLAMES.

The wagons pull up next to the fire plug. Each of them has the words "Black Joke Fire Co." written large on the side, but the FIREMEN wear party costumes, not regular uniforms. Some are dressed as British Redcoats, still others as Indians. The FLAMES continue to devour the building, but Tweed does not budge from the plug. He is approached by the Black Jake chief, who is dressed as an Indian chief.

Impasse. The rival Fire Companies size each other up and start toward each other. The building continues to burn. Tweed remains regal and unperturbed atop the fire plug. As the two COMPANIES are about to close with each other, a second BELL sounds. Tweed's "reinforcements" have arrived: the Native Americans, led by Bill The Butcher. They PILE OFF the wagons before the horses halt. Now the Black Joke Co. is outnumbered, and it FALLS BACK. As the Crowd CHEERS, Tweed takes the bucket off the fire plug.

Amsterdam is sitting off to the side, watching this ongoing debate with contemptuous detachment. Johnny sits next to him.

<AMSTERDAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does Shang have the sand to ever go against the Natives?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMSTERDAM>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. He acts like it.

</AMSTERDAM>
<DIRECTION>
His tone of voice has changed. Jenny Everdeane passes before him; she's ravishing. Amsterdam STARES, as if he's trying to see into her heart. Jenny pays him scant attention as she moves across the room toward Shang.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jenny Everdeane. Shang turned her into the best bludget in the Points.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny gives Shang silk scarfs, wallets and several purses from her coat.
</DIRECTION>
<AMSTERDAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shes his mort, is she, as well as his best provider?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMSTERDAM>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. But Jenny says she's anyone's she chooses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny's haul is impressive. Shang picks a BRIGHT RED SILK SCARF with a distinctive PAISLEY design from the pile of stolen goods. He examines it with a shrewd, appreciative eye.
</DIRECTION>
<SHANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the prize of the month. Spice Islands silk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANG>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the scart in his coat pocket with a FLOURISH, then throws his arm about Jenny in a proprietary way.
</DIRECTION>
<SHANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll learn our way if you're going to be one of us, Amsterdam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANG>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny reacts slightly to the mention of the name: she looks over and RECOGNIZES Amsterdam now.
</DIRECTION>
<SHANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every one of us gives a portion of all they steal to the gang. Morts more than men, being morts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANG>
<AMSTERDAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? And why is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMSTERDAM>
<SHANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because morts have more resources. Men can work only on their feet, but a mort can turn out on her back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANG>
<AMSTERDAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, why give at all? Why don't they keep for themselves?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMSTERDAM>
<SHANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you think there's something off about my way of running things, you got no place in this gang.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANG>
<AMSTERDAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got no place anyway, and you got no gang. This ain't a gang, no matter what you say. It's a mob.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMSTERDAM>
<DIRECTION>
There's a tense hush in the grubby room. Shang takes his arm from around Jenny, wanting to be restrained.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY>

(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all your play now, Shang. Maybe you can set him right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny hands him a cane. Barely managing to hide his reluctance, he starts--slowly--toward Amsterdam, who stands his ground. The gang steps back to give them room in this tiny space. Shang pulls the cane apart: it's a SWORD CANE, but Amsterdam shows no fear. He shifts his weight a little, watching ... and they're interrupted by a...

<HAPPY_JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've come for my due and proper, Shang.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAPPY_JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Happy Jack Mulraney (the Dead Rabbit gang member with the halfparalyzed face) stands before them in a POLICEMAN'S UNIFORM-sparkling clean and splendid--a leather helmet and long coat. In his hand, he twirls a NIGHTSTICK.
</DIRECTION>
<SHANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As agreed, then, Jack. Refreshment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANG>
<DIRECTION>
Shang OPENS the top of the gold-handled sword cane. Inside are large, solid LUMPS of cocaine. Jack reaches for the choicest.
</DIRECTION>
<AMSTERDAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still smiling, are you?

</HAPPY_JACK>
<AMSTERDAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hardly knew you under that hat, Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMSTERDAM>
<DIRECTION>
By now, Jack has taken not only the cocaine, and the money and swag Shang offers, but several of the purses and wallets Jenny delivered. Jenny stares at him with contempt, and he laughs, tossing one of the purses back at her.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There. For your respect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack turns to leave but a BRASH BOY blocks his way. Moving fast and fancy, Jack bashes the Boy to the floor with his nightstick.
</DIRECTION>
<HAPPY_JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anybody else? Any number at all, come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAPPY_JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Several of the gang make a move toward Jack, but Shang WAVES them back. Jack departs UNHARMED, to general disgust. Jenny walks back across the room to help the Brash Boy. Shang GLARES at Amsterdam, slides his sword back into his cane and follows Jenny, trying to explain himself.

EXT. PARADISE SQUARE DAY

A hot summer day. All the TRADESMEN are out in force, jamming the square and the side streets leading to it. Amsterdam walks fast through the crowd, enjoying the freedom and the bustle, as Johnny tags along close behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<AMSTERDAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got my own way to go, why don't you find yours?

WE SEE what they're looking at: the Old Brewery. In worse shape than ever before, but shut-down, abandoned. A tattered banner flaps against the front door: "Future Home of the Five Points Mission/ Praise God!/ The Reverend Shadrach Raleigh, Pastor."
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The city shut down the Brewery as unfit to live and Tammany gave it over to this minister.

MONTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Johnny continues to speak, we see Tammany tactics in action: WARD-HEALERS dispensing coal to the poor, and TOUGHS stealing meat off of butcher's wagons; a political PARADE with fife and drum-and politicians--including Boss Tweed--in ceremonial Indian costume, and a group of GOONS busting up a saloon; Tweed making a speech to enthusiastic CONSTITUENTS and a Tammany Fire Company tearing through the streets, scattering everyone in their way, finally revealing they are not rushing to a fire but are CRASING OFF a rival fire company.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They seem like the law, but they got a way of acting outside the law. Anything that happens in this city, on the straight or on the sly, Tammany's a part of, and Boss Tweed's the heart of Tammany.

	So if Tammany's the best, go with Tammany. What are you running with this mob for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMSTERDAM>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause they're more my size for now. With Tammany, you got to do something large, something that makes them take notice of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<AMSTERDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're better oft without their notice. You can run free, work your own schemes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMSTERDAN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	But if your schemes have size, you need size to bring them off.

INT. UNDER FLOOR/OLD BR.EWERY

A short tunnel under the Brewery floor, the kind a kid might make. Amsterdam has trouble crawling through it. DIRT and ROCK sprinkle him until he finds what he wants stuck in a shallow hole; a battered leather MONEY PURSE; and a PAPER-WRAPPED PACKAGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amsterdam snaps open the purse to make sure the little bit of MONEY is still there, then turns his attention to the package. He TEARS it open. Inside is the PIRATE KNIFE that Bill the Butcher used to kill Amsterdam's father.

A shock of summer SUNLIGHT as Amsterdam emerges from one of the back entrances of the Brewery onto a fetid alley filled with rotted barrels, broken glass and insensible drunks.

Amsterdam looks carefully up and down the alley, letting his eyes adjust to the bright light. Ahead of him, he SEES ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shang Draper, in jovial conversation with a SECOND MAN we do not recognize. The man is bareheaded, and has a deep scar running back to front clear down the center of his bald head. Amsterdam waits, WATCHES.

Shang takes the RED SILK SCARF he got from Jenny's swag and hands it to the Second Man. He and Shang SHAKE HANDS, as if they have concluded a business deal, and the Second Man walks away.

The main room is as loud and as prosperous as the stock exchange. Bill the Butcher makes his way past Small GROUPS of men engaged in heated political dealings of dubious virtue.

Bill knocks on the door to Tweed's private office while he's opening it. Inside is Boss Tweed, seated in a large WOODEN BOX like a primitive sauna. Around him are various PETITIONERS, and his assistant Daniel Killoran.

EXT- TOMBS DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA moves high along the outside wall, past small rectangular slits that pass for jail windows. EYES peer out, as if a peep show is underway directly below in the Tombs courtyard. A PRISONER is being readied for the gallows by having a hood tied to his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CROWD is in a carnival mood; HOT CORN GIRLS, STREET VENDORS, "HOKEY-POKEY" (i.e., ice cream) MERCHANTS, even BUSKERS, all add to the holiday spirit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny works through the crowd, pushing and smiling her way past groups of raucous merrymakers. She stops once or twice to have a word with a GENTLEMAN, flirts for a moment, then moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Further back in the crowd, Amsterdam NOTICES her. He watches her go through the crowd with an admiration that quickly turns to FASCINATION as he realizes what she's doing: picking pockets. The best bludget in the Five Points. He starts to FOLLOW her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny has worked her way close to the hanging platform, but she's so intent on her job she has not noticed Amsterdam. The closer the platform, the closer the spectacle and richer the pickings: Jenny's concentration is absolute. On the platform, an ASSISTANT HANGMAN addresses the Crowd.

	Those interested in the effects of the condemned please come forward.

Part of the Crowd PRESSES in toward the platform, temporarily blocking Amsterdam's view of Jenny. He is right against the platform.

McGloin grunts from underneath the hood.

	Not from under this hood I don't.

<DIRECTION>
Crowd near the platform begins to CHANT "No hood, no hood, no hood!" The Warden puts his hand on the hood, starts to remove it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and the Crowd CHEERS. Amsterdam turns, SEES: Charles McGloin. Bald, with a deep scar running front to back on his head. The very SAME MAN he saw in the alley with Shang.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McGloin acknowledges the cheers of the crowd. The Warden holds to megaphone close and McGloin bellows...

	<DIALOGUE>
	I never struck a foul blow or turned a card and may God greet me as a friend!

The Crowd ROAR approval at these words. Amsterdam PUSHES through the crowd, looking for Jenny ... SPOTTING her finally...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... while up on the platform, the NOOSE is placed around McGLOIN's neck, and he is HOISTED UP in no time. We hear his neck SNAP. His feet kick after death. The Crowd raises a zighty cheer.

Amsterdam walks with a crowd toward a waiting Broadway stage, a vehicle that looks like a horsedrawn train car. The stage will take spectators back uptown from the hanging.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is working his way toward Jenny, who is now BOARDING the stage. Amsterdam DASHES through the crowd and SQUEEZES onto the stage, which moves forward with a JOLT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once on board, Amsterdam looks through the jammed car, SEES: Jenny, about to sit down - A MAN has offered her his seat. She smiles dazzlingly as she sits...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and arranges her hands genteelly on her lap. The Man looks down on her and she smiles up at him again. He is bequiled.

<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I wouldn't want you to think me forward, you see.

...toward his pocket. The Man is in Jenny's thrall. He feels nothing and continues to have no idea what is going on. But Amsterdam KNOWS. Every silken, surreptitious move of her HAND across The Man's body is like a CARESS that Amsterdam can feel. Jenny's grace is balletic and EROTIC. As she picks The Man's pocket, she is, without knowing it, also seducing Amsterdam

A Tammany victory celebration. When we last saw this place--as Amsterdam confronted Happy Jack--the place was busy, alive. It's RIOTOUS now, jammed to bursting with POLITICIANS, CRIMINALS, GANG MEMBERS, MORTS, WHORES, HANGERS-ON, UPTOWN THRILL-SEEKERS, JOURNALISTS and COPS, not all of them off duty. The SOUND of the place is a cacophony of SHOUTING, SINGING, GAMBLING and STRANGE MUSIC--which we can't identify at first. We START CLOSE on a huge ruby ring and we HEAR...

<DIRECTION>
... passes a stage, where we finally SEE the source of all the strange MUSIC we've been hearing: the music is provided by
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHINESE MUSICIANS, a woman SINGER, a DANCER and some ACROBATS. They perform some weird, mangled Five Points version of Chinese opera. The music and performance continues as we MOVE PAST...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... across a PEWTER FAN-TAN TABLE, where CHINESE GAMBLERS play with fierce animation and concentration. By comparison, the Occidental types playing beside them seem like tourists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone SHOUTS and SCRAMBLES to place bets with the FAN-TAN DEALER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above the Dealer is an oval opening in the ceiling, through which OTHER PLAYERS may watch the action below. These FAN-TAN PLAYERS lean over an elegantly carved rail, peering at the action on the table below, placing their bets and collecting their winnings by means of a BASKET attached to WIRES that whirrs constantly overhead. We continue to MOVE PAST...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and for the first tine their EYES MEET. Bill's eyes rest on Amsterdam, take him all in... but DON'T REMEMBER him. He looks away as a TAMMANY HACK steps up to pay court....

The Crowd CHEERS and KIDS PULL on a series of ropes and pulleys to RAISE the CAGES further above the floor until they are parallel with the second-floor gallery of the Pagoda. WOMEN AND MEN call out BIDS even as the cages rise through the air. Depending on their age, the Women and children inside the cages respond to the auction with grim resignation, trepidation or fear. A few, drugged or drunk on all-sorts, lie insensible in their impossibly cramped space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny and Jenny make their way along the second floor gallery until she spots a COUPLE LEAVING a room and walks inside. Johnny CLOSES the door behind them as a BURST of APPLAUSE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... rises from the main floor, where Bill the Butcher stands in the dead center of the room. He slowly removes his coat and hands it to a FLUNKY. He is wearing his battle vest underneath, and it is fully rigged with all his butcher's implements.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place QUIETS. KIDS swarm silently, like busy ants, all over a huge wooden CHANDELIER, LIGHTING its HUNDREDS of CANDLES. Only the noise from the Chinese playing fan-tan in the far corner of the room can be heard now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Kids finish lighting the candles and the chandelier is RAISED toward the Pagoda ceiling, casting the whole place into a new riot of LIGHT and SHADOW as The Butcher prepares himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the Chinese Opera DANCER steps forward and stands near Bill. He NODS. The unsprung MUSIC begins. The DANCER starts to move, sinuously...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and Bill, with amazing skill, starts THROWING his KNIVES. The knife MISSES the Dancer by a hairsbreadth, landing in the floor near her foot. She doesn't flinch. She keeps dancing. And Bill keeps THROWING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... the KNIVES, which follow the Dancer around the room in a careful, deadly choreography. They land just inches from where she has just been, or will be: in a wall; a pillar; the apron of the small stage; the bar; the barrel of all-sorts. After each knife LANDS, kids retrieve it. When one of the KNIFE KIDS pulls the blade from the all-sorts barrel, DRUNKS knock each other over to drink from the stream that flows from the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Native Americans, meanwhile, WORK THROUGH the awed, attentive Crowd. They AVOID Cops, Tammany Members and anyone who looks too prosperous or too sober. But when one of the Natives SPOTS a MARGINAL CITIZEN, they GRAB his hand and examine it as if they were telling fortunes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Center floor, Bill pulls TWO KNIVES out, BALANCES one in each hand ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... as a WHORE in the crowd pushes a guy who's groping her toward a couple of Natives. Hels wearing a large RING. As soon as the Natives SEE the ring they throw their arms around the GROPER like a long-lost pal and escort him to Bill ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... who THROWS both knives rapidly at the Dancer. They land on the floor, inches from her dancing feet. She SPINS AWAY to great applause as the Natives bring the Groper to Bill.

They do quite a bit more than that: they GRAB the Groper and KNOCK him to the floor. In the crowd, one SPECTATOR turns to his companion.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch this careful. I've never seen the like, not even in Barnum's Museum.

</PAGODA_SPECTATOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Groper CRIES OUT as the Natives PIN HIM to the floor, SPREADEAGLED. Bill has one weapon left... in a special pocket, inside his vest. It's his CLEAVER. He takes it out slowly, SAVORING the moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Pagoda goes QUIET. Only the gambling continues. The MUSIC dies. The only SOUND beside the noises of the Chinese at their fan-tan is the Groper, who HOLLERS for help as soon as he sees the cleaver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bill HEFTS the cleaver in his hand, feels its weight, calculates timing, figures distance .... and starts THROWING it in the air...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... CATCHING it by the handle ... then throwing it again... higher, FASTER and HARDER with every toss.
</DIRECTION>

The Chinese opera MUSIC commences with a dissonant CRASH...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and Bill catches the cleaver again. But EVERY TIME he throws it and every time he catches it by its handle ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... he also MOVES CLOSER to the terrified Groper. Now... standing very close... he gives the cleaver a mighty toss ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... sending it SPINNING high in the air... up past the cages ... past the second-floor gallery, jammed with appreciative spectators ... until it SLOWS ... seems to HANG in the air... then starts its descent...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... FALLING FASTER... towards Bill's waiting, STEADY HAND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Groper SCREAMS in fear. Bill SMILES confidently, holding his hand out until ... just as smoothly, just as confidently...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... he PULLS his hand AWAY and the cleaver FALLS with terrific impact on the SPLAYED HAND of the Groper, cleanly SEVERING it at the wrist. The Groper FAINTS dead away as a TREMENDOUS CHEER greets Bill's amazing feat. One of the Natives TOSSES Bill the severed hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bill SLIDES the ring off the finger and TOSSES it to the Chinese Dancer.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_THE_BUTCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's for your beauty and your song.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_THE_BUTCHER>
<DIRECTION>
The Dancer puts the ring on her finger and DANCES OFF. Bill TOSSES the hand to the floor and walks back to his table. The Crowd PARTS, murmuring compliments on his dexterity, and the Knife Kids reverently RETURN the Butcher's implements.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now two DOGS from the rat pit in the back room RUN through the crowd and FIGHT FRENZIEDLY over possession of the bloody hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Crowd PASSES the Groper overhead and WE SEE from ABOVE: the Groper's unconscicus BODY being passed from hand to hand. The Crowd looks like a wave bearing the body toward the door. The Groper's stump BLEEDS on them as he passes overhead, sprinkling drops of blood and flesh like a moveable sacrament.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bill approaches his table, acknowledging the continuing adulation, and is about to sit down when a VOICE rises above all others.

	What do you want, boyo?

<AMSTERDAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got to give you something, Butcher. Something from my father.

</AMSTERDAM>
<DIRECTION>
Amsterdam PULLS OUT the piratels knife which Bill the Butcher used to kill his father almost 12 years before.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_THE_BUTCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got the sand to draw a blade in front of me? You will make good sport. Come ahead and give it here, you son of a bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_THE_BUTCHER>
<DIRECTION>
And Amsterdam THROWS the knife, the bright blade FLASHING OUT of his hand like lightning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And just as quickly the Buitcher PICKS UP his table, sending glasses flying and breaking, using it as a SHIELD...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and the knife THUMPS into it dead center. The Butcher HEAVES the table at Amsterdam...sending PATRONS yelling and SCATTERING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amsterdam LEAPS out of the way of the table, then RUNS AT Bill the Butcher...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... who's already coming for him. As they CLASH and GRAPPLE with each other...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... PATRONS all over the Pagoda crowd around for a good view of the action and start to MAKE BETS on the outcome. The odds do not favor Amsterdam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And neither does the fight. Amsterdam fights with real blood lust, but he doesn't have the Butcher's skill, or experience, or dispassion. He breaks the Butcher's CLINCH... HITS him once in the face... then a second time ... and then gets FLOORED by a well placed kick. The Crowd cheers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And, on the second floor, Jenny and Johnny come out of the room. Still arranging her clothes, Jenny looks over the gallery rail onto the floor below, sees the fight... and starts to RUN down the stairs. Johnny WATCHES her go ... looks at the fight again, for a second... then follows Jenny to the main floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Butcher is on top of Amsterdam now. He HITS him upside the head with the wood and brass handle of his cleaver. Then hits him again. AND AGAIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the Crowd now, Jenny finds Sheeny Mike.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Butcher'll kill him if we don't do something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<SHEENY_MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was Amsterdam's own doing. And it'll be our death too if we try to stop it.

(finally catching up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the truth.

<JENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The truth is you don't give a damn about him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<SHEENY_MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, if he gave a damn about us he wouldn't have called out the Butcher in the first place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENY_MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny looks at him with contempt, then STARTS into the crowd. Johnny grabs her ARM but she pushes him off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the floor, Bill uses the FLAT SIDE of the cleaver to SMACK the barely conscious Amsterdam on one side of his face... then on the other... REPEATEDLY... until Amsterdam is barely sensible. Bill grabs him by the hair. Amsterdam's body is slack.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_THE_BUTCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you say? Loin or shank? Rib or chop?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_THE_BUTCHER>

The Crowd YELLS their choices. Jenny tries to PLUNGE through toward Amsterdam, but a HALF-DOZEN MORTS and WHORES put hands on her and HOLD her back.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_THE_BUTCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, let me hear you!

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're all talking at once, I can't hear you!

<DIRECTION>
This is greeted with the biggest CHEER of the night. The newlyelected Mayor Wood seems to feel as if he should do something to stop the slaughter, but Boss Tweed calms him with a single dismissive GESTURE. Even the Boss himself is excited by the prospect of this ritual sacrifice.
</DIRECTION>

	Come on, look at it! You fancy yourself a gladiator, act a gladiator!

	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch the death blow when it comes to you. Go to hell with open eyes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_THE_BUTCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Bill the Butcher readies himself to deliver the blow... and a HAND GRABS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
his wrist, STOPPING his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Who would dare do this to Bill the Butcher? Bill turns, incredulous, to look into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... the untroubled face of Monk Eastman.
</DIRECTION>
<MONK_EASTMAN>

	It's been a full evening's fun now, Butcher. It's enough.

	Well I'm the game warden, you might say. I'm telling you this buck's too young yet. Wait till he's aged for a proper kill.

With his gigantic strength, Monk actually PULLS the Butcher off Amsterdam and onto his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<MONK_EASTMKN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just settle yourself Bill ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONK_EASTMKN>
<DIRECTION>
... and he part SHOVES, part THROWS Bill back a good twenty feet.
</DIRECTION>
<MONK_EASTMKN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and let the merrymaking continue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONK_EASTMKN>
<DIRECTION>
The Dead Rabbits have scampered forward, and they're picking Amsterdam up off the floor. Monk looks at Jenny and Johnny, who each have Amsterdam by an arm.

	It was his father took me in first, and it's thanks I'm returning now.

As the Rabbits CARRY Amsterdam toward the door, Monk finally turns his attention back to Bill.

	I'll have you then!

</BILL_THE_BUTCHER>
<MONK_EASTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come ahead, Bill. Unless you're wanting to shout me to death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONK_EASTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
And Bill comes forward, BRANDISHING his cleaver. Monk Eastman stands his ground, unmoving, untroubled. Everyone looks on in awe at this contest ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... except Boss Tweed.

	If these two are going to combat, it aught to be a worthier occasion. And more rewarding for all.

</BOSS_TWEED>
<DIRECTION>
Tweed SIGNALS to Bill: STOP. The Butcher sees the signal but can't believe it. He SHAKES his head. His blood is up. He won't stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tweed SIGNALS AGAIN. Bill KEEPS COMING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tweed signals Killoran, who STANDS himself. And, when he stands, every COP and TAMMANY LOYALIST in the place--a hundred of them anyway--STAND behind Boss Tweed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Bill keeps coming, and Monk stands easy, waiting...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... the Natives and their ALLIES now stand, facing the Tammany crew. The Tammany backers, dressed flush and fancy, face the scruffier, more savage Five Points bunch: the twin factions of the criminal underworld, so different in style and so similar in purpose, SIZE EACH OTHER UP from opposite sides of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bill STOPS. The odds are shifting, the stakes are climbing. Even the Chinese STOP GAMBLING. For the first time all evening the room is absolutely STILL. Even the Dead Rabbits have turned, at the door, to see what will happen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tweed and the Butcher LOCK EYES: neither blinks. Then after a moment ... a very long moment ... a calm, bemused Tweed RAISES his glass.
</DIRECTION>
<BOSS_TWEED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I only wanted to thank you, Bill, for the customary good job today... and an equally bright future for us both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOSS_TWEED>
<DIRECTION>
Another pause. Bill does not look placated. The whole place seems ready to explode...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... until Boss Tweed RISES to his feet, and RAISES his glass higher.
</DIRECTION>
<BOSS_TWEED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you drink with me, Bill, as a friend? An honored friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOSS_TWEED>
<DIRECTION>
Bill weighs the proposition... then looks to his men, NODS his head to call them off. He GRABS a glass off a table to join Tweed's toast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC begins again. The gambling recommences. Patrons take their seats. The Dead Rabbits help Amsterdam out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monk Eastman sidles up to Bill the Butcher.

<MONK_EASTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If there's one thing I can't abide, it's fighting for free.

He takes the Butcher's glass from his hand, raises it in salute, DRINKS DEEP and hands it back to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the door of the Pagoda, a badly beaten Ansterdam starts FLAILING and fighting by brute instinct. He HITS Jenny, and she goes down. Johnny grapples with him as Jenny PICKS HERSELF up and struggles to help SUBDUE Amsterdam.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go easy! Go easy. It's over.

She grabs Amsterdam's arm and, with Johnny's help, tries to HOIST him back to his feet.

<JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(Looking at Amsterdam's bloody face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's too damn little of him left to know anything.

They start across Paradise Square, holding him up...

... as the rest of the Dead Rabbits join to help them... all growing smaller in the distance against the primeval nighttime landscape of the Five Points...

Another DOOR OPENS, and Amsterdam stands on the threshold. A week or so has passed since the big night at Sparrow's Pagoda, but Amsterdam's face still shows the marks of Bill's beating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Don Whiskerandos is ministering to Monk Eastman with a straight razor, giving him a close and careful shave. Monk is thoroughly relaxed, doesn't even glance over when the door opens, hardly reacts when Don Whiskerandos says ....

Monk SIGHS and points to a huge WAR CLUB which hangs in a place of honor above the shop mirror. It has deep marks running along its front, like NOTCHES-

	You see my instrument there? First notch represents two dollars and fifty cents. That's how much I got for my first kill.

A large wagon bearing a Tammany banner and carrying dozens of small sacks of coal moves slowly down the narrow street. Boss Tweed sits on the front seat, next to the driver, as his minions HAND him coal sacks. Tweed distributes them with a smile to the NEEDY who trot next to the wagon.

	Citizens of the Five Points! It seems the Native Americans have come to trouble. They have grown so weak that now they seek my help. They can pay any wage I ask. But I ask you now.

Radiant and curious, Jenny joins the Reverend Raleigh in the center of the room.

<REVEREND_RALEIGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the evening's regent chooses her evening's partner.

</REVERAND_RALEIGH>
<DIRECTION>
Under the instruction of the bustling Reverend and his HELPERS, the Women skeptically stand away from the Men, who allow themselves to be arranged into a LINE. The Reverend Raleigh escorts the delighted Jenny to a chair that has been placed, by itself, in the center of the room. Jenny sits down, facing away from the rest of the guests. She holds a MIRROR in her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<REVEREND_RALEIGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now. The men, please. One by one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVEREND_RALEIGH>
<DIRECTION>
The first volunteer Reverend Raleigh brings forward is a reluctant Sheeny Mike. There are RUDE COMMENTS as he leads Mike slowly to the center of the room, coming up behind Jenny until she can see Mikels face reflected in the mirror. She SHAKES her head.
</DIRECTION>
<REVEREND_RALEIGH>

	Next Gentleman, please.

</REVEREND_RALEIGH>
<DIRECTION>
More laughing. The BOYS push out one CANDIDATE. Rejected.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now ANOTHER CANDIDATE comes forward. And STILL ANOTHER- Jenny rejects each with the composure of a princess.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now it is Johnny's turn. He WALKS slowly across the big room, and stands behind Jenny, trying to look confident. The moment is long, the room's tense... until--just once but very decisively-Jenny SHAKES her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny watches Johnny's face in the mirror. She stays still. Finally, he walks back to the GANG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Amsterdam starts toward the center of the room. He keeps his eyes fixed on Jenny.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jenny catches Amsterdam's reflection in the mirror. He STOPS. She NODS her head. Yes. Him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small BAND strikes up a barely recognizable version of "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God," arranged in waltz time. Jenny rises and holds out her arms to Amsterdam. They start to DANCE, a little clumsily, as other COUPLES join them.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
His eyes, in the candlelight, show both his love and his Resolution. Jenny NODS and they DANCE AWAY ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... losing themselves now among the dancers, all moving and holding candles. As they dance, their movement becomes SPLIT, SEQUENTIAL, a study in motion like an old Gjon Mili photograph. Their bodies create a RUSH OF YELLOW LIGHT ACROSS the screen like the tail of a comet.

Just before dawn. The streets are empty, the river is quiet. AMSTERDAM follows JOHNNY out of the house.

<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to fight you.

	Alright, alright. Then tell me why like this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMSTERDAM>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So when I lose no one will see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
And he SLUGS him. Hard. Harder even than he thought he could. AMSTERDAM stumbles, stunned, then pulls himself up. And CHARGES at Johnny, knocking him down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two friends PUNCH, WRESTLE, BITE and PUMMEL EACH OTHER with such extravagant energy that they soon...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... as a PACK OF ORPHANS, eyes glinting like night animals, scatter like wild beasts disturbed in their burrow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amsterdam has the physical advantage, and more skill. But Johnny has the fury. All the feeling and the frustration rain out of him physically, making the match nearly even.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Orphan Pack watches the fight silently, showing no favoritism or emotion, just an edge of curiosity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amsterdam HITS Johnny a wicked combination that makes him SINK to one knee in the mud. But Johnny will not go down. Amsterdam, hurt himself, just stares at Johnny in wonderment.
</DIRECTION>
<AMSTERDAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Satisfied?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMSTERDAM>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Satisfied? It wasn't me that's been dancing and shagging all night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
And he pulls himself to his feet and THROWS a roundhouse at Amsterdam, who half-staggers out of the way. The moment throws Johnny off balance, and he falls in the mud again, this time on all fours. Amsterdam SINKS down beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<AMSTERDAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMSTERDAM>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny won't stop: he throws a punch that Amsterdam can see coming a block away. But he's too tired too duck; or maybe he's just fed up. He takes the punch and FALLS on his back.

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it then.

</AMSTERDAM>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
And he THROWS HIMSELF on Amsterdam. It's more like he rolls over onto him than anything, but he's on top of him now, hitting him in the face with all he's got left in him.
</DIRECTION>
<AMSTERDAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMSTERDAM>
<DIRECTION>
Amsterdam HEAVES Johnny off and pops him a solid SWIPE to the jaw. That does it. Lights out. Johnny falls unconscious into the slime beneath the pier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Orphan Pack keeps staring from the shadow with their ferret eyes. Still silent. Amsterdam STRUGGLES to his feet, stops at the river's edge to get a handful of water to revive himself. Then he looks over, sees his unconscious friend.
</DIRECTION>
<AMSTERDAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn you anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMSTERDAM>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs Johnny's body by the shoulders and pulls him to the river's edge. He gets some water on his hand, lets it drip over Johnny's face, washing away a little of the blood. Not enough. He draws some more water, and RUBS it gently onto Johnny's face.

Bill NODS emphatically at Don Whiskerandos, who is clearly terrified. Bill nods again, almost vehemently. Don Whiskerandos SHAKES his head. Bill GLARES at him. The Barber takes a STEP BACK. Monk opens his eyes, starts to size up the situation.

MONK BELLOWS, staggers toward Don Whiskerandos, who shrinks against the wall. The scissor protrudes from Monk's eye as he RAGES, blinded by blood, now reaching out for the Butcher

	Your eyes was open for that alright. And you still got one to see this.

</BILL_THE_BUTCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Bill the Butcher reaches above him for Monk's war club, which hangs on the wall. He grabs tight hold of it and, with Monk nearly upon him, swings it viciously at Monk's head. The BLOW sends the scissor FLYING out of Monk's eye, with the eyeball still attached. It also SMASHES in the side of Monk's face. He FALLS, still GRABBING desperately for the Butcher...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... who now stands over him, beating him incessantly with the war club. CAVING his head in. KILLING him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Don Whiskerandos looks at Bill in a virtual paralysis of terror. The Butcher lets the CLUB FALL, reaches in his pocket and throws some MONEY at the barber.

The enormity of what he's done is beginning to sink in. He turns to leave the shop ... but STOPS in the doorway.

Outside, CITIZENS of the Points are staring at the fallen Monk in mute wonder. They have just witnessed a moment in history.

He takes a knife from his vest, and CUTS the LAST NOTCH in the club. Then, slowly...

walks among them in regal splendor, the war club at his side, dripping gore.

As the crowd falls back, Bill spots Amsterdam, Johnny and some of the other Dead Rabbits, watching his every mave. He STOPS.

HOLDS OUT the bloody war club in front of him... straight in front of him... POINTING IT right at Amsterdam.

Boss Tweed reigns in the banquet room of a vast, gaslit restaurant, at a long table overburdened with food. Seated along both sides of the table is an array of the city's POWER BROKERS, with whom Tweed and his Tammany MINIONS mix easily. Their attitude toward the Power Brokers is a mixture of ribald fawning and fine condescension; the Power Brokers, in turn, enjoy the food, and the MUSIC from a small BAND, and the DANCING GIRLS who flirt and entertain them, while exuding the unmistakable impression of amateur anthropologists exploring a decaying civilization.

Tweed is courting and joking with a bewhiskered HORACE GREELEY, editor of the influential Tribune.

	You don't know nothing about that! It was my doing! It says in The Book, "If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out." I followed that law with my own knife and hand. The first I ever fought Priest Vallon, he bested me. And when he came to bring me to death, I looked away and he watched me and he let me go. The shame was worse than the killing. I would have cut out both eyes if I could still have fought, but cutting just the one gave me heart. When I killed Priest Vallon, that restored me. Now I sent Monk Eastman over I got glory. I got all there is, and small thanks to you, squire.

A NATIVE AMERICAN drives a cart carrying large barrels of MILK. A SECOND NATIVE rides beside him on the seat, holding a rifle, looking impassively at the faces turned up to him. A WOMAN holding a BABY in one arm and a CHILD by the hand steps in front of them. They almost run her down.

Across the room, Jenny is sitting talking to a few of the WHORES, one of whom is a mixed-blood Eurasian with long black hair named Emma Loss. She gets up lazily and heads for the bar. As she passes a DRUNK, he reaches out to grab her. She's used to this, and she knocks his hand away. He keeps after her.

At the bar, Mother Joyce notices Emma being hassled, but pays no attention: her girls can take care of themselves.

He WATCHES, fascinated, fragments of the everyday rituals of a world he's never seen. As SOUNDS drift listlessly from the street beyond, and a light BREEZE blows, WE SEE IN A SERIES OF DISSOLVES the serving of a meal; SERVANTS carrying and passing plates; FAMILY MEMBERS reaching for dishes and passing them; the LOW KURMUR of Konversation in accents he has never heard. It's not so much that these people and their life are foreign to him. It is as if he has stepped into another Dimension.

	These lead all under the Square, into the Brewery and out again from there. They're closed off and forgotten since the Reverend opened the mission. Pass me the candle.

Amsterdam hands Jenny a stump of candle, which she holds high enough to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... that the tunnel has opened onto a small room just above the foundation of Jacob's Ladder. It's a graveyard, memorializing gang members gone to a better world--or worse. Trophies from many gangs--including the bones and skulls of some Dead Rabbits-litter the place in loose ritual fashion, as if this were a catacomb in Palermo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stooping low, Jenny walks to a narrow corner of the room, where several PAVING STONES have been laid in the rough pattern of a cross. A slab of slate serves as a headstone, and on it, in fading paint, barely legible, is the name "Maggie Everdeane."

Amsterdam hands her a chest that looks like a small version of Blackbeard's treasure box. She opens it and holds the candle close: inside is the swag from all her cat burglaries. There's a lot of it, GLITTERING with promise in the GUTTERING flame. Jenny starts to dig in her mother's grave.

... that we are in the country, a graveyard in an open field with an astonishing PANORAMA of New York and the East River. (MATTE) The cemetery is atop a hill, and the East River, busy with ferries and vessels of trade, glistens in the near distance. Just beyond it is Manhattan Island: low buildings, winding narrow streets, houses surrounded by open land. A BREEZE off the river rustles Jenny's dress and blows her hair as she steps up to the grave site, looks at the headstone and sees ...

The growth of the Dead Rabbits, as we continue to HEAR Amsterdam speak passionately to Jenny. We first see the Rabbits surrounding and OVERTURNING a fire wagon; this starts as a live action scene but soon BLEEDS into SEPIA, then freezes like an old magazine illustration.

	All of us is set on the same road together. The gang can have everything they ever wanted and get me what I want while they're doing it. We're not interfering with each other, we're helping each other. It's all the same, we're all one together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMSTERDAM>
<DIRECTION>
We CONTINUE with sepia illustrations: of Dead Rabbit morts picking pockets and purses along a crowded Broadway; climbing onto a wagon distributing newspapers and tossing off the occupants, taking over the route themselves; swarming all over a merchant ship in the harbor as the captain doles out protection money to have his cargo unloaded.

A sepia illustration of a fire wagon rounding a corner, refurbished and manned by Rabbits, all wearing striking uniforms with short capes called TAMLAS. (N.B.: they will be seen wearing the tanlas from these uniforms during all gang activity throuqhout the rest of the film. Only Johnny, Amsterdam and Jenny do not wear them.)

The sepia illustration turns to live action as the fire wagon TEARS around Paradise Square, SCATTERING everyone in its path, the Dead Rabbits laughing, their tamlas FLYING behind them.

Far up the sparkling Hudson, a RAFT floats slowly upstream. It's a huge thing (perhaps half a city block in size) crowded with SPORTSMEN. They form a LARGE RING around two mammoth PRIZEFIGHTERS who are brawling with bare knuckles. Amsterdam and Johnny are among the spectators.

At the base of a lamppost, a group of RIOTERS have cut open the hog-tied CORPSE of a black man and are pouring oil into it. One of the Rioters sees Jenny, grins and holds out the TORCH he's holding. She shakes her head and starts to BACK out of the alley.

A TREMENDOUS VOLLEY of GUNFIRE, as if to illustrate the Tweed theory of class warfare. Bodies fall in the street. Bodies fall from the Armory. The building is under siege by the main unit of the MILITIA and by Bill the Butcher and the Natives. The Dead Rabbits are trapped.

Johnny SNAKES through the Native American lines, over dead bodies, moving towards Bill, who he sees a hundred yards away...

FIRING continues from both sides as the Butcher shouts at the Militia Commander.

The men start to JOIN the Butcher; even some militia fall in. Johnny SLIPS through the men gathering near the Butcher. He's closer to Bill than ever.

Bill starts to mount their BARRICADE. There is MOVEMENT and commotion all around him as Natives and militia fall into rough formation. It threatens to obscure Bill from Johnny's view. Shield him.

He has to make his move. NOW. He DRAWS a revolver as militia and Natives pass in front of him... he AIMS ... he's anxious, confused ... his HAND shakes ... he fires... too soon! ...

The Butcher turns in the direction of the shot, SEES Johnny. Their eyes lock. Johnny FIRES again ... WINGS Bill ...

Bill the Butcher SLINGS Johnny's body over his shoulder as easily as if it were an empty sack of flour...

Bill walks alone toward the Native/militia lines.

From inside... from every window ... the Dead Rabbits watch him.

The sun is high, but the street is eerily quiet. There are FARAWAY SOUNDS of battle, but here there is only the sound of distant, unheard conversation between Bill, the Militia Commander and some Natives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amsterdam WATCHES intently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Butcher and the Militia Commander argue, but we still can't hear what they're saying. There is still no sound...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... until, SUDDENLY, we see the Militia Commander's face. Huge. EYES WIDE with surprise as we HEAR the thunderclap of a SHOT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bill the Butcher has just gutshot the Militia Commander.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As if the shot were a signal, the Natives TURN on the militia. It's hellish, close-quarter combat. Guns fired inches from enemies who had just been allies. Knives, swords, bludgeons, kids with dead-rat blackjacks, women with hob-nailed wooden planks, attacking better-armed but totally stunned soldiers.

Bill the Butcher falls back toward the Armory, the Natives following him.

Inside the Armory, Amsterdam turns to his own greatly diminished gang.

The Rabbits are so stunned to be fighting on the same side as their sworn enemies that, even with Amsterdam's order, no one makes a move. It's Amsterdam who FIRES the first shots. And that unleashes a great VOLLEY from the Armory...

... toward the militia.

<DIRECTION>
The Butcher and the Natives are closer to the Armory now... and the Armory doors start to open...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... when a MILITIA LIEUTENANT SIGNALS ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and MILITIA on the surrounding roofs, waiting for this moment, suddenly open fire...on the Natives below and on the Rabbits on the roof of the armory. Many drop in the street and fall from the Armory roof...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... as the Armory doors SWING WIDE to admit the Natives. As they run or stagger inside, the Rabbits start to close the doors. Some Rabbits are cut down by the fire from the rooftops. Other Natives never make it to the doors. And a few are shot...

As Jenny runs, her swag drops and FALLS from under her clothes. She TURNS to pick it up but Amsterdam PULLS her on....

It is VOLCANIC in its brilliance and intensity. The sky turns BLACK with powder, BLAZING ORANGE with flame.

In the small streets BEHIND THE ARMORY, many gang members are CRUSHED by debris or burned by FIREBALLS breaking off from the central flame.
