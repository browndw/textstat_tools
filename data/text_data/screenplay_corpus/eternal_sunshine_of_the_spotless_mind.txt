INT. PUBLISHING HOUSE RECEPTION AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's grand and modern. Random House-Knopf-Taschen is etched on the wall in large gold letters. An old woman enters carrying a tattered manuscript, maybe a thousand pages. She seems haunted, hollow-eyed, sickly. The young receptionist, dressed in a shiny, stretchy one-piece pantsuit, looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<OLD_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(apologetically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_WOMAN>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<OLD_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_WOMAN>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. Please have a seat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<DIRECTION>
The old woman smiles and sits, the bulky manuscript on her lap. She stares politely straight ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<RECEPTIONIST>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (quietly into headset)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's her -- I know, but couldn't you just -- Yes, I know, but -- I know, but she's old and it would be a nice -- Yes, sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to old woman)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, ma'am, he's not in right now. It's a crazy time of year for us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<DIRECTION>
The receptionist gestures toward a Christmas tree in the corner. Its ornaments are holograms.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This book -- It's essential that people read it because --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gravely, patting the manuscript)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- It's the truth. And only I know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_WOMAN>
<RECEPTIONIST>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding sympathetically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe after the holidays then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TILED HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The old woman carries her manuscript haltingly down a subway hall. She stops to catch her breath, then continues and passes several archway with letters printed above them. When she arrives at one topped by an LL, she slips a card in a slot. A plastic molded chair drops into the archway. She sits in the chair; it rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUBE -DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman is still in the chair as it slips gracefully into a line of chairs shooting through a glass tube. The other chairs are peopled with commuters. We stay with the woman as she and the others travel over New York City in the tube. There are hundreds of these commuter tubes crisscrossing the skyline. The woman glances at the manuscript in her lap. It's called:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This serves as the movie's opening title. The other credits follow, as the old woman studies commuters in passing tubes. Their faces are variously harsh and sad and lonely and blank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUBTITLED: FIFTY YEARS EARLIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every doctor's office waiting room: chairs against the wall, magazines on end tables, a sad-looking potted plant, generic seascape paintings on the walls. The receptionist, Mary, 25, can be seen typing in the reception area. Behind her are shelves and shelves of medical files. The door opens and Clementine enters. She's in her early thirties, zaftig in a faux fur winter coat over an orange hooded sweatshirt. She's decidedly funky and has blue hair. Mary looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<CLEMENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(approaching reception area)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENTINE>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Clementine sits. She looks tired, maybe hungover. She picks up a magazine at random and thumbs without interest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INNER OFFICE AREA - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary pads down the hallway. She knocks on a closed door.
</DIRECTION>
<MIERZWIAK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIERZWIAK>
<DIRECTION>
Mary opens the door, peeks in. Howard Mierzwiak, 40's, professional, dry, sits behind his desk studying some papers.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Howard, your one o'clock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<MIERZWIAK>
<DIRECTION>
(not looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIERZWIAK>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles and nods. It's clear she's in love. It's equally clear that Mierzwiak doesn't have a clue. Mary turns to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<MIERZWIAK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary...

<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome, Howard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles and heads down the hall. Stan, 30's, tall, spindly, and earnest in a lab coat pops out of a doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
She glances back nervously at Mierzwiak's open door.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Barely seen you all morning, kiddo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<DIRECTION>
He leans in to kiss her. She cranes her neck to keep him off.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
<DIRECTION>
(reprimanding whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stan... c'mon...
	</DIALOGUE>

</MARY>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. Anyway --
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
She indicates the door to the reception area. Stan nods.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you later, alligator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'kay.

</MARY>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I better do this, Stan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Stan nods again and Mary opens the door to the waiting room.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>

<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, Clementine appears in the doorway. Mary leads her down the hall, not looking back.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
<DIRECTION>
(professionally courteous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I guess.

</CLEMENTINE>
<MARY>
<DIRECTION>
(at Mierzwiak's office)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Mierzwiak steps out from behind his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<MIERZWIAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Kruczynski, please come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIERZWIAK>
<DIRECTION>
Clementine enters the office. Mary smiles at Mierzwiak and closes the door, leaving them alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mierzwiak directs Clementine to a chair next to a coffee table and a conspicuously placed box of tissues. Mierzwiak sits across from her. He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<MIERZWIAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIERZWIAK>
<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIERZWIAK>
<DIRECTION>
He indicates a tape recorder.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns it on, smiles at her, gestures for her to begin.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEMENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENTINE>
<MIERZWIAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with hm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIERZWIAK>
<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Mierzwiak nods. He's attentive, pleasant, and neutral throughout.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEMENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENTINE>
<MIERZWIAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIERZWIAK>
<DIRECTION>
She nods, thinks.

<CLEMENTINE>

EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUBTITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The platform is crowded with business commuters. Joel is among them. He is in his 30's, gaunt, and holding a briefcase. The platform across the tracks from him is empty. Suddenly he turns and makes his way through the crowd. He climbs the stairs, crosses the overpass to the empty platform. Soon an almost empty train pulls up to that platform. Joel gets on and watches the business commuters through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joel talks on a phone. The wind howls around him. He tries to shield the mouthpiece as he talks.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Cindy. Joel. Listen, I'm not feeling well this morning. No. Food poisoning, I think. Sorry it took me so long to call in, but I've been vomiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joel wanders the windy, empty beach, with his briefcase. He passes an old man with a metal detector. They nod at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later: Joel looks out at the ocean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later: Joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook. He opens it and writes with a gloved hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	January 13th, 2006. Today I skipped work and took the train out to Montauk.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(thinks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(thinks some more)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The sky is gray.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(thinks some more)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what else to say. Nothing happens. Nothing changes. I saw Naomi last night. We had sex. It was weird to fall into our old familiar sex life so easily. Like no time has passed. After two years apart suddenly we're talking about getting together again. I guess that's good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<DIRECTION>
He has no other thoughts. He glances up, spots a female figure in the distance, walking in his direction. She stands out against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded sweatshirt. It's Clementine. He watches her for a bit, then as she nears, he goes back to his writing, or at least pretends to. Once she passed, he watches her walk away. She stops and stares out at the ocean. Joel writes.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I'm constitutionally incapable of making eye-contact with a woman I don't know. I guess I'd better get back to Naomi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<DIRECTION>
Later: Joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the season. He peeks cautiously in a dark window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later: Joel digs into the sand with a stick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a local tourist place, but off-season empty. Joel sits in a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of tomato soup. An elderly couple drink coffee at the counter. Clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood. Joel glances at her bright blue hair. She picks an empty booth and sits. Joel studies her discreetly. The waitress approaches her with a coffee pot.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, yes. You've saved my life!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
The waitress pours the coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what you want yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<CLEMENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ain't that the question of the century.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
The waitress is not amused.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEMENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got grilled cheese and tomato soup?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENTINE>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. We're having a run on it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
The waitress heads to the grill. Clementine fishes in her bag, brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment, pours something in, then brings the cup back up.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEMENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(calling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And some cream, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Clementine looks around the place. Her eyes meet Joel's before he is able to look away. She smiles vaguely. He looks embarrassed, then down at his journal. Clementine pulls a book from her purse and starts to read. Joel glances up, tries to see the cover. It's blue. He can't read the title.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joel stares out at the ocean. Far down the beach Clementine stares at it, too. Joel glances sideways at her then back at the ocean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joel sits on the bench waiting for a train. Clementine enters the platform, sees Joel, the only other person there. She waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if they're old friends. He waves back, embarrassed. She takes a seat on a bench far down the platform. Joel stares at his hands, pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to conceal his awkwardness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN - A BIT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the slowly passing desolate terrain. After a moment the door between cars opens and Clementine enters. Joel looks up. Clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding where to sit. She settles on a seat at the opposite end of the car. Joel looks out the window. He feels her watching him. The train is picking up speed. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<CLEMENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(calling over the rumble)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Joel looks over.

<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>

</JOEL>
<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you sorry? I just said hi.

</CLEMENTINE>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around the empty car.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENTINE>
<JOEL>
<DIRECTION>
(embarrassed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I didn't want to assume.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENTINE>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<DIRECTION>
Clementine makes her way down the aisle towards Joel.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENTINE>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. So...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where she came from.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --

	No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --

<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, really.

	Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENTINE>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.

<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Because --

</JOEL>
<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENTINE>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.

<JOEL>

</CLEMENTINE>
<JOEL>

	I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.

</JOEL>
<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, the hair.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pulls a strand in front of her eyes, studies it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</CLEMENTINE>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like it.

<CLEMENTINE>

	Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.

	I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?

The conductor heads into the next car. Clementine shoves stuff back into her purse. Her hands are a little shaky. She pulls a airline-sized bottle of alcohol from her pocket, opens it, and downs it. Joel is watching all of this but pretending not to. She looks out the window for a while. The train pulls into the station. The doors open. Nobody gets on. The doors close. The train pulls out.

There are a few more people in the car now. Clementine has inched a few seats closer to Joel. She watches him. His head is immersed in his journal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN - LATER

It's dark out. The train is pretty crowded. Joel stares out the window. Clementine sits closer still to Joel, eyes him.

EXT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING

The doors open and Joel emerges along with others. He heads to the parking lot, arrives at the car. There's a big dented scrape along the driver's side. He gets in.

INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Joel drives. He passes Clementine walking. She looks cold. He considers, slows, rolls down his window.

Joel stands in the living room, somewhat nervously. He tries to calm himself by focusing on the surroundings. He looks at the books on her shelves. Clementine is in the kitchen. We see her as she passes by the doorway several times, preparing drinks and chatting.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. I like it, too. Been here about four years. It's really cheap. My downstairs neighbor is old so she's quiet, which is great.

<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.

<CLEMENTINE>

	And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?

	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the goal, Joel?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENTINE>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?

<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>

<CLEMENTINE>

</CLEMENTINE>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<CLEMENTINE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not at all.

</JOEL>

Joel looks slightly crestfallen.

<CLEMENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (off his reaction)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.

</CLEMENTINE>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.

</CLEMENTINE>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's scary sounding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?

<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so.

We stay with Clementine as she watches Joel tromping through the snow and getting in his car.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joel speeds through the suburban Rockville Center neighborhood. There is no snow on the ground. He seems different, somehow foggy and disoriented.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUBTITLE: THREE DAYS EARLIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He arrives at his apartment building and parks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joel gets out of his car, spots a van parked across the street. There are two dark figures inside.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OVER>
<DIRECTION>
He hurries inside the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joel enters, dumps his overcoat on a chair, turns off the lights, crosses to look furtively out the window. It's snowing in large flakes which seem to fall only in the beam of a streetlight.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was snowing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OVER>
<DIRECTION>
Joel squints to see inside the van. Two dark figures talk. One sucks on a cigarette and s dim orange light momentarily illuminates the interior. The figure in the driver seat rolls down his window and gives a cheery wave to Joel.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm like a joke to them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OVER>
<DIRECTION>
Joel pulls away from the window, his face blanched.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess they figure they can act like they want. They don't have to worry about me remembering.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OVER>
<DIRECTION>
He paces, mulling things over. As he does, the scene starts to change, almost as if it is drying out.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I might be making a mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OVER>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you, Clementine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<DIRECTION>
The colors bleach, the surroundings become slightly vague. Even Joel's persona and voice-over seem to alter, his emotional intensity becoming diffused. Joel does not seem aware of this. He stops pacing, takes a small vial from his pocket, dumps the lone pill onto his palm. He looks at it. It's pink. There's some illegible initials stamped on it.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pink.

	I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.

</JOEL>
<VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OVER>
<DIRECTION>
He swallows it, peeks out the window again, takes off his clothes, slips into a pair of pajamas fresh from the store packaging. He sits on the edge of the bed, dials the phone.

Joel hangs up and lies on his back on the bed. By now the scene is lifeless, almost a husk. He hears the apartment building door open. He hears footsteps.

INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joel sits in the bookstore coffee shop. It's a jarring transition, visually and emotionally. Joel is in the midst of some traumatic state of mind. He fingers the vial with the pink pill in it as he watches Clementine stack books on shelves. Her hair is bright orange now.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should maybe talk to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OVER>
<DIRECTION>
Joel rises and heads toward Clementine.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OVER>
<DIRECTION>
Right before Joel gets there, Patrick, a skinny young man approaches Clementine. Joel stops, watches. The young man seems out of breath. He glances over at Joel, then taps Clementine on the shoulder. She turns, annoyed, sees who it is and her face lights up.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clementine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's your look for me.

Clementine giggles, stands and pokes Patrick playfully in the ribs.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.

</PATRICK>

	You were not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENTINE>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Joel is mesmerized by their familiarity. As he stands there, the scene starts to dry out. Clementine and Patrick continue their flirtation but it's turning lifeless, as if they are just reciting lines. The bookstore start to lose its color and immediacy.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come over after I'm done here?

<PATRICK>

</CLEMENTINE>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>

Joel seems dazed, in some sort of dream confusion, as he realizes the world around him is looking increasingly odd.

<DIRECTION>
Joel turns to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joel drives fast, recklessly. The intensity is back. He's weeping as he drives.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OVER>
<DIRECTION>
The scene is faded as he parks in front of his apartment building, and gets out of the car. Joel spots the parked van. We've seen this before, but it's dried out now.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Them.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joel trudges along carrying two big trash bags full of stuff. He's been crying. He looks behind him and finds himself looking out the window of his apartment at the dark van on the snowy street. He turns back to the New York Street and spots the address he was looking for: 610 11th Avenue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joel sits in the small room with his bags. A woman across from him cradles a box full of belongings in her lap. Her eyes are red from crying. Mary, the receptionist, pokes her head through her window into the waiting room.

	How exactly is this going to work tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<DIRECTION>
As Mierzwiak talks, the room colors start to fade, Mierzwiak's tone of voice is also affected; it becomes dry and monotonous.
</DIRECTION>
<MIERZWIAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIERZWIAK>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<MIERZWIAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIERZWIAK>
<DIRECTION>
Joel looks quizzically at the eroding environment. Suddenly he gets it.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's happening now! I'm already in my brain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<DIRECTION>
Mierzwiak looks at the fading room.

<MIERZWIAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I suppose you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(back in his faded memory persona)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, let's get started -- If we want the procedure underway tonight, we have some work to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIERZWIAK>
<DIRECTION>
Joel is sitting in a chair. Electrodes connect him to some electronic machinery monitored by Stan. Mierzwiak watches from the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We use the articles you brought to create a map of Clementine in your brain. Tonight while you sleep we'll be able to trace the map and erase.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you're tracing and erasing now. It's already started. I'm home in my bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<DIRECTION>
Stan pulls a snow globe from one of Joel's bags, shows it to Joel. The equipment registers Joel's reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<DIRECTION>
Stan pulls out a potato dressed as a Vegas showgirl. Joel studies it. The machines register his response.
</DIRECTION>
<MIERZWIAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here. That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIERZWIAK>
<DIRECTION>
Stan pulls out a coffee mug with a photo of Clementine printed on it. Joel looks at the cup. The machines record his reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. We're getting healthy read-outs.
	</DIALOGUE>

The room, Stan, and Mierzwiak are now vague and wispy.

Joel looks up. Stan's voice seems to be coming from above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joel lies on his back in fresh pajamas. His eyes are closed and electrodes connect his head to several machines. The machines are operated by Stan, now in grubby street clothes and in need of a shave, and by Patrick, dressed similarly. The monitor on one of the machines traces a myriad of light blips running like streams through an image of Joel's brain. Stan presses buttons and operates a joystick, aiming for the lines. Patrick (who we saw earlier with Clementine at the bookstore) studies a meter on one of the machines.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The voltage looks fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then check the connections.

Patrick fiddles with some jacks.

	Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.

INT. LAB ROOM - DAY

The memory is becoming vague, characters' affects flat. Stan pulls out a pile of loose-leaf pages. Mierzwiak smiles.

	December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joel, snapped into a new memory, cries as he fills two large plastic garbage bags with mementos of his relationship with Clementine. There are funny little gifts, wind-up toys, some potatoes dressed as women, some clothing Clementine has left there, some CD's. He pulls a big clump of pages out of his loose-leaf journal and dumps them in the bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets some clean loose-leaf paper and writes:
</DIRECTION>

	Joel, honey... We have to feed the dog. Would you just wait here? Just a second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Joel nods, confused, as Rob and Carrie leave the room and close the door behind them. Joel hears a hushed argument ensue in the hall. He notices the dog asleep on the floor. He grabs a magazine off the coffee table, flips through it distractedly as he paces, puts it down, picks up another. A subscription card falls to the floor. He picks it up and is about to shove it back in the magazine when he sees it is not a subscription card at all. It reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clementine Kruczynski has had Joel Barish erased from her memory. Please never mention their relationship to her again. Thank you.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lacuna Ltd. 610 11th Avenue, NY, NY.

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joel gets off on the sixth floor. He searches for a room number. As he turns the corner, he sees that the hallway is faded, vague and mostly erased. He keeps walking, comes to the door marked Lacuna and opens it. Inside he can see vague, erased version of Mary the receptionist.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
<DIRECTION>
(dead monotone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, May I help you?

(laughs)
</DIRECTION>

	Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENTINE>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEL>
<DIRECTION>
This shuts Clementine up. She is stung and she starts gathering up her belongings, which are strewn about the apartment. Joel is immediately sorry he said this. He follows her around.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. Okay. I didn't mean that. I just... I was just... pissed, I guess.

He stops the car, gets out.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a street you might see in a dream, more an impression of a quiet street than an actual one, with what little detail there is obscured in darkness. Joel wanders it. In the distance Clementine walks off, but as in an animated loop, she doesn't get any farther away. It's lonely.

	I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Mierzwiak works the equipment. He has located a small area of light in the brain imaging and eradicates them.
</DIRECTION>
<MIERZWIAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm getting the hang of it. I still understand it. But I'm finding him quickly enough. I'm hopeful there won't be too much peripheral eradication.

	That's fine, Stan.

Mary doesn't say anything. Stan huffs and is out the door. Mierzwiak continues to find and erase points of light. Mary gets up her courage to speak.

	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you mean?

<MARY>

	Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.

</MARY>
<MIERZWIAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.

Mary is thrilled, beside herself. She tries to calm down.

<MARY>

	Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<MIERZWIAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that Nietzsche?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIERZWIAK>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<MIERZWIAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIERZWIAK>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles at her. She's flustered, flattered.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
<DIRECTION>
(sputtering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.

</MARY>
<MIERZWIAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alexander Pope?

<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(puts hand over mouth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<MIERZWIAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's no big deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIERZWIAK>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are such a sweetheart.

There's an embarrassed moment as that line hangs in the air. Then Mary plunges ahead to bury it.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, the quote goes "How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot: Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each prayer accepted, and each wish resign'd".
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, proud and embarrassed.

<MIERZWIAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's lovely.

	Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.

<DIRECTION>

Mierzwiak seems momentarily taken aback, then returns to his unflappable self.
</DIRECTION>
<MIERZWIAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a wonderful girl, Mary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIERZWIAK>
<DIRECTION>
She leans over and kisses him, then pulls away quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.

(suddenly weepy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Mierzwiak comforts her with a hug. It turns into kiss. He pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<MIERZWIAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIERZWIAK>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles sadly at her. She smiles courageously at him.
</DIRECTION>
<MIERZWIAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to know it's not because I'm not interested. If that means anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIERZWIAK>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other a long while, then Howard goes back to locating and eradicating blips of lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stan sits in the van and smokes a cigarette. He has an unobstructed view into Joel's bedroom window. He watches Mierzwiak and Mary. They're talking as Howard works. It appears to be a very serious discussion. A car pulls up outside. Stan turns to see. A middle-aged woman gets out, checks the address on Joel's building, approaches the only lit window, watches Mierzwiak and Mary inside. Mierzwiak's resolve has apparently weakened and he and Mary kiss again. This time it leads to groping, partial undressing, and falling onto the bed alongside the unconscious Joel. The woman in the window is transfixed. As Mierzwiak fumbles to unzip his pants, he catches sight of the woman in the window. He practically shrieks and jumps up.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It didn't start out to be this. I came here to work. It's a one-time mistake.

<DIRECTION>
Mary is right behind Mierzwiak now. Hollis is in her car.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
<DIRECTION>
(heroically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Mierzwiak, it's true. And it's not Mr. Mierzwiak's fault. I'm a stupid little girl with a stupid little crush. I basically forced him into it. I swear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Hollis turns, looks at Mary and then at Mierzwiak.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be a monster, Howard. Tell the girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLIS>
<DIRECTION>
Stan is out of the van now, listening. Mary shivers in the cold, hugs herself. There's a long silence. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Hollis and Mierzwiak have locked eyes. Mary looks back and forth between them. Hollis starts her car.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor kid. You can have him. You did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLIS>

She drives off. Mary watches Howard with increased foreboding.

<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, Howard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<MIERZWIAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIERZWIAK>
<DIRECTION>
He shuffles inside. Mary stands there, unable to digest this, struggling in vain to remember. Stan watches.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>

Mary shakes her head "no." She walks off, dazed.

Clementine and Patrick lie on their backs on the frozen river and look up at the night sky.

She hurries toward the shore, slips on the ice, gets up, and continues, now running.

Mary, in shock, sits in the empty fluorescent car. She tries to look out the window but can only see her own reflection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's deathly silent as Mierzwiak and Stan work on completing the job. Mierzwiak locates a light hidden very deep in the map of Joel's brain. He targets it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROWBOAT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joel, the size of a ten year old, sits fishing with his oversized father. Clementine is naked and in the boat, too. She's reading The Play by Stephen Dixon.

<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love this book, Joel. Thank you so much for telling me about it.
	</DIALOGUE>

Joel is his father. The father is drunk and sullen. He faces away from Joel, looks out at the lake.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be like me, son. Don't waste your life. You'll come to a point someday where it'll be too late. You'll be sewn into your fate...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was horrifying, seeing my father like that. There was no hope for me if his life was such a failure. And he saw failure in me, too, written in my future.

Clementine watches the frightened, confused Joel.

Joel finds himself eating Chinese food and sitting across from Clementine. He is ragged and jarred.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEL>

	Egad, were you horrified?

</JOEL>

She is wearing the black dress.

Clementine wears a generic black dress now.

There is a long silence.

Mary enters the dark room, frazzled. She flips on the fluorescent lights and searches the file folders, finds one with her name on it. Her jaw drops. With a shaky hand, she puts the tape into the player on her desk and presses "play."

	Um, I liked you immediately. At the job interview. You seemed so... important and mature. And I loved that you were helping all these people. You didn't come on to me at all. I liked that. I was tongue-tied around you at first. I wanted you to think I was smart. You were so nice. I loved the way you smelled. I couldn't wait to come to work. I had these fantasies of us being married and having kids and just...

<VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.

<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.

</JOEL>
<NAOMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.

	The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.

Joel climbs stairs, searches the aisle, spots Clementine.

She turns.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEMENTINE>

	Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.

<JOEL>

The scene is disintegrating. Clementine's speech is delivered without passion.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.

(more and more emotionless)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what to do about this. I've been feeling so alienated and numb lately. Forever. The thought of not acknowledging my feelings again seems self-destructive. How can I continue on this path toward a living death, a life filled with obligation and guilt and responsibility but joyless, hopeless? I need to speak with Clementine.

Joel sits on a log, a paper plate of chicken and corn on his lap. People warm themselves at the fire. Joel watches couples talking, kissing, Rob sharing a joint with a guy.

<JOEL>

<JOEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.

</JOEL>
<CLEMENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENTINE>
<JOEL>

Joel nods glumly.

Carrie continues to talk, but her voice goes under as Joel studies the faded husks of memories, piled like refuse outside the moving car window. He sees dried-out version of previous interactions with Clementine playing out in loops. He looks back and sees the memory of his ride home from the beach with Rob and Carrie. It, too, is decaying. Soon all has crumbled into dust. Everything goes black.

<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
