<DIRECTION>
It looks like an air-traffic control tower, with lots of screens and bay windows showing the whole complex.

ADMINISTRATOR PARKER SELFRIDGE takes a ball from a newly opened case of TITLEISTS and sets it on the floor. Selfridge is young, charismatic, focused. Some would say ruthless.

He assumes the stance and lines up his putt, toward a practice cup across the control room floor. He glances up as Grace strides toward him.

Selfridge crosses to his office, behind a glass wall nearby. Grace follows.

On Selfridge's desk is a magnetic base, and hovering in mid- air, in the invisible field, is a lump of METALLIC ROCK. Pure UNOBTANIUM. He grabs it and holds it up between thumb and forefinger, in front of Grace's eyes.

<SELFRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is why we're here. Unobtanium. Because this little gray rock sells for twenty million a kilo. No other reason. This is what pays for the party. And it's what pays for your science. Comprendo?

He places it back in the magnetic field.

NEXT MORNING, GRACE, NORM and JAKE approach their link units.

Jake glances through a PRESSURE WINDOW. In an adjoining chamber (the AMBIENT ROOM) JAKE'S AVATAR lies on a gurney, breathing slowly in PANDORAN AIR. NORM'S AVATAR is on a second gurney. Both are attended by med techs in exo-masks.

Grace steps back, hands raised. He drags himself into the unit.

JAKE STANDS, feeling the strength in his legs. His expression is child-like with wonder.

Nearby, a couple of AVATARS are playing one-on-one in front of a (non-regulation height) basketball net. Others go about their daily activities around the compound.

Jake flexes his legs -- JUMPS -- and lands a little unsteadily, but his expression is joyful.

<DIRECTION>
He takes a few steps and breaks into a RUN. People are calling to him, somehwere, but he doesn't hear them -- he's running. RUNNING!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finds himself in the COMPOUND GARDEN, and stops amid neatly tended rows of ALIEN PLANTS. He looks down, wiggling his toes in the warm soil. Then inhales deeply -- revelling in the alien smells -- earth, plants, the nearby forest. He looks at his bare footprint in the soil of an alien world.

A wall of steel FILLS FRAME. The DOZER BLADE crushes everything in its path, reducing trees to kindling.

WIDER, showing the CLEAR-CUTTING operation near the mine, as a road is cut through the jungle. Remotely operated DOZERS three stories tall rip into the tree-line.

One of the dozers has rotating SLASH-CUTTER, a vicious spinning head, mounted on a hydraulic arm, that hogs through the enormous tree trunks in a spray of wood-shrapnel.

The heavy machines are escorted by AMPSUITS. COLONEL QUARITCH, on foot, leads a squad of troopers wearing breathing masks and carrying almighty big AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

A BANSHEE -- a fearsome aerial predator -- HURTLES from above, diving toward them on wings 3 meters across. We get a glimpse of glassy fangs before --

P-P-POOM! Quaritch cranks off three rapid SHOTS with his massive sidearm, and the creature drops with a SHRIEK.

It crashes near them and Quaritch FIRES two more well placed rounds. The newbies stare at the thing's barracuda teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<QUARITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For you pogues, this is a banshee. A small one. See, they like it when I bring fresh meat out here. And this clearcutting really stirs up the hornet's nest. So keep your head on a swivel.

Quaritch leads his squad into the gloom of the forest, his eyes scanning. Flanking the squad, LYLE WAINFLEET drives an AMPSUIT, his massive feet CRASHING through the underbrush.

As his gaze comes down, he sees something ahead of him on the trail -- an intricate TOTEM of woven sticks, bones and feathers hanging across the trail like an orb-weaver's web.

He tears it down with the barrel of his rifle, and stomps it into the mud as he moves on.

Jake sits on a wooden bed in a long hut of tropical-style construction -- beamed ceiling, open sides covered by screen.

Around him the other avatars are bedding down for the night, pulling insect netting around their cots. In one hand, Jake holds the end of his long braided QUEUE of hair.

Jake nods. Quaritch brings the `suit to life. He steps forward and pivots smoothly.

<DIRECTION>
He balances the two ton machine on one foot while sweeping the arms in strong, graceful arcs. Jake realizes he is doing a WU-SHOO KATA. A flawless display of strength and control. He's impressive, and Jake is impressed. Quaritch is the kind of man he respects -- focused, hard. Determined.

	Look, son -- I take care of my own. Get me what I need, I'll see you get your legs back when you rotate home. Your real legs.

Jake catches only glimpses -- a glint of eyes, a slinking black movement -- then nothing. Darkness.

A WATERPROOF MATCH from his survival kit lights the torch.

The torch creates a pool of light surrounded by pulsing, leaping shadows. Jake turns warily as he moves along the trail.

Behind him are several pairs of reflective green EYES. Another pair flanking him beside the trail. Black-on-black SHAPES which seem to flow like liquid.

He looks up -- sees one cross a limb overhead. Another on his opposite flank.

The VIPERWOLVES can run like a dog and climb like a monkey. They are hunting Jake from the ground and the trees.

JAKE RUNS by torch-light, on the edge of panic. He reaches a steep banked stream and -- without thinking -- runs across it on a horizontal trunk --

-- and STOPS DEAD on the other side. The torch illuminates GREEN EYES cutting ahead of him across the trail. The viperwolves have him encircled.
</DIRECTION>

The psychotic BARKS become more intense as they signal each other, getting excited. ONE MAKES A RUN at him, angling on his legs from behind but --

JAKE WHIRLS, jamming the torch in its face. It yips and goes past, but ANOTHER moves in --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He jabs it with the business end of the spear and it SNARLS, retreating, baring its fangs.
</DIRECTION>

Now half a dozen are circling him in the open, and he sees what he's up against. The VIPERWOLVES are six-limbed with shiny chitinous skin, their paws leathery BLACK HANDS. Intelligent eyes. Glistening black teeth in dead white gums.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake realizes that he is making his final stand. He whirls the torch in an arc, keeping them at bay --

And feels a rush of adrenaline. It goes through him like a lightning bolt and the fear is gone.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its momentum wrenches it from his hands, and the torch goes flying. Left in semi-darkness, Jake draws his KNIFE as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WOLF LUNGES, sinking its teeth into his arm. He YELLS in pain and fury, SLASHING with the knife which --

<DIRECTION>
CUTS deep into the beast's shoulder and it lets go.

<DIRECTION>
JAKE SPRINTS, trying to escape, but a snarling viperwolf leaps, GRABBING him by the ankle with its fore-hand. Jake tears away, sprawling, SCRAMBLING to get up as --

THREE WOLVES charge at once. The nearest LEAPS at his throat just as --

NEYTIRI LEAPS right over Jake, and CRACKS her bow down on the skull of a circling wolf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER SPRINGS at her and she drops under its weight, but rolls, coming up on top of it with a knife in her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her knife FLASHES down, buried to the hilt in its chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SNARLING, a wounded wolf attacks Jake, and he KICKS it away, but --
</DIRECTION>

It SPINS and leaps back onto him, and Jake barely catches its throat in time to keep the SNAPPING JAWS away from his face.

Jake has his adversary pinned and is choking it with all his weight. Finally it stops thrashing. Panting, he releases it and looks up at --

<DIRECTION>
NEYTIRI. Her tail LASHES as she scans the forest, listening to the fading YELPS of the wolves. Satisfied the attack is over, she turns.

She regards him coldly for a second, then walks past him. Neytiri picks up the torch and extinguishes it in a stream.

Jake scrambles to recover his spear. Neytiri kneels beside --

</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
He makes the mistake of grasping her shoulder and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHACK! She WALLOPS him upside the head with her bow in a fierce backhand swing, laying him out flat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up to see a FURY standing over him. A Fury who speaks English -- accented, halting, angry English.
</DIRECTION>
<NEYTIRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't thank! You don't thank for this! This is sad. Very sad, only.

She silences him with the tip of her bow at his throat.

<NEYTIRI>

	Your fault! You are like a baby, making noise, don't know what to do. You should not come here, all of you! You only come and make problems. Only.

Jake gets up, slowly, facing her.

<JAKE>

	Okay, fine, you love your little forest friends. So why not just let them kill my ass? What's the thinking?

	But stupid! Ignorant like a child!

She turns away, stalking off, but Jake goes after her.

TRACKING WITH Neytiri as she climbs nimbly along a huge ROOT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER as she trots with perfect balance along the root, which forms an elevated walkway.

Jake runs to catch up, realizing suddenly that he is far above the forest floor. Throughout the following they move through a GLOWING PHANTASMAGORICAL FOREST.

He runs to catch up with her easy jogging pace.

She stops and he almost runs into her.

<DIRECTION>
They run across the elevated root of an enormous tree -- a horizontal trunk big as an oak.

WIDE SHOT as they cross a DEEP GORGE. A waterfall shimmers silver in the Polyphemus-light. Vines hang down a hundred feet into the gorge, and among them swoop stingbats and other night flyers.

	Hey, slow down. Look, I think we just got off on the wrong foot and --

Jake looks down, suddenly aware of the height.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--you just have to get to know me. I'm Jake. Jake Sull--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
A vine catches his spear and spins him off balance. He drops the spear and almost falls off the root.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whooaaa -- shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Neytiri catches him with one hand, gripping his bicep. He watches the spear cartwheel down to splash in the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls him upright. Shouts at him in English and Na'vi.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need your help.

<NEYTIRI>

</NEYTIRI>
<DIRECTION>
DOWN ANGLE FROM FAR ABOVE -- several WOODSPRITES float down through the trees. FOLLOW THEM as they descend silently toward Jake and Neytiri.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEYTIRI, sensing a presence, looks up to see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WOODSPRITES, PULSING with purpose, float right towards Jake. They dance gently around his shoulders and head.

<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(off her amazed look)

	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
More woodsprites gather around him. Several ALIGHT on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake holds still, knowing he should be afraid -- but somehow he's not. He spreads his arms. More sprites come, landing all over his arms, hands, body.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
CU NEYTIRI -- reacting with a mixture of wonder and dread.
</DIRECTION>
<NEYTIRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Atokirina'. Seeds of the Great Tree -- very pure spirits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEYTIRI>
<DIRECTION>
Jake -- now a pulsing, glowing, fluttering MASS OF LIGHT -- moves one hand slowly, not wanting to break the spell. He studies one of the sprites dancing on his palm until --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- WHOOSSHH! the woodsprites whirl up and away, scattering into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that all about?

Neytiri seems shaken. She seizes his hand and pulls him after her.

TRACKING WITH JAKE as he gazes about him in growing wonder. He touches leaves as he passes, watching the bioluminescence shiver through them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake looks down as -- they cross a bed of purple MOSS which reacts to the pressure of their footsteps. Rings of green light, like ripples on a pond, expand outward from each footfall. Exploding rings of light where his feet touch down. Dream-like, surreal beauty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE ON THEM as they run over a large root, across a mirror- like POOL at the base of a WATERFALL.

<DIRECTION>
Jake follows Neytiri, running along a raised root-trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your name?

</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE hears WHOOSH-WHOOSH and snaps a look as a BOLO flies at him, spinning end for end and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHWHAP!! -- tangles around his legs. He topples off the root and crashes into the foliage below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE untangles himself, getting up to run just as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEVERAL NA'VI RIDERS thunder toward him. They are riding DIREHORSES -- six-legged, armor-skinned alien Clydesdales.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see that the riders' QUEUES are connected to the horses' long moth-like antennae -- a neural-link with which they can command the horse, leaving hands free for weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The riders aim bows and spears at Jake as they approach. Jake turns to bolt, but --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NA'VI HUNTERS melt out of the shadows, weapons aimed -- blocking his retreat.

Neytiri drops to the ground next to Jake and confronts the LEAD RIDER. She shouts sharply in Na'vi --

	Stop! There has been a sign. This is a matter for the Tsahik.

JAKE is hauled roughly toward Neytiri's village, which is sheltered inside one of the GREAT TREES. HOMETREE is 250 meters tall, with a trunk four times the diameter of the largest Sequoia, and a base of massive mangrove-pillars.

<DIRECTION>
TSU'TEY rides inside the columns at the base of Hometree, shouting an ululating WARNING.

<DIRECTION>
Jake is force-marched through the pillars into --

INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An open CENTRAL AREA. The villagers gather to see the arriving hunt party. We see the people of the tribe -- mothers with babies, old women, young hunters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They gawk at the alien, expressions ranging from curiosity to outright hostility. The huge eyes of the children follow him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake is amazed at the size of HOMETREE inside. By the light of the COOK-FIRES he can see up into a vast cylindrical gallery -- a living cathedral.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clear membranes -- sturmbeest bladders -- filled with fluttering bio-luminescent insects, act as area lighting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The central space is dominated by the SKULL of some enormous creature, mounted with much embellishment on a TOTEM. Standing in front of this, awaiting their approach, is --

EYTUKAN (AY-too-kahn), the Clan Leader. Eytukan has deeply chiselled features and a long chest mantle of THANATOR CLAWS. His normally stern features are clouded further by anger.

Everybody looks up.

MO'AT (MOH-aht) stands on the second level, looking down. She is a severe woman in her 50's. Her bearing is haughty, her expression friendly as a hanging-judge. Her outfit is elaborate, denoting her rank as CLAN MATRIARCH.

TIGHT SHOT -- the tendrils INTERWEAVE.

Jake tries to keep up with Neytiri as she leaps up the core trunk like a lemur. He climbs the last section, arriving out of breath beside her. She leads him OUTSIDE, onto --

A large branch. Through gaps in the foliage Jake can see other Great Trees scattered across the landscape, like enormous umbrellas above the rainforest.

NEYTIRI strides out across the branch toward some kind of STRUCTURE -- a WEB made of thick woven fiber. DARK SHAPES clinging to it stir with a leathery RUSTLING SOUND.

Neytiri makes a series of TRILLS and CLICKS. One of the shapes MOVES toward them, emerging into a shaft of sunlight.

A huge MOUNTAIN BANSHEE. Much larger than the forest banshees, this thing is taller than a Na'vi with a 10 meter wingspan. A leathery FWHOOP, like the crack of sails, as it alights on the branch right in front of her.

She catches an enormous palm leaf and, gripping it, allows its DROOP to slow her fall. She lets go, plummeting, and catches another.

JAKE FOLLOWS in a leap of faith. THE CAMERA PLUNGES with him, from leaf to leaf, down and down in a dizzying kinetic rush.

<DIRECTION>
NEYTIRI AND JAKE move through the NIGHT FOREST, surrounded by galaxies of shimmering bioluminescence. They move gracefully, soundlessly -- two forest spirits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU JAKE -- the pupils of his cat eyes dilated. The night forest floods his brain with its million bio-sources.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NIGHT SHOT, from overhead -- Jake and Neytiri bow-fishing from a dugout canoe over huge glowing ANEMONES at the bottom of a pool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large fish swims silhouetted against the pastel glow. ZAP! Jake drills it. He holds up the fish, triumphantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER DAY -- Neytiri stands close behind Jake, adjusting his position as he draws his bow. Only now her hands are GENTLE as they move on his arms, his shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aware of her touch, Jake's focus is broken. Their eyes meet, and she pulls away quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NIGHT -- they enter a CLEARING filled with chest-high ferns. Neytiri signals him to move slowly. They approach a creature on one of the ferns. An ugly, stick-like LIZARD-THING perched on a frond. As he approaches --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SNAP! A long spine whips in a circle, unfurling a bioluminescent membrane -- a disk a meter across, opening like a Chinese fan. It FLIES OFF, a living Frisbee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FAN LIZARD FLOATS across the clearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neytiri plunges among the ferns with a SHARP CRY. An EXPLOSION OF COLOR as dozens of FAN LIZARDS take flight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grinning widely, she hops around like a little girl, until they are all flying. And for the first time, she is unguarded and joyful, totally herself with him.
</DIRECTION>

INSIDE THE LINK -- Jake's eyes open in the darkness. He doesn't know where he is. He weakly pushes open the lid, blinking at the light.

TIGHT ON AVATAR JAKE silently drawing his bow, his eyes focused in intense concentration. A beat -- the arrow flies.

JAKE PULLS the arrow from the twitching body of a hexapede. He dispatches it with his knife.

</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
TSU'TEY signals a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP-SLOPE AHEAD is an astounding formation. Thick vine-like trees have trapped large FLOATING BOULDERS of UNOBTANIUM in their gnarled grip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hundred meters above them more boulders are WOVEN into the twisted vine-trunks. This is some sort of freak natural occurrence -- like the mythical beanstalk, going up into the clouds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a THUNDERING ROAR, like an artillery barrage, and the ground SHAKES. Jake looks around at --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the FLOATING MOUNTAINS grinding against the flank of a nearby mesa. A huge rockfall is set loose. The mountain is drifting toward them, filling half the sky.

The Hunters dismount.

200 METERS up the BEANSTALK, the hunters nimbly climb along the vine-trunks. They clamber over one of the unobtanium BOULDERS which is lifting this incredible tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE looks down -- the massive trunk dwindles to the size of a licorice stick. A chunk breaks off a boulder as he climbs over it -- it floats upward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the upper branches of the beanstalk. Above them, the craggy underbelly of MONS Veritatis looms. Spray from one of the waterfalls hits them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some of the HANGING VINES are brushing over the upper branches of the beanstalk with a crackling hiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One by one the hunters grab onto vines as they pass.

Jake shrugs and leaps to a passing vine, his feet dangling over nothingness. They climb toward the floating islands above.

TINY FIGURES cross a causeway of vines connecting a small island of unobtanium to the main mass of Mons Veritatis.

Banshees circle next to the cliffs, flashing in shafts of sunlight. Waterfalls dissolve into nothingness below.

EXT. GROTTO/BANSHEE ROOKERY - DAY

A waterfall THUNDERS down into the void like a faucet of the gods. Jake looks down the sheer cliff at the world far below -- a view from Olympus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHRIEK and the THWAP THWAP of leathery wings -- NEYTIRI'S BANSHEE swoops in to perch at the edge of the grotto. She dismounts and, like a falconer, covers its eyes with a woven HOOD. It waits, docile, as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She joins Jake and the hunter party. Tsu'tey leads them through the cave until they emerge onto a CLIFF FACE. And Jake sees --
</DIRECTION>

The BANSHEE ROOKERY. HUNDREDS of banshees huddle on rock out- croppings as far as the eye can see. They cling to the walls with the fore-claws on their wings, or perch on ledges.

Out of sight of Tsu'tey, Neytiri takes his hand and squeezes it. Jake feels a rush of emotion, but she breaks away like it didn't happen. He is on his own, on the ledge with --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BANSHEES. They eye him as he approaches. Several SHRIEK and take flight. Others flap their wings and yawn, showing rows of fangs, in a threat display.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake unrolls a weighted leather strap, like a one-ended BOLO.

<DIRECTION>
A LARGE MALE spreads enormous wings, SHRIEKS, and glares straight at him.

Jake looks directly into its eyes -- and strides toward it.

Jake times the lunge, swinging the bolo, feinting and then slipping aside as the banshee's jaws miss him, SNAPPING SHUT.

Jake WHAPS the bolo across its snout. The weighted thong whips twice around its long jaws, tying them shut. A MUFFLED SCREAM and it SLASHES at his stomach with razor talons but --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake is already leaping, over the talons and tackling the banshee around the neck. It topples on its side, and he SWARMS IT -- arms around its thrashing head.

Jake grabs its whip-like antenna and brings it toward his queue but --
</DIRECTION>

The bony head SLAMS sideways, and BAM! -- clocks him right in the face, almost knocking him out and --

IT WRITHES, flinging him to the ground. He slides on the rock and almost goes over the edge as --

NEYTIRI gasps. Tsu'tey laughs and yells mockingly.

The bolo is coming loose as the creature shakes its head, way pissed off now, but --

Jake scrambles up and leaps straight at it. Claws rake his leg but he gets his arms around its head and CLAMPS DOWN HARD. They flop to the ground and he scrambles on top, pinning it and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grabs its whipping antenna, locks it under his arm, and jams the end of his queue into it. They FUSE together and --

THWAP! THWAP! The banshee is off like a shot. Jake SCREAMS as they PLUMMET off the cliff -- the banshee WAILS and --

They fall together, spiralling out of control, and he is almost tossed lose. The thing is SQUAWKING and SHRIEKING so much he can't think.

NEYTIRI'S BANSHEE falls into formation with him. She signals "follow me" and DIVES.

Jake guides his banshee clumsily after her. Neytiri's banshee moves with precise movements of its wingtips, while Jake's wobbles and dips, almost falling out of the sky.

Neytiri leads Jake in a sharp bank, skimming close to the cliffs. They punch through streamers of cloud and emerge into sunlight.

Jake is getting the hang of it. He jinks left, then right, then dives, tucking himself tight against the animal's back. He's reckless, fearless. Half in control and LOVING IT.

ANOTHER DAY. Jake dives, playing hide and seek with Neytiri among the clouds. They are wild and free in a wild world. She grins and banks hard, diving -- catch me if you can. He DIVES after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE GROTTO, by firelight, JAKE'S BANSHEE snaps at a piece of meat which he playfully pulls back. He's teaching it to take the food more slowly. He strokes its long head.

TSU'TEY is nearby with the young hunters. He eyes Jake with frustrated hostility.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER DAY -- Jake and Neytiri fly abreast, soaring easily. She points and Jake sees --
</DIRECTION>

JAKE flies with Neytiri along a forested ridge. She is teaching him to hunt from his banshee. They carry their bows at the ready, scanning below them for prey.

A HUGE SHADOW covers him and Neytiri SHOUTS a warning. Jake looks up to see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LEONOPTERYX in a delta-dive, whistling straight at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like a banshee, only several times larger, it is the king predator of the air: the GREAT LEONOPTERYX. Striped scarlet, yellow and black, with a midnight blue crested head -- it is both gorgeous and terrifying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hunter has become the prey. JAKE snap-rolls and dives toward the forest canopy. He plummets into the gloom as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
K-CRASH -- the leonopteryx tears through foliage, following him down, both diving like missiles and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE yanks into a hair-pin bank, right through a gap between two huge branches --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Forcing the leonopteryx to brake with a loud FWOOSH of wings. It banks away with a frustrated SHRIEK. Two flaps of its mighty wings and it is gone, back above the canopy.
</DIRECTION>

CLOSE ON THE LEONOPTERYX, as its fanged mouth opens in a bloodcurdling SCREECH which echoes among the mountains. The lord of its domain.

Jake braces himself -- and Tsu'tey holds up the KAVA BOWL, offering it to him. A challenge or an olive branch?

<DIRECTION>
Jake takes a long, hearty drink as some of the young hunters hoot and clap hands in a fast rhythm.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch that stuff. It'll knock you into next week.

Jake offers the bowl back to Tsu'tey. They lock eyes. Tsu'tey drinks.

LATER -- AN EMPTY BOWL drops, landing on a pile of empty bowls near the fire.

WIDER ON JAKE and TSU'TEY, sitting amid the rowdy hunters. Tsu'tey looks a little blearily at Jake. Finally, he GRINS.

Before Jake can answer, NEYTIRI'S lithe shape runs through the circle of silhouetted dancers toward them. She takes Jake by the hand and pulls him up --

<NEYTIRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must dance! It is the way.

</NEYTIRI>

TSU'TEY watches as she leads him away, his face darkening -- the moment of connection to Jake lost to anger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hunters WHOOP and CHEER as Jake joins the circle of dancers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake takes Grace's hand and pulls her up, protesting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE lets the DRUMS and CHANTING flow through him. He lets himself go, dancing from the inside, channeling the primal energy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRACE is rocking out, grinning. We see the young girl, so repressed, who lives within her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake and Neytiri flow amongst the dancers, but they are looking only at each other.
</DIRECTION>

A couple of the young girls watching from outside the circle are giggling and talking about them. Mo'at and EYTUKAN follow their look, seeing the obvious connection.

LOOKING DOWN into a hole dug among tree roots. The body of an old Omaticaya WOMAN lies curled there like an unborn baby in the womb of the earth. The purple flower is gently placed on her body, joining flowers, totems and beads.

Mo'at recites a prayer as Neytiri, acting as acolyte, places a WOODSPRITE, a seed of the Great Tree, on the body.

Earth is poured over the LENS and we CUT TO --

JAKE WAKING UP in the Link. DARK as a coffin. He pushes the lid off, letting in light, and lies there. He looks pale and haggard, with a scraggly beard.

	Hard to believe it's only been three months.

Under a sky of thunderheads, the forest is a dark wall beyond the fence. SELFRIDGE, wearing an exopack, TEES UP while GRACE and JAKE approach from the direction of the Ops Center.

	Good of you to stop by. How's it going out there? Our blue friends all packed up yet?

Jake ponders this. Isn't this what he was doing all this for?

Jake pushes past her toward the corridor --

	Will you listen to me? Sometimes the Na'vi themselves die in these vision quests. The venom takes you to the edge of death. And the psychoactive alkaloid in the worm- - we have no idea what that'll do in an avatar brain.

Jake breaks free and wheels away, down the corridor.

<JAKE>

BELOW, seemingly in the womb of the earth, Jake walks slowly into the center of a tight circle of seated elders and hunters. An ELDER is slowly rapping a large WATER DRUM.

MO'AT places the worm on Jake's out-stretched TONGUE. It twists on itself, lighting his mouth before he closes it. She indicates he should chew. He does.

MACRO -- AN EARTHEN JAR is opened. EYTUKAN removes a writhing black ARACHNOID, the Pandoran equivalent of a scorpion.

He places it against the back of Jake's neck and presses. The insect drives its stinger into Jake's skin and --

Jake grimaces. Mo'at and Eytukan step back, leaving Jake alone in the circle.

Neytiri watches intently, joining in the low chant.

REAL JAKE claws the ground, moaning, staring blindly while --

NEYTIRI DIVES from a rock, slicing into a mirror of water. Jake follows her and --

UNDERWATER, they swim over glowing ANEMONES.

Laughing, they run together into a stand of WILLOWS. Their trunks are as gnarled as bonsai. Long faintly glowing tendrils hang straight down in pastel curtains.

Underfoot, a bed of moss glows faintly. It REACTS to their footsteps with expanding rings of light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is an exquisitely beautiful spot.

The willows stir, responding to their presence. She holds up her hands, letting the TENDRILS caress her.

He puts his face close to hers. She rubs her cheek against his. He kisses her on the mouth. They explore each other.

Then she pulls back, eyes sparkling.

<NEYTIRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kissing is very good. But we have something better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEYTIRI>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls him down until they are kneeling, facing each other on the faintly glowing moss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neytiri takes the end of her queue and raises it. Jake does the same, with trembling anticipation. The tendrils at the ends move with a life of their own, straining to be joined.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACRO SHOT -- The tendrils INTERTWINE with gentle undulations.
</DIRECTION>

JAKE rocks with the direct contact between his nervous system and hers. The ultimate intimacy.

They come together into a kiss and sink down on the bed of moss, and ripples of light spread out around them.

CU JAKE'S AVATAR -- HIS EYES OPEN. He sits up. The forest is silent, shrouded in smoke that the sun can't penetrate. The animals have fled. Ash blows on the wind.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Outcast. Betrayer. Alien. To ever face them again, I was gonna have to change the rules.

</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE -- JAKE reaches the top of a rise. The forest beyond is utterly DEVASTATED. The trees burned and fallen. Small fires still flicker across a landscape in Hell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE stares. It is his vision, made real. He stumbles through the dark wasteland, sparks and ash swirling around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SCREECH. Jake looks up as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS BANSHEE -- bonded for life -- flaps down to a landing in front of him. He steps to it, and strokes its head. It nudges his chest like a horse.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY

THE GREAT LEONOPTERYX glides effortlessly along the ridge where Jake and Neytiri first encountered him.

<DIRECTION>
It scans for prey below, its magnificent indigo-crested head cocking left, then right.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The way I had it figured, Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky. Nothing attacks him. So why would he ever look up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
FROM ABOVE -- THE SMALL SHADOW of Jake's banshee falls across the back of the mighty Toruk.

<JAKE>

EXT. WELL OF SOULS - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Omaticaya people lift their voices in a SONG filled with tragic loss and yearning for deliverance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON NEYTIRI, singing. A SHADOW CROSSES HER FACE. She looks up, and her eyes go wide as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TERRIBLE CRY echoes, turning all eyes skyward. AN ENORMOUS SHADOW covers the crowd as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TORUK comes out of the sun, beating its huge wings to slow its descent. Its crimson and black wings, backlit by the sun, seem to glow from within.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The People CRY OUT in alarm and scatter as the dreaded beast alights in their midst. And that's when they see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE, riding high on its shoulders, plugged-in to its antenna. It folds its wings and stands calmly amid the paralyzed Na'vi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Toruk lowers its body. They stare in awe as Jake dismounts and strokes the magnificent animal's flank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEYTIRI, TSU'TEY and MO'AT watch in stunned amazement as the legendary Rider of Last Shadow walks toward them.
</DIRECTION>

	Toruk Macto... Toruk Macto...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROWD>

Jake walks through the crowd, straight to Neytiri at the foot of the dais. He looks into her enormous eyes, and the emotion between them is powerful and pure.

	I See you.

<NEYTIRI>

	</DIALOGUE>
</NEYTIRI>
<DIRECTION>
Jake takes Neytiri's hand and climbs the steps of the dais.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MO'AT steps back in awe as he approaches. He turns to Tsu'tey, who stares at him with fear and incomprehension. Jake plays to the rapt crowd as he says --
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(SUBTITLED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tsu'tey of the Rongloa, son of Ateyo. I stand before you, ready to serve the People.

	You are Olo'eyctan, and you are the best warrior. I can't do this without you.

TIME CUT -- AVATAR JAKE carries Grace's HUMAN BODY, lightly in his arms like a child. Jake walks through the crowd to the dais, followed by NORM, who carries GRACE'S AVATAR.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>

	Look where we are, Grace.

CU JAKE, realizing the enormity of what she's saying.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that possible?

Jake kneels next to Grace, taking her tiny human hand in his avatar hand.

</JAKE>

Grace is barely conscious. She grips his hand.

<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I -- always held back. But you gave them your heart. I'm proud of you, Jake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Jake feels his throat close with emotion.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT -- MO'AT stands in a kind of trance amongst the tendrils of the Mother Tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEYTIRI and the other acolytes dance hypnotically. All the Omaticaya sway and chant to the rhythm of the drums.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACRO SHOT -- fine, hairlike THREADS have emerged from the roots and are gently spreading over Grace's HUMAN skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE, still holding her hand, watches her body being fused to the root-floor by a thousand connections.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRACE'S AVATAR is gently connected by the same questing ROOT- CILIA-- they entwine with the QUEUE and spread over the body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The grotto is dark except for the spectral GLOW of the willows. The CHANT continues, hypnotically. MO'AT, on her knees beneath the Mother Tree, writhes her arms in the trance state. Her eyes are rolled back, showing only WHITE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRACE GASPS and her eyes SNAP OPEN. Her expression is AMAZED, as if seeing something so beautiful it can never be explained.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HER HAND -- GRIPPING Jake's convulsively, as she tries to anchor herself to this world for a few more seconds --
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm with her Jake --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(an amazed whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- she's real --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Grace SHUDDERS, as pain shoots through her. BLOOD seeps through the silken white root-cilia growing across her abdomen. Drowning WHITE in shocking CRIMSON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She exhales a last shuddering breath -- and goes STILL.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grace!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
He sees the roots falling away from her human body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE TURNS hopefully toward her AVATAR -- but the roots are falling away from it as well. It sleeps -- VACANT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MO'AT stops the chant. She crosses to Jake and kneels with him, touching his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<MO_AT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her wounds were too great, there was not enough time. She is with Eywa now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MO_AT>
<DIRECTION>
NEYTIRI removes Grace's mask and gently closes her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake stands slowly, barely holding it together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEYTIRI comes to him and he sees the despair and hope conflicting on her face --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and he raises his head. TURNS to face TSU'TEY and the CROWD.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With your permission, I will Speak now. You would honor me by translating.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Tsu'tey gestures assent, and they face the clan together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE SPEAKS, the pain of Grace's death in the passion and fury of his voice. Tsu'tey TRANSLATES beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Sky People have sent a message that they can take whatever they want, and no one can stop them. But we will send them a message. Ride out, as fast as the wind can carry you, tell the other clans to come. Tell them Toruk Macto calls to them. Fly now with me brothers and sisters! Fly! And we will show the Sky People that this is our land!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
TSU'TEY finishes with a bloodcurdling war-cry, and the entire CLAN responds, their shouts echoing across the forest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE takes Neytiri's hand and runs to the leonopteryx. He vaults onto its back and pulls her up behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HUNTERS run to their banshees, mounting quickly. Jake's leonopteryx rises on mighty wings into the night sky. With a thunder of wings, the banshees take off after it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG LENS -- POLYPHEMUS. Across its face, the banshees rise like a swarm of bats. Groups of riders peel off in different directions. CUT TO:

EXT. CLAN GATHERING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE and NEYTIRI stand before the gathered members of ANOTHER CLAN. Jake speaks as she translates. We don't hear the words.

<DIRECTION>
TRACK ACROSS the faces of the clan, a sea of eyes in flickering fire-light.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>

	We rode out to the four winds. To the horse clans of the plain, to the ikran people of the mountains. When Toruk Macto called them, they came.

EXT. WELL OF SOULS - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a WHOOSH and the crack of mighty wings, JAKE RETURNS. Jake and Neytiri alight from his legendary mount.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Around them HUNDREDS OF BANSHEES are landing. A gathering of eagles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM ABOVE we can see hundreds of Na'vi streaming down into the Well of Souls and many hundreds more camped in the forest above it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DIREHORSE RIDERS are arriving along many trails.

BANSHEE RIDERS circle and swoop, darkening the sky above the grotto.

INT. COMMISSARY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's standing room only as all base personnel are crowded into the dining hall. A portable 3D GRAPHICS PROJECTOR has been set up, and the lights are down. QUARITCH stands in front of the display image -- a classic pre-mission briefing.
</DIRECTION>
<QUARITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People, you are fighting for survival. There's an aboriginal horde out there massing for an attack. First slide.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUARITCH>
<DIRECTION>
The display shows an overhead image of the Well of Souls. It looks like Woodstock in the jungle.
</DIRECTION>
<QUARITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These orbital images show the hostiles' numbers have gone from a couple of hundred to over two thousand in one day, and more are pouring in. By next week it could be twenty thousand. Then they'll be overrunning our perimeter here. We can't wait. Our only security lies in pre- emptive attack. We will fight terror with terror.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUARITCH>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING ACROSS the grim faces of the miners and troopers. Fear transforming to hatred in their eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<QUARITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next slide. This mountain stronghold is supposedly protected by their deity. When we destroy it, we will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep they won't come within a thousand klicks of this place.

INT. ARMOR BAY - DAY

TROOPERS issue automatic weapons and magazines to a long line of mine workers. The miners lock and load like the red- blooded redneck NRA supporters they are.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLASTING TECHS are setting radio-detonated primer charges into two-ton stacks of EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND. The stacks are band-strapped together on pallets.
</DIRECTION>

TRACKING WITH SELFRIDGE, staring around him in growing dismay as he walks through the full-scale mobilization.

He approaches Quaritch, who is barking orders amid a hive of activity around the ampsuits.

<SELFRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This thing is completely out of control!

Quaritch ignores him, turning away to focus on ordnance loading.

	Listen to me! I am not authorizing you to turn the mine-workers local into a freakin' militia!

TRACKING through the warrior camp above the Well of Souls. Hundreds of hunters from many clans prepare their weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hunters paint the wings of their banshees like war ponies. DIREHORSES are painted and ornamented with totemic streamers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Na'vi paint and pierce themselves. Dance. Bathe in the smoke of cleansing herbs -- RITUAL PURIFICATION. HUGE DRUMS are beaten. A dark primeval energy. They are psyching themselves up for battle.

JAKE slips down into the darkened, empty amphitheater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves to the MOTHER TREE -- gnarled, ancient, MAJESTIC. The roots spread in all directions, like the center of the world.

Jake steps forward. The willow-like tendrils SWAY toward him, moving in a breeze that isn't there.

	If Grace is there with you -- look in her memories -- she can show you the world we come from. There's no green there. They killed their Mother, and they're gonna do the same thing here.

THE VALKYRIES blast the ground with their powerful lift jets. They land. The ramps drop. Troopers pour out, weapons leveled, advancing in a cordon.

A chilling SOUND echoes through the forest -- the ululating WAR CRIES of untold Na'vi. The troopers, look around, spooked. They can't tell where the sound is coming from.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then they feel it -- the GROUND ITSELF SHAKING. They grip their weapons, bracing themselves as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE HUNDRED NA'VI HORSEMEN charge through the forest at a full gallop, their hooves POUNDING the earth. It is an awesome sight.
</DIRECTION>

NORM SPELLMAN rides with the Na'vi hunters, carrying an assault rifle.

CHARGING DIREHORSES crash down, flipping over. Riders are flung off. The withering fire continues, and the ranks are decimated as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RIDERS LAUNCH their arrows at a full gallop. A few hit their marks among the troopers. NORM FIRES his AR on full auto.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO CHARGING DIREHORSES have a heavy log slung between them like a battering ram. At a full gallop they hit an ampsuit, FLIPPING IT onto its back with a blown-out canopy. Victory is short lived as the two riders are cut down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NORM'S HORSE is hit by tracer fire. He is flung off as the creature cartwheels. He hits hard, scrambling for cover as --

<DIRECTION>
A WARRIOR HURLS his spear a moment before his horse is cut down. It SLAMS through an ampsuit's canopy but --

Led by the Dragon, the gunships FIRE streamers of 40mm ROCKETS ahead of them. The jungle EXPLODES with HE bursts. Circular SHOCK WAVES flash outward through the jungle --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STROBOSCOPIC GLIMPSES of terrified horses rearing, Na'vi leaping, as the jungle rocks with the concussive onslaught.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HUNTERS LOOK UP as a dark shape hovers overhead. The downblast of the VALKYRIE'S lift jets shreds the forest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE SHUTTLE'S cargo bay, a row of DAISYCUTTERS are lined up. Troopers roll the first pallet down the ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PALLET falls into the jungle below and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BA-WHOOOOOM! -- an enormous high-explosive blast rips a huge hole in the forest. A white concussion wave flashes out across the ground for hundreds of meters in all directions.

AT GROUND LEVEL it is an apocalypse. Running Na'vi are blasted out of existence by fire and shock waves.

Quaritch glances up to see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A squadron of WINGED SHAPES, diving out of the morning glare like birds of prey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON JAKE, rushing straight down, SCREAMING a war cry as he leads the charge and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCORES OF BANSHEES SLAM into the gunships and Samsons like falcons hitting fat turkeys. The air battle is joined.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE'S GREAT LEONOPTERYX flairs into its signature crimson X shape just before --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
K-WHAM!! -- it knocks a Scorpion tumbling. It coils around the gunship, slashing furiously as they spin together. JAKE can barely hang onto the gyrating creature.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pilot of the Scorpion sees nothing but jaws slamming into his canopy. Jake releases the gunship and it careens into a CLIFF, tearing off one rotor -- then plummets into the trees. There is a satisfying FIREBALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCORPIONS fall out of formation to pursue individual banshee riders, FIRING cannons and rockets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE BANKS as the cliff face next to him explodes with cannon rounds. SCREAMING down on him is another Scorpion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE tucks and dives along the cliff, feeling the rounds splitting the air around him and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Scorpions bank after the furiously jinking banshees as they head for cover among the floating mountains, or dive down into the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOOR GUNNERS in a SAMSON are shooting down banshees like Messerschmidts from a B-17 as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE FOLLOW TSU'TEY'S BANSHEE in a full delta dive. He swoops in from its blind spot and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GUNNERS SWIVEL too late as Tsu'tey flashes past them, SHOOTING ARROWS with deadly accuracy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SCORPION gunship dives after a banshee. It fires an air-to- air missile and the banshee vanishes in an EXPLOSION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE SHOT as thirty ships and hundreds of banshees wheel and dive, like the Battle of Britain. Banshees are hit by guns and missiles, falling out of the sky. The occasional trail of smoke and fire marks the demise of a tilt-rotor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CENTER the Dragon is pouring out hellacious fire -- tracer rounds from multiple turrets and missiles from the stub-wing pods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEYTIRI BANKS hard as TRACERS flash past her. A Scorpion is right on her ass as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHE ROLLS inverted and dives under the edge of Mons Veritatis, then rolls out, zig-zagging through the dangling vines but --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GUNSHIP stays on her. It rips through the vines, and tracers FLASH toward us as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHE JINKS the banshee around a thundering waterfall but --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER PURSUER explodes right through the curtain of water. It launches an air-to-air missile. NEYTIRI jinks hard, diving. The missile hits a rock outcropping, pummeling her with the shock wave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GUNSHIP follows her through a narrow slit between Mons Veritatis and a smaller floating island. They run this slot rolled up on their sides and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SCORPION GUNNER locks up Neytiri for a missile shot but --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHADOW crosses his canopy. Out of the sun comes a crimson demon, shrieking over the roar of the turbines, and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
K-WHAMMM!! The leonopteryx SLAMS the gunship, driving it downward in a dive. The leonopteryx lashes at it with claws and teeth as they fall together out of control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake kicks the gunship loose and it falls like a brick, breaking its back on a rocky promontory and EXPLODING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLYING WITH A SAMSON as a SECOND SAMSON falls in beside it. This one has its pilot door off, and the PILOT is wearing a breathing mask. The door gunners wave at --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRUDY, her expression grim behind her mask. She holds the cyclic stick between her knees while she RAKES the other ship with BURSTS from an AR in her lap.

The pilot slumps over and the craft tumbles out of control.

NEYTIRI JINKS her banshee hard, an enemy Samson right behind her. The pilot is a hotdog, following her down into the trees, under the canopy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They slalom among the trunks at high speed. The gunners hang half out the doors, firing. Bark and leaves explode around Neytiri as she zig-zags through the jungle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BANSHEE dives under a huge tree limb, and the pilot follows. He looks up at the last second, catching a glimpse of blue-skinned figures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HUNTERS drop a net of woven vines behind Neytiri and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SAMSON hits it hard. The net fouls the ship, FLIPPING IT backwards. It crashes upside down to the forest floor. KABOOM!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEYTIRI'S BANSHEE is hit by GROUND-FIRE. It folds up like a broken kite, crashing down through branches and --
</DIRECTION>

SHE SLAMS into the ground, stunned.

TSU'TEY nods. He signals, gathering other hunters, who fall in with him as he dives. Jake rolls in after them but --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GUNSHIP drops in behind him and he is forced to evade as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TSU'TEY LEADS the attack on the first shuttle. Hunters jink and weave through WITHERING FIRE from the escort ships.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUNNERS with jerry-rigged gun mounts ride the broad backs of the shuttles, picking off banshees who get past the escort.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TSU'TEY is RAKED by a burst from the dorsal gunners. His mount crumples, plummeting with a dying scream and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SPIRAL DOWN with him, the forest rushing up and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLINDING BLIZZARD of green as he tears downward, catching at leaves and vines. He SLAMS to the ground, badly injured.
</DIRECTION>

NEARBY, ampsuits and troopers advance across the forest floor, firing their cannons and flamethrowers. The GAU-90s rip the forest to shreds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Norm, firing as he retreats, is HIT. He collapses, his avatar body mortally wounded as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HYDRAULIC FEET approach, passing the bodies of direhorses and Na'vi hunters. Norm painfully tries to load another magazine, panting in fear and pain as --

WAINFLEET cuts Tsu'tey's queue off near the base. TSU'TEY SCREAMS in agony, his nervous system exploding on overload. Grinning, Lyle holds up the queue -- Tsu'tey's only connection to the world-consciousness which is his life.

NEYTIRI -- bleeding, bruised -- staggers amid burning wreckage. AMPSUIT footsteps approach and she crouches behind a tree. Troopers are seconds from seeing her as --

NEYTIRI watches in awe as the ground troops scatter in disarray. The viperwolves flash past her, ignoring her.

She senses something and turns slowly to see --

A THANATOR emerging from the smoke behind her. A glistening black demon. She stands paralyzed before its stygian gaze--

On its back is NEYTIRI, and it's a toss up which one looks more pissed off. The thanator rears back, muscles rippling as it poises to strike and --

WE RUSH DOWN with him through this green blur. Jake drops to the ground in a feral crouch. Unhurt.

SHE BANKS hard, pulling g's, coming around on the Dragon. She pours on the coal and the Samson leaps forward, straight at the WARSHIP.

QUARITCH, DRILLS a stream of tracers at her, tearing through her canopy, ripping chunks off her fuselage.

TRUDY DIVES, raking through treetops and then, at the last instant, YANKS BACK on the stick and --

THE SAMSON leaps straight up and -- K-KRASH!! SHEARS OFF THE COCKPIT of the Dragon as --

<DIRECTION>
QUARITCH THROWS HIMSELF aft along the aisle and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRUDY'S SAMSON disintegrates, the wreckage burning as it tumbles into the jungle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILES QUARITCH grips the bulkhead as he stares out the open front of the fuselage. Wind howls through wreckage where the pilot used to be. The forest rushes up to meet him and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DRAGON CRASHES through splintering trees, IMPACTING in a lake with a WHITE BLAST of water.

</SELFRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Selfridge is stunned. Suddenly the ROAR of an ENGINE makes them all look up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE WINDOW, MAX sits in the cab of an enormous SLASH- CUTTER. Max flips Selfridge the bird and pushes a lever forward --
</DIRECTION>
<SELFRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELFRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Selfridge DIVES as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
K-RASHHHHH! The SPINNING TEETH of the SLASH-CUTTER tear through the window in a blast of glass and lethal air. Alarms go off. The technicians dive for cover in a blizzard of glass and shredded debris.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The slash-cutter head pulls back, and AVATARS SCRAMBLE through the gaping hole into the Ops Center --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TROOPERS look up to see blue giants aiming weapons down at them. The battle is over in seconds. The avatars are holding the Ops Center.

Selfridge lies there gasping, in his emergency mask. In shock. How could this be happening? CUT TO:

EXT. LAKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DRAGON lies half submerged. Out of the water FG, a shape rises -- a AMPSUIT. Inside -- MILES QUARITCH, his face bloody, his eyes burning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slogs out of the water, covered with mud, then strides into the forest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUARITCH'S AMPSUIT THUDS relentlessly through the jungle. He sees something through the foliage ahead -- the SHACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE SHACK Jake is oblivious under the link. Through a window we see Quaritch's AMPSUIT step into the clearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUARITCH levels his GAU-90 at the shack. His finger goes to the firing button--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM!! A six-legged BLACK DEMON tackles him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaritch pivots as he falls, FIRING the cannon. It misses Neytiri by inches. He grapples with the THANATOR as its razor claws SCREECH over his metal armor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TITANS twist and struggle. QUARITCH UNLEASHES a long burst from the cannon. Rounds tear into the creature, which SHRIEKS but --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEYTIRI wills it to SMASH the cannon hard against a rock, tearing it loose from the `suit's hand but --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaritch SLAMS the thanator back against a tree-trunk, almost crushing Neytiri.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON one hydraulic hand, as it draws the `suit's KNIFE and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUARITCH TWISTS violently, ramming the knife up under the thanator's chest armor. The creature ROARS and Quaritch flips on top of it, stabbing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUARITCH STABS DOWN AGAIN. The thanator slumps, pinning Neytiri's legs under its great bulk. She is trapped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaritch looks down at Neytiri. She glares back at him, panting, scared but defiant.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all over Quaritch --

Quaritch turns, seeing Jake DROPPING from a tree limb. The `suit rises slowly, knife glinting in the morning sun.

<QUARITCH>

	Nothing's over while I'm breathing.

</QUARITCH>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kinda hoped you'd say that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
QUARITCH SURGES forward. JAKE closes fast, snatching up the broken CANNON as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaritch SLASHES DOWN with the knife and Jake parries, blocking it with the cannon. He CLOSES faster than the suit can move and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
K-CRACK! -- SLAMS the end of the cannon into the canopy, crazing it with a web of cracks as QUARITCH SLICES air with the huge knife. Jake ducks, coming up to meet the next slash and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASHES the knife hand with the cannon once -- twice -- again -- in a furious attack -- knocking the knife flying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUARITCH catches him with the other arm, hurling him away. Jake rolls just before --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUDDD! -- the massive foot stomps down where he just was. He scrambles up as Quaritch CHARGES and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE DUCKS another round-house, LEAPING forward to smash the canopy again -- then again -- until it is WHITE with cracks. Quaritch manages to GRAB the cannon barrel but --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE COCKPIT, he sees nothing but the sun on the shattered glass. HE HURLS the cannon blindly, but Jake ducks. The massive cylinder cartwheels toward the shack and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM INSIDE we see it CRASH against pressure window, crazing it but not penetrating. Jake's link sits just inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE COCKPIT, Quaritch yanks a yellow handle and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P-FOOM! -- the canopy BLOWS OFF, flying through the air. Quaritch can see again. He dons his breathing mask. Bends to pick up his KNIFE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEARBY NEYTIRI struggles furiously, trying to get her legs free from underneath three tons of thanator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUARITCH, panting, glowers at Jake.
</DIRECTION>
<QUARITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How does it feel to betray your own race?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUARITCH>
<DIRECTION>
Then, inexplicably, he TURNS. Walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM INSIDE the shack, we see him charge straight toward us and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH! -- he puts his hydraulic fist right through the window. He is reaching inside for the Link when --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE HITS in a flying tackle with every ounce of force he has, knocking the ampsuit sideways and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE REACHES around the suit, grabbing Quaritch's shoulder and, yanks him forward HARD, SMASHING his face into the edge of the cockpit but --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUARITCH flings him off with a sweep of his arm, and Jake slams to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE LINK Jake is holding his breath as the toxic Pandoran air swirls in. GAS ALARMS SHRIEK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEYTIRI shoves with one free leg, desperately trying to pull her other leg out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE AMPSUIT charges, the knife flashing down and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE just manages to catch it in both hands, but the force of the attack drives him to his knees as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUARITCH pushes the knife down inexorably, until Jake is pinned against a rock, the blade now inches from his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE LINK Jake is straining to stay conscious, to stay connected as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE KNIFE reaches his throat as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THWAP! AN ARROW APPEARS in Quaritch's chest. He looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEYTIRI STANDS -- a FURY released. A classic archer figure, she NOCKS another arrow. Then draws and releases smoothly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TH-WHAP! The machine TOPPLES off Jake and lies still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUARITCH STARES at the two arrows in his chest. He touches the feathers of the ancient weapon, then -- with an ironic laugh -- he dies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEYTIRI runs up, another arrow nocked, bow drawn. Seeing Quaritch, she lowers her father's bow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE sees her, then goes limp, his eyes rolling back, and --

<DIRECTION>
INT. SHACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HUMAN JAKE EXPLODES out of the Link, slamming to the floor where he gags for breath. With his last strength, he claws toward an emergency breathing mask -- across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He scrambles toward it, on the edge of unconsciousness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEYTIRI VAULTS through the shattered window, landing in the debris like a cat. She GRABS the mask and flashes to Jake's side -- puts the mask over his face and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE drags in breath after breath. He looks up at Neytiri, studying him as she holds him -- seeing his human body for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake touches her face, his pale human hand against the blue of her skin. There eyes meet across the glass of the mask -- together, separate. Worldless. CUT TO:

MO'AT tends to the mortally wounded TSU'TEY as AVATAR JAKE arrives with Neytiri. Mo'at has bound his wounds, but by her expression, it is clear he cannot be saved.

Jake kneels and Tsu'tey opens his eyes. Through a haze of pain, he recognizes Jake.

TSU'TEY'S HAND clasps with Jake's in a fierce grip. Jake draws his knife.
