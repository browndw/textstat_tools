EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dark, rumbling sky. Haze clings to the lake as we float across it, clearing to bring the opposite shoreline into view. A few scattered streetlights. Dilapidated cabins. An abandoned campsite. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We continue to drift towards it, hearing the faint sound of seductive music and an occasional giggle. A small HOUSEBOAT floats into our foreground, its interior light flickering as TWO BODIES move around inside.

INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
A teenage boy and girl, JIM and SUZY, are slow-dancing. Jim's lips softly touch her lissome shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...how do you feel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<SUZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ask me in about five minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZY>
<DIRECTION>
She bites his ear, giggles, then kisses him fully..
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm talking about graduation. Being totally free to do whatever we want now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Her hands slip inside his Pendleton shirt. He sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It feels excellent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZY>
<DIRECTION>
Her mouth finds his again. After a long kiss, he gently pulls away from her with a teasing smile.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotta throw the anchor over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves the cabin. She slips under the bed sheets.

TIGHT ON WATER SURFACE

<DIRECTION>
as the weighty object splashes, sinking into black oblivion, pulling its cable down with it.

JIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
glances at the lake, at their eerie surroundings. He feels a chill, heading back inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

	What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZY>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.

He starts to pull off his shirt and join her. She senses his anxiety.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Jimmy. Something's bothering you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZY>
<DIRECTION>
Jim pauses, turning off the mood music.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just that we're right around that old summer camp where all those murders took place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
The boat creaks. She's instantly nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What murders?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZY>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<SUZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZY>
<JIM>

	There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.

He starts to kiss her again. She stops him.

<SUZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What stories?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZY>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't want to go into it but Suzy's face insists.

	There was this boy named Jason Voorhees who drowned in Crystal Lake...

Eight year old JASON is desperately trying to tread water, flailing his arms like a marionette to get attention as he gulps down gallons of mossy lake water.

	His mother blamed the counselors for his death and tried to kill them all.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She got her head chopped off by one of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
We don't need to see this clip...Suzy's reaction is quite sufficient.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So the murders stopped?

Suzy flinches as if she were getting the knife.

	<DIALOGUE>
	And every now and then, the murders start up again.

</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
The boat lurches slightly, tugging at the anchor cable. She's scared: he's frightened himself a little, too.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget about it, Suzy. They're just stories.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
He brushes her hair back, kissing her cheek gently, finding the nape of her neck again. She closes her eyes, trying to dismiss what he's dredged up. But she can't. Suzy begins to rationalize.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're the last graduating class, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZY>
<DIRECTION>
Jim's kissing her body, putting Jason behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<SUZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZY>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<SUZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZY>
<DIRECTION>
Jim stops, looking her squarely in the eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Except that Jason isn't real so none of it matters anyway.

<DIRECTION>
She starts to relax, returning his kisses.

EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the chains emit a dull tinkle due to movement from the tugging anchor. Camera continues to TRACK again...and we find to our horror that the waterlogged, fish-eaten body of JASON IS SECURED BY THESE SAME CHAINS. (NOTE: Jason's face is obscured.)
</DIRECTION>

Teenagers in love, lost in not-so-innocent passion. At the same moment:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The anchor tugs one last time and RIPS THROUGH THE CABLE. SPARKS INSTANTLY FLY, chasing along the cable, finding the chain which secures Jason and ENGULFING HIM IN ELECTRICITY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSEBOAT - ON LAKE SURFACE (EFX)

He pulls her back down.

INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

Suzy is tensely kneeling on the bed now. The black void of night is all she sees out the cabin door, which Jim has left open. An uncomfortable amount of time passes.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZY>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. Her heart starts to pound.
</DIRECTION>

Again, nothing. She wraps herself in the sheet, moving towards the open door. The ship creaks again.

SUZY'S POINT OF VIEW

	Stop screwing around, Jim. I mean it...

</SUZY>
<DIRECTION>
...And just as she reaches the door:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HOCKEY MASKED MONSTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leaps out, clutching a HUGE KNIFE. Suzy barely has time to scream before JASON PLUNGES THE KNIFE INTO HER CHEST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUZY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stands there in speechless shock, looking down at her mortal wound. But there's no blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MONSTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulls the knife back out, pushing the blade in and out with his hand. It's a retractable rubber knife. JIM pulls off the hockey mask with a huge grin, tossing it aside.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotcha good, baby cakes.

She doesn't know whether to hug him with relief or kick him in the balls. He pulls her back onto the bed, laughing.

A deadly-sharp SPEAR GUN rests in its rack outside the cabin. JASON'S HAND REMOVES IT.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - CABIN DOOR

...and camera RISES from the mossy feet, up the bloodless legs and torso to ultimately reveal the hockey-masked face of our anti-hero: JASON VOORHEES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUZY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lets out a broad smile, her eyelids fluttering. They stay open long enough to regard the visitor in the doorway. She tries to choke out a warning to Jim, who's just collapsed himself.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	JJJJJJJJason...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZY>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't follow her glance, smiling instead.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh. You must really think I'm an ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
But she continues to stare in horror as:

<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
raises the spear, taking aim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - SUZY AND JIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hs starts to kiss her but she bolts up with a blood- curdling SCREAM. A second later, JASON FIRES THE SPEAR, PIERCING HER NECK, PINNING HER TO THE HEAD BOARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim stares point-blank at his dead girlfriend, not able to assimilate it quickly enough. He spins around to see the monster himself.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ohmygod...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Jim springs off the bed, looking around for anything to defend himself with, grabbing the bedside lamp. He SMASHES IT OVER JASON'S HEAD which has little effect. Jim scrambles to get past him, but Jason LIFTS JIM IN THE AIR, SLAMMING HIM DOWN ON ONE OF THE SPIKED BEDPOSTS.

Standing at the boarding ramp is CHARLES MCCULLOCH, clipboard in hand. He's just finished checking off a pair of new-agey SENIOR GIRLS. McCulloch is approaching fifty, wearing a tie and unwrinkled clothes, as well as the disposition of a stern puritan.

Before Mrs. Watanabe can squeeze a word in, her daughter is gone. She waves a bittersweet goodbye to her graduate.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_WATANABE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_WATANABE>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING WITH TAMARA AND EVA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once they're out of Mrs. Watanabe's earshot --
</DIRECTION>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
Tamara unzips her purse, revealing a baggie filled with fine white powder. Eva looks very nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He bought you that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More or less. It's part of my college fund.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
She grins coquettishly, walking on. Camera HOLDS on the calm, foggy harbor...where the faint image of a HOUSEBOAT is aimlessly drifting into port.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ANGLE - HOUSEBOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sure enough, it's the same one we saw JASON on last night...but no one is behind the helm. It seems to be a ghost ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Tamara tries to slip past McCulloch, busy with another pair of seniors.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can stop right there, Miss Mason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
He motions the others onward. Busted. Tamara instantly hands Eva her drug-filled purse, paralyzing Eva.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULL40CH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only graduating seniors are allowed on this cruise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULL40CH>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<MCCULLOCB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never turned in your final biology project, so I've had your diploma rescinded.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCB>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't do that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's already been done.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to Eva)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulations on the 3.9 average, Miss Watanabe. You're in stateroom two- fifty-five.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Eva smiles awkwardly, reaching for her luggage, stalling to see what happens with Tamara.
</DIRECTION>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Mr. McCulloch, I got in a car accident yesterday and missed our appointment. It's okay, no big deal, just a bruised arm...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(squeezes her arm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...so I brought my project along today. It's in my suitcase. Really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her suitcase, not buying a word of this.
</DIRECTION>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's telling the truth, Mr. McCulloch. I saw her pack it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<DIRECTION>
He's surprised to hear this...and so is Tamara.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfectly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs her purse back from Eva, quickly moving on before he changes his mind. Their voices become whispers.
</DIRECTION>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A major prick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Improvise, of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOCK PILINGS - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the HOUSEBOAT haphazardly bumps into barnacle-covered dock pilings, still around fifty yards from the cruise ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POINT OF VIEW OUT HOUSEBOAT WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The window is splattered with blood, but still clear enough to make out Tamara and Eva walking up the gangway, along with a half dozen other teenagers mingling on board.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON HOUSEBOAT'S ANCHOR CABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--or rather the remnants of it. It's a piece of frayed woven metal charred by extreme electricity, severed just above water level. Suddenly there's blurry movement behind it; camera RACK FOCUSES just in time to catch a glimpse of JASON SLIPPING OFF THE SIDE, FLOATING TOWARDS THE PILINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOCKSIDE - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as McCulloch impatiently checks his watch and list again. Miss Van Deusen walks up to him.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<DIRECTION>
He gives her a disdainful look, starting up the ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<DIRECTION>
He stops, following her glance. His face tightens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rennie is walking toward them with a small suitcase, her dog Toby striding next to her. She walks up to him, starts to say something, then decides against it. Rennie heads up the gangway. HOLD on McCulloch and Miss Van Deusen. He's livid.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have no right...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I think it's just the beginning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<DIRECTION>
She walks past him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RAMP/SHIP - ON RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she reaches the top of the gangway, her heart pounding. Rennie pauses, working up the courage to look out at the lake again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ROWBOAT she saw earlier is still there, even closer now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE'S PUPILS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
contract, her blood pumping faster. Then she hears a FAINT VOICE BELOW HER...
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hhhhelp me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Rennie looks straight down at the water beneath her and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
floundering in the water. It takes us only a moment to recognize him -- IT'S YOUNG JASON. He's gasping, sucking in huge amounts of liquid, exactly like he did in the prologue.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_JASON>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leans back in terror, falling into Miss Van Deusen.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong, Rennie??
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<DIRECTION>
Rennie frantically points over the ramp edge, unable to speak. Miss Van Deusen quickly looks and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MISS VAN DEUSEN'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water is calm. No Young Jason.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RETURN TO SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Rennie gets a hold of herself.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just got a little dizzy. I'm fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
She continues up the ramp. HOLD on Miss Van Deusen, watching her go, somewhat troubled by it. RACK to McCulloch below her, also watching. Extremely concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
continues along the starboard side, not risking another glance overboard. She passes an older, very deranged DECK HAND, mopping the deck. HOLD on him, his bloodshot eyes following her like a crazed raven.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIDGE - CLOSE ON HARPOON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sharp and rusty, mounted on the wall amidst jagged scaling knives, shark jaws and other artifacts. WIDEN to reveal they are surrounding a navigational chart on the cruise ship's bridge. Admiral Robertson and his CHIEF ENGINEER are preparing for departure, checking the OMEGA satellite computer as well as the LORAN.
</DIRECTION>
<ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
<DIRECTION>
(checking watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's take in the brow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
<CHIEF_ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes Sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(into intercom phone.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take in the gangway and single up all lines.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF_ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
SEAN and MILES enter the room; Sean gets a glance from his Dad. Miles is very impressed with the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Admiral Robertson. Love your ship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a beauty, isn't she? I should've retired from the Navy ten years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've really been generous to give us this cruise. I know I speak for everybody on board.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody...with the possible exception of Sean. He avoids eye contact with his father.
</DIRECTION>
<ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell, there's just twenty or so of you -- we only need a skeleton crew and it's a pleasure to sail her anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the way, congratulations on winning the intramural diving championships, Miles. I'm sure you made your old man proud.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
<DIRECTION>
Admiral Robertson gives his own son a glance; maybe Sean should think about doing the same.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you decided on your departure protocol, Admiral?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF_ENGINEER>
<ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I thought I'd leave the honors to my son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, I don't think...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
<DIRECTION>
(to Chief Engineer, ignoring Sean)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relinquishing command of the Princess Ruby to Captain Sean Robertson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
<DIRECTION>
Sean has no say in the matter. Miles can feel his friend's nervousness as well.
</DIRECTION>
<ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But before you take the helm, take this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
<DIRECTION>
He tosses Sean a wrapped box. Sean opens it. Inside is a navigational computer the size of a calculator, sitting next to a rusty old sextant.
</DIRECTION>
<ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something old and something new. I used the sextant when I was your age, but now they have these goddamn computers to do all the work for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
<CHIEF_ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Sean)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you decided on a plan of departure, Captain?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF_ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
Sean's nervous. He eyes the Omega, quickly glancing at the LORAN, briefly referring to the navigational chart.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about if we start up the forward engines and come around. 180 degrees...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you forgetting something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
<DIRECTION>
Sean looks flustered. Admiral Robertson storms to a large button, pressing it three times, piercing the air with three long blasts of the ship's horn. It underscores his frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're in foggy weather! Send out the international maritime signal that a vessel is backing down, followed by a security broadcast warning other ships!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
<DIRECTION>
He shoves the mike out at Sean, but he doesn't grab it, leaving the bridge, humiliated. There's an awkward moment for Miles, unable to find any appropriate words. He exits as well. Admiral Robertson stares out the bridge window, saddened and frustrated. It wasn't supposed to go this way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DECK - ON SEAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he continues away, his retreat blocked by the DECK HAND. The crazy old man pierces a dead serious stare at Sean.
</DIRECTION>
<DECK_HAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This voyage is doomed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECK_HAND>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, tell me about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Sean sidesteps him, moving on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HARBOR - DAY (CRANE SHOT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parents and relatives wave gleefully from the docks as CAMERA RISES AND ROTATES to find eighteen or so teenagers 1ining the upper deck, happily waving back. The ship begins to slice through serene water. The voyage has begun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ON HULL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water begins to ripple as the ship's speed increases. All seems normal...until JASON'S HANDS APPEAR, CLINGING TO A LOOSE MOORING LINE DRAGGING IN THE WATER. He slithers up the side towards the deck as dense fog breezes past him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DECK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Sean continues along, hands in pockets. He turns a corner and collides with RENNIE, walking her dog. His eyes instantly brighten, as do hers.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rennie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Sean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard you weren't coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(glances at Toby)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We changed our minds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Sean pats her dog. There's an awkward pause...they are obviously in the early stages-of a relationship. Sean reaches into his coat pocket, bringing back a small necklace-sized box.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got you a present.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I didn't get you one...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Rennie opens it up, exposing a petite silver necklace with a Statue of Liberty pendant on it. She's touched.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sean...it's beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Sean takes it from her, snapping it around her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd love to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your father was looking for you, Mr. Robertson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
McCulloch appears behind them. The mood has been broken.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I'll see you later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Sean leaves. McCulloch steps up to Rennie, pointing out to the foggy sea. Her respiration increases as she psyches herself up to look.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a storm predicted tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Rennie looks at the ocean, forcing herself not to turn away.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm staying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She didn't push me into coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you doing this to yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a measured pause.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm staying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
He's not going to change her mind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. - RENNIE AND MCCULLOCH (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
through a porthole window...and through the viewfinder of a video camcorder. McCulloch shakes his head, turning away from Rennie and walking away. A sinister electric guitar solo screeches out. PAN with McCulloch as he passes the window, coming around 180 degrees into a CLOSE UP of J.J. JARRETT, fingering a sleek Gibson "Flying V."
</DIRECTION>

</J_J>
<DIRECTION>
INT. J.J.'S STATEROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as J.J., a female rocker in the vein of band "Vixen," continues to wail on her guitar. She's wearing a black leather corset, with wildly teased deep red hair. Holding the camcorder is WAYNE WEBBER, MTV-acclimated, wearing the latest hip prescription glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too cool, J.J. Your parents came through.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
She pops out the guitar cable from her practice amp.
</DIRECTION>
<J_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No lie. I hear there's a big power room down below where I can get supreme concert hall echo. Come down and shoot a basement tape on me, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_J>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure...but I gotta shoot some shockumentary footage first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
He avoids eye contact when he says it. She gives him a look.
</DIRECTION>
<J_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, don't tell me you're still trying to scam on Tamara...
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_J>
<DIRECTION>
His non-answer means yes. J.J. walks over to him, grabbing his cheeks, shaking them like jello.
</DIRECTION>
<J_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long have we known each other? Don't be a dweeb, Wayne. She's not interested in you, only what you can do for her. She's a user.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_J>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's sexy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<J_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So's this guitar. So what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_J>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll catch you later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
He exits. She mumbles something under her breath, coiling up her amp cord.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH WAYNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he walks onward. DROP DOWN to find his FEET as he passes a DARK ALCOVE...which happens to have SLIMY FOOTPRINTS AND SEAWEED leading into it. Camera FOLLOWS the footprints, RISING again and with dim recognition, our eyes fall on JASON. Lurking in the shadows. But not for long.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POWER ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Massive, very dark, backlit steam seeping from a maze of pipes overhead. No windows. A wall of circuit breakers and voltage meters decorate one wall, quietly humming generators on the opposite side. J.J. appears with her guitar, amp and ghetto blaster, appreciative of the surroundings.
</DIRECTION>
<J_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This place is aching for a video. Wayne, you're an asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_J>
<DIRECTION>
She finds an outlet and plugs in her equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're peering at J.J. predatorially through the steam, moving through it, behind the generators.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
J.J.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pops a cassette into her blaster, jamming the "play" button. A loud rock 'n roll rhythm track blasts out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
moving around the generators, eyeing her sleek leather pants as she bends over to plug in her axe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON ELECTRIC GUITAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as J.J. snaps the male end of the plug into the female. receptacle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
appears for an instant through the vapor, then vanishes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
J.J.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
screams out the opening licks of her solo in sync with her playback. The generators are causing a breeze which makes her hair dance, steam flowing between her legs. She's lost in her music, building to a crescendo, bending the high "E" string above the upper octave fret. She opens her eyes with the pleasure of it and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
emerging from a cloud of vapor like her worst nightmare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UPPER DECK - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as J.J.'s SCREAM echoes from an exhaust duct. WHIP PAN to find the crazed DECK HAND standing just below it, reacting with dread. He's the only one who has heard it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POWER ROOM - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Jason tears the guitar off her body, raising it in the air like a hatchet. The horrified girl flees down a narrow maze of steel steps, forced back against a generator with nowhere to go. PUSH IN on her face for one last look at her before:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
swings the guitar downward and buries it in J.J.'s skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UPPER DECK - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the Deck Hand flinches upon the thick, dull sound of her demise, followed by discordant feedback from her guitar...and eventual silence. He reaches into his breast pocket, his hand shaking badly as he sips from a flask of Early Times.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as LIGHTNING FLASHES over a gray, choppy sea. A storm is imminent. The Princess Ruby finally appears, cutting through whitecaps, no land in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - INK DIP PEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Rennie's hand carefully dips it in India ink, moving to a blank page in her journal. She hesitates for several beats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
No inspiration. She puts down the pen, looking at her dog, who's curled up on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think...time for some personal experiences to fuel our minds?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
The dog's eyes blink, but no more than that.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I agree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Rennie moves to her closet, finding a silk blouse and some black satin pants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTSIDE DECK - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wind is picking up, sweeping thick mist past a row of decorative flags. One of them flaps back...AND EXPOSES JASON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH JASON'S EYES (FLYING WALL EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the flag whips our faces. We MOVE through it, down the empty passageway, coming to a porthole window. Rennie's window. We peer through it with unnerving intensity at the backside of Rennie as she pulls off her T-shirt, slipping on the blouse. Camera continues through the tiny round window, floating across the room, over Toby and the bed...until we're INCHES FROM THE BACK OF RENNIE'S HEAD. She suddenly spins around in fright, facing us point-blank, and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nobody is there, her porthole window empty. But there's something surreal about the window...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON PORTHOLE WINDOW (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Empty grayness...then EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON FLOATS UP FROM BELOW, BUBBLES ESCAPING FROM HIS LIPS. The porthole has become a window into the depths of Crystal Lake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
feels her throat catch with terror and an instant later:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOG TOBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
begins to bark vociferously, rushing to her cabin door, scratching to get out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
are distracted to Toby for a second; when she looks back at the porthole, she sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN EMPTY WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No water, no drowning boy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
snaps out of it, moving to the door, where her dog is frantically clawing with his fur up.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay Toby, calm down...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
She's talking to herself as much as the dog. Rennie closes the curtains on her window, then steps to her door. She swings the door open for Toby...and exposes an empty hall. Toby scrapes his way out of the room, dashing off down the hall, snarling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHIP CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Toby runs straight toward us. PAN with him as he rushes around a corner, leading us into a view of TAMARA and EVA, disappearing down a staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MENS GYM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A strong seventeen year-old black kid, JULIUS GAW, is going a few rounds with another senior boy who's clearly losing the boxing match. Julius dances around him on the mat like he's Mike Tyson, several other boys cheering them on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE - LOCKER ROOM WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Tamara and Eva step into view. Eva glances around, feeling out of place in the men's locker room.
</DIRECTION>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure we're supposed to be here, Tamara.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<DIRECTION>
A couple of skinny boys wearing only towels walk by. But Tamara doesn't notice them, her face pressed up against the glass, watching Julius.
</DIRECTION>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that a muscular bod or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
Tamara puts on a sexy smile. The other boxer sees her instead, instantly distracted. Julius lays him out with a left-right-left combination. The onlookers applaud. Julius pulls out his mouthpiece, giving Tamara a wicked smile.
</DIRECTION>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's undefeated, you know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<EVA>
<DIRECTION>
(awkward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(lets it slip out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He might even pay some attention to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
Tamara quickly puts up her veneer again, spotting something.
</DIRECTION>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gorgeous guy at ten o'clock. Look sensual.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
Both girls slip into instant sultry as a CREW MEMBER in his mid-twenties passes them, wearing a tool belt. Very masculine. He gives the girls a pleasant smile. Tamara turns around to check out his back side.
</DIRECTION>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're joking, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
She wasn't, but Eva tries to act like she was. Tamara walks on, Eva following.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STATEROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as McCulloch steps from Rennie's room, looking very worried. Wayne Webber passes by, his eye stuck in his viewfinder. McCulloch yanks the camcorder away from his face.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you seen my niece anywhere?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, motivating downstairs, I think. What's the problem, Mr. McCulloch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Senior predictions started five minutes ago and she hasn't shown up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some of us don't want our futures predicted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In your case I'm sure that's true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
He brushes past Wayne angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SERVICE AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Tamara drags Eva into a secluded service area, pulling out her mirror, straw and baggie.
</DIRECTION>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The night time is the right time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
Tamara hands the straw to Eva.
</DIRECTION>
<EVA>
<DIRECTION>
(nervous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not that, it's just that...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<EVA>
<DIRECTION>
(a pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night. You've got your whole life to be uptight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
Eva takes the straw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STALKING POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as we move down the corridor, in and out of shadows, hearing giggles from Tamara and Eva up ahead. Jason's coming...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - TAMARA AND EVA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Eva takes a nosefull, sneezing badly.
</DIRECTION>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that unbelievable or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
Tamara giggles, getting ready to tap out another line. But the snickering stops upon the sound of APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS. They both look up, every muscle tensing with fear as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
appears from the shadows, just as startled to see them. It's not Jason at all. Rennie can't help noticing the cocaine, trying hard to ignore it.
</DIRECTION>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, you scared the hell out of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you seen my dog? I think he came this way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we haven't.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(awkwardly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Care for a hit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Rennie continues on. After she's gone...
</DIRECTION>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
Tamara puts the straw to her nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she presses on, the corridor getting darker.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Toby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
No reply. She walks on, turning down the left hallway... but camera turns down the right hallway. Suddenly JASON REVEALS HIMSELF, quietly stepping from the GAME ROOM. He's holding a pool cue, which he proceeds to snap in half, providing a splintery sharp shaft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SERVICE AREA - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Tamara finishes off her line, wiping her nose with a sniffle.
</DIRECTION>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah. Ready to party and then some.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
She rolls up her baggie, stuffing it into her purse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STALKING POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as we come down a corridor, turning into the Service Area, stomping right up to Tamara and Eva. They both GASP; Tamara drops her mirror, which SHATTERS on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are facing McCulloch.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing in here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
He eyes the broken mirror. He wasn't born yesterday.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you girls using drugs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think I would use drugs, Mr. McCulloch? We were just exploring the ship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't want to believe Eva is a druggie. But Tamara is a different matter. He levels his eyes on her.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're out of town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
He's gotten to her with that one. McCulloch storms away.
</DIRECTION>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(calculating)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
SPLASH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as a body pierces the surface of the deck swimming pool. It's MILES, having just completed a dive from the high board. Miss Van Deusen and several others stand at poolside, giving him some applause.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poetry in motion, Miles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A half-twist short. I'll hone that dive yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
He swims to the side, leading us to a view of Rennie. She's very cautious about getting too close to the pool edge as she approaches Miss Van Deusen.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you seen my dog anywhere?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The ship's only so big and there's certainly no way off it, is there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles reassuringly, but her words are less than comforting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHIP CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH TOBY - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the canine continues to sniff out Jason through the maze of corridors. TRACK with the dog as he slows his pace, knowing he's getting close to something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOBY'S POINT OF VIEW (STEADICAM)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Low to the ground, creeping past a steam vent which obscures his vision, then turning down a metal staircase, weaving into another passageway. Then with absolutely no warning, A BODY FALLS FROM ABOVE, THUDDING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF US.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rears back with teeth bared, but:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is quite dead: Toby is snarling at the corpse of the TEENAGE BOXER who lost his bout against Julius. He's still in his boxing shorts...BUT JASON'S SPLINTERY POOL CUE HAS BEEN STABBED THROUGH HIS CHEST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DECK POOL - ON RENNIE AND MISS VAN DEUSEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they walk along the edge of the pool.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, are you having fun yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(lying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In other words, level with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(a pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's something I haven't told you...

</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
...But before she can begin the next sentence, Rennie is shoved from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WATER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she SPLASHES INTO THE POOL'S DEEP END.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MISS VAN DEUSEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
spins around, seeing Tamara standing there with Eva.
</DIRECTION>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow, sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
flounders at the surface, nobody realizing the terror she's experiencing. She's too scared to even cry for help.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MISS VAN DEUSEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
isn't looking at Rennie, her attention on admonishing Tamara.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why on earth would you do something like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was an accident, I swear...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
Eva avoids eye contact, feeling awful. Sean comes walking up, seeing Rennie.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Rennie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rennie, are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's can't even hear Sean, her vision being splashed by the chlorinated water. She sinks under the surface, turning around...AND COMING FACE TO FACE WITH YOUNG JASON. The eight year-old corpse GRABS HER ANKLE AND TRIES TO DRAG HER DOWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEAN'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Rennie sinks under the surface, all alone, thrashing in terror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
realizes she's in trouble. He immediately dives in after her, pulling her to the pool's edge, where Miss Van Deusen helps to lift her out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TAMARA AND EVA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
quickly move on.
</DIRECTION>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was truly excellent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<EVA>
<DIRECTION>
(feels like shit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time to check out the waiters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But...wait a minute!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
Eva walks away. Tamara acts angry, but deep down she's hurt.
</DIRECTION>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some friend you are.

</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POOL SIDE - SAME TIME

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring her a towel, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<DIRECTION>
Sean nods, hurrying off as others start to crowd around. Miss Van Deusen looks up at them.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's fine -- everybody go back to what you were doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<DIRECTION>
They disperse. Rennie slowly starts to cry, holding tight to her teacher.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Care to talk about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment to compose herself...
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't swim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gathered that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<DIRECTION>
Rennie says nothing else. Miss Van Deusen knows she's holding out.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not that simple.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(long pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
The teacher didn't expect this, taking a thoughtful pause.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did this start?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After your parents passed away?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<DIRECTION>
Rennie nods somberly.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you have an accident in the lake?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason Voorhees.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<DIRECTION>
The name has triggered some deep memory...but the recollection vanishes upon the sound of her uncle's voice.

ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as McCulloch rushes over to Rennie, seeing that she's soaked. He's livid.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't her fault.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
He gets Rennie to her feet just as Sean runs back with a towel. McCulloch grabs it from him, wrapping it around his niece, facing both Miss Van Deusen and Sean.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay away from her...both of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to lead her away. The crazy DECK HAND blocks their path, slipping his flask away.
</DIRECTION>
<DECK_HAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's come back and you're all going to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECK_HAND>
<DIRECTION>
Rennie gazes at the Deck Hand, then back at McCulloch.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just...leave me alone...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls away from him, hurrying off, confused and frightened. McCulloch's retinas pierce the Deck Hand with scorn. He checks his watch, then storms off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

as a loud, firm KNOCK punctuates the silence. Then comes a sultry voice...

<TAMARA>

	Wouldn't you like a glass of champagne first, Charles?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
He's about to lose his temper. McCulloch steps closer.

<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did you get that alcohol?

</MCCULLOCH>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I haven't even shown you my biology project...

Tamara unties her robe. PAN DOWN to the floor with it as it softly piles at her bare feet.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - PORTHOLE WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the SHADOW OUTSIDE quickly blurs past the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RETURN TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McCulloch is flabbergasted, too stunned to fully react. Tamara is wearing a layered teddy, which she's beginning to unsnap, exposing her lithe body...but that's not all. Tamara has drawn all her major organs on her bare skin.
</DIRECTION>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a closer look, Charles. I want to make sure I labeled all my organs correctly.

</TAMARA>

EXT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - STALKING POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as we approach her door, still cracked open from McCulloch's entrance. We get there just in time to see Tamara slip her arms around McCulloch, planting her lips on his, pressing her nubile flesh up against his stiffly starched shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS

as she holds him tight. He finally breaks away in a fit of anger.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>

	Oh, you've done it now. Not only are you going home, I'll see to it that you spend next year back in a high school classroom!

</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
He storms for the door, swinging it open, coming face to face with:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAYNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who casually lowers his camcorder.
</DIRECTION>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so, Mr. McCulloch.

</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
His eyes are unable to leave her nakedness.
</DIRECTION>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
She quickly slips on her robe again, all business. McCulloch realizes what has just transpired.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll never get away with it.

<DIRECTION>
(eyeing Wayne)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you can forget about ever attending any film school.

<DIRECTION>
(serious beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're both going to be very, very sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
He storms off. Wayne looks very, very nervous. Tamara steps over to him, cuddling up.
</DIRECTION>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax, Wayne. He won't risk doing a thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I have the tape?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
He pops the eject button, absently handing it over. Wayne steps into her room, nervous and excited to be there. He lifts the glass of champagne she poured for McCulloch.
</DIRECTION>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is going to sound supremely lame...but I've had the major hots for you since our sophomore year, Tamara.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
He gulps down the fizz. She forces a smile, stashing the incriminating videotape.
</DIRECTION>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's sweet, Wayne. Look, I'd love to chat but I'm really pressed for time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(ushering him to door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's try to get together later, okey- doke?

</WAYNE>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for the camerawork.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
And out he goes, the door shut in his face. Wayne stands outside her room, realizing he's a major chump.
</DIRECTION>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wayne, you're an asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
He despondently exits.

INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME (STEADICAM)
</DIRECTION>

Nothing is there.

INT. LADIES RESTROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Rennie enters, her eyes reddened. She moves to the sink, looking at herself in the mirror. So much for the silk blouse and satin pants, not to mention her soaked hair. Rennie runs some warm water, rinsing her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she starts to fill her hands a second time, BLOOD POURS OUT THE FAUCET INSTEAD OF WATER. Rennie gasps, jerking up and seeing YOUNG JASON REFLECTED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR, SPLASHING IN WATER.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
as water from the shower head SPLASHES CAMERA for a beat before Tamara turns it off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Tamara reaches for her robe, slipping it on. Her body paint has been washed off. She steps from the shower, glancing in her vanity mirror AND SEEING THE REAL JASON REFLECTED IN IT. Tamara spins around, looking face to face with JASON IN HER BATHROOM. Just as she SCREAMS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LADIES RESTROOM - SAME TIME (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young Jason reaches out to grab Rennie, HIS FIST CRASHING THROUGH THE MIRROR. Right when Rennie SCREAMS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TAMARA'S BATHROOM - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The real Jason SHATTERS TAMARA'S VANITY MIRROR WITH HIS FIST. He grabs a sharp chunk of it, advancing on a whimpering Tamara.
</DIRECTION>
<TAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please...please don't...

</TAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
Jason raises the shard above her and just as she SHRIEKS...

</SEAN>

INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

</DIRECTION>
<ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's kick in the stablilizers, Mr. Carlson, and get the seas off the quarter. These kids are in for one hell of a storm.

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON

	<DIALOGUE>
	A tremendous age. Take some advice from a salty old man: don't push him too hard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
<DIRECTION>
The Chief Engineer nods with a sympathetic smile as the Admiral steps off the bridge, onto the stormy deck, contemplating the sea. The Chief Engineer moves to the radio/intercom console. He lifts a telephone, punching in a three digit number. PUSH IN TIGHT ON HIS FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the bridge. Approaching weather suggests we secure the main deck and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF_ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
His sentence is sharply cut off, his head jerking from excruciating, instant pain. His mouth contorts with words no one will ever hear as he stares into the face of:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
holding the opposite end of the harpoon. He shoves it forward with one more staccato jerk and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - CHIEF ENGINEER'S BACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- The harpoon's bloody, corroded tip pierces through his once-white uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
returns to the bridge as LIGHTNING flashes outside.
</DIRECTION>
<ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better have them doublecheck the lifeboat stations as well...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADMIRAL_ROBERTSON>
<DIRECTION>
Admiral Robertson stops cold upon the sight of Mr. Carlson. He hurries over to him, kneeling down, freezing as a pair of MUDDY FEET ENTER FRAME. Admiral Robertson bends his neck upwards to face:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hovering over him, now clutching one of the scaling knives.

INT. BRIDGE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Can he really take us home?

</RENNIE>
<SEAN>

	Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.

	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do.

He's made a big decision. Sean takes her hand as they walk on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POINT OF VIEW

<DIRECTION>
moving closer and closer to the bridge door, having not the slightest inclination of what's in store for them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEAN
</DIRECTION>

knocks on the bridge door. No answer. He's confused. He pushes the door open but something is blocking it. Sean puts his weight into it, shoving hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the door slides open, Sean stepping inside. His eyes roil downwards upon seeing THE DEAD CHIEF ENGINEER, THE HARPOON PROTRUDING FROM HIS BLOODY CHEST.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Jesus...Dad??
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Sean looks over at the helm...where his father is still sitting in the swivel chair, his back to them. Silent. Sean sidesteps the Chief Engineer's corpse, moving toward his father as Rennie remains frozen in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEAN'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly walking toward Admiral Robertson...at least he thinks it's his dad because he's unable to see his face. Is it Jason now wearing the uniform?? When he's about two feet away from him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reaches out and swivels the chair around. It is his father BUT HIS THROAT HAS BEEN SLIT. Sean staggers backwards, uncomprehending, his senses overloaded. We MOVE with him until he's backed into Rennie, clutching onto him tightly.

<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

Suddenly the door is jerked from her grasp and swung open. MCCULLOCH is standing on the other side of it.

	A killer walks this ship indeed. And it's certainly none of us...

</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
The crazed old man gets his drift. Everyone looks at him suspiciously. McCulloch grabs a SCALING KNIFE off the wall, taking a step towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DECK_HAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the one who's insane!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECK_HAND>
<DIRECTION>
The raving man flees back the way he came. McCulloch raises the flare gun; Miss Van Deusen grabs McCulloch's arm, stopping him.

<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing??

	It's no coincidence.

There's a murmur; it makes sense.

Julius walks off the bridge; all the seniors follow except Sean.

<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please everybody, stay here!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<DIRECTION>
They don't listen. McCulloch starts to go after them...and then it hits him:
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ...where's Rennie??
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?? You sent her out there with a murderer running around loose??
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DECK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Rennie moves past wet, empty lounge chairs towards the bow. She passes a row of translucent windows. The first three are normal...but the fourth has the SILHOUETTE OF JASON ON ITS OPPOSITE SIDE. He begins to stride parallel to her, then disappears when the windows end and a wall takes over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIDGE CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Julius and his followers continue on, passing Eva, who's coming up from a staircase. She stops Wayne.
</DIRECTION>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jason...Voorhees?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<DIRECTION>
She knows the legend as weld as everybody else. Wayne nods gravely, moving to catch up with the others. Eva rushes up to him again.
</DIRECTION>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you seen Tamara?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.

</WAYNE>
<EVA>

</EVA>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what else is new?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care about being hip anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<DIRECTION>
She means it. Wayne nods with understanding.
</DIRECTION>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, but I've gotta find J.J.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
He hurries on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Rennie appears, fighting the wind and rain to get closer to the anchor hoists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POINT OF VIEW THROUGH DECK WINDOW - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--spying on Rennie like a wolf watching a lamb. We MOVE a few windows down, getting a better view of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE - ON JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
deciding that the time is right to strike. His hand moves to the bow entrance door knob, slowly turning it, pulling it open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOW - ON RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
moving closer to the right anchor hoist, her back to us as well as Jason. She climbs behind the hoist, looking at the consoles. Then suddenly a BARK.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Toby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns, catching a glimpse of her dog running down the side of the deck. Rennie leaves the hoist, going after Toby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
through the crack in the door, watching Rennie unexpectedly take off. He's about to move after her when ha hears:
</DIRECTION>
<EVA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tamara? Are you around here anywhere?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<DIRECTION>
Jason quietly closes the door. Rennie will have to wait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH EVA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she cautiously walks along, poking her head in every alcove.
</DIRECTION>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tamara?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<DIRECTION>
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
moving down the same corridor, catching a glimpse of Eva before she turns a corner and disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY/TAMARA'S STATEROOM - MOVING WITH EVA (STEADICAM)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eva steps into the hallway outside Tamara's stateroom. She walks up to Tamara's door, knocking on it. It swings open, unlocked.
</DIRECTION>
<EVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tamara?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no response)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just want to talk with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVA>
<DIRECTION>
She steps into Tamara's room and we go in with her. The quarters are empty. Eva stands there for a beat, confused and scared. She's about to leave when a CREAKING SOUND causes her to look back at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BATHROOM DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It slowly swings open...splashing Eva's eyes with grotesque multi-images of Tamara: SHE IS HANGING ON THE DOOR HOOK, HER BODY PIN-CUSHIONED WITH A DOZEN MIRROR SRARDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shrieks, running back out the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STATEROOM HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and sliding to a abrupt halt because JASON IS STANDING AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY. He moves toward Eva like a bulldozer. She turns a rapid 180 and sprints in retreat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUNNING WITH EVA (HAND HELD)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gasping for oxygen, Eva has no time to even scream as she flees from the monster, erratically turning down a spiral staircase and running on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (STEADICAM)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
chasing after her with the smooth determination of a shark, never letting her get too far in the lead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOWELS OF SHIP - ON EVA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Empty for a second, then Eva appears, weaving her way through a maze of corridors and passageways. She races past a sign directing passengers to "CLUB RUBY."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--entering the same corridor a beat after Eva exits it in the direction of the disco. He tramples onward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR/DISCO (STEADICAM)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The thudding low frequency of a mesmerizing dance tune precedes Eva as she tears open a door, entering the corridor. MOVE BACKWARDS WITH HER as she rushes forward, curving through the shallow passageway and emptying out onto a high tech DISCO FLOOR. A flashing Star Wars lighting system assaults her all directions along with the music. She's all alone in here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON EVA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights strobing across her face only accentuate her terror. She spots another door on a small stage, rushing to it. It's locked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CROOKED ANGLE - ENTRANCE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Jason enters the corridor, SLAMMING THE DOOR SHUT BEHIND HIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
decides this is the wrong place to be. She moves for the corridor again and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
appears on the corridor steps for a brief second. The spotlight goes black, then flashes on again. Now he's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
backs away, sliding along the edge of the dance floor like she's on a building ledge. Chaser lights and mirror balls fondle her body as she moves as far away from the point where she last saw him. But:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
illuminates only ten feet from her, a crimson strobe assaulting his hockey mask. She's on a collision course with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
whirls dizzily to the center of the dance floor upon the sight of him. Camera SPINS with her in 360 degree arcs, PUSHING IN on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVA'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
spiraling counter-clockwise on the dance floor, flashes of Jason materializing where she least expects to see him. And getting closer. Finally at the point of exhaustion:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stops, looking everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVA'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He seems to be gone. She catches her breath...then sensing his presence, she revolves a half-turn to face:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HOCKEY MASK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
exploding under a pin spotlight, standing directly before her. His forearms recoil with lightning speed as he grips her throat...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE SHOT - DISCO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thundering music. Frantic lights. And Jason and Eva at the center of it all. HER FEET ARE TWENTY-FOUR INCHES OFF THE GROUND, KICKING MADLY AS THE LIFE IS BEING CHOKED OUT OF HER. Finally Eva's legs go rag doll limp. Jason flings her to the ground like a sack of flour. This dance is over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DECK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rennie appears again, scanning her no-visibility surroundings.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Toby? Where'd you go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
No sign of her dog. She remembers her mission, heading to the anchors again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOW - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Rennie arrives on the bow, climbing into the left hoist box behind the huge anchor cable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STALKING POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
moving up to the bow door like Jason did before, cracking it open, seeing Rennie from behind. And moving towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is oblivious as she reads the directions above the controls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - HOIST LEVER (SECOND UNIT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Rennie's hand grabs it, shoving it forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - GREEN HOIST BUTTON (SECOND UNIT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later, her thumb finds it and depresses it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - ANCHOR CHAIN (SECOND UNIT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the massive black chain links thunder to life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STALKING POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's now within ten feet of the unaware girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
remains in the hoist box, making certain it is operating correctly. A second later, we see the fleeting outline of a HUMAN SHAPE appear behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STALKING POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three feet from Rennie. She spins around to climb out of the hoist box and GASPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's facing MCCULLOCH. He immediately reaches past her, yanking the lever back to its center position, and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ANCHOR CHAIN (SECOND UNIT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
grinds to a halt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RETURN TO SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as McCulloch faces her, angrily grabbing Rennie's arms, shouting over the storm.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had me worried to death!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Sean said...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the one you should be listening to! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to find some defense, but McCulloch leads her off before any wards come forth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - EXERCISE MAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as a pair of SKEET RIFLES, three FIRE AXES, a FLARE GUN and several POOL CUES are dumped onto the foam padded plastic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EXERCISE ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where Julius has gathered his small group of vigilantes, including Miles and Wayne.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I managed to scrounge this shit from the game room and hallways. Grab what you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Wayne takes one of the rifles; Miles grabs the axe.
</DIRECTION>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you taking, Julius?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<JULIUS>

Julius pauses. He's not stupid.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothin' but this gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIUS>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches down, picking up the other rifle. And they move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STATEROOM HALLWAY/RENNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as McCulloch guides his niece down the hallway, swinging her door open.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't we at least talk about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
He avoids eye contact. McCulloch takes her hand, ushering her across the threshold. She's standing inside her room now; he's in the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
	</DIALOGUE>

<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't a request.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
He closes the door on her face, pulling out a key, locking the dead bolt. She pounds on it from the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uncle Charles!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
He ignores her, briskly walking away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she throws her fists against the door a final time, realizing it's futile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steam continues to seep from the maze of criss-crossing pipes. Wayne appears on one of the catwalks. He's holding the skeet rifle under one arm, using the sun gun off his video camera to guide him.
</DIRECTION>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	J.J. -- you down here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>

as Wayne carefully lets his light guide him down the precarious walkway. An unexpected blast of steam scares the crap out of him, causing him to stumble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - WAYNE'S GLASSES (SECOND UNIT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--They slip off the bridge of his nose, skittering down through the catwalk and pipes to God knows where.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAYNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lies helplessly on the metal grid work, realizing his bleak predicament has just been squared. He pulls himself to a standing position again.
</DIRECTION>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got a major problem, Wayne.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His vision now gives him shadows and shapes rather than crisp images. He raises the gun and continues unsteadily forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POINT OF VIEW THROUGH GRID WORK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Wayne inches forward. Camera slowly PANS INTO A PROFILE OF JASON, watching him from a catbird seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAYNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
takes another step, almost tripping on a set of stairs leading down to the next level. And when he arrives there...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...A LARGE FIGURE STEPS OUT, HOLDING WHAT APPEARS TO BE A KNIFE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAYNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
instantly raises the rifle and FIRES...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and the body goes down. He's hit him!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAYNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stands there, breathing some relief. He gets an idea, looking through his camcorder eyepiece. Wayne begins to adjust the eyepiece diaptor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAYNE'S POINT OF VIEW (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the figure on the ground slips in and out of focus, finally becoming crisp. WAYNE HAS SHOT A CREW MEMBER -- the same good looking one Tamara and Eva ogled earlier. He's holding a screwdriver from his waist band tool set, not a knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAYNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slowly lowers his camera as his heart rises into his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his camcorder again, hoping a second view will reveal a dead Jason rather than this young man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAYNE'S POINT OF VIEW (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets half his wish: a HOCKEY MASK NOW FILLS HIS FRAME...but Jason is far from dead. Wayne catches a split- second glimpse of Jason's fist coming towards him, then the camera is KNOCKED FROM HIS EYE AND THE WORLD BECOMES DARK AND BLURRY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAYNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
screams, blindly running as fast as he can. He trips, picking himself up, stumbling down the catwalk stairs. Wayne makes it about ten feet before he stumbles over something, bringing with it a harsh strum from an ELECTRIC GUITAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - WAYNE'S FEET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sure enough, his left shoe is resting on the pickups of a blood-streaked Gibson Flying V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON WAYNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--sprawled out on the metal floor. He gropes around, his hands feeling something. It sends chills from his groin up through his scalp.

	No no no...

</WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE
</DIRECTION>

Wayne's hands are touching J.J.'S BLOODY FACE, A LARGE CRACK IN HER SKULL. He doesn't have time to scream or cry because
</DIRECTION>

JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hoists him off of J.J.'s body and flings him into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHIP CIRCUIT PANEL (EFX)

<DIRECTION>
which shorts out with a fanfare of ELECTRICAL SPARKS AND FIRE, INSTANTLY FRYING WAYNE.

Sean doesn't look at him, still trying to assimilate the wall of components.

</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Sean closes his eyes, trying to keep from losing his mind and temper. A fierce WAVE slaps the windows in front of Sean's face, motivating him to get his shit together. He checks the Omega and LORAN.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Sean doesn't answer, moving to the seat behind the helm. His father's seat. Sean takes the chair, adjusting the wheel, watching the compass. He studies a series of buttons on the console.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - WALL OF BUTTONS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PAN across them, stopping on one labeled "FIRE ALARM - DO NOT BREAK EXCEPT IN CASE OF EMERGENCY." Camera continues around to find we are in the POWER ROOM, NOT on the bridge. Our vision suddenly lands on JASON, staring at the alarm button, considering. He glances back over his shoulder.

as the shrieking alarm assaults the main deck, hallways and corridors, giving Julius, Miles and Wayne deep pause for thought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the alarm bombards Rennie's ears like everybody else's. She hurries to her curtained porthole window, working up the energy to look outside. Rennie gets a grip on them, FLINGING THEM OPEN. The DECK HAND'S CRAZED FACE IS GAZING BACK AT HER. Rennie screams; a second later he hurries off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as McCulloch tears open a cabinet door labeled EMERGENCY FLARE GUN. The siren continues to blast.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you shut that damn thing off??
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Sean moves to a bank of switches, his eyes darting around for the appropriate switch. Miss Van Deusen sees McCulloch remove the FLARE GUN from the cabinet.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We already thought of that -- nobody could possibly see it in this storm...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<MCCULIACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's only one person who needs to see it. And I'm going to find him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULIACH>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the fire??
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I doubt very much that one even exists.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(resolved)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough is enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
He marches out the door. Sean finds the alarm kill switch, flipping it. The excruciating siren vanishes. He grabs a pair of rain jackets, tossing one to Miss Van Deusen.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to get everybody together just in case the fire's for real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Sean heads for the door, shoving it forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DECK - ON DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it slams open...and JULIUS steps out, not Sean, from a different deck door. TRACK with him as he treads along the side of the ship, skeet rifle raised.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
walking past the lifeboat stations, the wind and precipitation battering the small boats. With no warning, AN OBSCURE FIGURE LEAPS OUT, GRIPPING AN AXE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JULIUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shoves the gun stock into his shoulder and takes instantaneous aim...but he doesn't shoot. He slowly lowers the rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as MILES lowers the axe. They've just scared the shit out of each other.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take the upper deck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Julius nods. They separate. Neither boy notices the smoke which is starting to emerge from a deck vent...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Filled with black smoke. The fire is spreading dangerously close to a series of hoses attached to a fuel pump, leading to tanks below. A sign over them reads: DANGER - FUEL TANKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DECK POOL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--steaming and far from calm as the weather blitzes it. Miles appears, climbing a ladder to the upper deck level.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POINT OF VIEW THROUGH LADDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone is spying on Miles from below, watching his every step.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Miles arrives, axe raised. He pauses to regard his surroundings, then moves on. RACK FOCUS TO FIND JASON RIGHT BEHIND HIM, having followed Miles up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only darkness and rain for a beat, then Miles materializes, curving around the gargantuan smokestack. He passes us and we SWING AROUND, now looking at the back of his head. He takes three more steps and JASON STEPS INTO THE FOREGROUND. Miles senses his presence and JERKS AROUND, RAISING THE AXE, BRINGING IT DOWN ON JASON'S HEAD...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...but Jason easily grabs the axe handle before it makes contact, flinging it away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOWER DECK - ON JULIUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's pacing along when a clattering noise from above makes him stop. Suddenly MILES' AXE THUDS INTO THE MAHOGANY DECK NEXT TO HIS FOOT. Julius gazes at it, jerking his head upward.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miles??
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIUS>
<DIRECTION>
His answer is a LOUD CRACK OF LIGHTNING. At the same time:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUNNING WITH MILES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's scrambling as fast as he can across the slippery deck as the monster relentlessly pursues him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's having no problem catching up to the defenseless teenager.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DECK STAIRS - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Julius zooms up them to aid his comrade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RADAR MAST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Miles slides up to the mast and begins scaling it. He glances downward and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILES' POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason is right at his heels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slips on a rung, regains control, and continues upward. He makes it three more steps, almost at the uppermost point when JASON GRABS THE BACK OF HIS COAT, TEARING HIM OFF THE MAST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STUNT FREEFALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles cries out as he FREEFALLS BACKWARDS, somersaulting and twisting like he's doing one of his better dives...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - MILES' FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Empty space for a half-second, then MILES' FACE JOLTS INTO FRAME with a look of ultimate agony. Something has abruptly stopped his fall. Something quite fatal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DECK - ON JULIUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
coming around a corner, stopping dead in his tracks, his stomach wrenching as his eyes fall on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILES (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...who is staring right back at him with dead pupils. MILES HAS BEEN HORRIBLY IMPALED OM A SHIP FLAGPOLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JULIUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
doesn't get the chance to grasp the reality of it because JASON'S HAND GRIPS HIS SHOULDER, SPINS HIM AROUND AND SLUGS HIM SQUARELY IN THE FACE. The force of it sends the boxer REELING BACKWARDS OFF THE RAILING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STORMY OCEAN (TANK)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and Julius SPLASHES INTO THE ROUGH SEA. He's quickly swallowed by the torrential waters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Rennie's HAND jiggles her doorknob again, confirming that it's locked tight. RISE to find her desperate face; she begins furiously pacing and we DOLLY BEHIND HER ...but Rennie stops cold upon hearing:
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_JASON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hhhhelp....me....
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_JASON>
<DIRECTION>
Rennie whirls into a CLOSE UP, staring with disbelief at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YOUNG JASON (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...who is standing on the oval rug in her stateroom, his hands reaching out to her. But then comes the inexplicable: THE OVAL RUG TURNS INTO LAKE WATER AND JASON SINKS INTO IT. He's drowning in the middle of her room, choking on murky water.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_JASON>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stands frozen, feeling herself drawn to him like a magnet. She crawls to the edge of her rug, which is now a deep lake, and extends her arms to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YOUNG JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
grabs her hand, pulling hard, then grinning wide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
feels the skin on her face crawling off her skull, her eyes expanding because she's now looking at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HERSELF!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rennie is holding onto herself, about four years younger in a bathing suit, drowning in the lake. YOUNG RENNIE.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hhhhelp....me....
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
screams with guttural fear, letting go of herself, watching her younger self drown in the hole in her room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YOUNG RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
disappears under the surface of the water...which seconds later CHANGES BACK INTO HER OVAL RUG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Rennie moves away, tears rolling down her face, utterly confused. She backs against the wall next to her porthole window and THE REAL JASON'S FIST SMASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW, GRABBING HER THROAT. Rennie struggles, gasping for air as he attempts to strangle her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON RENNIE'S HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
groping for a weapon to stop him, her fingers skittering across her table like a spider.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT - RENNIE AND JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her head is pulled taut against the wall just below the porthole, with Jason's hideous mask framed in the circular shattered window. She's slowly dying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON RENNIE'S HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her movements slow as the oxygen leaves her system. But Rennie's fingers miraculously find a recognizable object: the ink-dip pen given to her by Miss Van Deusen. She seizes it, getting a firm grip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Rennie JABS THE PEN BACKWARDS, SENDING THE SHARP INSTRUMENT THROUGH THE EYEHOLE OF HIS MASK. Jason instantly releases her, reeling backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sinks to the floor, scrambling on all fours to get as far away from the porthole as possible. She makes it across the room to her stateroom door just as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is SLAMMED OPEN FROM THE OTHER SIDE. She shrieks in terror but it's SEAN who is standing there.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rennie...??

<RENNIE>

</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Sean rushes to the shattered porthole, looking out, seeing nothing. He steps back to her.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand what is happening to me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
She breaks down; he holds her.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gonna be okay...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...but Sean couldn't be more wrong. The flames are lapping at the fuel pump and hoses, furiously burning down into the tank. A second later the whole thing EXPLODES IN A BALL OF FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHIP HULL - UNDERWATER (EFX/MODEL?)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as a huge HOLE is blown through the thick steel hull:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ship noticeably rocks from the explosion. Rennie clings to him fearfully.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it??
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
One second later, the lights begin to flicker.

	<DIALOGUE>
	The power room...

<DIRECTION>
INT. POWER ROOM - SAME TIME (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as huge amounts of water rush in from a gaping hole in the hull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHIP KITCHEN - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the overhead lights flicker over McCulloch. There's some fear mixed with the anger as he grips his flare gun, moving onward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PONT OF VIEW FROM KITCHEN OVENS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone is crouched behind a massive convection oven, spying on McCulloch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MCCULLOCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
almost flinches when the lights die and he's plunged into blackness. He moves forward, every step tentative. He passes the convection ovens and we REMAIN on them, spotting the frightened face of the DECK HAND in the shadows. The deranged old man is very sober now, clutching a LARGE KITCHEN KNIFE for defense.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME

<DIRECTION>
Sean paces feverishly in the blackness of her room, trying to think, talking to himself.

</SEAN>
<RENNIE>

</RENNIE>

He returns to Rennie, the panic settling back in.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Her ultimate fear is staring her straight in the face. Suddenly the dim blue lights flicker on.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The emergency lights just kicked in...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Sean makes Rennie look into his eyes. His words are meant to convince himself as much as Rennie.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody wait right here until I come back with the others -- understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>

INT. ENGINE ROOM - SAME TIME (EFX)

Sea water is pouring into the ship's motors. Clouds of steam and black smoke fill the room as the engine bearings begin to GRIND.

	Rennie??
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
MCCULLOCH'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is empty, shards of the porthole glass scattered across her rug. He steps over to it, bringing his head up to the gaping hole, peering outside. We wait for his attack...but it doesn't come. McCulloch's eyes take us to something across the room. The bathroom door is afar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MCCULLOCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
cautiously steps up to the door, silently grabbing the knob and SWINGING IT OPEN. It's empty. He hears something, spinning around. Again, nothing is there. McCulloch quickly moves to the telephone and dials. A few seconds pass.

<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, answer!!

TIGHT on the bridge telephone, ringing repeatedly. RISE TO FIND JASON, ignoring the phone, scrutinizing the deck below through rain-streaked windows.

JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miss Van Deusen is darting across the deck, gathering up a trio of terrified seniors.

Jason methodically moves to the bank of switches, studying them.

In large, unmistakable letters over a red button are the words "ABANDON SHIP ALARM." He flips back the plastic safety cover, exposing the button.

INT. BOWELS OF SHIP - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A horrible grinding sound echoes through the narrow corridor. Sean and Rennie appear at the opposite end, coughing on the black smoke which clouds their passageway. Sean looks down, seeing that they are standing in a puddle of water.

...and a WALL OF WATER ENGULFS.RENNIE AND SEAN, KNOCKING THEM DOWN. Sean fights to pull her up, but not in time for her to witness:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAYNE'S CHARRED CORPSE (EFX)

which bobs up in front of her. Rennie cries out, scrambling to grab onto Sean as what's left of Wayne's body washes past them.

INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

One of the students screams, the others clinging together upon the sight of this infamous monster. But the boat is already over the edge, past the point of return. And lowering at a snail's pace.

<DIRECTION>
MISS VAN DEUSEN

MISS VAN DEUSEN

<DIRECTION>
MISS VAN DEUSEN'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--knocking down deck tables, chairs and chaise lounges as she flees. The creative writing teacher swerves around a column, heading for an interior door, sliding to a stop as it BANGS OPEN IN FRONT OF HER. McCulloch steps outside, carrying Rennie, with Sean right behind her. Rennie is conscious now, squirming free of her uncle upon the sight of Miss Van Deusen.

A PRIMAL SCREAM OF AGONY immediately cries out behind them, the words unintelligible. They turn around to witness THE DECK HANG STAGGERING TOWARDS THEM, GRIPPING THE KITCHEN KNIFE.

MCCULLOCH

<DIRECTION>
raises the flare gun with zero hesitation and FIRES IT...
</DIRECTION>

	It's the only way, Rennie. Let's get in the boat now, okay? Please...for me?

Rennie finds herself nodding. Miss Van Deusen helps the trembling girl up the steps, an angered McCulloch right behind.

as Sean jabs it and the hoist motor kicks in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHIP - WIDE SHOT (EFX)

just as a huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING cracks over the smoke stack and upper deck. JASON steps out from behind it, gaping down on them with frightening omnipresence. Gripping the bloody axe.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sean climbs in the boat as it continues to lower. He takes one look back at the ship and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rapidly moving down the staircase towards them. Sean's view is CUT OFF as the lifeboat sinks below deck level.

JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

trampling towards the hoist, about thirty feet away now. The boat has already disappeared over the edge.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. SHIP/STORMY SEA - NIGHT (TANK)

as the lifeboat continues to lower, about ten feet from making contact with the tumultuous ocean. The ship's hull is crooked and sinking.

...and the hoist cable falls limply over them. Jason's too late. Sean looks up and sees:

<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
standing by the hoist, hovering over the edge. Very angry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEAN (TANK)

<DIRECTION>
grabs an oar, turning back to McCulloch.

<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Start rowing!!

McCulloch takes the oar as Miss Van Deusen holds onto Rennie tightly, the girl's eyes squeezed shut. Sean looks up at the ship again, and:

SEAN'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason is none.

Sean breathes with some relief, resuming his rowing with McCulloch. They get about three strokes apiece before:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DARK FIGURE (TANK)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lunges from under the ocean surface, grabbing onto Sean. Everybody SCREAMS...but it's JULIUS, gasping for oxygen, spitting up seawater. Sean pulls him over the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Julius!

The ship is gone now, the lifeboat a speck in the ocean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIFEBOAT - DAY (OCEAN?)
</DIRECTION>

The water is less rough now, the rain replaced with fog. Julius has taken McCulloch's place behind an oar; McCulloch is flanking his shivering niece with Miss Van Deusen.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know where we are, Sean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_VAN_DEUSEN>
<DIRECTION>
Sean pauses, utterly exhausted. He thinks for a moment, remembering his father's gift. Sean reaches into his coat pocket, removing the pocket navigational calculator. He stares at it long and hard. Julius looks over at him, seeing that Sean is on the verge of tears. He grips his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey man, if I can make it, so can. you.

Sean slowly nods, turning on the calculator.

INT. LIFEBOAT - NIGHT (TANK)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McCulloch, Rennie and Miss Van Deusen are asleep, Sean and Julius rowing on sheer will power. Sean takes one more stroke, feels himself passing out, then regains his coherence again. Julius glances off the side of the ship for no particular reason, then does a doubletake.
</DIRECTION>

JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW (SECOND UNIT - N.Y.)

<DIRECTION>
They are rowing right past THE STATUE OF LIBERTY, illuminated in all its glory.

Julius feels his eyes widening and a huge smile taking control of his haggard face. He tugs on Sean's sleeve, his eyes never leaving the monument.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey man, wake up! Check it out!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIUS>
<DIRECTION>
The other stir as well, opening their eyes, not sure if it's some kind of vision or if they are genuinely here.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God damn, we're in New York! You did it, my man!!
	</DIALOGUE>

Julius howls with delight, Miss Van Deusen hugging Rennie as Julius gives Sean the high-five. Toby barks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE SHOT - NEW YORK HARBOR - NIGHT (SECOND UNIT - N.Y.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the lifeboat rows toward the very famous skyline of Manhattan, twinkling in the near distance. We can hear the faint sound of Julius singing "New York, New York," relieved to be alive. They're going to make it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EMPTY OCEAN - ANOTHER ANGLE (TANK)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the sound of Julius' voice grows fainter. The water begins to ripple...then the top half of a HOCKEY MASK BREAKS THE SURFACE FOR A BREATH OF AIR, SINKING AGAIN. And swimming onward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CANNERY HARBOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Julius and Sean row the lifeboat up to a narrow barge beneath deserted dock warehouses. They are not in the safest part of town by a longshot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ANGLE

as they climb onto the barge. Rennie breathes with relief as she steps off the boat. She takes a final glance back at it and sees:

flailing her arms in the water right next to the lifeboat, drowning.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_RENNIE>

He's the first one up. Sean looks at Rennie, concerned, then hoists Toby up in his arms. They all begin climbing the ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON LADDER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the last pair of feet disappear over the top edge of the dock. Camera PANS back down the rungs, finding the lifeboat and barge again. Suddenly JASON SPRINGS FROM THE WATER, CLIMBING ONTO THE BARGE. He gazes up at his new surroundings, quite different from all the years he's spent at Crystal Lake. But an item at the far end of the dock causes him the longest pause...

Sean has no choice but to freeze. Julius flexes his fists, but he too has Gang Banger #2's gun leveled on him. McCulloch stares at the thugs with obvious contempt. It doesn't go unnoticed.

McCulloch offers some rare silence, shaking a "no" to the gun-toting kid. Rennie's dog-begins to growl, backing away, ready to defend her. Gang Banger #1 points his barrel at Toby with zero conscience, cocking back the hammer.

PAN AROUND with them as they walk through a thick blanket of STEAM which pours out of a factory vent.

Jason is standing right behind him, shoving something into his back, out of frame. He thrusts it again, bringing with it one more horrific grunt from the kid. Jason goes for number three and:

Jason's syringe gets shoved completely through him, the needle sticking out his front side.

opens her eyes, looking into the dead boy's face as blood drips from his mouth. He collapses in front of her, giving way to a view of JASON TOWERING OVER HER. At the same time:

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shoves Gang Banger #1 off of her as Jason returns his attention to her. She grabs a loose brick and FLINGS IT AT HIM, CRACKING HIS HOCKEY MASK, momentarily disorienting him. Rennie sprints away.

<DIRECTION>
Like a cat watching a bird, we watch Julius head for the booth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JULIUS

<DIRECTION>
slams open the booth door, grabbing the receiver, punching the "operator" digit. SLOWLY PUSH IN on him as he waits for an answer. Several more rings.

Finally a click and muffled words from the operator.

	Get me the police -- this is an emergency...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIUS>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH! as JASON'S FIST CRASHES THROUGH THE BOOTH WINDOW, GRABBING JULIUS BY THE THROAT. Julius grips Jason's scaly arm with all his strength, staring at the cracked hockey mask framed in the shattered window. Julius summons all his strength, tearing free of Jason's grasp and running out the door. The phone is left dangling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUNNING WITH JULIUS (HAND HELD)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
with no apparent direction. Literally running for his life.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Julius soon learns the awful truth that the only way up is the only way down...with the exception of a head- splitting freefall. No way is he gonna jump. Julius turns back to Jason, raising his fists, psyching himself up for the fight of his life. He whispers to himself:
</DIRECTION>
<JULIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Use the combos and keep the feet light...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIUS>
<DIRECTION>
THE FIGHT BEGINS, man against monster, each sizing the other up. Jason takes the first swing, Julius deftly dodging him and countering with left-right-left combination. They have absolutely no effect. Julius follows up with a round of kidney punches. Again, nothing. Julius finds himself being forced back against the rings, which in this case is the edge of the roof. He risks a glance backwards and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a long, rough way down. It's do or die time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RETURN TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Julius SLAMS PUNCH AFTER PUNCH INTO JASON, forcing him back to the center of the rooftop, spending every last ounce of his energy in doing so. He throws one more feeble punch, knowing it's his last.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take your best shot, motherfucker...

</JULIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Jason gladly obliges, winding up and recoiling with a punch none of us expected...

She moves forward, the only sound being her shoes against wet asphalt. Four more steps, then a DARK, OUT OF FOCUS FIGURE STEPS OUT BEHIND HER WITH A GUN.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freeze.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
RACK FOCUS to find a uniformed IRISH COP standing there, service revolver raised. McCulloch steps out from the alcove as well, recognizing Miss Van Deusen.

<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay -- she's with me.

</MCCULLOCH>

She turns around, lowering her hands, utterly relieved.

They head through an ABANDONED PARKING LOT towards a concrete wall with stairs; about six feet above the wall is an upper street, where his patrol car is parked. They get halfway through the lot when they hear:

But Rennie goes to Miss Van Deusen instead. It's a bitter pill for McCulloch.

The others stare at McCulloch angrily. Miss Van Deusen turns to the confused policeman.

parked above the abandoned garage, the interior dark. The Cop and our heroes appear in the background, coming towards it.

	You're right -- I find it a tall tale indeed. But you seem like honest folks so I'm inclined to believe at least some of it.

ADJUST INTO A FULL SHOT OF THE BACK DOOR AS HE SWINGS IT OPEN...but even in this darkness, we see that it's empty. They climb in. The Cop opens his drivers door, and...

reacting to their terror, seeing Julius' head, quickly grabbing the radio mike. But he has no time for a message because JASON REACHES UP FROM THE PARKING LOT PIT BELOW, GRABBING THE COP'S ANKLE, DRAGGING HIM DOWN. The radio is still in his grasp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - DISPATCH RADIO (SECOND UNIT)

The foursome instantly try to flee the car, but police cars have no door handles in the back.

<DIRECTION>
Cocaine flowing through her veins, Rennie acts hyperkinetically, scratching her way over the seats just as:

JASON

<DIRECTION>
appears at the parking lot stairs, STALKING STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE CAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

There is no time for escape. Rennie finds the ignition and fires it up, jamming it into drive and STOMPING ON THE ACCELERATOR. Julius' head rolls off the dash, onto the floorboards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her vision is still a stoned one but clear enough to set her target. We come straight at the abominable creature and:

<DIRECTION>
WHAM! (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason is mowed down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>

slams on the brakes, jerks it into reverse and FLOORS IT AGAIN.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the automobile grinds back over him a second time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE

stomps on the brake pedal and the tires SCREECH TO A HALT. They all take a moment to catch their breath, looking out the front window...

THEIR POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason lies dead on the asphalt. For about two seconds. He SLOWLY STANDS.

desperately throws it into forward again, gripping the wheel and RACING FORWARD.

Rennie is almost maniacal now, her knuckles white around the vinyl wheel, her foot practically mashed through the floorboard.

She doesn't hear him, or anything for that matter. Her eyes remain straight ahead, never blinking.

<DIRECTION>
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a FIGURE standing in the distance. But it looks too small to be Jason. We RUSH TOWARDS IT, CHANGING INTO SLOW MOTION JUST BEFORE IMPACT. The figure is a dripping wet boy with a sinister smile. YOUNG JASON.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRICK WALL - A SPLIT SECOND LATER (EFX)

<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>

as the front passenger door is shoved open by Sean, who drags out Rennie. McCulloch follows close behind, helping Sean carry her away from the wreckage, over by a row of old oil drums filled with slime and rainwater. Then it suddenly hits Sean...

<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Van Deusen...

</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
He takes two steps back to the car when:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM! (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The squad car interior is ENGULFED IN A BALL OF FLAMES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
opens her dazed eyes, seeing Miss Van Deusen's body charring inside the wreckage. It's incomprehensible. She numbly gets to her feet, stepping towards it. Something makes her hesitate: she peers down at the asphalt...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ASPHALT - RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pool of gasoline has collected, flames dancing across its glassy surface. Suddenly a TINY ROWBOAT DISSOLVES IN, not unlike the lifeboat she was so afraid of. The rowboat glides across the surface of the burning gasoline, TWO PEOPLE RIDING IN IT. The flames and asphalt SLOWLY FADE OUT AND GIVE WAY TO A SERENE LAKE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE'S FLASHBACK - CRYSTAL LAKE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shimmering water, clouds and pine trees reflected in it. The rowboat floats into view. The two occupants are YOUNG RENNIE and MCCULLOCH. She's wearing a bathing suit and an innocent smile. And not an inkling of fear about the water. She stands, letting the sun soak into her.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a beautiful day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_RENNIE>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
She frowns at him, looking away.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<YOUNG_RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
She bends over, splashing the water.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what you said last year. I think the time for your first swimming lesson has just come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
The splashing stops.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want to end up drowning like that Voorhees boy, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
She's instantly tense.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<YOUNG_RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_RENNIE>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<YOUNG_RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're telling a lie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_RENNIE>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I? Let's find out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
...And quicker than she's able to react to it, MCCULLOCH PUSHES HER OVERBOARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPLASH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Rennie's body violently disrupts the calm surface. She immediately begins to flounder. McCulloch calmly leans over the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better swim before Jason drags you down, Rennie. Come on, you can do it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
...but Rennie thrashes in the water, struggling to keep from sinking under the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her uncle's face blurs and clears as water splashes her eyes.

</YOUNG_RENNIE>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!

</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is too panicked to obey.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hhhhelp...me....
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
She coughs on some water then disappears...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER (TANK)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The world above her ceases to exist, murky lake water taking over. Rennie looks-down, and to her horror...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (TANK)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young Jason is grabbing her ankle and dragging her down. The whole image BURSTS INTO FLAMES and we:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ASPHALT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the gasoline continues to burn, the rowboat gone. ADJUST to find RENNIE'S FACE, the flames of the car wreckage flickering over her glassy eyes. She looks up at Miss Van Deusen's body one last time before:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - SQUAD CAR (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The auto's fuel tank EXPLODES, SHRAPNEL FLYING EVERYWHERE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY #4 - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up at her uncle with knowing eyes. Eyes that tell him she's remembered everything.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You pushed me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
(defensively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Rennie just stares, incredulous.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You son of a bitch...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
She lets it build until she's ready to explode...then:
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was down there!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
And Rennie runs off. McCulloch starts to follow but Sean grabs him, shoving him down.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You keep away from her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Sean chases after Rennie. Camera methodically PANS BACK TO MCCULLOCH, crumpled on the ground. A very bitter man. He wipes his hands, getting ready to stand when THE SHADOW FALLS OVER HIM. His skin fades to porcelain white.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCULLOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You...are...NOT POSSIBLE.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCULLOCH>
<DIRECTION>
But possible, and actual, he is. A PAIR OF ROTTED ARMS EXTEND DOWN, RIPPING HIM OUT OF FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING WITH JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the walking corpse lifts a screaming McCulloch over his head, carrying him over to one of the scum-filled OIL DRUMS, SHOVING HIM HEAD-FIRST INTO IT. Jason grips McCulloch's thrashing legs as bubbles rise to the surface of the slime, a pathetic gurgling reverberating out the drum. At last McCulloch's appendages go limp. Jason releases him, moving on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY #5 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Sean runs into view, glancing around, spotting Rennie, crouched against a crumbled brick wall. No tears...only hate. Sean sits down next to her. After several moments...
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was at school when they told me. 'Rennie, we have some very bad news... your parents have been killed in an auto accident.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Sean gently takes her hand, sharing her internal agony.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It seems like everybody I care about ends up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
She can't finish. PUSH IN as Sean kisses her on the forehead, then makes her look into his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
He caresses her face; it develops into a tender kiss. Finally she holds him back, letting it out. At the same time:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STALKING POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somebody is creeping at a low angle towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEAN AND RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
are lost in their shared quiet moment...until the GROWLING SOUND becomes audible. They look up, seeing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
cautiously approaching them. Rennie stands, absolutely relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Toby...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to move towards him and her dog SNARLS VICIOUSLY, CROUCHING BACK IN FEAR.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong, boy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Another protective growl, then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Jason stampedes through a stack of crates and garbage cans behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEAN, RENNIE AND TOBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
abruptly flee down the alley, Jason in mad pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY/SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Rennie, Sean and the dog run straight towards us, Jason swiftly catching up. FAST TRACK WITH THEM over to a deserted, rain-slicked SUBWAY ENTRANCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they bang through the glass doors, sailing past us. Three beats later, JASON APPEARS, not bothering to open the door, STAMPEDING RIGHT THROUGH THE GLASS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBWAY STATION - ESCALATORS (N.Y.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sean, Rennie and Toby sail down the escalators past a few scattered COMMUTERS. Again, Jason appears, looming tall at the top. He starts down the "up" escalator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (ICY.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as an ELDERLY COUPLE rises toward us. Their reactions grow more bleak the closer we get, finally registering terror as we plow right through them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - SUBWAY TURNSTILES (ICY.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sean and Rennie hop over a metal turnstile, Toby crawling under it. A TICKET TAKER leans out his window, shouting at them.
</DIRECTION>
<TICKET_TAKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TICKET_TAKER>
<DIRECTION>
The teenagers are soon forgotten as JASON SMASHES THROUGH THE TURNSTILE LIKE THE TERMINATOR, TEARING THE ALUMINUM WHEEL RIGHT OFF ITS BASE. The Ticket Taker reacts speechlessly, deciding not to press his luck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Sean and Rennie slide up to the edge of the track pit, SEEING THE LIGHTS OF AN APPROACHING TRAIN which is taking too long to get there.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
...but Jason arrives before the train. Toby barks and snarls, trying to protect them. Jason is unfazed. He treads toward them and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOG TOBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leaps onto Jason, sinking his teeth into the monster's throat. Jason wrestles the animal into submission just as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SUBWAY TRAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
streaks into the station. A fraction of time later:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
heaves the dog in front of the train.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shrieks in horror as Toby disappears inside the pit just as the train roars by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - ONLOOKERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're New Yorkers, but not callous enough to stomach this, quickly scattering. Even a group of severe SKINHEADS decide they can wait for the next train, quickly heading up the escalators after seeing Jason in action.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
makes Rennie look away, dragging her with him along the platform edge in retreat as Jason returns his attention to them. They reach the end of the platform, having no choice but to board the front car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBWAY TRAIN (N.Y.)

<TRAIN_ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey pal, you can't do that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAIN_ENGINEER>

A second later he's gotten a good look at Jason. It's too late for a retraction as JASON SAVAGELY JAMS HIS HEAD INTO THE TRAIN CONSOLE.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT (N.Y.)

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (N.Y.)

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the train rapidly speeds past us, showing no signs of slowing down.

<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - FINAL CAR (N.Y.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Sean and Rennie come through another set of separating doors, rushing through... finding they're in the last car. They look back, seeing Jason enter at the opposite end. The monster stalks forward. Sean's eyes dart around. He spots the EMERGENCY STOP CORD. HE LEAPS FOR IT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and the train SCREECHES TO A HALT.
</DIRECTION>

The sudden stop throws Jason on his back. Sean throws the rear door open, jumping out with Rennie.
</DIRECTION>

as Sean and Rennie sprint down the center of the tracks toward the light of the next station, running out of strength.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TIMES SQUARE STATION - NIGHT (N.Y.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they emerge from the darkness, up to the edge of the pit. Sean boosts Rennie up, starting to climb up himself when:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
fires out from the tunnel, grabbing onto Sean's ankle. Rennie screams as Sean is dragged down...but he manages to latch onto a chain securing a garbage receptacle. Jason pulls harder, stretching Sean to his limit as Rennie watches helplessly.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO!!!

</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
runs straight towards the track pit like a football punter, RECOILING WITH HER RIGHT LEG, KICKING JASON SQUARELY IN THE FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
trips backwards and LANDS ON THE THIRD, ELECTRIFIED RAIL, RECEIVING TEN THOUSAND VOLTS. His body smokes and convulses, finally sizzling out. He appears to be terminated!!!

<DIRECTION>
as our heroes arise into the neon-filled big city wonderland, relieved to be alive, gazing around at the awesome spectacle known as Times Square. A huge DIGITAL CLOCK tells us it's a quarter to midnight. Sean wraps his arm around her.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's over, Rennie. It's finally over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Camera RISES ABOVE THEM, RACKING BACK TO THE SUBWAY EXIT. Guess who has just made an encore...with more energy than ever!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEAN AND RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
look all around them, having never been to a city as big as this. They finally turn far enough around to spot JASON in a series of three quick cuts, each one closer than the last.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God...please no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
But Jason keeps on coming.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody help us!! He's going to kill us!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
But the heavy Times Square foot traffic ignores her, bustling onward. Rennie and Sean have no choice but to flee again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shoves his way through the preoccupied pedestrians; they've certainly seen weirder characters than him here. He moves past a group of STREET URCHINS listening to some rap from their ghetto blaster. His foot obliterates their stereo system with one stride. They instantly pull out switchblades and chains.
</DIRECTION>
<STREET_URCHIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're dead meat, slime bag.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STREET_URCHIN>
<DIRECTION>
Jason stops, turning around, towering over the kids. He has blood and gore caked everywhere, his skin charred from the electrocution. Jason starts to remove his mask, facing them squarely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON STREET URCHINS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Jason's mask comes off out-of-frame. Their tough faces turn to putty, scared completely shitless.
</DIRECTION>
<STREET_URCHIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey man, it's cool, it's cool...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STREET_URCHIN>
<DIRECTION>
They turn tail and race like the wind. Jason steps forward so that we're looking at the back of his head, never seeing his naked face. He slips his hockey mask on again, turns into a CLOSE UP, then exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TIMES SQUARE DINER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
filled with noise, smoke and derelicts. A tough, redheaded WAITRESS with a thick Brooklyn accent stands behind the countertop, a wall of mirrors behind her. The front door bangs open with the entrance of Sean and Rennie, rushing up to the waitress.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(out of breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to call the police...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, hurry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
A telephone sits right next to her, but this is New York.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a pay phone in back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
They start to run.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...but it's broken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't understand -- there's a maniac trying to kill us!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
(blase)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to New York.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
There's no time for further response as JASON CRASHES THROUGH THE DINER DOOR, MOWING A PATH STRAIGHT TOWARDS THEM. Sean and Rennie run out the back as the Waitress eyes Jason with complete disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the BURLY CHEF comes out to confront him. Jason FLINGS HIM HEAD FIRST INTO THE JUKEBOX.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WAITRESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
picks up the telephone, really pissed off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BIKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
climbs off his counter stool, revealing a HUGE BOWIE KNIFE. Jason plows straight for him and the Biker STABS JASON IN THE HEART. Jason has little reaction, pulling it out, tossing it aside. The Biker's face goes wan, backing away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WAITRESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stops in mid-dial. Fear is starting to register now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lifts the very large man and EFFORTLESSLY HEAVES HIM INTO THE MIRROR OVER THE COUNTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WAITRESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
feels the phone receiver slipping from her grasp, her mouth trembling. She backs away from the beast as far as she can. Jason has no time to waste on her, trampling out the back after Rennie and Sean as the other patrons shrink from him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REAR OF DINER - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Sean fumbles to unlock three deadbolts and two chains, finally getting the back door open and springing into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DEAD END ALLEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They run about ten yards before realizing the alley is a dead end. Sean and Rennie start to head back the other way when JASON MOWS OUT FROM THE DINER DOOR. Their vision scatters everywhere in search of a retreat...
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
She's spotted a MANHOLE COVER, slightly ajar. They haven't the luxury of thinking about it, Sean sliding the cover back as Jason comes forth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SEWER - ENTRANCE CHAMBER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they descend into hell...a massive chamber consisting of tall columns, slimy catacombs and three feet of stagnant water. Their alternatives are nil; Sean and Rennie join hands, wading through the swill, splashing deeper into the labyrinth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE UP STAIRS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the dim streetlight glowing in the above world is eclipsed by JASON, making his way down after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL #1 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An oval tunnel slanted downward into pitch blackness. Dim overhead lights illuminate salt deposits and eery rust formations. Rennie and Sean appear at the far end, wading from the sewage as the tunnel rises toward us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they come forward at a brisk but cautious pace, strangers in a very strange land.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - THEIR FEET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sloshing through the slime. All is silent until Sean's foot TRIPS OVER A BARREL labeled HUGHES CHEMICAL PLANT. A vaporous green substance oozes out the rusty end of the container, sizzling on the around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEAN AND RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
carefully sidestep it, continuing on. They make it another ten yards when A FIGURE LEAPS OUT FROM AN ALCOVE, GRIPPING A HUGE WRENCH. Rennie's scream echoes through the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...but it's a middle-aged SANITATION ENGINEER who lowers the wrench, as frightened as they are.
</DIRECTION>
<SANITATION_ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you kids doing down here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANITATION_ENGINEER>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you help us get out??
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<SANITATION_ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sure can and we don't have a minute to waste.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANITATION_ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
He begins quickly packing up his tools.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<SANITATION_ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Toxic waste, son. This sewer floods out with the stuff on the 13th of every month, right at midnight.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(checks watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's less than ten minutes from now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANITATION_ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
Rennie looks down the dark tunnels in all directions, swallowing hard.
</DIRECTION>
<SANITATION_ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Follow me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANITATION_ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
He clicks on his high powered flashlight and quickly leads them down:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL #2
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...no less threatening than the one they just left. When they pass a lightless intersecting corridor, JASON EJECTS HIMSELF FROM IT, TACKLING THE SANITATION ENGINEER AND SEAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FLASHLIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rolls through the muck, its beam splashing erratically across the polluted walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SANITATION ENGINEER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
begins BASHING JASON'S HEAD IN WITH HIS WRENCH but the monster drags the kicking and screaming man into TUNNEL #3.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
tries to help up Sean but he's been knocked into the opposite wall, barely conscious.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run, Rennie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
She's struck with indecisive shock, looking into Tunnel #3, seeing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GRUESOME SHADOW ON THE WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason arches his back with wrench in hand, hammering it over and over into the Sanitation Engineer's skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
backs away but does not run. The time has come to face her fears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - SHADOW ON TUNNEL #3 WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Jason takes one more vengeful stroke, finishing him off. He steps from Tunnel #3 with the scarlet-coated tool, his shadow becoming flesh. He moves straight for Sean, who has no hope for escape. Jason cocks the wrench over Sean's skull...and suddenly his hockey mask is SPLASHED WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT. Jason stops, turning directly into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rennie is blinding us with the sanitation Engineer's flashlight, giving us only brief glimpses of herself in the reflective wet surroundings.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never got me in the lake, Jason. And you're not going to get me now either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Her voice is defiant. She carefully backstops, the irritating light never leaving us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has been sufficiently taunted. He moves after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the bright beam leaves our eyes, Rennie dashing down the intersecting tunnel (#1).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON JASON'S FEET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stomping through the sludge, picking up speed. He's wanted to kill Rennie most of all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL #L
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Rennie dashes up to the HUGHES CHEMICAL DRUM Sean tripped over, using the back end of the flashlight to crush in the can's rusted lid. The metal is flimsy but still resists her blows. She frantically hammers harder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL #2 - TRACKING WITH JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's moving like a freight train now, an addict rolling after his fix.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - CHEMICAL DRUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the butt of the flashlight dents the metal, ultimately causing it to cave in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL INTERSECTION - JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--Looking through his unblinking eyes, whipping into Tunnel #1...where we catch a fleeting glimpse of Rennie flinging the contents of the oil drum. A half second later a WAVE OF GRAY/GREEN LIQUID FLIES AT US...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON JASON (SLOW MOTION)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and his hockey mask is SPLASHED WITH TOXIC WASTE, SEEPING INTO HIS MASK'S EYE SLITS. He careens back as if her were a rabid dog receiving a load of point-blank buckshot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
drops the can, fumbling for the flashlight again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - JASON (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the radiant flashlight beam finds his mask, the plastic beginning to bubble and melt. RUSH INTO A TIGHT CLOSE UP AS JASON TEARS OFF HIS MASK, EXPOSING HIS HIDEOUS FACE: rotted flesh, some of it sizzling from the chemical. Worms slithering out his nostrils. And his eyes...or lack thereof. They're like two raw quail eggs frying in liquid green pollutant...and the yolks just broke, running down his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON FLASHLIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the beam begins to waver in her quivering grasp. RISE TO FIND RENNIE'S FACE, reacting to the stomach-turning sight of Jason's visage. She grabs hold of her senses and RUNS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Rennie skirts past the blinded creature: WHIP PAN WITH HER as she turns down Tunnel #2, heading back toward Sean. CONTINUE TO QUICKLY PAN AROUND until we've come around 360 degrees and are back on JASON, in no way ready to give up. He staggers after Rennie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL #2
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Rennie skids up to Sean, still dazed. She grabs him, shaking hard.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get up, Sean!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes blink, only half coherent. Then an inconceivable terror registers in her ears...A LOW, DEEP RUMBLING SOUND, COMING FROM UP AHEAD. Her head jerks in the direction of her planned retreat:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ominously empty tunnel, soon to be filled with the unthinkable. The sound of RUSHING LIQUID is growing at leaps and bounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as her trembling chin rises, looking at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - TUNNEL #3 CEILING (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dim overhead lights are beginning to vibrate from the approaching flood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rotates her head and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
vision or no vision, he is lurching towards her relentlessly. She is literally sandwiched between hell and high water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
drags Sean to his feet with the strength of a possessed woman, pulling him over to a SERVICE LADDER attached to the intersecting alcove wall.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Climb!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
She shoves him up it from below, Sean summoning everything he's got to obey her. Rennie shoots a stare back down the tunnel...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The overhead lights are banging around like an earthquake has just hit; the liquid will be arriving any second. Her vision WHIP PANS 180 DEGREES TO FIND JASON APPROACHING FROM THE OPPOSITE END, groping around with his scaly arms like the claws of a roto-tiller.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - LADDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Rennie starts up after Sean, looking down and seeing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
within ten feet of them, shifting directly for the ladder like he's working on some kind of radar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slips on the rusty ladder, regaining her footing. and rushing higher. She takes her final glance into the tunnel, the ultimate horror registering in her corneas as she sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A million gallons of green-brown toxic waste splash into the far intersection, FILLING THE TUNNEL, FLOODING STRAIGHT FOR CAMERA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has just started to climb the ladder when the wind and smell of the rushing toxic waste bombards him. His decomposed head swivels to face:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tons of lethal sewage, stopping for no one. Arriving in seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON'S FINAL CLOSE UP (EFX/FIBER OPTIC LENS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't need vision to confirm what his other senses already know. Jason's mouth begins to quaver...AND THE FIRST WORDS HE HAS EVER SPOKEN COME OUT, IN THE VOICE OF AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY:
</DIRECTION>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmmmmmmmommy...DON'T LET ME DROWN, MOMMY...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JASON>
<DIRECTION>
Camera speeds toward his gaping mouth and DOWN HIS THROAT as lightning arcs off his mucous covered insides. We sink deeper into his guts, fire and smoke flaring into our eves, eventually coming to a WELL IN THE PIT OF HIS STOMACH, FILLED WITH BLOOD...and EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON IS DROWNING IN IT.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hhhhelp me....
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_JASON>
<DIRECTION>
A split second later:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TUNNEL #3 (EFX) (SLOW MOTION)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wall of deadly toxic liquid ENGULFS JASON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL #3 - ON RENNIE AND SEAN (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The powerful flood thrashes the ladder about two inches below Rennie's feet, the force of it fiercely shaking their rusty support. They are clinging to the ladder with their eyes squeezed shut. Praying for survival.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are drowning in a chunky cloud of sewage, rushing over and under us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The digital clock we saw earlier abruptly CHIMES MIDNIGHT, HUGE BOLTS OF LIGHTNING CRACKING OVER MANHATTAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the sewage level begins to drop. Rennie opens her eyes, glancing straight down and seeing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ladder beneath them reappears...which gives way to a PAIR OF HANDS GRIPPING THE BOTTOM RUNG. The liquid drops further, unshrouding the now-dead corpse of EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON. He's a relatively normal looking boy, probably the way he looked back in 1957...right when he drowned in Crystal Lake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason Voorhees has finally been put to rest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (N.Y.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rennie and Sean stagger out from a side street, holding each other up...relief etched in their matured faces.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hear there's a statue here that's 22 stories tall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Rennie would smile if she could. She kisses his cheek. They amble on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STALKING POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...coming out from another alley, creeping up behind them through a crowd of pedestrians. About the height of a small child.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENNIE AND SEAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
walk arm in arm, exhausted and oblivious to their pursuer. But something, some innate perception causes Rennie to slow...and stop. Her eyes register a horrid fear and she WHIPS AROUND TO FACE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOBY!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Limping on all fours, filthy with grease-matted fur. The whimpering dog crawls up to her, Rennie bending down, hugging her animal like she'll never let go.
</DIRECTION>
<RENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Toby...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH ANGLE CRANE SHOT (N.Y.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Sean bends down too, ruffling the dog's fur, standing again with Rennie. The three survivors enter the collage of pedestrians, bright lights and skyscrapers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is finally over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
