FADE IN:

We are in the belly of a wave. Light refracts in a constant collision of water. SLOW MOTION, the hallucinatory prisms, like liquid diamonds taking flight, dreamlike...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OCEAN - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Backlit against a flaming sun a solitary SURFER glides across the green glassy peak. TIME IS STRETCHED until his movements gain a grace and fluidity not of this world. Total Zen concentration. Body weight centered, eyes forward and on the next section.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. URBAN STREET - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW MOTION ON a black sedan. Creeping along store fronts. Past a Winchell's. PEOPLE splash steps down rain-washed sidewalks in DREAM MOTION. The sedan turns past the FIRST VIRGINIA BANK and into an alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BLACK SEDAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO MEN and ONE WOMAN in SUSPENDED TIME put on overcoats and hats. Under their hats strips of Scotch tape stretch taut from the base of their nose to their forehead, hideously distorting their features. Makes them look like human PIGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OCEAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SILVERY in this light, almost metallic, as if from some future-scape. The lone surfer SHREDS a long, endless right wall. ACCELERATING INTO REAL TIME -- as he stares into the pit, digs in, drops into the sweet spot on the wave, hunkers down. His moves becoming aggressive, frenzied--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BLACK SEDAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An M-16 clip is SMACKED into place and cocked with a CACHACK! Ammo clips are SNICK-SNICKED into handgun butts and a long clip is SSSNICKED into an UZI. Watches are checked. The PIG NOSE people nod to each other.

Pig Nose #1, steals into position near the glass doors, slams his back to the wall, weapon to cheek, breath fast.

EXT. OCEAN

<DIRECTION>
FAST NOW -- the surfboard rips a brutal gash in the face of the wave. The surfer TRIMS down the line, pivoting the board and going straight down, CARVING the bottom. He slashes viciously back toward the lip and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a radical INVERTED AIR ATTACK sails SIX feet above the wave in an explosion of water--

EXT. BANK WALL

<DIRECTION>
A MAN in his twenties. His head spins revealing rain- slicked hair and face, eyes wide, bright. An edgy handsomeness to him. He pops a stick of Wrigley's in his mouth, rests a shotgun on one leg and leans against the wall. He wears a headset... through which we hear the FBI guy yelling for him. This is JOHNNY UTAH.

EXT. FIRST VIRGINIA BANK

<DIRECTION>
The bandits burst through the doors and sprint to the alley where they jump into the SEDAN. THE DRIVER, the WOMAN PIG NOSE, punches it and the TIRES WHIRRR on the slick pavement. The sedan launches down the alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Utah running. Like a freight train. Splashing through a cross-alley. He doesn't break stride as he slams his shoulder into a large, steel GARBAGE DUMPSTER. DRIVING it like a football training sled into the ALLEY where--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SEDAN LOCKS 'EM UP seconds too late as it SKIDS and SLAMS into it, CRUNCHING into the brick wall and-- Still alive -- GRINDS into reverse back down the alley, HEADLIGHTS SMASHED, it guns it backward as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UTAH leaps over the dumpster and sprints after the car. He has a brick in his right hand. He cocks it back. Johnny HEAVES the brick thirty yards and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH! The brick EXPLODES into the windshield, SPIDERWEBBING the glass. Lady Pignose flinches from the glass fragments thrown into her face.
</DIRECTION>
<LADY_PIGNOSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son of a bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_PIGNOSE>
<DIRECTION>
The car slews backward onto the street, slamming a parked car. Lady Pignose slams the thing into DRIVE, cuts the wheel hard, and punches it, skidding on wet pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UTAH hurtles from the alley. He leaps, somehow TACKLES the DRIVER'S door handle and is dragged along the street. He pulls himself up, reaches inside the window, and whips the steering wheel hard right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SEDAN fishtails into a parked Toyota. Utah bounces forward, slamming into the asphalt. Glass shards and crushed steel are strewn everywhere, as radiator steam whistles hot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pig Nose #2, riding shotgun, is trapped. Can't get his crushed door open. The DRIVER pushes open her door. Gropes for her pistol. Utah springs -- no respect for a lady. He slams the door, pins her arm and slams again and again until the gun drops. Utah kicks it away as the woman collapses in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pig Nose #1 bails out and runs across parking lot. Utah leaps up onto the crushed hood and draws down with the shotgun.

	Halt. FBI!

</UTAH>
<DIRECTION>
Pig Nose #1 spins. We sense reckless anger. He raises the UZI. Utah squeezes the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No death. No blood. Just buzzers and flashing bulbs. Pig Nose's flak vest lights up like a pinball machine. Utah's laser weapon hit the "kill zone". Pig Nose rips the tape off his face and the FBI CADET shakes his head in disgust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OBSERVERS step forward. Bank customers. Bank tellers. All FBI personnel. MEDICAL STAFF offer the woman driver assistance. Pig Nose #1 heads for Johnny, but is subdued by other agents.

Utah turns to go. As he passes he casually raises his laser-shotgun and re-triggers Pig Nose's flak vest. LIGHTS AND BUZZERS. Pig Nose explodes. More agents restrain him. Screams and shoving matches and pissed off guys. Utah walks off, down the simulated street, past a sign which bears the FBI SEAL and reads "Combat Village, Quantico, Virginia."

UTAH holds the tip steady, gouges the face of a wave and squirts out the other side. Another wave rises and Utah glides up over the hump. He clears the swell and the ocean suddenly smooths out like a giant lake. Triumphant over having made the lineup, he sits up on the board, and falls over.
</DIRECTION>

PAPPAS slices a green apple, some feta cheese and eats off the knife.

UTAH climbs back on his board. WHISTLES and HOOTS sound as SURFERS spot a new swell. Utah watches as the regulars start catching rides. Suddenly he feels like a lost dog on a busy freeway. A young LOCAL in a neon wetsuit slashes past him, inches away.

Johnny paddles rapidly, ducks under. Sees another, bigger wave coming. Pissed off... at himself, at the downy-cheeked hotshots, at the frustration, he turns his board around and starts paddling hard. He somehow gets the soles of his feet in contact with the top of the board, then struggles up. He's standing -- sort of. Arms pinwheeling, he topples in a nasty crash... Right in front of a SHAVED-HEAD SURFER on full afterburner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny vanishes in an explosion of spray. His board SHOOTS OUT. It SMASHES SIDEWAYS INTO RAZORHEAD. The guy does an ugly endo. Utah comes up GASPING for air, arms flailing. His board, floating a few feet away, tugging at his ankle. He drapes his torso across the board and pants for breath. Razorhead, already back on his board, paddles over. Points to a small dent in the fiberglass.

Johnny dead asleep. Silence. Then BRRRRR!! He jacknifes up like he just took 20,000 volts. His eyes read panic. He rolls up, legs scissor against tangled sheets and he collapses over empty boxes.

EXT. OCEAN - DAWN

Deafening BOOM as a monster wave CRASHES below a sky the color of slate. A distant Pacific storm has brought the swell. 10 foot faces. Glassy, green walls the size of houses beckoning from beyond the soup.

A lone FIGURE bobbing out beyond the break. The surfer disappears behind the swell. Then REAPPEARS, grinning across the smooth offshore barrel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UTAH wearing a wetsuit stands beside his surfboard, craning forward to get a better look. The surfer is a WOMAN. She moves with liquid grace, in perfect harmony with the sea, long hair flying out behind her. She undulates like a dancer. Dipping, carving, slicing, making it look sooooo easy. Johnny shakes his head. Oh man, if she can do it...

He stands, grabs his board and heads out into the icy foam.

OCEAN BREAK A horizon of whitecaps churn behind him. He lies on his board, rising and dropping with the swell. So far so good. He spots a wave. A fluid gray-green house rising, forever rising. Utah turns. Paddles. The house catching him, lifting him high upon its roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Utah is committed. He gets to his feet as his board slices along the lip. He peers over the falls, down the face -- holy shit! -- it looks like Niagara. He loses balance and spirals airborne, falling bullseye into the IMPACT ZONE. The entire force of the wave crashing upon him, plunging him down into the--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WASHING MACHINE (UNDERWATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where he SPINS like a whirling dervish, LASHED to a slamdancing surfboard at the mercy of God. He is held prisoner in a grey-green churning nightmare, like a six-ton pit bull has him by the neck, shaking him. He looks around. Can't tell up from down. WHAM! His head slams into the bottom -- rocks and sand. Stunned, he struggles toward the light, finally bursting to the--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SURFACE. Gasping for breath. The good news is he's breathing, the bad news is he's surfaced in the impact zone. Another wave crashes down, stuffing him back into the washing machine. Leaving no sign of life in the white froth. The orangeade surfboard launches high into the sky, spinning like a misfiring Trident missile, trailing its broken leash like a kite tail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE WASHING MACHINE, Utah tumbles in a cold green hell. His chest is convulsing, needing air now. Suddenly a FIGURE lunges down INTO FRAME. A hand snatches a fistful of his hair and yanks him toward--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SURFACE. The WOMAN SURFER bursts through the foam. Grabs her board for leverage. Hauls Utah's head above the water with one strong arm. He is choking, coughing, slapping fatigued arms against the surf, panic registering in his movements.

The woman gets her board under one of his arms for support and sidekicks fiercely into the wave, holding him in a painful grip. With powerful strokes, she helps Utah make it to calmer water outside the break. The big waves, just forming up, lift them and drop them as they pass. Muted thunder when the waves hit the beach. She drags him half onto her surfboard. Practically slamming his face into the board. He's coughing out saltwater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE WOMAN, our first good look at her. She is EXQUISITE. Hair slicked tight to her high- cheekboned face, she looks sleek and feral, with eyes that burn bright. Especially when she's pissed.

	Look crazy son of a bitch! You wanna commit suicide, you do it someplace else!

She undoes her leash and swims rapidly off, returning in a few seconds with Johnny's board. He takes it from her and flops over it, still coughing. Wipes at the salt-snot running out of his nose. There is a cut over his eye from when he re-arranged the rocks on the bottom.
</DIRECTION>

	Go when I say. But stay down. Just lie on the board. Alright, let's go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Utah paddles rapidly, following her, watching what she does. He is borne up by a low glassy wall. He bellyboards all the way into the mushy shorebreak. Tumbles. Stands unsteadily, grabbing his board. Runs clumsily out of the retreating foam as another wave comes, sucking water out. On terra firma he looks back to see the woman kick-out gracefully and disappear beyond the wave.

He flops on the sand. Shivering. Miserable.

THE WOMAN, in a bikini, towels off briskly. Swimmer's shoulders. Long muscular legs. Lean and mean. She jumps into the car without bothering to open the door. Looks at her watch -- her manner is late, in a hurry. Through the tiny windshield we watch her shimmy and shake as she pulls her bottoms off and struggles into something else, not too concerned about the morning traffic right next to her. She pulls on a T-shirt and them performs a Houdini act to extract the bikini top out of one sleeve hole.

Lean-and-Mean, wearing jeans and T-shirt, jumps out of the Porsche. She hurries to the door of the Net, unlocking it for a couple of Mexican cooks -- helpers wearing expressions like they wait like this for her every day.

Tyler and Utah straddle their boards outside the break. She nods as the set comes, mellow right tubes. Utah digs in, arms pumping. He feels the bite as the wave picks up his board and starts down the wall. And endos.

CLOUDY PLATINUM DAWN... Tyler shouting at Utah as he fights for balance. He flies off again.

Utah, backlit in glorious slow motion, tries a little turn and feels his feet slip out. He slams down butt-first on the board, flips over, feet sticking straight up out of a blast of diamond spray. Tyler cringes, giving a look like it's hopeless.

UTAH and TYLER wait their turn in the lineup. Rain pelts their faces. The waves are depressing inside mushers under a gray sky. Utah starts to paddle. Tyler shakes her head no. Utah is committed to the I'face. Tyler stifles a laugh.

A LONE SURFER slashing through the pilings of the pier. A real kamikaze run as the whitewater walls thunder behind him. SILHOUETTED against a crimson sky and backlit spray the figure pumps among the pier pilings in a frenzy of motion that is somehow balletic. Laying out bottom turns, torquing his body and blasting the lip a few times, moving so fast his long dark hair stands straight back as if he were leaning out a car window on the freeway.

She whirls. Bodhi pumps his arm. Tyler jogs back for the catch. Bullseye. She shoots Bodhi a look. Something crosses her face. Bodhi smiles. Tyler doesn't. Then it passes. She chucks the ball to Utah. Who drops his board and makes the catch in one move. He SPINS the football on his fingertip, drops it on his foot, kicks it up into his hands. Razzle dazzle. He grins evilly.

Rimmed by a dozen car HEADLIGHTS at the edge of the sand. Utah crouches, waiting for the snap from NATHANIEL, ponytailed and powerfully built. Facing them on defense are Bodhi, Tyler and three others: ROACH, gonzo and spiked-haired. GROMMET... 17 and thin as a stick, and ROSIE, a biker with piggy eyes and arms blue with tattoos.

MONTAGE STYLE -- Utah tosses a flurry of mindboggling passes. Every one picture perfect. Nathaniel scrambles z-out left, turns and the ball is practically waiting for him. Touchdowns galore. Endzone dancing. Bodhi stares at him curiously.

Tyler rushes. Utah enjoys scrambling, ducking left and right, twisting her into a pretzel. Play after play. Utah tosses another touchdown, but Tyler keeps coming. Sacking him. They lie together in a heap, laughing.
</DIRECTION>

Bodhi quarterbacks. Utah rushes. Bodhi fakes a pass then runs, ball tucked in his arm. Utah tears after him. Flat out speed run. Roach attempts a block. Utah hits him like a freight train. Roach hits the sand face first. Grommet and Rosie the biker in a squeeze play. Utah, fierce now, blasts between them. No mercy. Utah can't play for fun. We see his expression. Something scary there. What we will call "juggernaut mode". Tyler just steps aside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bodhi running along wet sand as a wave sweeps up the beach. Looks back. Sees a demon shooting up roostertails of spray behind him, gaining. Pours it on. Both of them pistoning through curtains of water. Not a game anymore. Closing on the endzone. 5 yards. Utah is airborne. SLAMS BODHI LIKE A SAM MISSILE. They crash and burn together in the surf.

AT THE SHOWER Johnny sets down his gear and opens his wetsuit to the warm, salt-free jet of water. TRACKING SLOWLY IN on him as he lets it pour over his face. A HAND ENTERS FRAME, shutting off the water suddenly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON UTAH, his eyes opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE, revealing RAZORHEAD and THREE OTHERS. They are powerfully built SURF-NAZIS. Scalps shaved on the sides. Hair military short on top, lengthening into pigtails in the back. Tattoos. Wrist chains. TONE, ARCHBOLD and WARCHILD. The one who socked Utah before is BUNKER. They spread out flanking him.

<DIRECTION>
As they lunge, Utah grabs his board and swings it in a whistling roundhouse. Its edge slams Warchild in the gut and folds him double. The bad news is... Warchild gets an arm around it and brings a pile-driver hammer-punch down. The board splits into two pieces. Utah drops his end as the others close. A flurry of punches and kicks, most of which he blocks. But he's lost the offensive. Bunker takes him to his knees with a vicious karate-style side-kick.

ANGELO gets out of the car fast. He jogs twenty feet and raises the binoculars. Catches a glimpse of the carnage around the edge of the building. Breaks into a run, massive legs pistoning.

JOHNNY HITS THE GROUND hard. He rolls and comes up fast. The razorhead brothers are a little surprised.

<ARCHBOLD>

Warchild grabs Utah from behind. Gets him in a headlock. Archbold and Tone pin his arms. Bunker starts working him like a practice bag. At this moment, Johnny is getting the proverbial shit beat out of him. SUDDENLY, a new figure blurs INTO FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BODHI seizes Bunker and flings him aside. He spins with remarkable agility and drives his heel into Warchild's face. Utah breaks free, staggering back on the sand. The fight is still there in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bodhi is at his side -- holding the others at bay with a raised hand and an evil look.

Johnny answers with a LIGHTNING ROUNDHOUSE that hits with a CRACK! They can hear it in Pomona. BUNKER HITS THE GROUND. Flat out. Lights out. Tone, Archbold and Warchild lunge like dogs. Bodhi yanks Utah out of the line of fire.

Tone starts to go after them. Archbold grabs his arm. They help Bunker up. Warchild holds he bleeding nose. Utah and Bodhi start up the stairs, turn a corner and run HEAD-ON into a huffing PAPPAS. The big man clocks a battered but intact Utah. We see him shift gears in his head in 2 tenths of a second.

LONG LENS POV of Razorheads house. Through the windows we see the four moving inside. Tone throws Archbold and Bunker a Coors from the fridge. Archbold shakes his and opens it in Warchild's face. Warchild, in no mood, slams him against the wall. We feel the revved-up, chaotic energy of the group in silent pantomime.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bunker is met by a GIRL coming from the back of the house. She is wearing only panties and a black leather vest. Short black hair and tattoos stark on her white skin. Bunker puts one arm around her neck in a head lock embrace and slides his other hand under her vest. Tone pulls the curtains.

Not a happening night at the Razorheads.

Roach drains a beer in one gulp, spies the sharp needle point of the dart, then squints at the target. ROSIE moves through the small crowd collecting bets.

Suddenly Roaches arm snaps back. A collective hush... In a blur of tattoos the small feathered missile is airborne.

TWAAAPPPPPP! Bulls-eye. Centimeters from flesh. Grommet secretly exhales. Roach howls as Rosie rains money on his head. The crowd goes wild. BODHI stands nearby with his arm around a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. Pleased to see Utah, he motions him over.

Johnny moves through the house, looking for her. As he passes the den, he sees Tyler standing inside, and goes into the dark room. It is the only personalized space we have seen in the house. A kind of shrine to the Bodhisattva. Shelves filled with books and artifacts from his travels. Maori masks, a blowgun, a skeletal shark mouth two feet across, a huge fossil ammonite... an unbelievable variety of tribal artifacts and marine specimens. The books include political literature, eastern religion, philosophy. A strange hodgepodge of titles and authors: Nietzsche, Marx, the Tao, "Steal this Book", "The Book of Five Rings", Frederick Forsyth thrillers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler is looking at a wall of photographs and Johnny walks up behind her. Shots of Bodhi surfing a monster wave, mountain-biking, skydiving, flying an ultralight airplane, bungee-cord jumping, cliff diving. Every kamikaze activity in the book.

Bodhi returns from another room with... AN ALL-BLACK SURFBOARD. It gleams like obsidian. Near the tip, in small gray letters it says "Stealth Fighter". Bodhi thrusts it into Johnny's hands. The others WHOOP maniacally. Johnny feels the challenge. The pull of the tribe.

Johnny clenches his jaw and charges past her into the water. He strokes powerfully out through the black swell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UTAH'S EBONY BOARD pierces the wave and he slides down the backside to where the others are waiting. Roach and Nathaniel, silhouettes nearby, see one they like and take off yelling. Johnny turns as a figure glides up next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<UTAH>

<BODHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODHI>
<DIRECTION>
Grommet gets a ride, slicing across in front of them. A ghost moving off into the silvery distance. Tyler waves jauntily and takes the next one. It's Johnny's turn.
</DIRECTION>
<BODHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Football's a man-made game. You keep score with numbers. But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent. Just you and the wave.

	I know that part. Tell me something I can use, here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UTAH>
<BODHI>

	I've watched you once or twice. You surf like it's some kind of street fight. You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you. Always trying to win.

<UTAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A flaw I'm working on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UTAH>
<BODHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only way to win out here is to surrender. You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync. Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.

</BODHI>
<UTAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.

Bodhi is looking at the lights along the shoreline. Without looking back, he senses the incoming swell.
</DIRECTION>
<BODHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This one's got your name on it, Johnny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODHI>
<DIRECTION>
Utah looks. Huge glassy face, perfectly formed. Black and terrifying.
</DIRECTION>
<BODHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODHI>
<DIRECTION>
Bodhi digs in with both hands, driving himself forward. Johnny starts grabbing water right behind him. The wave picks them up.
</DIRECTION>
<UTAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UTAH>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny uses the patented Tyler-pop and makes it to his feet. Suddenly he's going like a shot. He moves back on the board, trims out, slowing down. Maintains a fragile control. On pure adrenalized instinct, heart pounding, he falls in behind Bodhi, taking the same line along the roaring black face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bodhi is like the Silver Surfer, ahead of him in the moonlight. Not wanting to drop too far behind, Johnny walks a little forward on the board. The nose dips, picking up speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny starts letting the speed work for him, learning that he can make long floating turns up and down the glassy face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Feeling the water under his feet, the tons of water piling up behind him... feeling its awesome power and borrowing a little of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Silver Surfer and the quarterback rocket through the night. Utah has a big feral grin plastered on his face. Bodhi looks back. Gives him a thumbs up. Then he cuts left and drops giddily down to the bottom, slashing back and climbing. Utah tries it, feels the drop like freefall... feels the speed. He makes his bottom turn, nearly falling. The grin dropping off his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He falls in behind Bodhi again as the wave wraps over them like a great black wing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TYLER, paddling back out, watches them shoot past her. Utah raises his arms above his head and HOWLS like a gonzo wolf as they go by. She grins to herself, watching him. Knows he's gotten the ride that will make him a surfer for life.

EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT

Rosie sits on the sand next to a blazing fire in a cement firepit.

<UTAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I just want to sit out here for a minute.

He watches the lights along the shoreline as the gentle swell between sets lifts and drops them. His face is somehow childlike. A slow grin spreads itself across his face.

Her face seems luminous in the moonlight. The ocean silver. The shore a shimmering line of gold. The sky black velvet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Utah turns to Tyler, eyes exploring her, as in a dream. Water beads on her dark skin like crawling diamonds. He glides closer, holding her board like an uneasy horse alongside his. He runs his fingertips down her arm.
</DIRECTION>
<UTAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goosebumps. Come here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UTAH>
<DIRECTION>
She leans closer and he rubs his hands up and down her arms, warming her. His hands stop on her shoulders. He pulls her to his mouth. Her tongue meets his. She wants this. He is surprised by the fierceness of her kiss, which overwhelms his.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON THE ZIPPER of her shorty wetsuit as Johnny's fingers draw it down. Slowly down, to where it ends between her legs. He spreads the front and slips his hands inside, along her ribs.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those are cold.

<UTAH>
	<DIALOGUE>

She moves his strong hand onto her breast. His fingers massage her cold-stiffened nipple. She moans and grabs his wet hair in her other hand, pulling him into another intense kiss.

EXT. OCEAN - UNDERWATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking up from the bottom, we see the silhouettes of two boards surrounded by pulsing shafts of moonlight. CAMERA TILTS DOWN to show the bottom. The dreamlike blue light shimmering on the sand and rocks. A big shark browses gracefully, ignoring the lovers. Their moment of harmony with the sea will be honored.

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Tyler's Porsche stands alone in an empty lot. Her surfboard sticks up in back, next to Utah's "stealth fighter". Rosie's fire is burning low. Tyler, half-wrapped in a blanket from the car, straddles Johnny on the sand like she straddles her board. The blanket slips down. Naked silhouettes in the firelight. She arches her back as they move together in prefect sync. Grips his shoulders and stares into his face, her teeth bared in a grimace of pleasure that looks like pain. She makes love like she does everything... with honesty and intensity. Utah, surprisingly, is gentle and slow. He strokes her hair after she collapses onto him.

LONG LENS on UTAH'S SEDAN fishtailing through the alley, narrowly missing dumpsters and parked cars. He pulls up next to several unmarked FBI sedans. No one in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UTAH jumps out tucking in yesterday's shirt, stuffing his Beretta into his waistband. He also shoves a small leather case into his belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Utah pulls open the door to one of the unmarked cars and rips a walkie-talkie out of the charging rack on the front seat. Running, he passes a gate. Goes back. Looks.

Pappas pulls the loose Hawaiian shirt down over the radio- mike gear and his stalwart .38 snub. He steps out from behind a fence and walks along the sidewalk toward Bunker's house, two doors down. He is wearing polyester shorts and sandals, and carrying a DOG LEASH.

COLE AND MUNOZ snap around the corner of the garage and sprint low toward the rear of the brown stucco house.
</DIRECTION>

UTAH circles back out through the alley. TRACKING WITH HIM as he makes it to the neighbor's back hedge and crab- walks toward Bunker's house. BABBIT and ANOTHER AGENT make it to the front corner of the stucco house, staying out of sight of the windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGELO is walking up to the falling-down porch of this low-rent roach-hotel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNNY is elbow-crawling between the house and a tall hedge. He slides quietly in below a bedroom window. He pulls out the little leather kit he tucked in his waistband. Removes something from it. A DENTAL MIRROR. Moving slowly, he raises it above the window sill, angling it where he can see inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON DENTAL MIRROR, Johnny's POV. We see a bedroom through a gap in the venetian blind. Tone is lying on the bed, wearing headphones. Cranked up speedmetal. His eyes are screwed shut, and his fists pump to the beat like karate on 40,000 volts. The door to a bathroom is open, and the black-haired girl can be made out behind rippled shower glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON DOORBELL as Pappas rings it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UTAH JUMPS at an explosion of sound. He spins in a microsecond, pistol aimed at... A LAWN MOWER. Through the hedge we can just see THE NEIGHBOR, sixtyish and polyester clad, as he adjusts the choke on the roaring machine about two feet from Johnny's face. Utah exhales and lowers the gun. Wipes sweat from his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON PAPPAS, smiling open-faced and goofily charming as...

THE DOOR opens, revealing a GIRL we haven't seen before. She has hair like bleached fiberglass, black eye-makeup and nails. Ramones-style wardrobe. She looks tense, and won't open the door very far.

HIS POV, in the little mirror. Like a silent pantomime under the ROAR OF THE MOWER, he sees Bunker and Warchild come flying into the room. They are hyper and manic. Eyes wild. Bunker leaps clear over the bed. Grabs a COMBAT SHOTGUN from the closet. Throws it to Warchild. Tone is oblivious. Bunker thumps him in the chest and Tone leaps up like an overwound toy, gaping "What the fuck?!" we read his lips saying. Bunker grabs a STEYR ASSAULT RIFLE, white knuckled, while Tone fumbles around and comes up with a .45 COLT AUTO.

JOHNNY is pissing himself. He can see it all going down. So fast he doesn't have time to think. He goes into motion -- slipping rapidly along the wall to the next window. The bathroom window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAPPAS, AT THE FRONT DOOR, makes his move. He pushes the door open, breaking the security chain, and jams his FBI shield in the girl's face as he grabs her arm.

INT. HOUSE
</DIRECTION>

Bunker's eyes bug out as he sees Pappas coming through the door. He snaps the assault rifle to his shoulder. Suddenly Johnny is behind him -- half-in the bathroom window, pistol gripped double-handed like they taught him in Quantico.
</DIRECTION>
<UTAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FBI!! DROP IT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UTAH>
<DIRECTION>
Bunker whips around. Squeezing off a wild burst! B-B-B- BLAM! It rips the plaster next to Johnny's shoulder. Shatters the shower door behind him. The BLACK-HAIRED GIRL screams. Johnny flinches, FIRING RAPIDLY. Wild. Bunker drops, hit. Warchild lets go with the 12 gauge. KABOOM! Takes a chunk like a shark bite out of the doorframe by Johnny's head. Deafening in the confined space. Johnny flattens himself behind the doorframe. Tone just splits. Down the hall like a greyhound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAPPAS is on one knee, his piece drawn fast, holding Fiberglass in a neck-lock with one massive arm. Bunker, wild-eyed and bleeding, is on his knees in the bathroom doorway. He raises the Steyr. Mistake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Angelo FIRES. 30 years in the field tends to show. Three rounds. Chest. Chest. Head. Bunker is off the planet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUNOZ KICKS THE BACKDOOR IN like they do in the movies. He and Cole charge into the rancid kitchen. Badass FBI agents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNNY, hotwired and hyperventilating, pops out for a shot around the doorframe. He gets a glimpse of Warchild's back disappearing into the hallway. FIRES. His shot is wasted, punching plaster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a pink freight-train hits him. He forgot about the girl in the shower. Naked except for her tattoos, she bodyslams him face-first into the wall. As he tries to turn she grabs his hair in both hands and hammers his head into the medicine-cabinet -- CRASH -- shattering the mirror. Then she knees him in the balls as he ricochets off the wall into her. She drives her elbow into his back as he drops. "FREIGHT TRAIN" lands knee-first on his gun hand, and viciously kicks the pistol away with one bloody foot. It skitters under the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's cut up from flying glass. Demon-eyed and wired, her body lithe and muscular under white skin. She sprints across the bedroom, leaving Utah slumped, heaving for breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE HALLWAY, Tone is hidden behind a doorway. White-knuckling the forty-five. A wild-eyed kid with a big gun and not the slightest idea how to use it. He hears footsteps POUNDING behind him and spins. It's Warchild, running with the shot-gun.
</DIRECTION>
<WARCHILD>

	Move it, man. Let's get the fuck out of here!

</WARCHILD>
<DIRECTION>
Off-guard, Tone is SLAMMED BY THE DOOR as Munoz drives into it with his shoulder. Pounded between the door and wall, Tone is wired so tight he pulls the trigger and blows a hole through his own right foot. He screams and drops to the floor. Munoz sandwiches him with the door and draws down on Warchild, who dives into a doorway. Cole drives past Munoz, who has Tone pinned, and pounds down the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole reaches the doorway and goes for the shot on Warchild. "Freight-train" appears behind him from another door. She raises a pair of scissors and drives them into his back up to the hilt. Pulls them out, going for another stab, when-- Pappas spins her around and slams her face-first into the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UTAH, in the bedroom, sees Warchild blur across his field of vision. On pure instinct, he kicks into overdrive. Johnny leaps the bed and goes ballistic. His flying tackle catches Warchild at the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The window EXPLODES OUTWARD in a spray of sunlit glass. Utah and Warchild crash to the ground. The razorhead, with 50 pounds on Johnny, rises like a bull. Bleeding from superficial lacerations, Warchild plows through the hedge. Johnny dives after him. The Polyester Neighbor stands paralyzed as the two crazed figures careen toward him. He is knocked flying, and the ROARING LAWNMOWER is flipped onto its side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Utah and Warchild are locked together. The shotgun lies nearby, out of play. Warchild jerks a 6 INCH KNIFE free from its sheath, hanging from a thong around his neck. He trusts straight at Johnny's throat. Johnny deflects the thrust -- INTO THE WHIRLING LAWNMOWER. KA-WHANGGG!!! The knife is hammered out of Warchild's hand. Whistles away, spinning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Warchild grabs Johnny as they scramble, and heaves him bodily toward the spinning blade. Utah catches the rim of the mower with both hands, stopping himself inches from the rotor. Warchild puts all his weight on Johnny. Pushing him face-first toward the blades. Johnny feels the wind on his face. The engine is roaring, full throttle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAPPAS APPEARS BEHIND THEM. He aims the .38. FIRES TWICE. The little Briggs & Stratton dies young, its casing shattered. The rotor spins to a stop. Warchild looks up into the black eye of Pappas' gun. Two inched from his face.

UTAH and PAPPAS watch through the one way observation window. THWAAAAAP!! The two taped packets slam the wall inches from Utah's right ear. Johnny snaps his head around. Stares into the face of DIETZ who looks like Warchild's meaner brother. And he's pissed as hell...

The doorbell BUZZ shrieks through the room. It stops. Starts again. A ghostly dawn finds UTAH and TYLER sleeping peacefully, limbs entwined like vines. Johnny's eyes snap open. Spies the clock. 4:00 a.m. Tyler stirs beside him, coming out of sleep. Johnny wraps a blanket around his waist and staggers to the door.

BODHI stands outside the door wearing a lunatic grin. Behind him NATHANIEL, ROACH and GROMMET hoot from the pickup.

Vampire morning. A misty predawn, bled of all color. Steel gray tones. The ocean vanishes in the fog a few feet from shore. Tyler and Johnny, carrying their boards, walk toward the water.

	Come on, Utah. Everybody's out there catchin' all the good rides.

JOHNNY'S POV... the water receding into a backlit wall of mist. FIGURES APPEAR, faint silhouettes in the fog. Shades of gray in the gray. IN SLOW MOTION they weave hypnotically across the screen, their shapes merging and unmerging as they cross each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STACKED UP BY THE EXTREME LONG LENS, Bodhi, Roach, Grommet and Nathaniel crave and slash toward us with mystical grace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In SUSPENDED TIME we see them hooting and grinning at each other as they cut aggressive moves close to each other. Dolphins playing. Challenging each other in mock combat. So good, their boards slash past each other with inches to spare. There is an incredible sense of freedom and exhilaration. Bonding forged through mastery of this arcane art. For the first time we see the core group of Bodhi's tribe, by themselves. It dawns on us... There are four of them. And at that moment Nathaniel drops in front of Bodhi, laughing at the near miss, and drops his pants in a nasty wig-wagging moon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING SLOWLY IN ON JOHNNY staring, mouth open. Watching the four horsemen of the Apocalypse ride toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN SLOW MOTION, BODHI grins as he slashes past Nathaniel's shining white butt.

Early evening. Utah pulls into the driveway. When he kills the engine we hear Greek music from inside the house.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pappas dancing alone in the living room with his shirt off, holding a glass of ouzo. Facing away from the door the ample Greek hears Utah's tentative knock. Without breaking from his dance or turning he calls out--

<PAPPAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, babe. Get on over here so the big dog can teach ya how to bark.

SLOW PAN from the facade of the bank halfway up the block to Utah's sedan in the TIGHT F.G. Head flopped back over the seat, Angelo snoozes in the hot sun with a sports page over his face. Johnny looks at his watch for the fiftieth time. Whole lot of nothing going on.

As Johnny is counting out the bills, a BURGUNDY THUNDERBIRD pulls up in front of the bank. The doors fly open. The Ex-Presidents jump out. They sprint for the entrance. All this OUT OF FOCUS, B.G. Johnny misses it as he picks up the food order. The Presidents disappear inside. Johnny looks toward the bank again. There is no movement.

Pappas is about to take a huge bite when a meatball falls out of the end of the sandwich. It lands on the seat next to him. He looks at it. Picks it up. Pops it into his mouth and-- Freezes, mouth open. Eyes focused on... The Ex-Presidents, in living color, flashing through the doors of the bank 80 feet away.

Johnny is so astounded he doesn't do anything for about two seconds. Pappas coughs out his meatball, eyes bugging.

NIXON spins, raising his shotgun. But Reagan knocks the muzzle down with his hand. Shoves him into the car. Then Reagan jumps behind the wheel. The back wheels light up, smoking, as the T-Bird launches.

Utah FIRES. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! He puts two into the trunk and blows the back window into junk jewelry. The T-Bird peels out into traffic, clipping a Subaru which locks them up and spins.

A car pulls out, straight ahead. Utah swerves wildly, mostly gets around him. The guy's bumper and front grille are removed. Utah does a smoking skid-recovery. Doesn't even slow down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The late model T-Bird is weaving manically. It makes a sliding turn onto a cross street half a block ahead of the FBI agents.

Utah cuts the wheel into a huge Ralph's parking lot. Pedestrians scatter. Utah center-punches a week's supply of groceries in a cart.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two cars spin out of control. Utah cuts the wheel, slamming into them again. Side by side demolition derby. WHAM!! Utah hits them again. The Presidents lose control, jumping a curb, losing the right front tire in the process.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Utah's car starts to swap ends. Hit the center island broadside. The sedan flips onto its back in an explosion of glass. SCREECH of steel on concrete as it comes to rest. Hanging upside down, Pappas is mightily pissed off.

They can see the T-Bird still moving. It slews drunkenly as the driver maintains speed on flapping rubber.

The T-Bird vaults into the parking lot and slides to a smoking stop at one of the pump islands. The Presidents explode out of the car in a blur.

Reagan bodyslams a TEENAGER putting gas in his MUSTANG. He flips his big pistol to LBJ as the other Presidents charge past him. Nixon jumps behind the wheel of the Mustang. LBJ and JFK pile in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reagan grabs the gas nozzle out of the car. He pulls out a ZIPPO LIGHTER. Reagan raises the gas nozzle like a gun and holds the zippo below and slightly in front of it. He flicks the flame. Then pulls the trigger on the nozzle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like an impromptu flame thrower, the nozzle spews A TWENTY FOOT JET OF FIRE which engulfs the T-Bird in an instant. Any physical evidence in the car is rapidly incinerated. Customers are running, screaming. Nixon has the Mustang fired up.

Ronny's eyes sparkle behind his mask as he paints the scene with the jet of fire. You can see it getting good to him. In a second he's going to blow up the whole block. But he's getting his rocks off. He sets two other cars on fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FIGURE BLURS INTO FRAME. In a flying tackle, Utah catapults Reagan off his pins. They roll, skidding across the oily concrete. Spraying wild, the fire swirls around the pump island.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of the black smoke, PAPPAS charges like an angry bull, his snubnose held high. NIXON sees him and floors it. The Mustang smokes out of the gas station as Pappas' shots blow out the back window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Utah and Reagan roll away from the blaze. Johnny's pants are burning. He gets to his knees in time for Reagan's kick to take him square in the solar plexus. He folds in half. Drops to the cement. Reagan kicks him again and takes off running. The President is burning. His suit jacket is ablaze. He shucks out of it as he runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gasping, Johnny rapidly slaps his jeans. Puts himself out. He comes up running, pulling his Beretta. Sees the back of Reagan's head disappearing into an alley behind the gas station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A non-descript L.A. alley... commercial buildings on one side, walled suburb on the other. Two men running all out. A recent President and a wild-eyed cop trailing smoke like a crashing jet fighter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beyond the buildings behind them A FIREBALL EXPLODES SKYWARD. We hear sirens and shouting, which recede as the two pelt along the alley. It gets quieter. Just the machine-gun slap of the shoes on pavement, and the hard breathing of the two men, each in overdrive, going all out in long blurring strides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REAGAN looks back. Sees the demon cop behind him, gaining. Utah has become an engine, a running machine... juggernaut mode.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AHEAD OF THEM a BLACK AND WHITE swings into the alley. Reagan hangs a hard left and blasts a wooden gate half off its hinges. Utah whips through the gate a second later. Diving into suburbia.

INT./ EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - FOOTCHASE SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It becomes a blur. Pure kinetic energy. Two meteors rocketing through a low-rent suburb. And God help anyone who gets in the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reagan crosses a cluttered backyard. Broken field run through toys, swing set, stacks of god- knows-what. He runs through a Mr. Turtle Pool in an explosion of spray. Crashes through a hedge. Through the narrow gap between houses. Utah powers into the tight space behind him. Blurring along between stucco walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They emerge into the front yard. A WOMAN watering her lawn is so surprised she yelps and falls down. Reagan and Utah both hurdle her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AHEAD, KIDS ON BIKES, racing along the sidewalk. Reagan dodges the first, Utah slams into the next two. He crashes, rolling, tangled up in bikes and squawking teenagers. He comes out of a pile-up somehow still in high gear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reagan flashes across the sunlit street. Dodges in front of a GARBAGE TRUCK which locks up the brakes. It stops so fast, one of the guys falls off the back. The GUY is getting up as Utah whips around the back of the truck. Knocks him sprawling. Utah doesn't stop. Doesn't look back. Like he doesn't see anything in the real world but the figure running ahead of him. Like it's some kind of hyperkinetic video game.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everything is a blur. Suburbia smeared into staccato impressions. The house across the street is blocked by fence on both sides. A MAN is picking up his mail. Reagan pounds past him. Right through the front door of the house. Utah follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Panting as he sprints down a dark hallway. A WOMAN with a basket of washing SCREAMS as Reagan blasts past her, knocking her flying. Utah leaps over her sprawled legs. Cats blur underfoot. Utah crunches down on a tail. A CAT EXPLOSION. Screeching merges with the woman's shrill shouts as Utah slams the back screen door off its hinges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the back yard. Fence. Over it. Running on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REAGAN looks back. Sees Utah still behind him like in a bad dream. He enters the next house. Sliding glass door. Utah sees Reagan pull it closed. Locking it. Without breaking stride Johnny grabs a potted plant off a patio wall. Heaves it ahead of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The glass BURST INTO A WALL OF DIAMONDS. Utah blasts through a microsecond later. Topples the kitchen table. Furniture and crockery crashing everywhere. He sprints down a hallway after Reagan. A FIERCE WOMAN in a housecoat shouting at them as they pass, holding a vacuum cleaner like it's shot-gun.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the fuck out of this house! What the fuck do you think you're doing--

Around a corner. A VICIOUS SNARLING SOUND. Utah sees something flying at him. Reflexively catches it. Reagan has thrown a PIT-BULL. The Fierce Woman's fierce dog.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UTAH'S POV -- the snarling little demon right in his face. He drop-kicks it like a goddamn field-goal right through a doorway and runs on. Another door. Another explosion of sunlight. Another yard. Sprinklers this time. Reagan and Utah running through sunlit walls of rain. They crash through another hedge. Emerging drenched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ground drops away. Slipping and sliding on iceplant, they skid down a steep slope. Reagan reaches bottom. A TEN FOOT RETAINING WALL, dropping off like a cliff to pavement below. Reagan falls, landing on his feet. Panting now, feeling it, he stumbles up and runs on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Utah rips down through the iceplant like a human lawnmower. Slides over the edge. Falls -- lands hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON HIS KNEE and SLOW MOTION. Taking the impact. We HEAR something go. Utah crashes to the pavement, his face contorted with pain. He grabs his tortured knee with both hands.

Reagan runs on. They are in an enclosed storage yard of some kind. Ten foot chainlink all around. Utah struggles to get up and run. He sprawls forward, biting back a howl of pain. We see the incredible will driving him on. He gets up and again, hobbling. Trying to run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reagan reaches the fence. He is heaving for breath. Holding his side. Utah stumbles, gets up, clutching his knee. Hobbling forward. His eyes wild, the veins in his neck bulging.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reagan starts to climb. Utah collapses to his knees. He can't go on. Reagan reaches the top of the fence. He looks back.

UTAH HAS THE BERETTA POINTED RIGHT AT HIM. Twenty feet away. The muzzle rock-steady. He can't miss. They both are frozen, panting. Locked into the moment.

PAPPAS reaches the top of the hill, 200 feet away, panting like he's about to collapse. He sees the tableau.

ECU -- UTAH'S FINGER on the trigger. Tightening. RACK TO his eyes. Blinking, water running into them. God, he wants to.

ECU -- REAGAN'S EYES, through the mask. Locked with Utah's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UTAH suddenly snaps his hand up and FIRES VERTICALLY. HE HOWLS WITH RAGE, FRUSTRATION AND PAIN. FIRES AGAIN. And AGAIN. Slumping back, his shoulders slam down onto the concrete. Straight-arming the Beretta he FIRES RAPIDLY... Bulleting the blue sky.

HIGH ANGLE, looking straight down on the tableau. Reagan leaps off the fence and runs OUT OF FRAME, as Utah empties the magazine straight at us, the shots merging with his agonized howl, echoing as we--

UTAH sits next to the DISPATCHER waiting for news like a sailor in a storm. His leg is popped up on a chair with jeans split to the thigh and an ace bandage wrapped around his knee. His face is a nasty patchwork of scratches and bruises. He drains his coffee and gazes out at the empty bullpen.

Utah's brow unfurls. The thought has passed. He slowly cups his hand over hers. Gently pulling her close.

He presses his lips to the smooth curve of her forehead. A kiss to each downcast eye. Searching out her mouth with his own as his hands glide down the small of her back. Their reflection in the mirror as Utah slowly lowers Tyler to the bathroom floor. She clings tightly in a breathless kiss.

UTAH asleep, flopped in a spread-eagled X. WE HEAR the bedroom door opening, see a slash of light fall across the bed. Johnny doesn't stir. A shadow appears on the wall, moving toward him. An outstretched arm holding a gun. Utah snores softly, sleeping like a baby. CAMERA TRACKS IN on his peaceful face. A single eyelid flutters. Total silence, until...

KABOOOOMMM! The Pillow beside him EXPLODES into a blizzard of goosedown. Johnny rears up, eyes wide, mouth agape. TYLER stands above him, recovering from the kick of the smoking 9mm Beretta in her hand.

She goes limp as the sobs rack her body. The gun flops from her grip. Utah sweeps it under the bed with his foot. He moves to gently comfort her. She bolts at his touch, running from the bedroom. Utah is up and hopping into his pants to follow her. He stumbles.

From the living room we hear a rattling of keys, the front door opens and slams shut. He hobbles to the door, favoring his knee. Opens it. We hear the Porsche screeching away. Utah sags, the breath coming out of him long and slow.

Cheerful, hardly able to contain his exuberance. He moves through the room, grabbing Johnny's shirt from a chair, a pair of sneakers on the floor. Utah sees his FBI shield sitting on the dresser in plain sight. He palms it when Bodhi is turned away, and slips it into his hip pocket to conceal it.

A long pregnant pause. Utah breathes deeply, remaining calm, his voice carrying a chilling bravado.

Bodhi reaches his hand underneath the seat. He pulls out a huge holstered handgun, rests it in his lap, draws and holds the gun up against his cheek.

He twirls the gun, grabs the barrel and extends the handle to Utah. Johnny takes it slowly. Now it's aimed at Bodhi.

	Whoa. Careful. You got the muzzle pointing right at me, brah.

He casually pushes the barrel away, looking back at the highway. Johnny swings a stiff arm out his window and pumps a ROUND into open desert. KABOOOM!! The recoil blows Johnny's arm back over the top of the truck. Practically breaks his wrist. Thunder rolls across the dark hills. From the back of the pickup Nathaniel howls. Grommet and Roach high five.

Johnny turns to Bodhi, breaking slowly into a feral grin.

Utah watches Bodhi, Nathaniel, Grommet and Roach wriggling into their colorful freefall suits. Nathaniel pulls on a pair of purple shorts over his suit. Looks real dorky. Grommet has on duck feet. Bodhi, apparently, is going to jump barefoot. Nobody has their chutes on yet. Johnny hefts his, as if weighing it, somehow judging the contents. His brain is racing. Bodhi shouts over the roar.

Grommet, working his duckfeet, pitches himself into a wild spin, rotating like a dervish in a head down dive. He flares out and "flies" back to the others. Rocketing through the void at 120 mph they seem to paradoxically hang above the world, almost unmoving... on a separate plane of existence. A hurricane of wind. Wild HOOTING. Despite his terror, Johnny has to grin at Nathaniel, falling butt first like he's sitting on a big inner tube in the pool.

Grommet pulls his ripcord. He seems to be jerked upward by a great force. Suddenly he is far above, a brightly colored disc of fabric. Utah is suddenly aware of the earth rushing up at him. Nathaniel pulls, then Roach. They shoot upward, disappearing. Bodhi and Utah fall on, alone.

Bodhi reaches out suddenly and pulls Utah's ripcord handle. He waves goodbye as Johnny's canopy deploys. Utah is jerked upward. He feels his weight hanging brutally in the harness. Johnny looks down. Impossibly close to the ground. Bodhi's canopy BURSTS OUT, an explosion of color. Below him is the shimmering mirror of a LARGE RESERVOIR. Two seconds later the bright yellow canopy meets its reflection and goes slack. An explosion of white water marks Bodhi's impact.

Bodhi walks toward us, dripping wet and grinning. He wraps his arm around Utah's shoulders as the others walk up. They're all soaked and stoked.

<BODHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ya see... I told you Johnny U was gonna be just fine!

Roach and the others clap him on the back. A moment of acceptance into the tribe. Utah isn't sure what it means yet.

<BODHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mere. There's something you need to see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODHI>

Bodhi leads him toward a PLAIN UTILITY VAN parked nearby. It was there earlier but Utah had no reason to notice it. Bodhi opens the rear doors and motions Johnny inside. Utah, puzzled and suddenly alert, steps in. Bodhi follows.

The interior is empty except for several canvas duffel bags and a small portable VCR. It is one of the new sales presentation models, with deck and monitor together in one tiny unit.

Utah hits the button and an image comes up on the tiny screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON SCREEN. A night shot. Rosie the biker has Tyler in a powerful grip. Her hands are cuffed behind her, and her mouth is taped. He has his switchblade up to her throat. Her eyes are wild, but with rage, not fear. She's trying to struggle out of his grip, kicking at him viciously. He controls her efficiently. Bodhi stops the tape.
</DIRECTION>
<BODHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a wild one, isn't she... Special Agent Utah?

<BODHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, can't do it, brah. He's on the road. And where they're going there's no phones. Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do. I hate violence. See, that's why I need Rosie. I could never make this thing work, myself. No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once. We shared time in this world. But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism. Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness. Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes. Nothing I can do, unless I get there.

Utah blanches as he takes this in. Knows Bodhi well enough now to know he means business.

WIDER, revealing that Bodhi is in the back with Utah and Roach. Nathaniel and Grommet sit up front. The duffels contents are strewn around. Masks. Weapons. They're all pulling on suit pants and jackets. Tying ties. Slipping on white gloves. Snappy Oxfords. Bodhi is pulling a suit jacket on over his BODY ARMOR. Utah is fumbling with his armored vest.

<DIRECTION>
A YOUNG JOCK makes a move to run. 'OUR' SHOTGUN comes up like a reflex, right in his face. Roach/Nixon throws the guy to the floor by his hair. AHEAD OF US, Bodhi is in action. Moving to the counter, shouting--

WE'RE STILL IN POV, the image WHIPPING wildly from side to side as Utah scans the room. We whirl dervish among the statuary of the customers and bank employees. Our gaze drifts across THE FLOOR MANAGER, a short guy in a brown suit standing with his hands clasped behind his back.

	All customers on the floor. Let's go! Move it! Get down! On the floor! Right now! Let's go.

Roach and Grommet are pushing them down. Utah stands stiffly with the shotgun. He seems dazed. He catches the eye of a CUSTOMER. In a tenth of a second we see Johnny see the customer see his uncertainty. Fear has them both hyper-aware. Johnny gestures fiercely with the shotgun.

A CUSTOMER, lying on the floor near the fat guard catches his eye. The guard, face jammed against the linoleum, blanches as he sees the customer lift a corner of his shirt to reveal THE BUTT OF A PISTOL. The customer mouths the words "I'm a cop". The guard is hyperventilating.

INSIDE THE VAULT Grommet and Roach are pillaging rapidly. Their hands blur as nice fat STACKS OF 20s and 100s are dumped into canvas sacks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE MAIN FLOOR the OFF DUTY COP slips his hands slowly around the butt of his pistol, concealing the move with his body. He signals with his eyes to the fat guard, glancing at the guard's ankle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON THE GUARD'S ANKLE where we can see a sliver of BACK-UP GUN, a tiny .25 auto in an ankle holster. The guard's eyes are pleading with the hard-on cop. "Don't make me do this". The guy is sweating, shaking. A yellow liquid spreads across the tiles next to his quivering hips. He's actually pissing himself, he's so scared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON the off-duty cop. Watching like a ferret. He cocks his .38. ECU GUARD'S EYES, wide with terror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It happens like lightning. The cop pops to his knees, straight-arming the .38. The guard goes for his ankle holster. REAGAN spins. The cop FIRES. BLAM! Reagan is catapulted backward off the counter by the impact. He crashes onto a desk on his back. Slides off, scattering papers. A teller screams. The cop spins toward Utah. Johnny throws down the shotgun. Shows his palms. He's holding out his gold star.
</DIRECTION>
<UTAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Federal agent! Undercover!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UTAH>
<DIRECTION>
The cop FIRES TWICE. Two in the chest. Utah is hurled back. Slams into the tellers' counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHANIEL/LBJ lets go with the 12 gauge. BOOM! The cop spins, hit by some 00 buck pellets. The guard caps-off like a maniac. BLAM, BLAM, BLAM, BLAM!!! All of them wild, but serving to get Nathaniel pinned down behind a check-writing island.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROACH/NIXON LEAPS THE COUNTER and lands behind the guard. The guard's shoulder explodes as Roach's 12 gauge detonates. He pitches onto his face, screaming and holding the wreckage of his upper arm. Grommet/LBJ is coming over the counter behind Roach as the off-duty cop spins and fires. BLAM! BLAM! Roach takes it in the chest. Staggers back, firing into the floor. Trips and drops his shotgun. Grommet clutches his throat as blood streams over his fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN SLOW MOTION Reagan's face rises above the counter. The mask is askew. In order to see, Bodhi pulls it off. The Casull comes up in a slow, deliberate arc as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COP turns, terrified now, whipping his gun around, nightmarishly slow as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BODHI COCKS THE CASULL in dream-time and-- KABOOOOM!!! The world's most powerful handgun proves its claim at 2000 feet per second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gout of hamburger explodes out of the cop's chest. He is lifted off his feet. Hits and slides across the floor leaving a two-foot wide red smear. Echoes slap the walls. Then all is still. Plaintive whimpering and moaning. The air is blue with smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny is trying to catch his breath. He rips his shirt open to see two deep indentations in the Second Chance vest. Flattened .38 slugs caught in the Kevlar mesh. But no blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bodhi drops over the counter near Utah. The two men look at each other. Bodhi's eyes seem lost. He stares around at the carnage he has wrought, the bloody wreckage of his ego game. His expression changes to something new -- truly crazed now. We feel that the madness which has been held in check so long has been let off its leash.
</DIRECTION>
<BODHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't anybody fucking move!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODHI>
<DIRECTION>
Roach, clutching his side, moves to Grommet, who is on his knees. Beneath LBJ's stony countenance a river of blood flows down Grommet's chest. Roach pulls off the mask. Revealing a terrified kid. Grommet pulls his blood-drenched hand away from his throat, stares at it bug-eyed.
</DIRECTION>
<GROMMET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no, oh my god, oh god... it's all comin' out man, gotta stop it... it's all gonna come out... do something!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROMMET>
<DIRECTION>
He's trying to hold it in with his hands. This doesn't work. A paste-white frightened kid. Eighteen years old. Suddenly realizing that this is not some video game. That death is real. He slumps back, losing the battle for consciousness. WE HEAR SIRENS APPROACHING.

JOHNNY'S POV, as he drops to his knees. Everything going dark as we see Bodhi's face distantly, his mouth moving slowly...

Ten minutes later the bank "crime scene" is in full swing. UNIFORM COPS are everywhere, trying to get statements from sobbing witnesses. HARP, MUNOZ, COLE AND PAPPAS represent the FBI contingent. Cole has one arm strapped to his body in a fairly elaborate sling, and he moves slowly.
</DIRECTION>

Harp is barking orders to everyone in sight. Outside (visible beyond the doors) it's total pandemonium, with cops and ambulances, and of course a huge crowd of rubberneckers. A MINICAM CREW shows up. Harp starts shouting at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE, with evident pleasure, cinches down a pair of handcuff's on Utah's wrists with his good hand. Johnny has a deep cut on his forehead, and the blood is trickling into his eyes, but he seems not to notice. Not to hear MUNOZ speaking monotonously--

LONG LENS SHOT through a forest of small planes as Pappas' sedan glides INTO FRAME. It moves sharklike among through the Cessna forest. Slows to a stop. Through the jungle of wings and fuselages we see Pappas get out of the car and start working his way among the aircraft. Utah slides behind the wheel and drives on.
</DIRECTION>

TIGHT ON TURBOPROP ENGINE roaring as it warms up. The same aircraft as before. Bodhi and Nathaniel are loading duffel bags into the open back door as the pilot completes his pre-flight checks. The Ex-President's suits have been removed, along with the body armor, and no guns are in sight. Just a couple of guys getting ready for a charter flight. Bodhi looks up and stops his work as...

THE FBI SEDAN stops about 50 feet away. Nathaniel pulls a shotgun out of one of the duffels. Utah gets out. He holds his hands out from his body and turns completely around. Without his jacket on, it is evident that he is not carrying a gun. He walks forward.

</UTAH>
<DIRECTION>
Though he can't hear what's going on. THE PILOT has clocked the tension between the two men. And the shotgun in Nathaniel's hands. He blanches, and starts to shut down the plane's power. By his reaction we see that he's obviously not in on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROACH comes out of the hangar building nearby. Neither Utah nor Pappas see him. But he sees Pappas drawn down on Bodhi. He drops quickly to one knee and opens the duffel he was carrying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON DUFFEL BAG, as it opens. The pistol grip of a 12 gauge riot-gun sticks out of lots and lots of money. Roach's hand slides the gun out slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UTAH IS VERY CLOSE to Bodhi.
</DIRECTION>
<UTAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you man, when they fall on you, you won't back down. They'll have to burn your ass to the ground. And I can't stop them... I'm the last person they're ready to listen to right now. Thanks to you.

</UTAH>
<DIRECTION>
The pilot opens the door and is climbing out when Nathaniel wheels on him. The pilot goes cross-eyed staring down the muzzle of the 12 gauge, inches from his face.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back in the hotseat, campadre. NOW!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODHI>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND THE TRUCKS, Pappas senses something. His head snaps around. Roach is behind him with the 12 gauge. He FIRES. Pappas hurls his weight sideways, as the buckshot punches into the truck fender. Some of it catches Pappas in the hip. He hits the ground hard and whips up the .38 BAM! BAM! BAM! Roach flips onto his back. The shotgun blows a hole in the sky as he hits the deck. Pappas is on the ground, totally exposed, 20 feet from the others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHANIEL fires once, wild. Terrified. His shot blows a divot out of the asphalt next to Pappas. He pumps the slide, chambering another round. Then Pappas' fourth and fifth rounds drill into him. He slams back against the Cessna's fuselage. Slides down. Two red smears on the white aircraft. Bodhi lunges for the fallen 12 gauge. Pappas takes aim. One round left. Utah sprints between them.

Utah is blocking Bodhi with his body. Bodhi's fingers are poised, frozen, a few inches from the shotgun. Standoff.
</DIRECTION>
<PAPPAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GODDAMMIT!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAPPAS>
<DIRECTION>
He snaps the pistol up, aimed at the sky. Pappas stands panting. Enraged and frustrated. Pain searing his leg. Everything is tense and electrified. BOOM!! Pappas' chest EXPLODES with a spray of blood!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND HIM, ROACH is lying on one elbow in a pool of scarlet. He cocks another round into the chamber and fires again. BOOM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Angelo drops to his knees, holding his ruined body like he's hugging himself. Johnny lunges toward him, his face distorted with shock.
</DIRECTION>
<UTAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NNNOOOOOO!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UTAH>
<DIRECTION>
Angelo's eyes meet his for a moment. In his dilated pupils is the great question. Then he slumps forward and lies very still. The breath leaves his body and doesn't go back in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny moves toward his friend in a daze. Drops to one knee beside him. Roach aims the shotgun at him, coughing blood. Utah doesn't notice. Or is beyond caring. Bodhi holds his hand up in a gesture like a benediction. Roach's finger relaxes on the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Utah puts his hand on Angelo's white crewcut hair. He hears the scraping of steel on asphalt behind him as Bodhi picks up the other twelve gauge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roach is working himself to his knees. His breath is sucking through a bloody hole in his chest as well as the customary breathing orifices. Bodhi crosses to him and helps him up. He covers Utah with the shot gun as he half-carries Roach to the plane. The pilot is white with shock. He'd run if he could remember how.

Roach works his way up into the plane. He waves the shotgun at the pilot, his face a vicious, blood-flecked mask.
</DIRECTION>
<ROACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in the fucking plane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROACH>
<DIRECTION>
Bodhi stands behind Johnny, the shotgun aimed at his head. Their expressions are lethally cold. We see that Utah hates this man who was his friend, his teacher, more now than he dreamed it was possible to hate.
</DIRECTION>
<BODHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're gonna ride this out, all the way, Johnny. You and me. Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>

Johnny nods slowly, as if accepting that this was all somehow pre-ordained, and that they both knew the game would take them this far and beyond. He stands and walks to the plane.

EXT. MEXICO - DAY

<DIRECTION>
THE SCREEN EXPLODES WITH A BLUR OF MOTION. POV of the ground racing below us at 180 mph.

REVERSE, preceding the plane as it rockets through barren canyons. As close to the earth as the terrified pilot will take it. Under the radar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The aircraft bucks like a bull as the pilot jinks and banks wildly. Bodhi has the Casull aimed at the base of his skull from the jump seat just behind him. Roach holds the shotgun on Utah, seated across from him in the rear seats. Roach is a pale, sweaty mask. He is propped against a bulkhead, seemingly collapsed in on himself like a discarded coat. His entire shirtfront and lap are slick with blood. But his gaze is steady, and the shotgun is aimed into Utah's guts. No one talks or moves on this grim hell-ride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARROYO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near noon. The sun blisters a landscape out of time. The white Cessna rockets above the saguaros, its shadow pumping up and down over the broken terrain like some manic alter ego below it. It WOOSHES over us, raising dust devils.

The pilot yells over his shoulder to Bodhi...

Roach clutches the canvas sack to his chest like a Teddy bear. Glares at Utah. He hooks the strap of the duffel over one shoulder.

Bodhi meets his eyes and considers for a couple of seconds, then keys the walkie.

Bodhi looks out the doorway. Gauging distance, airspeed, the geography below. He looks at Utah, aiming the Casull at him. Johnny stares back at him like a pit viper.
</DIRECTION>
<BODHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know it's hard for you Johnny. You want me so bad it's like acid in your mouth. But not his time.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODHI>
<DIRECTION>
Bodhi signals the pilot and Utah feels the plane drop as the engines are cut back to an idle. Bodhi slaps Roach on the shoulder and Roach slumps backward out of the plane. Bodhi braces to jump, looking at Johnny for a last split- second.
</DIRECTION>
<BODHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lose, campadre.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODHI>
<DIRECTION>
He chucks the Casull onto the seat beside the door and bails. Bodhi tumbles out into space. It's over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Utah's knuckles are white, gripping the seat. There's a dynamo, spinning out of control in his head. He leaps up in an explosion of rage and drives his fists into a bulkhead. Looks around like a rabid animal. TWO SECONDS. THREE SECONDS. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<UTAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FUCK IT!!!

Utah grabs the Casull off the seat and dives out of the plane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UTAH, WITHOUT A PARACHUTE, but carrying a very large gun, rockets downward. He presses his arms to his sides and falls head-down, building speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three hundred feet below him is Bodhi, freefalling in a spread-eagle position. Utah moves his feet and hands, angling toward him. Bodhi doesn't see him. Falling flat, he tops out at terminal velocity for that position. 130 mph.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Utah slashes downward at 160 mph. The gap between them closes. Utah is almost blinded by the windstream. His eyes burn. His lips are peeled back by the blasting air. Bodhi is eighty feet below him... 4000 feet to terra firma. Utah focuses all his incredible will and concentration. He's only going to have one shot at this. Bodhi is right below him. Utah is closing like a SAM missile. He trims a little, and... WHAM! Slams into Bodhi in a mid-air tackle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bodhi's eyes are wide with amazement as they tumble together. Utah has made the grab and locked his arms around Bodhi in an iron grip. He pulls the Casull's muzzle up to Bodhi's head and screams in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<UTAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pull the parachute!!

Utah looks down. The earth is rushing at them. 2500 feet.
</DIRECTION>
<BODHI>

	Go on, Johnny. Pull it. But you gotta drop the gun, first! Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?

1000 feet. The ground is close enough to see details. Cactus, sagebrush. They rocket past the bright yellow canopy of Roach's chute a hundred feet away.

<UTAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fucking crazy!? Pull it!!
	</DIALOGUE>

Utah flings the Casull away and pulls the rip-cord so hard he almost loses his grip anyway. POOM! The canopy cracks out. Full and round and bright red. The ground roars at us. WHAP! Utah and Bodhi hit. Hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They slide and tumble down the slope of an arroyo in a cloud of dust. Rocks and debris clatter into silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEARBY Roach hits the ground limp as a rag doll. He moves listlessly as his chute lines tug at him but his eyes stare without blinking right at the sun. Next to him the money satchel's contents are spilled right into the sand. Roach's lifeless hands lie limp among the bills that caper in the desert wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UTAH AND BODHI are both completely still as the dust clears. Finally they groan and stir. Necks move, hands move, legs move. Bodhi rolls to his knees. He is cut and scraped, the blood running bright down his dust-covered skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Utah looks around, blinking. Surreal that he should be plopped down here in the red-hot Mexican desert. Bodhi staggers to his feet and grins at him.

He looks up at the sound of an engine.

<DIRECTION>
BODHI'S POV of his big four-by roaring toward us with a meteor tail of dust. It slides to a stop next to them. Rosie gets out of the driver's side and stands calmly with a sawed-off over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Utah blinks through his sweat and pain at--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TYLER running toward him out of the dust. She kneels next to him and puts her arms around him. Bodhi limps to the truck. Through the swirling dust we see him look back.
</DIRECTION>
<BODHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had me worried there, for a second, Johnny U.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODHI>
<DIRECTION>
He swings up into the four-by and guns the engine. Rosie hops into the shotgun seat and the truck hurls up roostertails as it tears out across the desert toward Roach's billowing gravemarker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny touches Tyler's face tenderly, leaving a smear of blood. He gives her a wan version of the Johnny Utah grin.

Dark. Almost empty. A snarling crocodile head is mounted above a tapper of Guinness Stout. A Koala bear with plastic eyes holds a Foster's. A BARTENDER with leathered skin washes glasses.

Bodhi doesn't wait for a reply. He walks to the water's edge, and never looks back. He throws his board into the foam and paddles, the riptide pulling him out. The monsters dwarf his body as they quickly suck him into the trough of the holocaust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UTAH stands and solemnly waits for the universe to deliver final justice. The cops are running clumsily across the sand, too late to stop Bodhi. Tyler steps up behind Johnny, and puts her hands on his shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BODHI is nothing more than a SPECK as he shoots across the lip of the colossal wave, carving the board downward -- AN UNTHINKABLE FOREHAND BLAST sends him into a 180 degree slide straight down the enormous face, eyes wild, his mouth opens in a soundless howl -- Bodhi and the outer- limits wave are locked for one impossible yet glorious moment in perfect harmony, perfect symmetry, perfect union... There is no fear in his face, only awe as the mountain of water closes out, burying the Bodhisattva in a whitewater grave... Pieces of broken surfboard explode upward, only to fall back into the raging whiteness and vanish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UTAH remains pensive, eyes fixed on the riderless surf. Tyler lowers her head. A fragment of surfboard washes up onto wet sand. The wind gathers force. Johnny finally turns to his woman, curls an arm around her shoulder, gathering her close. Tears are streaming down her face as she stares at the sea.
