INT. PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flicker of film. Footage from a press conference.
</DIRECTION>
<GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You kill your film several times, mostly by talking about it. A film is a dream. You kill it writing it down, you kill it with a camera; the film might come to life for a moment or two when your actors breathe life back into it - but then it dies again, buried in film cans. Mysteriously, sometimes, in the editing room, a miracle happens when you place one image next to another so that when, finally, an audience sits in the dark, if you're lucky -- very lucky - and sometimes I've been lucky - the dream flickers back to life again. That's why I'm secretive.

INT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge soundstage. The STUDIO SUPERINTENDENT lets a man into the stage, turns on a working light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERTITLE: Cinecitta film studios, Rome, 1965
</DIRECTION>
<STUDIO_SUPERINTENDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good luck, Maestro.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUDIO_SUPERINTENDENT>
<DIRECTION>
Departing, he closes the soundstage door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the man crosses the shadowy stage, a dim shaft of light catches his face, weary, handsome, haggard. GUIDO CONTINI, the most famous film director in the world. In front of him:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ENORMOUS, DUSTY, MULTI-LEVEL FILM SET under construction. A complex maze of scaffolding, its unfinished, chaotic elements suggesting ancient ruins. Cracked stone facades, broken columns, open platforming, the skeleton of a grand staircase. A lighting grid, not yet hung, and a camera crane surrounded by a forest of studio lights on stands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guido sits at the table, lights up a cigarette and puts on his glasses. He looks at the plans, looks up at the stage, puts his glasses down and stands up, stepping over to the crane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guido, alone, cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth, contemplates the studio, its turbulent set, in every sense a jumble of ideas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guido looks at the set in despair. He sits in the bucket seat of the crane, buries his head in his hands, overwhelmed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FIRST OF NINE LOUD CHURCH BELLS CHIMES
</DIRECTION>
<GUIDO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maestro, Maestro, Maestro Contini... How do you begin? How do you begin this thing? Page 1... Page 1... Page 1... Page nothing...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUIDO>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, a figure approaches out of the darkness, the darkness of Guido's imagination. An escape from his tortured reality.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure emerges gradually, like a goddess. She is gorgeous, imposing, and seductive. She is CLAUDIA, his film star, his muse. When Claudia reaches Guido, she stops in front of him, takes his hands from his face, and kisses him. And with that gesture, the music swells, the lighting grid rises majestically into the air, the gritty soundstage transforms into something beautiful, transforms into the interior world of GUIDO'S FANTASY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Claudia moves away, more and more women slowly appear. They emerge from everywhere. These are the women from Guido's life, past and present. Women from his films, women he has loved, the sources of his inspiration and creative genius.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A grand OVERTURE unfolds. The most significant women in Guido's life are revealed, each with their own powerful entrance:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUISA, his wife
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARLA, his mistress
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LILLI, his costume designer and accomplice
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUIDO'S MAMMA, her spirit
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STEPHANIE, a fashion journalist
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARAGHINA, a whore
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dark and glamourous dream. The women surround Guido and he loses himself and his anxiety in their collective embrace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fantasy ends abruptly with A VIOLENT GRATING NOISE, as the studio's truck doors are yanked open, jolting Guido who is slumped in the crane seat. Harsh daylight penetrates the gloom. Too bright. He blinks, discombobulated, as a group of silhouetted figures approach with purpose. One of the figures is a well- fed, amiable character, DANTE. He is Guido's longtime associate and Producer. A younger, more ascetic figure accompanies him, sharp and birdlike. This is FAUSTO, an accountant. Dante speaks quickly and without obvious punctuation:
</DIRECTION>
<DANTE>
<DIRECTION>
(walking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guido! You're here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buongiorno, Dante.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUIDO>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been looking for you all over the place. The set's coming along. How are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bene, grazie, bene.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUIDO>
<DIRECTION>
Guido stands to greet him. They kiss on both cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bene. My God, you look terrible, better go to makeup, forget you've got a press conference?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<FAUSTO>
<DIRECTION>
(discreetly, to Dante)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has no tie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAUSTO>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, makeup and wardrobe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes Guido's arm and they head towards daylight. Guido looks back at Fausto, who follows and with a look and a gesture asks Dante who is he?
</DIRECTION>
<FAUSTO>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping Dante)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Signor Contini, I'm Fausto. Good morning, Signor Contini.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAUSTO>
<DANTE>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's counting costs, you know. The Bank wants him here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Fausto)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't speak to him, I speak to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<FAUSTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I have some questions for Signor Contini.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAUSTO>
<GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We all have questions for Signor Contini.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUIDO>
<DIRECTION>
They head outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CINECITTA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guido, Dante and Fausto hurry through the studio en route to the Production Offices. Behind them is a large poster of CLAUDIA, starring in Guido's last movie, a failure, LA DONNA MODERNA (The Modern Woman). As Guido passes he causes a mild stir, and many people nod deferentially, offer a Maestro, or Dottore. Guido nods.
</DIRECTION>
<FAUSTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but please, please, I think it's customary for there to be an approved script and budget before filming commences...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAUSTO>
<GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he going to follow us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUIDO>
<FAUSTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not my intention to be difficult. Maestro, I am a huge admirer of Maestro Contini's movies, your early films are...everybody loves them and... I consider it a great honour for me to be here now... none the less, I need a script and a budget.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAUSTO>
<DIRECTION>
Neither Dante nor Guido respond. Fausto flounders. They make their way to the Production Offices. Everywhere signs for the movie, ITALIA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRODUCTION OFFICES, CINECITTA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long corridor, bustling with activity. The trio heads down it. If a pretty girl goes by, and there are several, both Guido and Dante turn to look but without missing a beat of their solemn conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they progress into and through the open plan office, many of the crew look up and cluster around, trying to get Guido's attention, swelling the procession, interjecting with their urgent requests.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are set models everywhere, in the process of being constructed, or painted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACONELLI, Guido's production designer, looks up from a model, hurries over. Nobody stops moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As a pretty girl passes between them, they all turn to look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PIERPAOLO, Guido's young PA, has caught up with the procession. He has dozens of phone messages, sorting through them, as he walks alongside Guido, through a partitioned office -
</DIRECTION>
<PIERPAOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where do you want your messages?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIERPAOLO>
<GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On my desk.

</GUIDO>
<PIERPAOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no room on your desk.
	</DIALOGUE>

<GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Under my desk. In the trash. Non lo so.

<PIERPAOLO>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Some of these are urgent!

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ascolta me.

<DIRECTION>
(he kisses Jaconelli on the cheek)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful what you say. He's a spy from the bank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUIDO>
<DIRECTION>
Guido carries on moving through the office.
</DIRECTION>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not exactly from the bank, Guido.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<DIRECTION>
Now BENITO, Guido's Casting Director, moves towards Guido, Guido tries to duck away from him as they head towards Guido's office.
</DIRECTION>
<BENITO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dottore, Dottore. You have actors waiting for you in your office. Auditions all morning. You should see what I've found. I found two sisters. Look, they're right...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENITO>
<DIRECTION>
Guido turns through another partition, as they all besiege him with questions. Benito despairs.
</DIRECTION>
<BENITO>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dottore, this way...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENITO>
<DIRECTION>
Guido heads towards Wardrobe, goes straight through the door, swinging it shut, leaving the chaos behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dante blocks Benito.
</DIRECTION>
<BENITO>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maestro!

INT. WARDROBE, CINECITTA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guido comes through the door, blows hard from the barrage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're in Lilli's domain here, and a haven, always, for Guido. Part Edith Head, part Coco Chanel, Lilli is Guido's Costume Designer, no longer young, cranky, indomitable, sharp as a tack. She adores Guido without any sentiment. She's incapable of sentiment. Guido heads straight towards her desk, where she is cutting some fabric.
</DIRECTION>
<GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need a cigarette.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUIDO>
<DIRECTION>
Dante comes in, closing the door behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He needs a shirt and tie, Lilli.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<DIRECTION>
Guido sits up on Lilli's table, as Dante heads to Lilli's desk and picks up the phone to make a call.
</DIRECTION>
<GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need a coffee and a cigarette.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUIDO>
<DIRECTION>
He lies down.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLI>
<DIRECTION>
(unimpressed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Answer a question, I'll give you a coffee. Answer another question, I'll give you a cigarette. And so on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLI>
<GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually and an aspirin.
	</DIALOGUE>

Dante stands at Lilli's desk and looks at some drawings.

	<DIALOGUE>
	We're running late...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<LILLI>
<DIRECTION>
(turns to Guido and lights a cigarette)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Calm down. Directing a movie is a very overrated job, we all know it. You just have to say yes or no. What else do you do? Nothing. Maestro - Should this be Red? Yes. Green? No. More extras? Yes. More lipstick? No. Yes, no, yes, no, yes, no - that's directing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLI>
<DIRECTION>
Lilli hands Guido the lit cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right: that's directing. And it doesn't seem to make a blind bit of difference, finally, what the answer is...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUIDO>
<LILLI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So please, Guido, yes or no, do you want any costumes in this film?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLI>
<GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

Lilli glances at Dante who has edged closer to the table, he looks at the costumes.
</DIRECTION>
<GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, yes.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Soon.

Lilli glares at Dante, ushering him away.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I don't allow producers in here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILLI>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright. Two minutes Guido.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<DIRECTION>
Lilli is the only person who intimidates Dante. He leaves. Guido pulls out his own tie from his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lilli walks round and takes the tie off him. Guido sits up. Lilli puts the tie round his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<LILLI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's gone. Have you written a word of the script?

</LILLI>
<GUIDO>

(looking around, desperate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why is there no fire escape in here? What if somebody needed to escape? I can't face these reporters. I have nothing to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUIDO>
<LILLI>

	You'll be fine. You're a world class liar, darling, go out there and lie for Italy, lie for Italia.

EXT. ROME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guido is driving his Roadster through the streets of Rome. An Italian pop song of the day is playing on the radio as he speeds around the Piazza del Poppolo. In front of him in the convoy is Dante with Fausto.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GUIDO'S CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Guido drives, he turns to see his MAMMA in the passenger seat. He's not remotely surprised. She appears the way he remembers her. Mamma is extraordinary.
</DIRECTION>
<GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell's wrong with me? I can't sleep. I can't think. I can't write. I can't breathe. My heart is racing. Am I dying, Mamma? I owe you flowers, I know. I'll come to the cemetery at the weekend. You should have let me bury you in Roma, Mamma, I could visit you every week. Don't look at me like that.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREETS OF ROME / INT. GUIDO'S CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is the Rome of La Dolce Vita, the Rome of Vespas, skinny ties, cool sunglasses, impossibly cool young people. A magnificent fall day, and the cafes are stuffed with the beautiful and chic.
</DIRECTION>
<MAMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is your Rome, Guido. The world sees Rome the way you invented it. Your films did that.

Guido is in his own world. The policeman raps on the bonnet of the car. Guido startles and pulls off, alone in the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guido looks across as he drives. Mamma has gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOTEL EXCELSIOR, VIA VENETO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The convoy comes to a quick stop in front of the Hotel Excelsior on the Via Veneto.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As soon as Guido gets out of the car, the waiting paparazzi snap his picture. Beautiful women look at him. Guido moves quickly by them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dante and the team hurry after him. Fausto tackles Dante.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And they hurry after Guido.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big suite. About fifty reporters, men and women, are in the room, and an array of microphones are on a coffee table next to a long couch. Excited chaos. A RADIO REPORTER narrates in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO_REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And we're just waiting for the arrival of Contini...any moment now - Could this film put the Maestro back on top?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RADIO_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
A few news cameras are filming. There's a buffet, and a bartender.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for coming, everybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUIDO>
<DIRECTION>
Pretending to leave, he heads towards the exit and kisses Dante on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He returns to the couch. All the reporters fire their questions at once. The questions come on top of each other, and Guido covers his despair with an inflated energy. He takes his sunglasses off and signals to DINARDO, a harsh-looking woman.
</DIRECTION>
<DINARDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maestro Contini. Maestro Contini.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINARDO>
<GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

<DINARDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grazie. Maestro Contini, your new film is called Italia... big title.

</DINARDO>
<DIRECTION>
Another journalist, Leopardi, vile - sitting next to her, egging Dinardo on - almost sniggers with contempt.
</DIRECTION>
<GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, it's my shortest title yet.

</GUIDO>
<DINARDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But hardly a modest one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINARDO>
<GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Films are not modest. They cost too much, they take too long, and they involve too many people. So they should have grand titles.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DINARDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And might you tell the press what the film is about?
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was the problem. Nobody else did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPARDI>
<GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I can tell you what my film is about...I can tell you the story, I can tell you who I am going to cast, the music I want to use, I can tell you everything... but... I... won't. I'm afraid that if I say anything, the word might get out to the Press.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUIDO>
<DIRECTION>
General laughter in the room. He wins a round, but is clearly feeling the strain... Dante recognizes, steps in.
</DIRECTION>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our next film will be exactly as it sounds. Italia. It's the very spirit of Italy - Italy as myth, Italy as a woman, Italy as a dream.

<LEOPARDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this true?

And she brings him onto the stage. The audience applauds. She addresses him as though he is Older Guido.

INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We seem to be looking at the SET ON STAGE 5. But suddenly a HUGE HEAD dips into the shot and it's Guido contemplating a model of the set. He places a figure on the top of the staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves round to the front of the model and places another figure on the top of the scaffold tower. He knocks it over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unconvinced, he sits down on the sofa. The coffee table is covered in head-shots. He finds the one of Claudia. Guido looks at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lies back to write and finds himself in CLAUDIA'S LAP. She hands him a lipstick, smiles and strokes his hair. He starts to sign - "TO HIS EXCELLENCY.... " then paints his lips and kisses the photo himself. Claudia laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANCIENT BATHS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grottos and tunnels are thick with steam. Guido follows the Cardinal's Secretary.

The Cardinal's Secretary leads Guido to a private area, where the Cardinal is already soaking in a large tub of hot water.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Eminence, Signor Contini is here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARDINAL_S_SECRETARY>
<DIRECTION>
The Cardinal's Secretary makes a gesture to Guido to get into the tub with the Cardinal. Guido gets in the water. The Cardinal looks hard at Guido and then makes his first pronouncement.
</DIRECTION>
<CARDINAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like Charlie Chaplin.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me - my films are what I imagine.

(nonplussed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you train the imagination?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUIDO>
<CARDINAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The imagination is God's garden; don't let the Devil play in it. Teach our Italian women to be wives, not whores, don't make us look at filth and debauchery. Make us proud to be Italian...

Guido's head disappears under the water. The sound of the Cardinal's voice trails away...

MEMORY:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERTITLE: Pesaro, Italy, 1926
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young Guido, dressed in his school uniform, runs fast across the rough dunes with five boys from the village.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys head for a graffiti-covered defensive wall with barbed wire along the top, a leftover from the war.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They reach into pockets and extract small change, hand it to Young Guido, already the ring leader.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They crawl through a small opening in the wall and approach an abandoned bunker...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SARAGHINA'S BUNKER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Young Guido takes a step forward toward the bunker, as the other boys fearfully take a step back.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_GUIDO>
<DIRECTION>
(not loud enough)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Saraghina.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(louder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Saraghina.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_GUIDO>
<DIRECTION>
Now all the boys join in.
</DIRECTION>
<BOYS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Saraghina! Saraghina!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOYS>
<YOUNG_GUIDO>
<DIRECTION>
(loudest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Saraghina! Sa-ra-ghina!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_GUIDO>
<DIRECTION>
A shadow moves inside the bunker. Now even Young Guido takes a step back, but the boys are taking three steps back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then she comes out. SARAGHINA is a gritty, earthy woman, with a powerful, voluptuous energy. She has darkened eyes and a beauty mark: she is clearly the model for the whore makeup on Carla.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at the boys. She may be a crazy whore, but she's not an animal, she's just playing one for the boys, and they don't quite understand that she's having her own fun with them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a deliberate step. Young Guido stands his ground. She takes another step and holds out her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young Guido opens his hand with the coins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at the money. Is it enough?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But she grabs his wrist, and holds it, and then takes the coins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stuffs the money in her ample bosom and heads back to her bunker. She returns dragging an old broken chair, places it in front of the boys and sits, ready for the "show."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Saraghina scoops up the soft white sand in her hands and pours it over her body...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dark vamp begins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FANTASY:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Curtains of falling sand fill the soundstage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the sand, we see Saraghina seated on the same chair from the beach. She speaks, surrounded by other WHORES in provocative positions on beaten-up chairs.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAGHINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you little Italian devils, you want to know about love? Saraghina will tell you...and if you want to make a woman happy, you rely on what you were born with. Because it is in your blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAGHINA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a smile, she pulls her dress off her shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
</DIRECTION>
<SARAGHINA>
<DIRECTION>
(sings)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BE ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN. TAKE A CHANCE, AND TRY TO STEAL A FIERY KISS. BE ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN. WHEN YOU HOLD ME, DON'T JUST HOLD ME BUT HOLD THIS!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAGHINA>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs her breasts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She undulates her body. The boys watch and cheer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
</DIRECTION>
<SARAGHINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PLEASE BE GENTLE, SENTIMENTAL, GO AHEAD AND TRY TO GIVE MY CHEEK A PAT, BUT BE DARING AND UNCARING. WHEN YOU PINCH ME, TRY TO PINCH ME WHERE THERE'S FAT.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAGHINA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Saraghina gets up on the chair, lifts her skirt, and begins to move her hips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
</DIRECTION>
<SARAGHINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BE A SINGER, BE A LOVER PICK THE FLOWER NOW BEFORE THE CHANCE IS PAST, BE ITALIAN BE ITALIAN LIVE TODAY AS IF IT MAY BECOME YOUR LAST!

	BE A SINGER, BE A LOVER, BEFORE IT'S PAST, BE ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Saraghina drops to the ground and playfully writhes in the sand. The boys are transfixed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gets up and heads towards the water. The boys follow, running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Saraghina and The Whores brandish tambourines. They begin a slow, rhythmic and sensual dance that builds into a wild and raucous tarantella.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We furiously intercut between the musical fantasy and the memory of the boys romping on the beach with Saraghina, across the sand and through the water.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAGHINA>

<DIRECTION>
The whores dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The number ends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two PRIESTS are running down the beach, cassocks flapping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys run. Young Guido tries to run away from the priests. They catch him and carry him away from the beach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ST. SEBASTIAN CHAPEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Off-screen, a boys choir sings KYRIE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The priests drag Young Guido through the school's chapel, past a tortured Christ hanging above the ornate altar, into the Principal's office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guido's mother is there with the PRINCIPAL (again, she appears the way he remembers her).
</DIRECTION>
<MAMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am ashamed of you, Guido.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAMMA>
<YOUNG_GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Mamma, what did I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_GUIDO>
<PRINCIPAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring him here. That savage is the devil. God will punish you for your sins, now and forever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCIPAL>
<DIRECTION>
The Principal produces a cane and starts to whip the boy remorselessly. Mamma looks away. Young Guido cries out as they punish him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and the cry is now in Guido's mouth, on top of Carla in the spasm of sex... He suddenly can't breathe... Carla is suddenly aware that he's not in ecstasy... He rolls over, recovers slowly. As always, immediately wanting to leave after the sex.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I die it would kill your husband?
	</DIALOGUE>

Guido shrugs the sheet off and sits up slowly. Carla kneels up and hugs him, kissing his back.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that's not what I meant, Guidino. No. Where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>

</GUIDO>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But why is it impossible? Look at your producer! He's married, he brings his girlfriend to work and nobody cares. Guido. Everybody knows about me. Why? Why won't you let me near you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the very same reason you don't want me to die on top of you. It's not fair to your husband. It's not fair to my wife.

<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, you're playing with me. You're twisting everything... Please let me come with you.

INT. TERRACE RESTAURANT, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - NIGHT

Glittering lights on the terrace. A view of the sea. A pop band and a dance floor. A slick Italian MALE SINGER performs QUANDO QUANDO QUANDO. People dance. The whole PRODUCTION TEAM is at a working dinner. Guido is at the end of the table, spilling ideas, struggling, struggling to make sense of Italia -

Guido and Doctor Rondi come out. Guido is concerned. Doctor Rondi writes out a prescription as he talks.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR_RONDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She took five or six pills, enough to make herself very sick. I understand she's your mistress.

	This is a sordid business. You movie people, I suppose you don't consider yourself bound by morality...

Carla's husband, LUIGI, is talking with Matron on the landing.

The whole energy of this return to Cinecitta is hectic, people wanting to work, equipment waiting to work, everybody and everything needing Guido's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guido drives towards the stages. Guido feels the pressure that the whole studio is gearing up for a movie that doesn't exist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guido is trying not to panic. He feels as if he's just arrived in prison camp. He drives fast and straight to Stage 4, and as they head towards the studio, they are immediately swamped. Pierpaolo has a hundred requests for Guido...

Guido walks forward and sits by the camera, as suddenly there's a commotion at the studio door, and Lilli and some of her assistants come through, silhouettes only, followed by a tall figure, who demands the space around her. As the others walk towards a holding area with costumes, and wigs and all manner of items, the woman, who is CLAUDIA, of course, simply walks into the light, her home, and stands there waiting for Guido.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks stunning and glamorous. The epitome of a Sixties movie star. Guido gets up and approaches Claudia.

Dante is thrilled. Fausto is also mesmerised. She's a star, that's the long and short of it.

Guido drives Claudia towards the gates, which swing open. The paparazzi are in waiting and swarm the car, flashbulbs popping, men clambering onto the car for a picture of the Star driving away with her Director. Lots of shouting and pleas, lots of remonstration from Guido. They drive away, and are immediately followed by a posse of photographers on their mopeds and Vespas and little cars.

INT. CAR, ROME OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

Guido's Roadster roars away, the papparazzi posse following. Guido glances at Claudia, loves having her in the car, she's such a class act. He's always inspired. He's driving fast but distracted by her.

The room goes dark, the next reel begins. Guido turns back to look at the screen.

During the reel, Dante is very decisive... shouts out, as the women appear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They come on, one after the other, say their names. Guido gives them things to do. Pick up the phone and argue with your lover. No, make him laugh. Make him want you. Walk towards the camera as if you were frightened. As if you were angry. ON ELEANORA - very angry on the phone:

Another actress appears. It's Donatella. Very nervous. She says her name. Guido instructs her. She tries the phone, the walks. She's not a natural.

Luisa finds the gentle humor in this situation. She looks at Guido. A little smile. He feels it like sunshine. He turns back to the screen.

Another girl: ALESSIA. Very striking. Keeps looking out past the camera, getting sotto voce instructions from Guido. Her hair is in a chignon. She begins her improv, but Guido interrupts her, suddenly appears in front of the camera. Approaches her, and undoes the chignon, freeing her hair. She's beautiful and innocent. Guido says something to her, a whisper. But what he says and how he says it, the smile it provokes, goes like a dagger to Luisa.

Guido's changed, bearded, hair longer and unkempt. Haggard. He looks out to sea, alone, as the waves crash to and fro. A newspaper sits open in front of him. Scribbles and heavy markings circle an ad for a theater production in Rome. Guido gets up at this moment, starts to leave, hesitates, takes the paper, folds it under his arm, and exits the restaurant.

	The only movie I could make now would be... I don't know... would be about a man trying to win back his wife.

FLASH: Lights from a makeup mirror. A glimpse of a female eye applying false eyelashes.

Young Guido, 9, appears and whispers into Guido's ear.

INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A surreal backstage, the cast of Guido's life, whores, models, schoolboys, priests, etc. A show about to begin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music of "Be Italian/Folies Bergere" plays and builds throughout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People run past with props, lights, etc. Showgirls are hurrying. A beautiful confusion.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guido pulls up in his car outside the soundstage. He stops the engine, and sits for a moment in silence. Summoning his courage, he gets out of the car. He is greeted by Pierpaolo. He seems to need and acknowledge his support. Pierpaolo is tender.
</DIRECTION>

	I can't remember how you do this.

INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera moves through the backstage mayhem.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mamma is in her dressing room preparing. Saraghina is sharing a dressing room with a Priest. He is helping with her corset. Carla and Luigi. Carla fixes her husband's hair. Claudia and Stephanie smoke and talk. Lilli adjusts her own, and other men's wardrobe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAGE 5, FILM SET, CINECITTA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guido is in his element again, locked in passionate discussion with an ACTOR and an ACTRESS. In his hand, an actual script. The set surrounding them is modest; a tiny bedroom with a single window and rumpled sheets. The vast film Italia has clearly given way to something smaller, and perhaps truer: the tale of a man and a woman.
</DIRECTION>
<GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to say too much. The first way that we kill our film is by talking about it. But this scene is about reconciliation. And within the scene I would like you to try and find your way to begin that journey back towards each other.

INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMS

Young Guido rushes by the dressing rooms.

INT. STAGE 5, FILM SET, CINECITTA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From high above on the soundstage catwalk, Young Guido watches Older Guido at work.
</DIRECTION>
<GUIDO>
<DIRECTION>
(Continuing to speak to his actors)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's the most important building block that we have to begin again... We start from the beginning each time and I feel today as if I'm starting from the beginning. We'll just keep asking each other questions, and don't look to me for the answers, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUIDO>
<DIRECTION>
On cue, Young Guido opens the door behind him and ushers in THE CAST OF GUIDO'S LIFE. They enter with a sense of anticipation and excitement and arrange themselves on the staircases and scaffolding that loom behind Guido. They are all dressed in angelic white.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Guido is oblivious, focused instead on the task that lies ahead. He talks to his cameraman. Puts down his script. He takes off his jacket and hangs his glasses off his sweater, stands contemplating the set in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<PIERPAOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maestro, should I call final checks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIERPAOLO>
<GUIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUIDO>
<PIERPAOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Makeup, please! Final checks!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIERPAOLO>
<DIRECTION>
A LONG WIDE PAN reveals a tableau vivant looming behind Guido like a glorious choir, his every muse, his every inspiration. They watch him as he begins to work. A part of him now and forever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guido sits on the crane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The soundstage door opens, and we see a small figure slip quietly onto the set. Tentatively, she steps through the shadows. It's Luisa. From a discreet distance, she watches her husband return to his gift.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pierpaolo calls for silence.
</DIRECTION>
<PIERPAOLO>

CLOSE UP ON THE CLAPBOARD. WORKING TITLE: NINE. DIR: G. CONTINI.

As the clapboard strikes.

	Slate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAPPER_LOADER>
<DIRECTION>
At the last moment, Young Guido runs fast, down the maze of steps, across the soundstage and jumps onto the crane with Guido as it begins to rise. Luisa watches. As the last note plays, the crane soars higher, carrying Guido up and up.
