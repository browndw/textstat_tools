An emergency beacon. Under-floor lights go on.

Weir opens his eyes, waking from dream. Sweat beads his ascetic, etched face. Many years a scientist.

	I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.

<WEIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.

Weir folds the paper, lining up point A over point B... then THRUSTING his pen through both, skewering the pin-up.
</DIRECTION>
<WEIR>

Cooper. Outside, braced in the viewport bracket.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

<DIRECTION>
Weir spins and FIRES at Cooper. The nail lodges in the thick quartz glass. A web of cracks spreads out from the bullet, the glass SHRIEKING under the pressure.

Weir takes a step towards the window, raises the gun to fire again.

Miller dives for the door. Before Weir can fire,

EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE WINDOW (HANGING SECTION)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the window EXPLODES outward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ship HOWLS as air rushes out, ripping Weir off his feet. Weir catches himself in the broken window, trying to pull himself back in...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A monitor tears free, SMASHES into him. HE IS SUCKED OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miller pulls himself through the door as it begins to shut. He is safe...

Miller hesitates, looking from Starck back into the safety of the ship. The door continues to shut. In seconds, he will be safe. And she will be dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miller YELLS and rips a compressor from its mount, wedges it in the door to keep it open. He keeps one hand on the door, reaches the other hand to Starck.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me your hand! Your hand!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLER>
<DIRECTION>
She does. Frost forms on their bodies as the air cools. Their veins begin to bulge, blood pulses from their noses. He YELLS with exertion...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...drags her to the door... through the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Miller runs down the corridor. Stops at a bulkhead coupling. Kneels down to remove the cover from an explosive charge, switch it to MANUAL detonation.

Miller runs to the next coupling. Repeats the process...

Cooper exits down a ladder. Starck turns to the console, activates three gravity couches. Behind her, two begin to fill with blue gel...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and one begins to fill with blood... the hint of dark shapes moving within...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Starck doesn't see it, concentrates on the console.

THUMP. THUMP. Starck turns. Sees the bloody tank. Sees something moving inside it.

A corridor beneath the Gravity Couch Bay. Cooper searches through circuit panels until he finds the EMERGENCY BEACON breaker. He runs a by-pass, activating it manually. The lights begins to STROBE...

DRIP. DRIP. A bloodstain spreads over his shoulder. He follows the drip to the ceiling...
</DIRECTION>
<COOPER>

A small cover pops open. Miller reaches in, removes a RADIO DETONATOR.

Miller runs fast. The fire is faster, flooding in behind him.

Miller dashes for the Second Seal as IT BEGINS TO CLOSE. The fire gains on him, surrounding him.

Miller dives through the Second Seal...

<DIRECTION>
INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
...SLAMS into the engineering console. Miller looks back at the Second Seal. It's still open by a fraction when the fire hits it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...SENDING A LANCE OF FLAME stabbing out towards Miller. He rolls aside as the fire hits the console. The console EXPLODES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Second Seal shuts tight, cutting the fire off. The paint on the Second Seal begins to bubble and scorch... and then cools as the fire subsides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miller gets to his feet. Almost allows himself to relax. Then he sees his shadow before him, dancing in the growing red light. He turns...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

The Second Containment is a holocaust. Fire swarms over the walls. Burning jelly drips from Control Spikes. The Core itself is a blazing orb; the gyroscope that holds it glows red-hot.

Miller turns. The Burning Man stands RIGHT BESIDE HIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He SMASHES Miller with a backhand that ignites Miller's clothes and sends him flying. The detonator falls from Miller's grasp, lost beneath two feet of coolant. Miller comes up CHOKING and SPLUTTERING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Burning Man stalks towards Miller. The coolant STEAMS and SIZZLES at his feet.

Miller stares at the Burning Man as he approaches. Slowly rises to his feet.

The Burning Man's flames wane, revealing Weir's misshapen form.

Miller throws a wicked right. Weir catches Miller's fist. SQUEEZES until blood wells up between his fingers. Then slings Miller against a cooling tank with BONE CRACKING force. Miller collapses into the slime, barely able to raise his head to breathe.

Weir staggers. Miller attacks. Again and again and again...

This time Weir is ready. He catches the scrubber and tears it from Miller's grasp. SMASHES Miller to the floor with a single blow. Miller GROANS.

The foredecks teeter on the edge of oblivion...
