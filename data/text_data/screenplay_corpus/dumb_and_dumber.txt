EXT. PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND - WINTER MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN is standing on the street corner waiting for a bus. She's carrying books and looking very collegiate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A black stretch LIMOUSINE with darkened windows drives past, SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES, and backs up. The Young Woman stares at her reflection in the windows, wondering what this is all about.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, the REAR PASSENGER WINDOW zips down, revealing LLOYD CHRISTMAS, age 30. He's a pleasant-enough looking guy, if a little shaggy. He's wearing a dark suit.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>

	Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to the medical school? I'm supposed to be giving a lecture in twenty minutes and my driver's a bit lost.

EXT. MUTT CUTS DOG SALON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This building is white with black spots on it, like a DALMATION. Over the front door is an awning shaped like a DOG'S SNOUT, whiskers included. A van pulls up outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vehicle is decorated like a GIANT POODLE, with four legs hanging off the sides, a tail in the rear, and a dog's snout on the front grill. MUTT CUTS is written on the side of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY DUNNE climbs out. He's in his early 30s and dressed in a ridiculous BEAGLE COSTUME, including a CAP WITH FLOPPY EARS. He goes to the rear of the van, opens it, and a swarm of DOGS pile out.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, gang, single file. You know the rules: No pushing, no humping, and no sniffing heinies...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the shop opens and Harry's annoyed boss, MR. PALMER, sticks his head out.
</DIRECTION>
<PALMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, why aren't those mutts on leashes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PALMER>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The same reason you're not on a leash, sir – because it's demeaning and it chafes like hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<PALMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just get them in here now! They all have to be bathed and clipped in an hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PALMER>
<DIRECTION>
Palmer disappears back inside. Harry CALLS to the dogs but they pay no attention. He struggles to keep them from wandering off. He grabs a couple of SMALL POOCHES and sits them on a wall.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You kids stay right here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>

As he turns to round up the other, we discover that the wall isn't a wall – it's a flatbed truck. The truck drives away, taking the two dogs with it.

Lloyd Christmas pulls the limousine into a long, tree-lined driveway. He gets out and looks up in awe at an IMPRESSIVE STONE MANSION. He WHISTLES to himself, then walks to the front door and RINGS THE BELL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The double-front doors of the mansion open and MARY SWANSON appears. She's 25 and gorgeous. Lloyd's jaw drops open when he lays eyes on her.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>

Lloyd is driving and Mary is in the back, looking out the window, lost in thought. She's got a BRIEFCASE resting on her lap and she fingers the leather nervously. Lloyd keeps glancing at her in the rear-view mirror, but for a moment he is speechless. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why you going to the airport? Flying somewhere?

<MARY>

ON LLOYD - we can almost see his mind work. He's desperate to impress her.

<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, this isn't my real job, you know. It's only temporary.

</LLOYD>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh?

</MARY>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you see, my friend Harry and I are saving up our money so we can open our own pet store.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I beg your pardon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what we're gonna call it: I Got Worms. We're gonna specialize in selling worm farms – you know, like ant farms. A lot of people don't realize that worms make much better pets than ants. They're quiet, affectionate, they don't bite, and they're super with the kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't ants quiet, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Lloyd realizes she has a point.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... well, sure – but they aren't half as affectionate. And if you cut an ant's head off, it won't grow back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And best of all, worm farming is a seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year industry. I wouldn't mind having a piece of that pie, if you know what I mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
To her credit, she doesn't. They continue driving. Mary looks at her watch and crosses her legs. Lloyd can see that she's concerned about something.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>

</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Lloyd SWIVELS AROUND and STARES over his shoulder at her.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's really nothing to worry about, Mary. Statistically, they say you're more likely to get killed on the way to the airport. You know, like in a head-on crash, or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, Lloyd, could please keep your eyes on the road.

<LLOYD>

Then she PICKS UP HER BRIEFCASE and walks into the terminal, followed by a PORTER pushing her bags. Lloyd watches her, ENCHANTED, until she's out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Afterwards, he climbs back into the limo, LOVESICK. For a moment he doesn't even have the energy to turn the key. He just drops his head against the steering wheel, DEVASTATED. There's a TAP on the window. Lloyd looks up to see a POLICE OFFICER standing there.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_OFFICER>

	Come on, move it, you're in a red zone.

She passes a row of phone botths and two MEN – one dressed in an ARMANI SUIT, the other in a PLAID SPORTCOAT – watch her.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMANI_SUIT>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Lloyd pulls his limo slowly away, he glances in the airport window and SEES MARY WALKING ALONG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she stops at the foot of the escalator, he stops, too. She puts down the briefcase and checks her coat pocket for her ticket. Lloyd's attention is distracted by a HONK. He turns to see a car directly behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
(to car's driver)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drive around me, you pinhead!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
When he turns back to watch Mary in the terminal he sees that SHE'S GONE, and she's LEFT HER BRIEFCASE AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS. Lloyd jumps to ATTENTION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls the car into a HANDICAPPED SPOT and hops out. He starts to run into the terminal, then notices the Police Officer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk, limping and dragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL
</DIRECTION>

The Armani Man nods to the Plaid Sportcoat and he starts to approach the briefcase. Just as Plaid Sportcoat is reaching for the handle, LLOYD RUNS BY AND GRABS IT. He CONTINUES UP THE ESCALATOR three steps at a time. The two men look at each other, dumbstruck.

The place is a mess. Wallpaper's peeling off the walls. The carpet is threadbare and filthy. In the corner we see a miniature WORM FARM and a large terrarium filled with dirt and worms. Here are a couple pieces of haggard furniture with stuffing spilling out of the gashes.

Lloyd is now FAST ASLEEP in the passenger seat as Harry drives on. A roadsign reading DENVER - 602 MILES whizzes by. Todd Rundgren's "Too Far Gone" begins to play while Harry peers at the empty highway INTROSPECTIVELY. As the song plays we see a series of quick shots:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A new sign says DENVER - 421 MILES. Lloyd is still asleep with his feet now on Harry's lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another sign reads DENVER - 201 MILES. Harry stares straight ahead, practically catatonic. Lloyd's feet are out the window and his head is on Harry's lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The next roadsign says DENVER - 157 MILES. Lloyd's feet are now up over the headrest and his head is down where his feet should be. Harry looks on the verge of blacking out.

Finally, a sign reads COLORADO STATE LINE - 25 MILES/FOOD, GAS NEXT EXIT.

The Mutt Cutts van pulls up to a gas pump. In the background are several tractor-trailer rigs and a café. Harry climbs out, thoroughly exhausted, walks around and opens the passenger door.

Lloyd tumbles to the asphalt, STILL ASLEEP. Harry nudges him with his foot.

Harry is yawning as he pumps the gas. Suddenly a Jeep Cherokee pulls up and a long-legged, tanned, ATHLETIC BEAUTY climbs out. This seems to wake Harry up.

The Athletic Beauty smiles at Harry as she grabs a pump and starts to fill her jeep. Harry makes a feeble attempt to brush his hair into place, then CLEARS HIS THROAT and nods to the skis on her roof-rack.

Lloyd is standing in a stall urinating. He starts to read the graffiti scrawled on the wall. Finally, he comes to one that says: FOR A GOOD TIME, MEET ME HERE NOVEMBER 8, 1993, 2:15 A.M. SHARP.

He frowns at this, then looks nervously at his watch.

Just as a concerned look crosses Lloyd's face, we hear the BATHROOM DOOR SQUEAK OPEN AND SLAM SHUT! Terrified, Lloyd quickly locks the stall door, then crouches on the toilet bowl so his feet aren't visible. The sound of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS approaches the stall and then stops. Lloyd looks down to see a pair of SIZE 16 WORKBOOTS beneath the door. We can barely hear a LOW GROWL. Then the stall handle JIGGLES. Lloyd holds his breath. The ominous boots MOVE AWAY and Lloyd lets out a SIGH OF RELIEF.

All of a sudden the DOOR IS KICKED IN, AND A TOWERING FIGURE STEPS INTO FRAME. Lloyd looks up and GASPS.

As she starts to rummage through her purse, Harry SMELLS THE SMOKE. He looks down and sees that his RIGHT SHOE IS ABLAZE! He shakes it, then tries to put it out with the other shoe, but to no avail. Meanwhile, the Athletic Beauty is still searching for a pen.

	Well let me put it this way, Lloyd: Do you remember when we were Cub Scouts and we got lost in the woods during that blizzard? We huddled together all night, and we made an oath that if we ever got out of there alive we'd never ever leave each other's side again. Do you remember that?

Lloyd smiles and over tips him.

<BARNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you so much, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNARD>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the tray down, hands Lloyd the newspaper, and heads for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, one more thing: You can dispense with the 'sir' crap. Let's face it, Barney, we're all from the same mold.

	We just have a little more dough than you right now.

Barnard smiles and EXITS. Harry comes back in the room. He picks up a champagne glass and flicks it with his finger, sending out a resonant RING.

He shoves the newspaper at Harry.

MONTAGE OF HARRY AND LLOYD'S GLAMOUR MAKE-OVER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-The boys are in a beauty parlor getting their hair shampooed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-Harry and Lloyd sit beneath old-fashioned hair dryers. The ATTENDANTS lift the dryers from their heads, revealing both guys' hair in curlers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-Lloyd's getting shaved by an ATTENDANT with a straight-razor. Suddenly Lloyd grabs his neck as if he's been nicked. BLOOD SQUIRTS OUT from between his fingers. The other CUSTOMERS stare in horror at this. Lloyd LAUGHS and shows everyone a SQUEEZE KETCHUP BOTTLE hidden in his hand. Only Harry and Lloyd seem to find this joke amusing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-We see them getting their nose hairs clipped. PAN DOWN to the floor to reveal a PILE OF NOSE HAIR CLIPPINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-Then a shot of a MAN next to them getting a pedicure. PAN OVER to Lloyd's bare feet – he has toe nails like Howard Hughes. Sparks are flying as an ATTENDANT wearing safety goggles tries to sand down Lloyd's toenails with an electric sander.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-Harry is lying on his stomach with his shirt off, getting a massage from a beautiful ORIENTAL MASSEUSE. He pulls a hundred dollar bill from under his towel, hands it to her, and WHISPERS in her ear. She smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-Next we see the Oriental Masseuse lying on her stomach with her shirt off, while Harry happily massages her back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-The guys are in an expensive haberdashery. Harry comes out of the dressing room in a very elegant BLACK TUXEDO. He couldn't look any more suave. The SALEMAN nods, impressed, but Lloyd shakes his head no and Harry goes back in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-Harry reappears in another stylish WHITE TUXEDO. The Salesman looks on hopefully, but Lloyd again disapproves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-This time Harry comes out in a JUNIOR-PROM-LIKE SKY-BLUE TUXEDO, complete with TACKY FRILLS. The Salesman looks sickened as Lloyd give Harry the thumbs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN ACROSS THE STREET from the haberdashery - an apprehensive J.P. Shay is sitting in a parked car, WATCHING HARRY AND LLOYD.

EXT. ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Throngs of GUESTS in black-tie and elegant gowns are entering the building. Suddenly the hearse pulls up – with Harry and Lloyd BUMPER SURFING BEHIND IT. Harry's wearing his blue tuxedo. Lloyd's tux isn't any better – it's pumpkin orange. (THEY'VE GOT MATCHING TOP HATS AND CANES.) When the hearse stops, the boys hand the driver – Barnard – a couple hundred dollars.

Nicholas Andre is greeting people at the door. However, when Harry and Lloyd try to enter, he stops them and gives them the once over.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, gentlemen, but this is a five-hundred-dollar-a-plate dinner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDRE>
<DIRECTION>
Harry and Lloyd look at each other and shrug. Then Lloyd takes out a WAD OF BILLS and peels off TEN HUNDREDS, much to the amazement of Andre.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This should cover a couple plates.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm kind of hungry, Lloyd. What if we want seconds?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Lloyd thinks about this. Then he peels off another thou.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put us down for four plates, my good man.

They ENTER the party. As Andre watches them go, his associate – J.P. Shay – comes up beside him, an alarmed look on his face.

	I'm getting nervous, Harry.

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	relax, Lloyd. These people are just like you and me.

</HARRY>
<LLOYD>

	What are you talking about? They're educated, well-bred, charming, and sophisticated.

</LLOYD>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what? We can be sophistica – holy shit, would you look at the fun bags on that hose hound.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He points out a busty BLONDE BOMBSHELL entering the party. Lloyd rolls his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do this to me, Harry. I'm already a wreck. What if Mary doesn't like me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, let's just go saddle up to the bar and down a couple bowls of loudmouth soup. A little booze'll bring back that old Lloyd Christmas over-confidence.

</HARRY>

The guys stand out at the glittering social scene as they make their way to the bar.

	Shut up, Harry.

</HARRY>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well I know what you were gonna say and I'm telling you to shut up in advance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know what I was gonna say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I read you like a book.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, if you read me like a book then what was I gonna say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were gonna say:
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(in Harry's looped VOICE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'That's one fiery bush I wouldn't mind roasting my weenie in.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Harry raises his eyebrows, IMPRESSED.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I would say 'shut up', because this is our chance to get in with the rich and powerful and you don't ingratiate yourself to the kind of people by acting like Ron Jeremy on Spanish Fly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
The Bartender delivers their martinis as we hear the o.s. CLINKING of a glass. The guys turns to see Nicholas Andre standing at a podium. Next to him is a LARGE, COVERED DISPLAY. On his other side are Karl and Elizabeth Swanson.

<ANDRE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to thank you all for coming to this very special event. As you know, the Aspen Preservation Society - founded and chiefly funded by our great benefactors, Karl and Helen Swanson - is the world's foremost defender of endangered species. Our sprawling grounds are home to twenty- three separate varieties of animals that are currently listed on the United Nation's charter of protected species. Tonight, we are deeply honored to have Mr. Karl Swanson welcome our twenty-fourth.

<MR_SWANSON>

	These magnificent specimens were rescued recently, culminating a five- year, two-million-dollar effort on our part. Together, they constitute one-seventh of the snow owl population left on the planet.

ON ANDRE - he's nervously eyeing Harry and Lloyd. He looks pale.

	Here these lovely birds will be allowed to breed in a natural but protected habitat. And, God willing, with your help and that of the Society's, we will see these wonderful creatures flourish once more.

More APPLAUSE.

<DIRECTION>
The crowd APPLAUDS and begins to mingle again. Lloyd turns back to the Bartender and holds up his empty glass.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two more, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Harry stares at Lloyd with concern.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lloyd, I've never seen you this uptight. You've gotta chill out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't help it. This is a very important night for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry, have you ever wondered why you and I never have long-term girlfriends?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about? I went out with Fraida Felcher for two and a half weeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a fluke.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The reason we never have long-term girlfriends is because of one thing: We're afraid of the C word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's crazy. We live for the C word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm talking bout commitment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I'm ready for commitment, Harry. The first time I laid eyes on Mary Swanson, I knew she was the one.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some things you feel in your heart, other things you feel in your groin. This girl makes me feel it all in the heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Lloyd notices something across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - a beguiling Mary Swanson is talking with a couple of guests. She's wearing a spectacular black cocktail dress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lloyd quickly turns toward the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit, there she is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(checking her out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. You weren't kidding, Lloyd. She's an angel.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what are you waiting for? Get over there and talk to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's gonna think I'm some kind of psycho when she realizes how far I came just to see her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have her briefcase – she's gonna be thrilled to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then what? She'll take it back and that'll be it. I'm a nobody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Harry thinks about this a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, man, you just drove two thousand miles to see this girl. Don't quit on the last fifty feet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
(brightening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a second, I have an idea. You go over and introduce yourself. That way you can build me up so when I come along I won't have to brag about myself. Tell her I'm good-looking and I'm rich and I have a rapist's wit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't tell her you're good looking, Lloyd – she's got eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Lloyd takes a big gulp of his new martini.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please Harry, I'm appealing to you as one loser to another. Just build me up and then give me a signal to come over. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Harry SIGHS.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. But you're gonna owe me a big one for this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry straightens his polka-dot bow-tie, then APPROACHES Mary, who is now standing alone, admiring the owls.

	Nice set of hooters you got there.

Mary turns to Harry, stunned.

<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you a bird lover?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I used to have a parakeet, but my main area of expertise is canines – that's dogs to the layperson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles at this.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. I love dogs, too. So how are you involved with them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I've trained them, bathed them, clipped them; I've even bred them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Any unusual breeding?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, mostly just doggie-style. But one time we successfully mated a Bulldog and a Shitzu.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? That's weird.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. We called it a Bullshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(breaks out LAUGHING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a little breeder joke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She seems strangely charmed by this.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, the real reason I came over is because I want to introduce you to a friend of mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, Mary's stepmother approaches. She's holding a martini and looking a little sloshed.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary, I don't believe I've met your friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MARY>

	Actually, we haven't been introduced yet.

	Harry Dunne. Pleasure meeting you both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<HELEN>

	I saw you come in earlier, Mr. Dunne. I was hoping we'd get a chance to meet.

<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(taken aback)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were?

</HARRY>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That tuxedo – I love a man with a sense of humor. So does Mary.

</HELEN>

Mary shoots Helen a look, then smiles at Harry.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, he's caught up in Mary's eyes, but then manages to snap out of it.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, about my friend –
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--Are you doing anything tomorrow, Mr. Dunne? Because I believe Mary's looking for somebody to hit the slopes with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whuh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Helen, you're embarrassing me.

</MARY>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well you are, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Harry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor girl doesn't get out enough. So what do you say, Harry? Are you available?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Harry thinks about this, then looks across the room at a hopeful Lloyd.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I don't know. You see, my friend –

</HARRY>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--Forget your friends for one day. You and Mary will have a ball.

Mary's captivating eyes meet his, waiting for an answer.

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um... well... I don't know. You see, the thing is... sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
ON LLOYD - he waits impatiently at the bar as Harry returns.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come you didn't call me over?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax, you're golden. I got you a date with her tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Lloyd falls back against the bar and grabs his chest. He's SPEECHLESS.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wha... you... I... it's...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, man. I love you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Lloyd clamps an embarrassed Harry in a TIGHT EMBRACE.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, get a grip, Lloyd. You're making a scene.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Lloyd steps back elated.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This calls for a toast!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs a bottle of champagne out of a bucket and starts to open it.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gonna be my best man, Har, I mean it. It was always between you and my future wife's brother, but you just earned a seat at the head table, pal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the CORK SHOOTS OUT OF THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE AND ZIPS ACROSS THE ROOM LIKE A BULLET – DIRECTLY TOWARD ONE OF THE NOW EVEN WIDER- EYED OWLS. In quick succession we hear a BOK!, a SQUAWK!, and a THUMP!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HUSH falls over the entire party as everyone turns their stunned attention to the cage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV - feathers are floating in the air throughout the cage, and one of the Icelandic Snow Owls LIES ON ITS BACK, its species now one bird closer to extinction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry and Lloyd look on in horror. Harry takes the smoking champagne bottle from Lloyd and places it on the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(under breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we've done enough hobnobbing, Lloyd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
The guys LOWER THEIR HEADS and slink out of the room before anyone can figure out what happened – anyone except for Nicholas Andre, that is; we PAN to show that he's been standing nearby watching their every move. And he doesn't look very happy.

Mary is obviously thrown by this question.

<LLOYD>
