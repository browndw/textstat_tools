A misty OUT-OF-FOCUS SHOT of a black panther pacing behind cage bars. Over this come the production credits. A pale fog rises over the shot of the black panther, and over it Is SUPERIMPOSED the following quotation:

As the last word of the quotation FADES from the screen, the fog clears, the caged leopard comes into full focus, and we see that it is an actual leopard behind actual bars. Over the scene is the wheezy music of the Triumphal March from "Aida," as played on a hand, organ. This is playing in the distance, and we do not see the organ-grinder until later.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA DRAWS BACK to show a young artist sitting before the cage on a campstool with a drawing portfolio in her hand. She is presumably sketching the panther, although her drawing is not shown, and we do not see the features of the girl's face. The girl picks up the drawing and holds it off, weighing its values. It evidently does not meet with her approval, for she wads the drawing Into a ball and turns to look for a place to throw the waste paper. We see her face. It is heart-shaped, demure, even a little naive. She is small, young,and very beautiful. In one hand the wad of waste paper is poised, ready to throw into a container.

She starts off down the promenade. She walks briskly in one direction, while Oliver turns the other way, ambling toward the leopard cage. Along the promenade a file of Saturday afternoon idlers goes by. Oliver moves up to the cages and pauses at the guard rail before the leopard cage. Near him sits Irena, busily sketching. Oliver looks at her, but she does not look up at him. She gets up and moves a few steps, her eyes intent on the movements of the panther, which is walking about In its cage. Oliver politely steps aside so that she can get a better vantage point. She does not even notice him. She frowns at her drawing, wads the paper into a ball, and turns to throw it into the container. Oliver steps before her, smiling and extending his hand. She looks at him a moment, then smiles and drops the wad of paper into his hand.

With an easy aim, Oliver tosses it neatly into the container and turns to her with a shrug, as if to say how easy it was. But Irena has picked up another drawing upon which she has worked and is now studying it. The music of the organ-grinder grows constantly louder as the scene progresses.

Irena laughs and starts to pick up the paper, but a gust of wind blows it down the promenade. She turns to Oliver and shrugs her shoulders. She starts to fold up her campstool. Oliver comes forward to offer his assistance. At the same time the organ-grinder passes between them and the camera, playing "Aida" on his hand organ. Oliver asks Irena if he may help her, but the music is so loud she cannot hear him. He assists Irena in gathering up her things. He takes the campstool, and Irena carries her artist's portfolio. They start toward the avenue together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of the torn drawing as a little wind, carrying with it some autumn leaves, picks up the paper again and blows it over and over up the promenade. The torn half of the drawing falls over into place, so we see what Irena had been drawing. It is a smart fashion sketch of the type seen in Vogue or Harper's Bazaar, but the face of the model is the blunt mask of a black panther, and the hands protruding from the sleeves are tipped with feline talons.

Irena swings the door wide open. Through the doorway a little bit of the room can be seen. Prominently displayed is an odd equestrian statuette. It is the figure of a man in armor, carved out of gray stone. The man wears a regal chaplet on his head and is mounted on a magnificent horse. Around the base of the statue is a circle of flames, while the rider holds high above his head a sword upon which is impaled the figure of a writhing cat. Irena takes a step into the room and stands waiting for Oliver to follow her, then turns to look back at him. He has become aware of the perfume in the room.

As the CAMERA HOLDS on the statuette, a light appears in a bay window across the street, bringing the figures of horse, king, and cat into dramatic focus. Over the shot we hear Irena's voice humming "Berceuses du Chat" by Stravinsky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS to show Irena and Oliver seated together on a couch near the window. Because of the dim light in the room they can barely be seen. Oliver is listening to her sing. She ends her song, and they sit quietly for a moment. Suddenly, as sometimes happens, there is a lull in the traffic outside. In this momentary stillness, this stillness in which a great city seems to catch its breath, Oliver hears the sound of distant roaring, muffled and yet full of savage reverberation.

She turns on the lamp. Now, in the light, we see her apartment — a nicely proportioned living room with a little fireplace set under a neat Georgian mantel. Doors at either end of the room lead off into small bedrooms. Behind a fantastic three-part screen on which is painted the long, sleek figure of a black leopard against a background of jungle foliage, is concealed the two-burner stove, tiny sink, and old-fashioned icebox which make up the kitchenette. In the other corner, under the wide window, are a drawing board and a desk, littered with crayons, brushes, bottles of discolored water, and papers. On one side of the wall, in neat frames, hang three of Grandville's amusing studies of cats dressed as humans. Over the mantel hangs a beautiful reproduction of Goya's sinister portrait of Don Manuel Osorio do Zunlga and the cats. In front of Oliver, on the coffee table, are the remnants of their tea.

<IRENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not really a cat. It's meant to represent the evil ways into which my village once had fallen. You see, the Mamelukes came to Serbia long, long ago, and they made the people slaves. But my village was too little, too far away in the mountains. They left it alone. For five hundred years my little village was cut off from the Mother Church. At first the people were good and worshipped God in a true Christian way. But, little by little, the people changed. When King John drove out the Mamelukes and came to our village he found dreadful things. The people bowed down to Satan and said their Masses to him. They had become witches and were evil. King John put some of them to the sword and burned some of them in fires.

WIDE VIEW. The Consolidated Ship and Barge Construction Company has a handsome drafting office. Severe and modern, it is nevertheless a room that immediately suggests shipbuilding. A wide doorway opens in from the hall, in the f.g. are three draftsmen's tables, glass-topped and lighted from beneath. Behind them are several tables for other workers. There are a number of rows of filing cabinets, and at one side is a water cooler. The back wall of the office is unadorned, wide, and slightly curving. At the moment, a group of office workers are just starting to paste up the sectional plans of a ship, entitled "PROJECT NO. 457," on this wall. The ship's bow can be seen taking form in detailed constructional profile.

Two of the three draftsmen's tables in the f.g. are now occupied. Oliver sits working at one of them. The center one is unoccupied. At the other one, a tall, lean Englishman works. This is James Carver. At the back wall, Alice Moore is supervising two workers, who are doing the actual pasting. She holds in her hands a small sheet of paper with the detailed mathematical measurements of the project,

Beside her, Commodore Judson, head of the Consolidated Ship and Barge Construction Company, stands watching the beginning of the project with genuine delight.

Alice turns and goes to the desk between Oliver and Jim Carver. She picks up a sheet of paper from the desk and is just about to return to the wall, when she is stopped by the sound of a cat's mewing. She listens. The mew is repeated. Carver raises his head and also listens. Alice takes a look at the floor under and around her desk, Oliver is still bending over his work, Alice looks suspiciously and questioningly at Carver, Carver replies by throwing his hands out to show that he doesn't know,and then pointing to himself and shaking his head to announce that the mew is not coming from him. The mewing continues during this, which is one reason Carver and Alice do not speak. They are listening. Alice and Carver both turn and look at Oliver, He knows very well that they are looking at him, and his pose is one of elaborate innocence. There is a light cardboard box on his desk.

He takes the kitten out of the box and sets it on the floor. Irena stoops down beside it. Seeing her, the kitten draws back, arching itself. Oliver, puzzled, looks from the cat to Irena. She leans forward, smiling, trying to coax the kitten to come to her. The kitten snarls and spits viciously at her. Oliver scoops it up in his hands.

INT. PET STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All is tranquil in Miss Plunkett's Pet Shoppe. Outside it is raining, a soft autumn rain. Miss Plunkett sits nodding. Most of the birds and animals are sleeping. Above Miss Plunkett, in a circular stand, a brilliant macaw swings. It looks very much like Miss Plunkett, and, like her, is peacefully nodding in sleep. A little bell tinkles, and there is the sound of the door opening and closing. Miss Plunkett sleeps right on. We see that Irena and Oliver have entered the shop. Immediately there is a transformation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The birds begin to call back and forth to one another, their calls growing excited, shrill. The monkeys, awakened, clamber excitedly in their cages, whimpering and chattering madly. The puppies begin to bark, the cats to meow. In a moment the sound has grown to sheer cacophony. The macaw, too, has awakened, and is screeching its head off. Miss Plunkett snaps out of her stolen rest and looks about her, blinking curiously. Her lips form the words of amazement, "Landie, dearie me!" but there is so much noise now that nothing she says can be heard. She looks up to see what may have startled the animals into such noisy activity;

<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT of Irena and Oliver, as they stand, perplexed by all the commotion. Oliver is closing an umbrella. Miss Plunkett comes into the scene. She tries to yell to the animals to bo quiet. The noise is too much for her. Oliver tries to explain to Miss Plunkett that he wants to exchange the kitten, which he holds in the box in his hands, for a canary, but he cannot make himself heard. She only shakes her head and tries to say something at which Oliver shakes his head. Irena touches Oliver's arm, indicating that it might bo better to go outside. Oliver points outdoors to Miss Plunkett. She nods and follows them out onto the street.

EXT. & INT. SERBIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The Belgrade, as seen through the plate glass window from outside. It la snowing, the first light snow of the winter. In the window on display are three calves' heads prepared in Serbian fashion. They have been skinned. The eyes, considered a great delicacy by gourmets, are wide open and glisten like bullets. The heads are crowned with chaplets of artificial flowers. In the b.g. we see the wedding party. Seated around a table are Oliver, Irena, Alice, the Commodore, Jim Carver, and some of the other people we have seen on the office sequences. Irena is dressed in a light suit and wears a bridal bouquet on her shoulder. She is laughing a natural, happy laugh to contrast with the later hysterical laugh. The proprietor of the restaurant has just brought proudly to the table from the kitchen a large iron kettle from which the steam of hot wine is rising.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA TRUCKS THROUGH to the wedding party. A trio of musicians, dressed in Balkan costume, is playing a Balkan love song. Jim Carver, like everyone else in the party, has been drinking, and is in a gay mood. As the proprietor places the iron kettle on the table, Carver applauds.

MED. CLOSE SHOT of a woman who is seated at a little table at the far side of the restaurant. She is in evening dress, but is dining alone. The woman looks like a cat. She has a round, tabby face and a pompadour which somehow suggests the roundness of a cat's head. The eyes, slanting, large, and very light in color, fringed with sweeping lashes, are completely feline. She turns these great, luminous eyes in the direction of the wedding party and stares at the festivities.

The panther screen is glowing in the bright sunlight streaming through the window. The sun throws a shadow onto the screen just over the panther. It is the enlarged shadow of tbe bird cage, with the canary hopping about inside the bars.

<DIRECTION>
CAMERA DRAWS BACK to show Irena at her desk. She has just finished working on a sketch. Now she gets up, stretching and turning. Her eyes fall on the bird in its cage, and she crosses over to it, the CAMERA MOVING with her. The bird huddles on its perch, frightened, Irena tries to encourage it to sing. She whistles a few notes. Still no response. She opens the small door of the cage, and puts her hand inside to take hold of the canary. The bird flutters wildly. Before she can get hold of it, it falls to the cage floor and lies there. Irena picks it up tenderly and holds it in her hands. The bird is dead. Irena is serious and concerned as she puts the bird down on a table, opens a drawer, and takes out an empty bonbon box. Very carefully she places the dead bird in the box, and ties it up with a bit of ribbon. She puts on her hat and coat, gets a trowel chat Is on.

A policeman has rounded a corner of the path, and is coming toward her amiably swinging his nightstick, as he whistles "Who?" Irena swiftly pushes the purse back on her arm and continues walking along the path, passing the policeman, who goes right on whistling.

Irena comes up the walk. The panther is pacing back and forth behind the bars. It stops pacing as she passes the cage. She, too, stops, and looks at the beast.

There is no response. The man gets up, so that we see him in silhouette. He crosses the room and draws the curtains, letting in the brilliant sunlight. Irena lies with eyes closed, breathing with the shallow, regular breath of sleep, undisturbed by the harsh light.

<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT of Irena and Dr. Louis Judd. He stands for a moment watching her. Judd is a harshly ugly man of early middle ago. There is an arrogance in his bearing which makes some women see him as the suave, continental man, perfectly sure of his success with any woman. His consulting room is clean, antiseptic, and sparsely furnished with a couch, a chair, and a gooseneck lamp on a stand. Irena is lying on the couch. Judd, standing beside her, makes a few notations on a pad. Then he lightly pats her cheek to wake her. She comes from sleep very quietly.

	Those things are very simple to psychiatrists. You told me of your childhood. Perhaps we'll find this trouble stems from some early experience. You said you didn't know your father...that he had died in some mysterious accident in the forest before your birth...and because of that the children teased you and called your mother a witch...a cat woman. These childhood tragedies are inclined to corrode the soul, to leave a canker in the mind, but we will try to repair the damage.

Her manner is very cold. She gives them both a long look, and walks away to stand by the window, gazing out, with her back toward them. Alice looks guiltily at Oliver, shrugs her shoulders, and picks up her hat and coat from a near-by chair.

<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. I seem to have put my big foot in it.

With another-guilty look at Oliver, Alice closes the door behind her. The moment the door clicks shut, Irena turns to face Oliver. She is furious, hurt, offended. Oliver tries to make nice with her.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irena is unable to sleep. A bright moon drives a shaft of misty light through the window and across her bed. She turns restlessly, gets up, and goes to the window for a moment to look out. From the park comes the sound of the lions and one eerie, piercing shriek that she knows is the leopard's cry. She trembles, perhaps with cold, perhaps with some emotion that she cannot understand. She comes to a decision, throws a fur coat over her nightdress, outs on a pair of galoshes over her bedroom slippers, and lets herself out of the room.

INT. IRENA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Irena hesitates as she tiptoes across the studio room of her apartment. The moonlight Is pouring in through the window, throwing the familiar objects of the room Into mysterious half-shadows. She goes quietly over to the other door, opens it quietly, and looks in.

EXT. THE PANTHER'S CAGE - PARK - DAY

Irena stands at the guard rail, watching the old keeper unlock the cage door and throw in the big, bloody chunks of meat. He is singing again his monotonous, nasal song, but even his singing cannot drown out the noisy feeding of the panther as it gnaws and tears at the meat. When he has thrown in the last chunk, he slams shut the cage door and moves on. It is a gusty, blowy day of hard, inconstant winds. Irena notices that he has left the key in the look of the cage.

	I don't feel that way about Irena. It's a different feeling. I'm drawn to her. There's a warmth from her that pulls at me...I have to watch her when she's in the room. I have to touch her when she's near. But I don't really know her. In many ways were strangers.

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oliver comes up in front of the office building that houses the Consolidated Ship and Barge Construction Company. A plaque on an entrance cornerstone bears the name of the company. There has been snow, followed by thaw, so that the streets are wet. Oliver stands on the wet street, watching the revolving door slowly move around with abrupt jerks. No one, however, is in any of the door compartments. Then as the door comes around, we see that in one of the compartments, on her hands and knees, scrubbing the floor, is a thin charwoman, Mrs. Agnew, her blowsy hair falling down over her face. As she gets around in front of Oliver, she looks up, brushing the hair out of her eyes. A lighted cigarette, with a long ash dangles from one corner of her mouth. She picks up her bucket and scrubbing brush and starts to move out of Oliver's way.

Now she turns out the light above her desk, leaving the room illuminated by a single light near the door. On her under-lit drafting table, taking full advantage of the warmth, his forepaws snuggled under his chin, is the most decorous sort of office cat. He looks like a bookkeeper.

EXT. A ROOFTOP OPPOSITE IRENA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Along the rooftop of the building opposite Irena's apartment glide a couple of mangy alley oats. They lead into the scene. Seeing Irena's lighted window, they seat themselves on the parapet side and look down into the lighted square of the window. Through it Irena can be seen on her knees, her hands folded in prayer. Her lips are moving.

ANOTHER ANGLE SHOOTING :fI*bm^;:VohlMv;th6?ae^h^1M'V/¦::,iV^ cat in line; a little further to one side than the other. From this vantage point we can see down into Irena's apartment.

Suddenly, Irena rises swiftly to her feet, and with a quick, violent movement she sweeps the statue to the floor. The cats, frightened, scamper away over the rooftops.

EXT. PARK WALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Irena steps out from the shadows around the park wall. She draws up her fur collar over the lower part of her face and turns toward the transverse walk. On the sound track the music for "Berceuses du Chat" begins in an eerie, minor key.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRANSVERSE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irena pauses at the entrance to the transverse. Ahead of her, walking briskly about one hundred feet in advance is Alice. There are no other pedestrians on the narrow transverse walk. The street and sidewalk are glistening wet and reflect the pools of light from the street lamps. The melting snow drips down the stone walls. Irena turns into the transverse and starts to walk after Alice.

SHOT of Alice, as she walks along. On one side of her are the high, rock walls of the transverse; on the other is the street.

SHOT of Irena, as she, too, walks along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - street lamp on transverse. It throws a circular pool of light, Alice emerges from the darkness, crosses the area of light, and continues on into the darkness. The soft click of her heels fades into the distance. Even as the sound of her steps fades, the sound of Irena's steps comes into the scene. Irena comes from the darkness, crosses the area of light, and continues oh after Alice into the darkness.

CLOSEUP of Alice's feet as they walk along, the heels clicking on the wet pavement.

CLOSEUP of Irena's feet as they walk along, her heels likewise clicking on the pavement.

<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT of a lighted area, as Alice again walks through a circle of light. She walks directly through and into the darkness beyond, her footsteps clicking on the pavement. As her footsteps fade, we would logically hear Irena's steps coming onto the scene. But we do not. There is nothing, only the sound of Alice's heels fading into the distance. The music of the "Berceuses du Chat" rises and fades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT of Alice as she walks along, the CAMERA TRUCKING with her. There is the sound of her feet on the pavement. She stops in a pool of street light, frowning, sensing the presence of something behind her. She glances over her shoulder, then looks around. The music is growing louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT of the glistening wet transverse walk, as Alice sees it -- a dark, deserted walk, fading off to a perspective line. It is lighted by regularly spaced street lamps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT of Alice, as she peers more closely into the darkness. She is troubled. The silence is ominous. She frowns apprehensively, turns, and starts to walk on a little faster. She turns her head slightly, but does not dare look behind her. She increases her pace and walks very rapidly through the next area of light and on into the darkness. The sound of her own steps is loud, and she begins to run. She reaches the next pool of light, stops stock still, panic-stricken, afraid to move. Outside the circle of light is only blackness and silence, Alice's frightened eyes poor into the darkness. She shrinks against the lamp post. Sheer terror crosses her face. Suddenly there is a roaring sound that fills the sound track, completely drowning the loud music. A pattern of light cuts across Alice's face. She throws up one arm, almost as if to defend herself. There is a hissing, screeching sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT of a transverse bus, as with a hiss of air brakes it stops directly alongside Alice. She grasps the platform rail to steady herself. The doors open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUS DRIVER Climb on, sister.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice steps up. A snarl sounds in the darkness, looks behind her. Her eyes are carried upward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wet shrubbery at the top of wall stirs, settling, as if something had only that moment passed through it.

Alice is looking back over her shoulder, fascinated by what she has seen. She is standing just within the bus, but the driver cannot close the door.

A mounted policeman, in glistening raincoat and cape, sits quietly on his horse. A cone of lamplight illuminates him. Overhead, from the bridge, a dark shadow glides. There is the deadened sound or padded paws on the stonework of the bridge. The horse, sensing the presence and hearing the sound, rears suddenly and plunges. The policeman struggles to rein in the maddened animal.

The policeman gets the horse in hand, although it continues to snort and start nervously. He bends down from the saddle to pat the horse's lathered neck.

CLOSE SHOT of the prints of an animal In the soft mud around the body of the fourth lamb.

CAMERA MOVES a few feet beyond the body. Here, going off toward the sheep pasture gate, are more prints, but not the prints of the animal. Those are the dainty imprints of a woman's slippered-foot.

The caretaker, stunned and a little frightened by what he has seen, brings a whistle up to his lips,and blows it shrilly.

Irena is standing under a street lamp. She seems dazed and bewildered. She is dabbing at her lips with her handkerchief. The caretaker's whistle is blowing in the distance.

She is blinking in the glare of the light, She looks ghastly, white, and drawn, her shoes and stockings are wet, muddied, torn. She has lost her hat, and her hair is in wild disorder. In her hand she is crumpling and re-crumpling a soiled lace handkerchief.

SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT. An army of gigantic, thin, angular cats marches up from the back of the screen until their weird shapes, and glowing eyes fill the entire screen from frame to frame. Then through their ranks comes stalking a knight in chain armor with ragged grave cerements for cloak and tabard. He is unearthly tall and, as he walks forward, it is as if a statue were moving. It is the same figure we have seen on horseback as King John of Serbia. The face under the crowned helmet is in darkness. When he comes up close, this darkness is divided and reveals the face of Dr. Judd. Suddenly, and with a savage movement, this knightly figure draws his sword. It comes flashing from the scabbard and instantly changes, to an enormous Yale key on a ring. The key grows constantly larger, blotting out everything else from the screen. Over this sequence is the music of "Berceuses du Chat" in the softer portions of the melody we hear constantly the repetition of Judd's suggestions:

She passes a showcase filled with terra cotta figurines of the cat-headed goddess, Bubastis. She only glances at them as she passes. Her stride lengthens with her growing anger. At the end of the aisle she stops still and looks up.

As SHOT from Irene's VIEWPOINT, looking up, we see a towering effigy of the goddess Bubastis, carved into a black basalt caryatid.

Alice is standing in front of her locker, drying herself with a big towel. She has just come out of the pool. The door to the plunge is open behind her, but she has turned out the lights and it is dark within. There is only the single light gleaming in the locker room. Alice removes her wet bathing cap and shakes her hair out. She puts on a chenille wrapper over her bathing suit and goes toward the door. She starts to turn out the lights in the locker room, but remembers the kitten. She looks around and sees the kitten.

Alice reaches the center of the pool and treads water. Around the edge of the tank she can hear her pursuer begin to run with bounding steps along the tiles. Then there is silence. Alice looks about her in the quiet darkness. Her eyes try to peer into the shadows. Her whole expression is one of taut, almost hysterical panic. She listens closely.

INT. IRENA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Oliver and Irena are sitting at a little table drawn up before the fireplace. They have finished dinner. Only the empty dessert plates and the empty demitasse cups remain. The fire is burning bright, but low. Above the mantle is an empty space. The Goya has been removed. Later, as the CAMERA SHIFTS, we will notice that the Grandville drawings and the panther screen have also been taken away. Oliver is looking down at his empty coffee cup, lost in thought. Irena is watching him.

<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Irena -- I had hoped - things have changed.

Irena still smiles at him, but there is more inquiry than invitation in her smile. Oliver finds the words he wants to say and says them with blunt simplicity.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't love you, Irena. I love Alice. I've always loved her, but I didn't know it. I had to learn maybe through this marriage of ours -- what love was. I didn't want to tell you this. But now, you see, I have to. It's too late.

CLOSE SHOT of Oliver. Her words have affected him greatly. He tries to say something but Is struck by the futility of anything he can say and does not speak. (Note to director: If necessary to get over this thought, you might lot him start and swallow the word "Irena" as if he were going to say more.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irena. She looks at him. As she looks, her mood changes; anger comes to her face and it is almost as if with this flood of anger, her grasp on reality and sanity relaxed. Although her voice lowers, it gains in intensity. (Note to director: There are a great many "s" sounds in the following speech and, if possible, they should be emphasized so that we can almost hear the spitting of a cat in her voice. The words between should be held in low key. The facial expression is tense and presages the immobility of her face in the coming scene with Judd.)

Oliver gets up hesitantly and goes toward the door. He looks back, sees her tensely quiet on the sofa, picks up his hat and coat, looks again, his face showing worry and concern. Finally he leaves, closing the door softly behind him. Irena's two hands rip downward, the nails slashing the thin fabric of the sofa covering.

Oliver turns out the light, and together they start toward the door, the CAMERA MOVING with them. Oliver turns out the under-lit table lights. Halfway across the room Alice stops, her fingers clenching in Oliver's sleeve. There is n soft, metallic click as of a door closing. They look In the direction of the sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT of the door. It is closed.

<DIRECTION>
Alice seizes his arm. In the darkness, to one side of them, there Is a sound like a snarl. Instinctively Oliver and Alice step backward, away from the sound in the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA MOVES with them. They bump into a desk, grope their way around It. From the darkness following them, there is a whisper of light, padded feet — a delicate tick, tick of claws scraping the floor. Alice bumps Into the glassy coldness of the water cooler, gasps in fright, arid pushes it away from her. There is a crash, the sound, of glass breaking, and then the throaty gurgle of water spilling out onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is silent then. Alice and Oliver are creeping back down between a row of filing cabinets. Now there comes again, pursuing them, the whispering tread of soft paws. Alice and Oliver are against the further wall now. Alice is pushed behind Oliver, her back against the wall. Panic-stricken, she begins to whimper with restrained hysteria. Her nerves are cracking up. Oliver tightens his hold on her wrist. A cold sweat breaks out on his forehead. He reaches in his pocket, and pulls out a book of matches. He lights one. It throws a faint glow around them. Shadows flicker across their faces. Behind them the match light dimly reveals the letters "Project No. 457." They peer into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT of the dark, shadowy room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice is sobbing with fright, trying to restrain her fear, so that the sobs, when they come, are the more terrifying to hear. Oliver calls into the darkness.

As Oliver reaches up to got the T-square, Alice's match light dies. In the darkness, he snatches the T-square Alice lights another match. Oliver has the T-square in his hand and in the eerie light, a shadow is thrown on the wall above and to one side of him. He leans forward tensely. He speaks with deep feeling, the name of God in tones of reverent supplication.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE TWO SHOT of Irena and Judd as he bends to kiss her. They kiss. He draws back from her, smiling, his arms still around her body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP of Irena. This is as immobile, as expressionless a shot of her face as we can achieve; there is a frightening blankness and vacancy in this face. Then the whole head moves forward slowly toward the camera, the expression never changing, not even stirring to breathe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP of Judd. The smile suddenly fades from his face. Its place is taken by shock and terror.

Alice and Oliver come hurriedly in. Oliver lets the door close behind him, and they start up the stairs. A man's high-pitched scream of mortal agony cuts down the stairwell. It is followed by hideous noises, bestial snarls and growls, the crash of overturned furniture. Alice and Oliver look at each other; then they start running up the stairs. As they reach the first landing, the sounds of snarling and struggle grow louder. There comes one piercing, human shriek of agony and then quick silence.

<DIRECTION>
SHOT of the stairs above them. We can see the shadow now more clearly. It is Irena. She is coming down the stairs. Her fur coat is only half on. One arm is in the sleeve; the other side of the wrap is draped about her shoulders, pulled across her breast as if she were holding it to hide some hurt. She sees Alice and Oliver below her and moves stealthily back into the deeper shadows of the stairway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice and Oliver are passing an angle of the stairway where Irena stands. Neither of them sees her.

As Alice and Oliver step into the apartment, Alice gets one look at the room and turns away. Oliver takes her in his arms, trying to hide the room from her. Over the scene is the sound of the phonograph record still revolving with a monotonous, grinding sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE SHOT of the apartment as Alice and Oliver see it. The room bears the signs of a terrific struggle. Furniture is overturned, ornaments smashed, the draperies and pictures torn down. Judd's body is hidden by a chair. Only his legs, one pants leg torn, can be seen. O.S. is the sound of the record revolving. '

MED. SHOT of Irena and the panther. The beast snarls once and leaps forward. With one sweep of a heavy paw the animal hurls Irena to the ground. Free, he bounds off into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Irena. There is a little smile on her lips. Her coat has fallen back from a naked shoulder. A piece of the broken blade of Judd's dagger protrudes from a bloodless wound in the shoulder. A thin trickle of blood flows from the corner of her mouth. She scrabbles with her fingers against the hard pavement. Then her fingers relax. She is dead.

EXT. PANTHER CAGE - PARK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oliver and Alice come to a little space before the cage. They see a black object lying on the pavement. Quietly and cautiously they cross over to it. Oliver bends down to examine it. Under Irena's fur coat is a black leopard's body, the leg and paw in the same attitude her arm and hand had taken, and the broken blade that had once protruded from Irena's gleaming shoulder is now rooted in the black fur of the panther.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oliver looks up at Alice, then gets to his feet, takes her arm, and they start to the walk. Some few foot away, they turn back to look again at the body.
</DIRECTION>
