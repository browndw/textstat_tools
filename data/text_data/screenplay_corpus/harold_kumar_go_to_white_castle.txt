<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get your ass ready! It's almost five o'clock and this bad boy needs to get his drink on!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
J.D. notices his friend pining over the photo.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God. Give me that. I'm burning it once and for all.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
J.D. snatches the photo, and pulls out his lighter. Just as the flame is about to touch the photo, BILLY grabs it back.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't!

BILLY nods knowingly.

	You know what'll cheer you up? Some hot chick riding your jock all night long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're such a romantic, J.D.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would help get your mind off of Sarah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY ponders this for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever. Even if I wanted to meet other women, I wouldn't even know what to do. I've been out of the game so long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Billy, you come out with me tonight, and I promise you'll get laid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds tempting, but I can't. Berenson needs me to update the financial models for his meeting with the foreign investors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what? It's Friday! You have all weekend to do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No I don't. The Germans are taking an earlier flight back, so the meeting's been moved to tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
J.D. thinks for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, why don't you just get somebody else to do your work then?
	</DIALOGUE>

J.D. gets a big smile on his face. He has an idea.

</HAROLD>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, but something came up. I have to meet with some clients tonight, so I won't be able to get to it. It's your responsibility now. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Harold doesn't like this, but before he even has a chance to protest, J.D. steps forward...
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And make sure it's in tomorrow by nine o'clock sharp. With all the downsizing going on around here, we wouldn't want to have to tell Berenson that you've been slacking. He's just dying to figure out who he should fire next.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh...okay...no problem...

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING PARKING LOT - 5:00 PM BILLY and J.D. are walking through the parking lot.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, J.D. presses a button in his car that causes the top of the convertible to go down and a funky white boy song kicks in. Intercut:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. J.D'S CONVERTABLE Billy and J.D. think they're hot shit as they cruise through the parking lot blasting their tunes. When the lyrics kick in, J.D. begins lip-syncing passionately. Billy loves it. When the chorus begins, the guys begin dancing in their seats in an unrealistic, synchronized, choreographed manner. J.D. gives a thumbs up to an ELDERLY PARKING ATTENDANT as his car zooms out of the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK BOOM UP from J.D.'s Convertible and PUSH IN to Harold standing at a window watching as Billy and J.D. zoom off. He looks at the stack of papers they gave him...

INT. DR. WOODRUFF'S OFFICE - NYU MEDICAL SCHOOL KUMAR PATEL (22, Indian, Funky Hair) is answering questions from his NYU Medical School interviewer, DR. Woodruff (middle aged, erudite, very professional). Kumar has NO ACCENT. He's American.

	Mononucleosis or mono is an infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. Symptoms may include fever, sore throat, headaches, white patches on the back of your throat, swollen glands, sluggishness and loss of appetite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KUMAR>
<DR_WOODRUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellent, Kumar. I have to say you're one of the best applicants I've ever interviewed. Not that it's a surprise. Your father is very respected in his field. You know he and I had some pretty wild times when we were in med school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_WOODRUFF>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?

<DIRECTION>
(cracking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, we were crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kumar nods and smiles. Woodruff finally stops laughing...
</DIRECTION>
<DR_WOODRUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway-- just one more question.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reading from a clipboard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are some potential symptoms of pancreatitis?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_WOODRUFF>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see. There might be epigastric tenderness, diffuse abdominal tenderness...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, we hear what sounds like be a match being lit, a gurgle, and a cough -- the distinct sounds of somebody smoking from a bong. Dr. Woodruff is confused. Kumar pulls out his cell phone. It's his personalized ringer.
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>
<DIRECTION>
(to Dr. Woodruff)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. Can you hold on one second?
	</DIALOGUE>

Kumar stands up and answers his cell phone.

</HAROLD>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh come on! When has getting high ever prevented you from finishing your work?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Woodruff is so shocked that the mug of coffee simply slips out of his hands. Hot coffee goes all over his shirt. Woodruff yells and starts wiping his shirt with a napkin.
</DIRECTION>
<HAROLD>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, I'd love to go home, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No fucking buts! I just bought a quarter of the finest herb in New York City, and I'm not smoking it alone. So you're just gonna have to chill the fuck out, bring your work home, and prepare to get blazed, because in a couple of hours I expect both of us to be blitzed out of our skulls. Got it?...Okay good. See you later.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kumar hangs up the phone and sits back down. Dr. Woodruff is stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>
<DIRECTION>
(to Dr. Woodruff)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, where was I? Oh yes. More symptoms of pancreatitis. Um...decreased bowel sounds, possibly fever, dehydration, and sometimes even shock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KUMAR>
<DR_WOODRUFF>
<DIRECTION>
(livid)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Patel. This is supposed to be a proper interview. Do you actually believe after the way you've behaved that I would ever even consider recommending you for admission?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_WOODRUFF>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'd actually be pretty surprised.

<DIRECTION>
Dr. Woodruff is flustered. He doesn't know how to react.

	Well, I'm not an idiot.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Woodruff is at a loss for words. Kumar notices a framed picture of a HOT TEENAGE GIRL on Dr. Woodruff's desk. He picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow! Is this your daughter?
	</DIALOGUE>

A disturbed Dr. Woodruff grabs the portrait out of Kumar's hands.

<DIRECTION>
Harold carefully lines up his car to parallel park. As he starts to pull in, A YELLOW JEEP STEALS THE SPOT FROM BEHIND. The jeep is loaded with "alternative" stickers, and has a KAYAK, HANG-GLIDER, and other sports equipment on the roof. Harold almost hits the JEEP. He knows this car.

EXT. HAROLD AND KUMAR'S APARTMENT BUILDING Harold walks a bunch of blocks to his apartment building. He walks up the steps to the LOBBY ENTRANCE of his building... Suddenly, he stops in his tracks. Through the glass door, he sees... MARIA-- A beautiful, sweet-looking young woman of Puerto-Rican descent. She's standing by the elevators. HAROLD can't move. He's mesmerized. This is his dream girl. Harold takes a deep breath...

Harold walks over to Kumar's room and looks inside. It's Martha Stewart's nightmare-- dirty laundry all over the floor, etc. On his walls we see old school gangsta rap posters. MARIJUANA PARAPHERNALIA is everywhere. We see a Giant Photograph of Kumar with his arm around Mr. T. Kumar is not in the room, however.

INT. LIVING ROOM Kumar walks over to a table in the living room where he finds AN M.C.A.T. TEST PREP BOOK. Kumar lifts open the cover-- inside, we see a hollowed-out circle filled with marijuana.

	So what? It's not like there's a shortage of Dr. Patel's out there. My dad's a doctor. My brother's a doctor. Just because everyone in my family went to med school, doesn't mean I have to.

	Well, then what are you going to do?

Sitting on the couch is ROSENBERG (a seemingly "nice Jewish boy," wearing khakis and a sweater) and GOLDSTEIN (a more depraved Jewish boy, wearing a t-shirt with a picture of the OLSEN TWINS-- underneath the picture we see the words, "FINALLY LEGAL ON JUNE 13, 2004"). Both of them are taking bong hits (out of a shofar bong) while watching TV as Harold and Kumar enter...

Harold's answer becomes clear as he pushes the "door closed" button repeatedly. The door closes before Maria sees them.
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you doing? That was a perfect opportunity! You could have asked her if she wanted to go to White Castle.

HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, devastated.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been an employee here for three years now, and if there's one thing I've learned, it's that when you're craving White Castle, the burgers here simply won't cut it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(in his own little world)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In fact, just thinking about those tender little White Castle burgers and those grilled onions makes me want to burn this place to the ground and re-build a White Castle in its place.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I were you, I'd suck it up and make the trip.

<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Agreed.

<BURGER_SHACK_EMPLOYEE>

	White Castle, here we come. I just wish we had some more pot. I'm almost completely sober right now.

HAROLD ignores this. He's TYPING FEVERISHLY ON HIS LAPTOP-- trying to get his work done. Meanwhile, Kumar notices a sign on for the PRINCETON EXIT.

	Nice. Princeton. We're getting off here.

</KUMAR>
<HAROLD>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I can't help you out there. Cindy doesn't smoke. She's not gonna help us.

INT. CINDY KIM'S DORM ROOM - 11:OO PM HAROLD is sitting on a bed, next to CINDY KIM (very cute, prim and proper, Korean girl). Sitting on the floor are A DOZEN ASIAN STUDENTS-- pure stereotypes (glasses, nerdy clothes, etc). Harold is kind of creeped out by them.

Suddenly, one of the nerdy Asian students (KENNETH) raises his hand. HAROLD looks at him strangely, and then over to Cindy. "Does this guy think I'm a teacher or something?" Harold sits there and stares at Kenneth for a while...

<KENNETH>

All the Asian students start high-fiving with each other.

	Oh great. Now I think I have to go.

CHRISTY enters STALL NUMBER THREE and shuts the door. The sound of the door shutting causes HAROLD and KUMAR to turn their attention to the other stall. They then look at each other grossed out.

INT. COMMON ROOM Harold and Kumar stop in their tracks when they see the EAST ASIAN STUDENTS ASSOCIATION party in full blast. All the "nerdy" asian kids from Cindy's room are grinding with each other as KENNETH RAPS A FILTHY RAP. Harold and Kumar look at each other in shock. Some of the dancing Asian chicks look pretty hot. Kenneth jumps off the couch he was standing on, holding a big bag of POT BROWNIES.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pot brownies for everyone!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kenneth throws some pot brownies in the air. People grab at them. Harold and Kumar can't believe it. Two Cute Asian Chicks approach Kenneth...

<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To tell you the truth, I'm running low. But a quick titty flash may persuade me.

The Korean chicks look at each other. "Should we?" "Okay!" They lift up their shirts and bras, revealing their boobs.
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dude, I'm starting to think you made a mistake by not going to this party...

SECURITY GUARD (#2)--

The guys turn and see the guards running at them. HAROLD AND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KUMAR RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN DOWN THE HALLWAY, WITH THE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUARDS CHASING AFTER THEM...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Further down the hall, they pass the party. The partygoers watch as the guys run by, except for Kenneth, who makes a quick grab at one of the topless girl's boobs. When she notices, Kenneth quickly looks away, as if he did nothing. Cindy Kim notices Harold...
</DIRECTION>
<CINDY_KIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harold!

They keep running, past the bathrooms, where Christy and Clarissa exit...
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY_AND_CLARISSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kumar!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They continue running. The guards are still running after Harold and Kumar, who see the EXIT DOORS just ahead. Suddenly, the Hippie Asshole walks by, blocking their path.

Harold is about to avoid him, but Kumar grabs Harold close and the two of them BASH INTO THE Hippie Asshole-- KNOCKING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIM ON HIS ASS. Harold and Kumar burst out the doors and EXIT THE DORM... The Security Guards run by the Hippie Asshole, but stop when they see his backpack, which is half-open, and is exposing THE GIANT BAG OF WEED. The Security Guard picks it up...
</DIRECTION>
<SECURITY_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, well, well. What have we here?

From Harold's reaction, it's clear he hit it on the head.
</DIRECTION>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, it doesn't matter. I'm gonna end up with Cindy anyway. It's just more practical. Now can we drop this and get our asses to White Castle?

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUSH NEAR DARK ROAD KUMAR is still peeing. Suddenly, A CREEPY GUY (FROM OUT OF NOWHERE) walks over to him. The Creepy Guy unzips his pants and starts urinating IN THE SAME BUSH, RIGHT NEXT TO KUMAR! Kumar looks at the Creepy Guy -- totally confused. The Creepy Guy simply goes about his business. It's clear that Kumar wants to say something. He remains silent for a couple seconds, until he can't take it anymore...
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me...I'm sorry, I just have to ask you...why are you peeing here?

The CREEPY GUY calms down. He and KUMAR silently urinate next to each other for about TEN SECONDS, until the Creepy Guy subtly looks at Kumar's package.
</DIRECTION>
<CREEPY_GUY>

KUMAR interrupts before HAROLD can tell her the truth.
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What Dr. Lee is trying to say is that we need to sedate the patient first or else he could go into cardiac arrest.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
HAROLD looks at KUMAR confused and nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<MALE_NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright. I'll get the anesthesiologist.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The NURSE is about to rush away, but Kumar stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on. What we should probably use is marijuana. That'll sufficiently sedate the patient for surgery.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Marijuana? But why...

KUMAR shows the amount he wants with his hands.

<MALE_NURSE>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Using the surgical equipment, Kumar actually begins removing bullets from the bleeding patient!!! Harold can't believe what's going on. Suddenly, the Patient begins having trouble breathing! He's gasping for air! The BEEPING SOUND monitoring his heart rate begins speeding up to an insane pace.
</DIRECTION>

</KUMAR>
<DIRECTION>
The NURSE hands KUMAR what is essentially a LARGE NEEDLE! Kumar directs the needle in the direction of the Patient's chest. It's a tense moment. The Patient is scared. So is Harold. The Nurse looks hopeful. Kumar looks determined. With a quick thrust, Kumar jabs the needle into the Patient's chest, causing a rush of air! The Patient breathes easier. His heart rate drops back to normal.
</DIRECTION>

	Harold. It's one in the morning. We're an hour from home. And who do we see, but your dream girl standing outside a theater playing your favorite movie. I mean, if we were in a cheesy romantic comedy, and I was your annoying gay friend, this would be the moment I'd tell you "this is a sign."

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - 1:15 AM HAROLD examines the flat tire. Kumar is standing nearby. There's not another car in site.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, they see AN OLD PICK-UP TRUCK driving in their direction. HAROLD and KUMAR wave it down. The truck stops in front of them. The door opens and a SHADOWY FIGURE begins walking towards them. Harold and Kumar are nervous. As soon as the FIGURE reaches them, LIGHTENING STRIKES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the UGLIEST MAN OF ALL TIME-- he's in his fifties, wearing a crappy mesh cap, but most notably, HE HAS LARGE BUMPS AND BOILS ALL OVER HIS FACE. Harold and Kumar jump back in fear as they catch their first glimpse of him.
</DIRECTION>
<UGLY_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You boys need some help?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The UGLY MAN takes off his mesh cap. Even his haircut is freaky. He has a SKULLET (A MULLET BUT WITH NO HAIR ON TOP). HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, freaked out.

Harold and Kumar look at each other. They then notice a JESUS CHRIST bobble-head doll on the dashboard...
</DIRECTION>
<FREAK_SHOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you boys worship Christ?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys look at each other again, not sure how to respond.

<DIRECTION>
After a while, HAROLD starts to notice that they're driving in the middle of a dark woods. It looks very sketchy.
</DIRECTION>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So where exactly are we going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<FREAK_SHOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. My place isn't too far from here. Once we get there, I'll have your ride fixed up in a jiffy.

The guys silently continue driving, until KUMAR notices a
</DIRECTION>

RASH OF BOILS ON FREAK SHOW'S NECK.
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering to Harold)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eww-- check out those boils on his neck!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
HAROLD nudges him to be quiet. KUMAR looks back over at FREAK SHOW and sees that ONE OF THE BOILS IS PULSATING.
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God! You gotta look! One of them's actually pulsating!

	</DIALOGUE>
</KUMAR>
<HAROLD>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter with you? You think that just because you're whispering, he can't hear what you're saying? He's two feet away from us. He can hear this entire conversation. He can hear me talking right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<KUMAR>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, he can't hear anything. Not with all that crust in his ear.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
HAROLD gives KUMAR a hard elbow to the stomach. He then looks nervously at FREAK SHOW, who doesn't seem to have heard a thing. Harold seems relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<FREAK_SHOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard every word you said.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
FREAK SHOW doesn't say anything else. HAROLD and KUMAR don't know how to react. They feel really uncomfortable. The fact that nothing happens makes it all the more awkward for them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FREAK SHOW'S HOUSE - 1:30 AM HAROLD (with laptop in tow) and KUMAR stand by their car, as FREAK SHOW brings out some tools and a new tire from his house, which is run-down and in the middle of nowhere.
</DIRECTION>
<FREAK_SHOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now it's gonna take me a little while here, so if you boys like you can go inside, wash up, fuck my wife, have something to drink, watch tv-- anything you want. Mi casa es su casa. Just don't do anything Jesus wouldn't do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
FREAK SHOW gives HAROLD a pat on the back and starts changing the tire. KUMAR and HAROLD look at each other. Slowly, they walk towards FREAK SHOW's house...
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I deaf or did he just say we can fuck his wife?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KUMAR>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He couldn't have said that.

</HAROLD>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he did! It may have been in mid- sentence, but it was still clear as day.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the front door and are about to enter...
</DIRECTION>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who cares? You've seen Freak Show. What do you think his wife is gonna look like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FREAK SHOW'S HOUSE HAROLD and KUMAR walk inside and see THE HOTTEST CHICK OF ALL TIME (LIANE) walk out of the kitchen. She is dressed Daisy Dukes and a tight, skimpy shirt, that accentuates her chest.
</DIRECTION>
<LIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. I'm Freak Show's wife, Liane. Would you boys like some pink lemonade?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
HAROLD and KUMAR can't move. They're awestruck.
</DIRECTION>
<LIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me go bring in a pitcher.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
LIANE leaves to go into the kitchen. Along the way, she turns on a record player, which starts playing a CREEPY SONG ABOUT JESUS CHRIST. HAROLD and KUMAR look around the house. There are crosses and Bible Verses on the walls, along with Freak Show and Liane's wedding picture...
</DIRECTION>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. It's official. We've entered the Twilight Zone.

</KUMAR>
<LIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, never been better. We love each other very much.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
KUMAR looks disappointed. HAROLD, however, is intrigued...
</DIRECTION>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I ask-- how does a guy...like Freak Show...end up with a woman like yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<LIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I met him at choir practice `bout four years ago. Freak Show was very shy back then-- you know, because of all the hideous boils on his face and neck. But he had the most amazing voice -- like a baby canary.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Harold and Kumar look at each other in disbelief -- "are we talking about the same Freakshow?"
</DIRECTION>
<LIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, one day after Easter service, I told him how much I enjoyed his solo, and he just mustered up some courage and asked me out. The rest is history. And we've been in love ever since.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
HAROLD ponders this for a moment. He and KUMAR begin drinking their lemonade.
</DIRECTION>
<LIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you boys gonna fuck me or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
HAROLD and KUMAR spit the lemonade out simultaneously. They look at each other in complete shock. Kumar turns to Harold.
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rock, paper, scissors to see who goes first?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KUMAR>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a second-- what about Freak Show...and this whole Christian thing you guys have going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<LIANE>
<DIRECTION>
(a little offended)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, so just because we're passionate about our Lord, you assume we don't know how to have a good time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIANE>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I just...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Liane starts playing with the knot in her shirt. Harold and Kumar stare unabashedly. Harold looks outside the window, where he sees Freak Show changing the tire, apparently busy.

HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other again, more confused and kind of disturbed. Kumar turns to LIANE...
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, are we talking about one hole or two?

<LIANE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you help me with this...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Liane walks over to Harold, seductively. Harold is nervous and doesn't know what he should do. She takes his hand and puts it on the knot in her shirt. Harold looks over to Kumar, who gives him a reassuring nod. Harold then pulls on the cloth, causing the knot to come loose, thereby releasing her shirt. The shirt is now hanging and just barely covering her breasts.
</DIRECTION>
<LIANE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Harold, re: breasts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want to play with them?

Harold looks over to Kumar, then back at Liane...
</DIRECTION>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, let's do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Liane takes Harold's hands and places them on her breasts. Kumar looks on enviously. Liane moans in pleasure as Harold starts to massage her chest. AT THAT MOMENT, FREAK SHOW ENTERS THE ROOM, holding a particularly threatening TIRE-IRON...

HAROLD and KUMAR both find this to be quite strange.
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>

HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other-- weirded out.

	Hey, there's a gas station! Let's stop and get directions.

Cole and the Two Punks push past Harold and Kumar and walk into the store. Harold and Kumar enter after them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONVENIENCE STORE HAROLD and KUMAR walk into the store, where they see Cole and the Punks are nonchalantly knocking over random items from the shelves. They then begin playing HACKEYSACK with a HOSTESS-like PIE. The CASHIER (an OLD INDIAN MAN IN HIS SIXTIES) throws out a couple indecipherable protests...

<INDIAN_CASHIER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Cole and the punks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please...the pies...do not...

Cole and the Punks ignore him. Harold and Kumar then approach the Indian Cashier...
</DIRECTION>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me-- can you tell us how to get onto the highway from here?

The INDIAN CASHIER shrugs his shoulders.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He probably can't speak English...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KUMAR>
<DIRECTION>
KUMAR SAYS A FEW WORDS IN HINDI, WHICH LIGHTS UP THE CASHIER'S EYES. Kumar listens as the Cashier tells him the directions in Hindi-- it takes the Cashier a long time to explain it. He mentions numerous streets and routes. It sounds like it's very complicated. Meanwhile, while they are talking, HAROLD suddenly sees TWO MORE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS enter the store, CARRYING A KAYAK AND A PADDLE. They carry the kayak to the back of the store. Harold has no idea what the hell is going on. KUMAR and the CASHIER are too busy talking to notice. Harold watches nervously as COLE PUTS ON A HELMET AND GETS INTO THE KAYAK...
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who knew that learning Hindi would actually pay off? The guy says the highway's just down the road. We should be in Cherry Hill in ten minutes.

<DIRECTION>
HAROLD, KUMAR, and the INDIAN CASHIER immediately turn and look at COLE, WHO IS IN THE KAYAK-- WHICH IS BEING HELD UP BY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS. THE PUNKS RUN DOWN THE AISLE WITH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE KAYAK AND LAUNCH IT INTO THE AIR... In slow motion, we see COLE swing his paddle around in mid- air, KNOCKING OVER EVERYTHING ON THE SHELVES-- BAGS OF CHIPS,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GLASS JARS OF JELLY, BOTTLES OF SODA, ETC. The EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS cheer COLE on, while HAROLD, KUMAR, and the INDIAN CASHIER watch in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kayak lands on the floor. COLE gets out and celebrates with his friends.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was so fucking extreme, man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<EXTREME_SPORTS_PUNK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah man, on a scale from one to ten-- one being not so extreme, ten being extremely extreme, I'd give it a nine point five.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, all the Extreme Sports Punks begin going crazy throughout the store, knocking food off the shelves, bothering other customers. The INDIAN CASHIER begins yelling at them in HINDI. Extreme Sports Punk #1 casually looks through a shelf of various kinds of snack chips, discarding them one after an other. Finally, he stumbles upon EXTREME CHEDDAR DORITOS. He goes apeshit over his find.
</DIRECTION>
<EXTREME_SPORTS_PUNK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Extreme Cheddar!
	</DIALOGUE>

He tears open the bag and starts pouring them into his mouth, getting the chips all over the place. The INDIAN CASHIER is still yelling. Cole picks up the Cashier...

<EXTREME_SPORTS_PUNKS>

	Oooooooooh!
	</DIALOGUE>

Pissed, Cole stops in his tracks and drops the Cashier on the floor. He's pissed. It's clear to Harold that they may get their asses kicked.
</DIRECTION>
<HAROLD>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kumar)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean you should do something.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Cole slowly walks over to Kumar. The two stand face to face. Cole looks pissed, but Kumar keeps his confident exterior. It's a tense moment. Suddenly, Cole makes a quick motion as if he was going to hit Kumar, trying to get him to flinch. Kumar stands his ground without flinching, still looking Cole in the eye. The Punks don't know what to think as their leader is shown up. Seemingly impressed by Kumar, Cole begins to turn around as if he's going to walk away, but he quickly doubles back, doing the same fake punch he did before. Caught off guard, this time Kumar flinches like a nervous weakling...

<KUMAR>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.

Cole and the Punks burst out laughing.

<COLE>

	Yeah, that's right, bitch! Try fucking with me one more time. Just try it!

Cole jumps up and town gloating and pounding on his chest.

	Come on, lets get out of here.

Harold and Kumar walk out of the store, deflated. With their leader victorious, the Punks begin celebrating.

	There's a pay phone across the street, if you don't want to deal with those assholes.

</KUMAR>
<DIRECTION>
Harold turns around and walks back towards the street. Kumar walks with him, keeping his distance. They reach the street. On the other side, he sees AN ORANGE "DON'T WALK" SIGN LIT UP. Harold presses the "WALK" BUTTON on the post next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So after you talk to the cops we're still going to White Castle, right?

</KUMAR>
<HAROLD>

	I'm not speaking to you.

Harold waits for the "DON'T WALK" sign to change. It doesn't. HE STARTS PRESSING THE "WALK" BUTTON REPEATEDLY.
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, pressing the button a bunch of times doesn't make the sign change any faster. The computer responds to the first press. Every press after that is extraneous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KUMAR>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Mr. Wizard.

<DIRECTION>
HAROLD waits for a few seconds, but when the light doesn't change, he begins pressing the button again.
</DIRECTION>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ! When are they gonna fucking develop button technology that'll understand urgency?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The "DON'T WALK" sign still won't change. Kumar looks to the left and then to the right. The street is completely empty and there is no place for a police car to hide.
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is ridiculous. Just walk across.

</KUMAR>
<HAROLD>

Harold points to his ID.

	Harold.

Harold is starting to pacify Palumbo.

OFFICER PALUMBO hands Harold his ticket and begins to walk away.

Kumar grabs the ticket from Harold and looks at it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, no. I understand what's going on.

Harold steps in front of Kumar and puts his arms up to block him. Palumbo interprets the movement as a hostile movement towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER_PALUMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, hands down! No sudden moves!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Harold puts his hands down and Kumar continues his rant, with Palumbo improvising little responses.
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me guess. You were probably the big asshole in your high school, right? You'd pick on guys like us every day. But then graduation came, and we went to college and you went nowhere, so you thought, "How can I still give them shit? I know! I'll become a cop!" Well, congratulations. Your dream's come true.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Both Officer Palumbo and Harold are getting really pissed. Kumar steps in front of Harold and offers his friend over to Palumbo.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, while you're at it, why don't you write him up another ticket? Or better yet, arrest him. Lock him up!

With that, HAROLD TAKES A BIG SWING AT KUMAR. Kumar sees Harold's fist coming and quickly ducks. Harold's fist ends up hitting OFFICER PALUMBO in the face. SMACK!!!

The Mom leaves, with Hippie Asshole clinging to her like a frightened child. Palumbo shakes his head and sits down at his desk, where we see HIPPIE ASSHOLE'S BIG BAG OF WEED, along with Harold's WALLET and LAPTOP. He then starts filing a report on Harold... Harold looks at Officer Palumbo through the bars...

Harold turns around and examines his cell. Inside with him is a black man (TARIK) sitting down, reading a book. Harold sits down, across from Tarik. While Harold isn't looking, we see Officer Palumbo take the cash out of Harold's wallet and pocket it.
</DIRECTION>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what are you in here for?

</HAROLD>
<TARIK>

TARIK sits up. He looks at OFFICER PALUMBO who, with his Walkman on, is oblivious to their conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<TARIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am serious. You wanna know what happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Harold nods.
</DIRECTION>
<TARIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was walking out of a Barnes and Noble, and a cop stops me. Evidently, a black man robbed a store in Newark. Therefore, since I'm black, it was probably me, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Harold shrugs his shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<TARIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well that was the logic the cop used. I told him I haven't even been to Newark in months. Then he pointed a gun at me and told me to stop resisting arrest. I said, "Hey, I'm not resisting anything." So he starts beating me with his gun, screaming at me, telling me to stop resisting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TARIK>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit. What did you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<TARIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I kept saying, "I understand that I'm under arrest. Please stop beating me." But that didn't work. Then another cop showed up. Then another. When it was all said and done, it took nine cops to bring me in here.

Tarik nods and continues reading his book. Harold sees that Tarik is remarkably relaxed.

EXT. STREET Harold and Kumar stand there, speechless, as Neil drives right past them, splashing a puddle in Harold's face! They stand there, watching silently as NEIL drives off. Harold is now drenched. Muddy water drips from his hair and clothing. He gives Kumar a dirty look. Kumar knows he shouldn't push Harold any further.
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>

	Fine...We'll find a pay phone and get a cab back to your office.

	Fucking asshole. Suddenly, HAROLD stops in his tracks. He's noticed something through the Krispee Kreme window. He stops KUMAR and points...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KUMAR>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look! Through the window, we see ROSENBERG and GOLDSTEIN inside, sitting at a booth. They both have a dozen donuts and five cartons of milk. It looks like they just sat down... Goldstein savors his first bite of his POWDERED BLUEBERRY FILLED DONUT and Rosenberg licks his fingers after his first bite of his CHOCOLATE CREAM FILLED DONUT. HAROLD and KUMAR watch through the window longingly...

Suddenly, Kumar notices something else inside. Someone else is sitting down at Rosenberg & Goldstein's table...
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that Cindy Kim?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Harold watches as Cindy Kim sits down next to Goldstein. Goldstein puts his arm around her and feeds her a piece of donut. It looks like Goldstein and Cindy are "an item."
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should have boned her when you had the chance.
	</DIALOGUE>

Before Harold can respond, he's hit in the back of the head by a hacky sack! Cole and the Punks laugh at Harold.

Harold turns around and starts walking towards the Krispee Kreme entrance. Kumar follows. In the background Cole and the Punks are laughing about what a "pussy" Harold is.

SUDDENLY, HAROLD SNATCHES COLE'S KEYS FROM THE HOOD OF THE

KUMAR keeps sniffing. He turns around to the back seat. He reaches back and picks something up from off the floor. It's a WHITE CASTLE bag. He pours out the contents and we see EMPTY WHITE CASTLE HAMBURGER CARTONS fall onto Kumar's lap.

INTO THE FOREST, DISAPPEARING IN THE WOODS... We then see the COP CAR go around the turn. It passes by the point where HAROLD and KUMAR entered the forest.

He puts his foot on the brakes, bringing the car to a screeching halt. OFFICER BRUCKS gets out of the car and looks around wondering where the YELLOW JEEP went. HE THEN HEARS THE SOUND OF

KUMAR walks over to the edge of the cliff and looks out onto the EARLY MORNING HORIZON. The sun is still rising. The scene is very picturesque...
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our parents came to this country, escaping persecution, poverty, and hunger. Hunger, Harold. They were very, very hungry. And they wanted to live in a land that treated them as equals. A land where their kids could study and get into good colleges. A land filled with hamburger stands. And not just one type of hamburger. Hundreds of types-- with different sizes, toppings, and condiments. That land was America.

THE POLICE SIREN IS GETTING LOUDER...

KUMAR walks over to HAROLD.

	And so we've reached this point. The point which all men eventually have to face. The point of no return.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>

	We can stay here, get arrested and end our hopes of ever going to White Castle. Or we can take the hang-glider and make our leap towards freedom. I leave the decision up to you.

	Okay. Here's how this is gonna work. On the count of three, we're gonna run to the edge of the cliff. When I say "jump," launch yourself forward as if you were diving into a pool, got it?

INT. WHITE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER HAROLD and KUMAR have put three tables together, on which we see SIXTY WHITE CASTLE HAMBURGERS-- EACH ONE STEAMING HOT. TWO GOOD-LOOKING GUYS (JON and HAYDEN) stare at Harold and Kumar's orders, amazed by their size. They then look at their own orders and realize how worthless they are. HAROLD and KUMAR are sitting across from one another, looking at the smorgasbord in front of them. HAROLD IS ABOUT TO DIG

SUDDENLY, HAROLD NOTICES A CONVERTIBLE PARKING OUTSIDE THE

<DIRECTION>
RESTAURANT-- IT'S BILLY AND J.D. WITH TWO WOMEN.
</DIRECTION>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are far worse things in the world than being tagged for having a natural ability in medicine...

<DIRECTION>
HAROLD pretends to be listening to KUMAR-- BUT HE IS MORE FOCUSED ON BILLY AND J.D., who get out of the car with their women and start walking towards the front door.
</DIRECTION>

	Uh-huh.

</HAROLD>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides, I have to admit, it felt pretty cool saving that guy's life last night. Somewhere between that, getting yelled at by my dad, and seeing Neil Patrick Harris, I realized that I've always wanted to be a doctor-- I've just been too scared to admit it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
KUMAR sees that HAROLD isn't paying attention...
</DIRECTION>

At that moment, BILLY and J.D. walk in the restaurant with their women, ZOE and TRACY, respectively. TRACY looks like some bimbo slut that J.D. picked up at a strip club. ZOE, On the other hand, has a sweet RENEE ZELLWEGER quality about her. She and Billy are the perfect Hollywood couple...

J.D. and TRACY check out the menu. BILLY takes ZOE aside-- whatever their story is, it seems to have reached the "you complete me" moment...
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I have to admit something to you. At the start of last night, all I really cared about was getting some. But then I met you, Zoe. You're so different from all the other women I've ever met. You're smart, funny, artistic. I guess what I'm trying to say is...

	Yeah, you know I did. You're just stalling because you're not quick enough to think of a comeback.

J.D. is stunned. Now he's a little nervous.
</DIRECTION>

<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, YOU don't understand. I'm not doing your work anymore. And if either one of you douchebags ever tries to pull this shit again, I'll go to Berenson and tell him what's really going on.

Harold notices Traci and Zoe listening...

<HAROLD>

	And I'll tell everyone in the office how you both caught gonorrhea from that whore.

	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<KUMAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever. I'll tell my dad to reschedule it. He won't have a problem, as long as I'm taking it seriously for a change. Now, let's fly to Europe and find Maria!
