EXT. JUNGLE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An eyeball, big, yellowish, distinctly inhuman, stares raptly between wooden slats, part of a large crate. The eye darts from side to side, alert as hell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A legend tries to place us - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ISLA NUBLAR 120 MILES WEST OF COSTA RICA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - but to us it's still the middle of nowhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's quiet for a second. A ROAR rises up from the jungle, deafening. The trees shake as something very, very large plows ahead through them, right at us. Every head gathered in this little clearing snaps, turning in the direction of the sound as it bursts through the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a bulldozer. It drops its scoop and pushes forward into the back end of the crate, shoving it across the jungle floor towards an impressive fenced structure that towers over an enclosed section of thick jungle. There's a guard tower at one end of this holding open that makes it look like San Quentin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bulldozer pushes forward into the back end, the crate THUDS TO THE FLOOR. A door slides open in the pen, making a space as big as the end of the crate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nobody moves for a second, A grim-faced guy who seems to be in charge (Robert Muldoon, although we don't know it yet).
</DIRECTION>
<MULDOON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright now, pushers move in. Loading team move it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULDOON>
<DIRECTION>
The movement as agitated whatever is inside the crate, and the whole thing shivers as GROWLS and SNAPS come from inside. Everyone moves back.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, steady. Get back in there now, push. Get back in there, Don't let her know you're afraid!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULDOON>
<DIRECTION>
The men go back to the crate and begin to push it into the slot. The crate THUDS UP AGAINST THE OPENING. A green light on the side of the pen lights up, showing contact has been made.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM INSIDE THE CRATE, we get glimpses of what's on the other side of those wooden slates - - jungle foliage, MEN with rifles, searching searchlights. The view is herky-jerky as the crate put into position.
</DIRECTION>
<MULDOON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well lockedŠ Loading team, step away. Joffrey, raise the gate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULDOON>
<DIRECTION>
A WORKER climbs to the top of the crate. The search lights are trained on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The RIFFLEMEN throw the bolts on their rifles and CRACK their stun guns, sending arcs of current CRACKING through the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WORKER gets ready to grab the gate when all at once - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ROAR from the inside the crate, and the panel flies out of his hands and SMACKS into him, knocking him clear off the crate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now everything happens at once. The WORKER THUDS to the jungle floor, the crate jerks away from the mouth of the holding pen flash, an alarm BUZZER sounds - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - and a claw SLASHES out from inside the crate. It sinks into the ankle of the WORKER. dragging him toward the dark mouth between the crate and the pen. The WORKER SCREAMS and paws the dirt, leaving long claw marks as he is rapidly dragged toward the crate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Muldoon SHOUTS orders:
</DIRECTION>
<MULDOON>
<DIRECTION>
Tasers get in there, Goddamn it!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They FIRE their guns - the wood of the crate SPLINTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Muldoon runs in and grabs the WORKER, trying to pull him free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wild arcs of currents from the stun gun flash and CRACK all around, but in a second - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - the WORKER is gone.

EXT. CAVE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROSTAGNO and GENNARO move into the dark, dripping cave, where at least a dozen other WORKERS are gathered in a tight circle, staring at something intently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rostagno fights his way to the center of the group. One of the WORKERS hands him something and Rostagno examines it carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a chuck of amber, a shiny yellow rock about the size of a half dollar. GENNARO If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off. I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy. They want Alan Grant.

Rostagno turns and holds the amber up to the sunlight streaming through the mouth of the cave.

With the light pouring through it, the amber is translucent, and we can see something inside this strange stone - -

EXT. THE DIG DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An artist's camel hair brush carefully sweeps away sand and rock to slowly reveal the dark curve of a fossil - it's a claw. A dentist's pick gently lifts it from the place its has laid for millions of years. Pull up to reveal a group of diggers working on a large skeleton. All we see are the tops of their hats. The paleontologist working on the claw lays it in his hand.

DR ALAN GRANT, mid-thirties, a ragged-looking guy with intense concentration you wouldn't want to get in the way of, carefully examines a claw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DR ELLIE SATTLER, working with him, leans in close and studies it too. She paints the exposed bone with rubber cement. Ellie in her late twenties, athletic-looking. There's an impatience about Ellie, as if nothing in life happens quite fast enough for her.

From the bottom of the hill a voice SHOUTS to them:

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr Grant! Dr Sattler! We're ready to try again!

<DIRECTION>
Grant SIGNS and sits up, stretching out his back.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate computers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
He shoves the claw absent-mindedly into his pocket and he and Ellie walk toward the source of the voice. As they walk, we get our first look at the badlands. Exposed outcroppings of crumbling limestone stretch for miles in every direction, not a tree or a bush in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the dig itself, the ground is checkered with excavations everywhere. There's a base camp with five or six teepees, a flapping mess tent, a few cards, a flatbed truck with wrapped fossils loaded on it, and a mobile home. There are a dozen VOLUNTEERS of all ages at work in various places around the dig. The Volunteers are from all walks of life, dinosaur buffs. Three or four of them have CHILDREN with them, and the kids run around, like in a giant sandbox.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant , Ellie and a Volunteer walk down the hill. Grant spots a KID kicking dirt onto one of the digs. He notices and frowns.

He and Ellie arrive to where several VOLUNTEERS are clustered around a computer terminal that's set up on a table in a small tent, its flaps lashed open.

The VOLUNTEER throws a switch on a machine that looks a bit like a floor buffer. The whole thing hops up into the air as it drives a soft lead pellet into the earth with a tremendous force. There is a dull THUD, the earth seems to vibrate, and all eyes turn to the computer screen - -

<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long does this usually take?

	The screen suddenly comes alive, yellow contour lines tracing across it in three waves, detailing a dinosaur skeleton.

	Great. Well maybe dinosaurs have more in common with present-day birds than reptiles. Look at the public bone - - it's turned backwards, just like a bird. The vertebrae - - full of hollows and air sacs, just like a bird. Even the word raptor means "bird of prey".

The kid steps forward and looks at the computer skeleton critically.

	That doesn't look very scary. More like a six-foot turkey.

Everyone sort of draws in their breath and steps aside, revealing the KID, standing alone. Grant turns to the Kid, lowers his sunglasses, and stares at him like he just came from another planet.

	You'd get your first look at the six-foot turkey as you move into a clearing. But raptor, he knew you were there a long time ago. He moves like a bird; lightly, bobbing his head, And you keep still, because you think maybe his visual acuity's based on movement, like a T- rex, and he'll lose you if you don't move. But no. Not VELOCIRAPTOR. You stare at him, and he just stares back. That's when the attack comes - - not from the front, no, from the side, from the other two raptors you didn't even know were there.

A strange wind seems to be whipping up. Grant and Ellie look around, confused. The wind is getting stronger, blowing dirt and sand everywhere, filling in everything they've dug out, blowing the protective canvasses off. Now there's a more familiar ROAR, and they look up and see it - -

The trailer serves as the dig's office. There are several long wooden tables set up, every inch covered with bone specimens that are neatly laid out, tagged, and labeled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Farther along are ceramic dishes and crocks, soaking other bones in acid and vinegar.

There's old dusty furniture at one end of the trailer, and a refrigerator. A man roots around in the refrigerator, his back to us. GRUMBLING about the contents which are mostly beer.

Hammond looks around the trailer approvingly, at the enormous amount of work the bones represent.

The door SLAPS open again and ELLIE comes in, just as pissed off as Grant was.

Hammond begins to walk into the kitchen, making himself at home. Ellie follows him tries to help. Grant settles behind the table.

As Hammond moves, they notice he walks with a slight limp and uses a cane - - for balance or style, it's hard to say witch.

Ellie goes around towards Grant. She grabs a bottle of water. They look at each other, really aback by this guy's bravado, and site down. Hammond dries the glasses.

<HAMMOND>

	I own an island. Off the coast of Costa Rica. I leased it from the government and spent the last five years setting up a kind of biological preserve down there. Really spectacular.

<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of opinions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not to put a fine point on it, your kind. Let's face it, in your particular field, you're the top minds. If I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know, give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on schedule - -

EXT. CAFE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DENNIS NEDRY is in his late thirties, a big guy with a constant smile that could either be laughing with you or at you, you can never tell. He sits at a table in front of a Central American cafe, eating breakfast
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another Legend: SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nedry looks up and sees a man get out of a taxi - - LEWIS (Louis) DODGSON, fiftyish, wearing a large straw hat and looking almost too much like an American tourist. Dodgson clutches as attaché case close to him and scans the cafe furtively. Nedry laughs, shakes his head, and waves to him.
</DIRECTION>
<NEDRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dodgson!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
Dodgson hurries over to the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DODGSON>

(as he sites)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shouldn't use my name.

</DODGSON>
<NEDRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dodgson, Dodgson.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(loud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got Dodgson here! See, nobody cares. Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
Dodgson ignores that, sets his attaché case down next to the table, and slides it towards Nedry,
</DIRECTION>
<DODGSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven fifty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGSON>
<DIRECTION>
Nedry smiles and pulls the attaché closer to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DODGSON>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On delivery, fifty thousand more for ever viable embryo. That's one point five million. If you get all fifteen species off the island.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGSON>
<NEDRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'll get 'em all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEDRY>
<DODGSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember - - viable embryos. They're no use to us if they don't survive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGSON>
<NEDRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How am I supposed to transport them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
Dodgson pulls an ordinary can of shaving cream from a shoulder bag he carries and sets it on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DODGSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bottom screws open; it's cooled and compartmentalized inside. They can even check it if they want. Press the top.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGSON>
<DIRECTION>
Nedry presses the top of the can and real shaving cream comes out. He grins, impressed. While Dodgson talks, Nedry looks around for somewhere to wipe the shaving cream and ends up dumping it on top of someone's Jell-O on a dessert tray next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DODGSON>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's enough coolant gas for thirty-six hours.

Nedry looks at the can.
</DIRECTION>
<NEDRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? No menthol?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEDRY>
<DODGSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry. The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGSON>
<NEDRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's up to your guy on the boat. Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEDRY>
<DODGSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGSON>
<NEDRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got an eighteen minute window. Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.

A WAITER arrives and puts the check down on the table, between them. Nedry looks down at it pointedly, then up at Dodgson.

EXT. OPEN SEA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A helicopter, "IN-GEN CONSTRUCTION" emblazoned on the side, skims low over the shimmering Pacific.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HELICOPTER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANT, ELLIE, GENNARO and MALCOLM are huddled in the back of the chopper; HAMMOND is in the front with the PILOT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are two other passengers was well -- DONALD GENNARO, the lawyer from the amber mine, now dressed in safari clothes, everything straight from Banana Republic. The other Dr. IAN MALCOLM, fortyish, dressed all in black, with a snakeskin boots and sunglasses. Malcolm, who finds it hard to take his eyes off Ellie, leans over and SHOUTS over the engine whine.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you two dig up dinosaurs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try to!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm laughs, finding this very amusing, which confuses Grant. Hammond turns around annoyed.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm! He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chaotician, actually! Chaotician!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Hammond SNORTS, not even bothering to cover his contempt for Malcolm.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Codswollop! Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I certainly have! Very clearly! Because of the behavior of the system in phase space!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Hammond just waves him off.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, that¹s all it is!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
(poking at Hammond's knee)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John, John.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(pushing him away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No? Non-linear equations? Strange attractions?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(again, she shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Grant just rolls his eyes as Malcolm gives her an oily grin, but Ellie smiles, enjoying Grant's jealousy. Hammond turns to Gennaro and gives him a dirty look.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bring scientists -- you bring a rock star.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Hammond looks out the windshield, and CLAPS his hands excitedly.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There it is!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead, the others see it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ISLA NUBLAR. It's a smallish island, completely ringed by thick clouds that give it a lush, mysterious feel. The PILOT pulls up over a spot in the clouds and starts to descend, fast.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bad wind shears! We have to drop pretty fast! Hold on, this can be a little thrilling!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter drops like a stone. Outside the windows, they can see cliff walls racing by, uncomfortably close. They bounce like hell, hitting wind up and down drafts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only Hammond still feels chatty.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're planning an airstrip! On pilings, extending out into the ocean twelve thousand feet! Like La Guardia, only a lot safer! What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
They don't answer, just hold on. As they near the ground, a luminous white cloud cross appears below them, a landing pad shining through the Plexiglas bubble in the floor of the chopper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cross grows rapidly larger as the chopper plummets, but a sudden updraft catches them and they bounce skyward for a moment then drop again, even faster if possible, before landing with a hard BUMP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HELICOPTER LANDING PAD DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chopper plummets and finally lands. One of the workers opens the door and the group gets out. Hammond looks out, proudly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HILLTOP DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two large, open-top jeeps ROAR down the hilltop away from the landing cross as the helicopter engines WHINE back to life and the rotors start to spin again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELLIE, GRANT, and MALCOLM hold on tight in the front jeep, HAMMOND and GENNARO are in the rear jeep. Both cars have DRIVERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass through an enormous gate in a thirty foot high fence, which is closed behind them by two PARK ATTENDANTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are large electrical insulators on the fences, warning lights that strobe importantly and clear signs -- "ELECTRIFIED FENCE! 10,000 VOLTS!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE REAR JEEP,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gennaro regards the fences critically.
</DIRECTION>
<GENNARO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENNARO>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems. Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<GENNARO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get something straight, John. This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island. Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned. Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gestures to Grant, Ellie, and Malcolm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- -aren't convinced. I'm not convinced. And I can shut you down John.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENNARO>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies. Now get out of the way. So I can see them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
He shoves Gennaro aside, to get a clear view of Grant, Ellie, and Malcolm.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't miss this for the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
The jeeps wind their way along a mountain road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE LEAD JEEP,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie stares off to the right, fascinated by the thick tropical plant life around them. She tilts her head, as if something's wrong with this picture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches out and grabs hold of a leafy branch as they drive by, TEARING it from the tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE REAR JEPP,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hammond watching Grant, signals to his Driver .
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just stop here, stop here. Slow, slow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
He slows down, then stops. So does the front jeep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE FRONT JEEP,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie stares at the leaf, amazed, running her hand lightly over it.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alan - -
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
But Grant's not paying attention. He's staring too, out the other side of the jeep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant notices that several of the tree trunks are leafless - just as thick as the other trees, but gray and bare.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (still staring at the leaf)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This shouldn't be here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Grant twists in his seat as the jeep stops and looks at one of the gray tree trunks. Riveted, he slowly stands up in his seat, as if to get closer. He moves to the top of the seat, practically on his tiptoes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his head, looking up the length of the trunk. He looks higher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And higher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And higher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That's no tree trunk. That's a leg. Grant's jaw drops, his head falls all the way back, and he looks even higher, above the tree line.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (still looking at the leaf)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This species of vermiform was been extinct since the cretaceous period. This thing - -
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Grant, never tearing his eyes from the brachiosaur, reaches over and grabs Ellie's head, turning it to face the animal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees it, and drops the leaf.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh - - my - - God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Grant lets out a long, sharp, HAH - a combination laugh and shout of joy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets out of the jeep, and Ellie follows. Grant points to the thing and manages to put together his first words since its appearance:
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THAT'S A DINOSAUR!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
- - a dinosaur. Chewing the branches. Technically, it's a brachiosaur, of the sauropod family, but we've always called it brontosaurus. It CRUCHES the branch in its mouth, which is some thirty-five feet up off the ground, at the end of its long, arching neck. It stares down at the people in the car with a pleasant, stupid gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie looks up at the sauropods in wonder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They've pretty light on their feet - a far cry from the sluggish, lumbering brutes we would have expected.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hammond gets out of his jeep and comes back to join them. He looks like a proud parent showing off the kid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ian Malcolm looks at Hammond, amazed, and with an expression that is a mixture of admiration and rapprochement.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did it. You crazy son of a bitch, you did it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Grant and Ellie continue walking, following the dinosaur.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The movement!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The - - agility. You're right!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
In their amazement, Grant and Ellie talk right over each other.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong! This is a warm-blooded creature. They're totally wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were wrong. Case closed. This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Several of the top branches are suddenly RIPPED away. Another sauropod, reaching for a branch high above their heads, stands effortlessly on its hind legs.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
(to Hammond)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The brachiosaur? Thirty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grant and Ellie continue to walk.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?! Like that!?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Hammond)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(proudly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.

</HAMMOND>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got a T-rex!?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got a T-rex! A T-rex! He said he's- -

	<DIALOGUE>
	Say again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, we have a T-rex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Grant feels faint. He sits down on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, put your head between your knees, and breathe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Hammond walks in front of them and looks out.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Grant, my dear Dr. Sattler. Welcome to Jurassic Park.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
They turn and look at the view again. It's beautiful vista, reminiscent of an African plain. A whole herd of dinosaurs crosses the plain, maybe a hundred that we see in a quick glance alone.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
	</DIALOGUE>

<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll show you.

</HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, we notice Gennaro, who was sort of faded into the background while the others reacted. He's just staring, a look of absolute rapture on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He speaks in a voice that is hushed and reverent.
</DIRECTION>
<GENNARO>

EXT. MAIN COMPOUND DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The main of Jurassic Park is a large area with three main structures connected by walkways and surrounded by two impressive fences, the outer fence almost twenty feet high.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside the fences, the jungle has been encouraged to grow naturally.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The largest building is the visitor's center, several stories tall, its walls still skeletal, unfinished. There's a huge glass rotunda in the center.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second building looks like a private residence, a compound unto itself, with smoked windows and its own perimeter fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The third structure isn't really a building at all, but the impressive cage we saw earlier, overgrown inside with thick jungle foliage. The jeeps pull up in front of the visitor's center.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VISITOR'S CENTER DAY

INT. VISITOR'S CENTER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lobby of the still-unfinished visitor's center is a high- ceilinged place, and has to be house its central feature, a large skeleton of a tyrannosaur that is attacking bellowing sauropod. WORKMEN in the basket of a Condor crane are still assembling skeletons. A staircase climbs the far wall, to another wing.

<DIRECTION>
GRANT, ELLIE, and MALCOLM take their seats in the front row of the fifty seat auditorium. GENNARO sits behind them. HAMMOND walks over to the giant screen in front of them.

IN THE FILM,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the screen-Hammond is joined by another figure, this one animated. MR. DNA is a cartoon character, a happy-go-lucky double- helix strand of recombinant DNA. Mr. DNA jumps down onto the screen- Hammond's head and slides down his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well! Mr. DNA! Where'd you come from?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<MR_DNA>

<DIRECTION>
IN THE FILM,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. DNA has taken over the show, and is speaking to the audience from the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_DNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A DNA strand like me is a blueprint for building a living thing! And sometimes animals that went extinct millions of years ago, like dinosaurs, left their blueprints behind for us to find! We just had to know where to look!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_DNA>
<DIRECTION>
The screen image changes from animated to a nature- photography look. It's an extreme close-up of a mosquito, its fangs suck the deep into some animals flesh, its body pulsing and engorging with blood it's drinking.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_DNA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A hundred million years ago, there were mosquitoes, just like today. And, just like today, they fed on the blood of animals. Even dinosaurs!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_DNA>
<DIRECTION>
The camera races back to show the mosquito is perched on top of a giant animated brachiosaur.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The image changes, to another close-up, this one of a tree branch, its bark glistening with golden sap. Mr. DNA leaps on the sap.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_DNA>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes, after biting a dinosaur, the mosquito would land on a branch of a tree, and get stuck in the sap!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_DNA>

The engorged mosquito lands in the tree sap, and gets stuck. So is Mr. DNA. He tugs his legs, but they stay stuck.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_DNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHOA!
	</DIALOGUE>

Now the tree sap flows over them, covering up Mr. DNA and the mosquito completely. Mr. DNA SHOUTS from inside the tree sap.

A SCIENCE LABORATORY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place buzzes with activity. Everywhere, there are piles of amber, tagged and labeled with SCIENTISTS in white coats examining it under microscopes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One SCIENTIST moves a complicated drill apparatus next to the chuck of amber with a fossilized mosquito inside and BORES into the side of it. MR. DNA escapes through the drill hole as the Scientist moves the amber onto a microscope and peers through the eyepiece.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_DNA>

	A full DNA strand contains three billion genetic codes! If we looked at screens like these once a second for eight hours a day, it'd take two years to look at the entire strand! It's that long! And since it's so old, it's full of holes! That's where our geneticists take over!

we see an actual DNA strand, except it has a big hole in the center, where the vital information is missing. Mr. DNA bounds into the frame, carrying a butch of letters in one hand.

	John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible. If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.

Grant charges across the compound, a fire in his eyes, ahead of ELLIE, MALCOLM, and GENNARO. HAMMOND struggles to keep up.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Grant, Dr. Grant? Uh - -we planned to show you the raptors later, after lunch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
But Grant has stopped abruptly next to the Velociraptor pen, which we recognize as the heavily fortified cage we some earlier, which the San Quentin towers at one end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant stands right up against the fence, eyes wide, dying for a glimpse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMMOND catches up, slightly out of breath.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Grant - - as I was saying, we've laid out lunch for you before you head out into the park. Alejandro, our gourmet chef - -

</HAMMOND>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are they doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
As they watch, a giant crane lowers something large down into the middle of the jungle foliage inside the pen. Something very large.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a steer. They poor thing looks disconcerted as hell, helpless its in a harness, flailing its legs in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feeding them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moving along)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alejandro is preparing a delightful meal for us. A Chilean sea bass, I believe. Shall we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Grant goes up to the viewing deck. The others follow, staring as the steer disappears into the shroud of foliage. The line from the crane hangs for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The jungle seems to grow very quiet. They all stare at the motionless crane line. It jerks suddenly, like a fishing pole finally getting a nibble. There's a pause - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - and then a frenzy. The line jerks every which way, the jungle plants sway and SNAP from some frantic activity within, there is a cacophony of GROWLING, of SNAPPING, of wet CRUNCHES that mean the steer is literally being torn to pieces and is almost makes it worse that we can't see anything of what's going on - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - and then it's quiet again. The line jerks a few times, then stops. Slowly the SOUND of the jungle starts up again.

They turn and look at the man who spoke. ROBERT MULDOON, the grim-faced man who was present at the accident in the beginning, is fortyish, British.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He joins them and takes his hat off. When Muldoon talks, you listen.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Robert. Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya. Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.

<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fences are electrified, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<MULDOON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. But they never attack the same place twice. They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically. They remembered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULDOON>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them, the crane WHIRRS back to life, raising the cable back up out of the raptor pen. The guest turn and stare as the end portion of the cable becomes visible. The steer has been dragged completely away, leaving only the tattered, bloody harness.

Hammond claps his hands together excitedly.

INT. VISITOR CENTER PRESENTATION ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMMOND, GRANT, ELLIE, MALCOLM, and GANNARO eat lunch at a long table in the visitor's center restaurant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a large buffet table and two WAITERS to serve them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is darkened and Hammond is showing slides of various scenes all around them. Hammond's own recorded voice describes current and future features of the park while the slides flash artists' renderings of all them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The real Hammond turns and speaks over the narration.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
None of these attractions have been finished yet. The park will open with the basic tour you're about to take, and then other rides will come on line after six or twelve months. Absolutely spectacular designs. Spared no expense.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More slides CLICK past, a series of graphs dealing with profits, attendance and other fiscal projections. Donald Gennaro, who has become increasingly friendly with Hammond, even giddy, grins from ear to ear.
</DIRECTION>
<GENNARO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And we can charge anything we want! Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it! And then there's the merchandising - -

	Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich. Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.

Grant looks down, at the plate he's eating from. It's in the shape of the island itself. He looks at his drinking cup. It's got a T-rex on it, and a splashy Jurassic Park logo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are a stack of folded amusement park-style maps on the table in front of Grant. He picks one up. Boldly, across the top it says, "Fly United to Jurassic Park!"

(or alt. version)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait - we were invited to this island to evaluate the safety conditions of the park, physical containment. The theories that all simple systems have complex behavior, that animals in a zoo environment will eventually begin to behave in an unpredictable fashion have nothing to do with that evaluation. This is not some existential furlough, this is an on-site inspection. You are a doctor. Do your job. You are invalidating your own assessment. I'm sorry, John - -

	<DIALOGUE>
	The problem with scientific power you've used is it didn't require any discipline to attain it. You read what others had done and you took the next step. You didn't earn the knowledge yourselves, so you don't take the responsibility for it. You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you knew what you had, you patented it, packages it, slapped in on a plastic lunch box, and now you want to sell it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't give us our due credit. Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should. Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them. Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!

</MALCOLM>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this is nature! Why not give an extinct species a second chance?! I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!

<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist. How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?

</HAMMOND>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing that great about discovery.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

	Please - - let's hear something from the others. Dr. Grant? I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENNARO>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it? You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous. You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves. Violently, if necessary.

Exasperated, Hammond turns to Grant, who looks shell-shocked.

<VOICE>

(O.S.) One of the earliest carnivores, we now know Dilophosaurus is actually poisonous, spitting its venom at its prey, causing blindness and eventually paralysis, allowing the carnivore to eat at its leisure. This makes Dilophosaurus a beautiful, but deadly addition to Jurassic Park.

The Technician turns around his chair and extends his arms in a Christ-like pose. As we get a good look at him, we get the sinking feeling that we've seen him somewhere before. And we have. DENNIS NEDRY is the man who accepted a suitcase full of cash in San Jose.

The two Explorers drive along a high ridge and stop at the edge of the large, open plain that is separated from the road by a fifteen- foot fence, clearly marked with "DANGER!" signs and ominous-looking electrical post.

IN THE PADDOCK,

there is a low HUMMING sound. Out in the middle of the field, a small cage rises up into view, lifted on hydraulics from underground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cage bars slide down, leaving the cage's occupant standing alone in the middle of the field.

It's a goat, one leg chained to a stake. It looks around, confused, and BLEATS plaintively.

The goat waits. And waits. From the Explorers, six faces watch it expectantly. The goat tugs on its chain. It walks back and forth, nervous. It BLEATS.

Grant watches, his eyes glued, his breathing becoming a little more rapid.

GRANT, ELLIE, GENNARO, and the KIDS are out in the open field, heading towards a small stand of trees. For the first time, we notice the sky is darken rather early in the day. Tim dogs Grant's footsteps, so excited he can hardly keep his feet on the ground.

A Triceratops, a big one, lying on its side, blocking the light at the end of the path. It has an enormous curved shell that flanks its head, two big horns over its eyes, and a third on the end of its nose. It doesn't move, just breathes, loud and raspy, blowing up a little clouds of dust with every exhalation.

EXT. FIELD DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the weather grows darker, ELLIE, GRANT, HARDING, and MALCOLM are grouped around an enormous spoor of triceratops excreta that stands at least waist high and is covered with BUZZING flies.

<MALCOLM>

Ellie has plastic gloves on the reach up to her elbows, and is just withdrawing her hand from the middle of the dung.

INT. CONTROL ROOM DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DENNIS NEDRY is busily and surreptitiously typing a series of commands into his console. On his screen, a cartoon hand winds up a cartoon clock, moving its second hand up to the twelve. The clock rotates around to face us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It has a large green dollar sign in the middle. A big word appears on screen, an option surrounded by forbidding red box. "EXECUTE," it says.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARK DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The skies are really foreboding now, and there's a sense of growing urgency. ELLIE is by the animal, a short distance away from the group. GRANT is near her, thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>

Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.

Grant just rolls his eyes, but Ellie comes over and checks out the stones.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?

<DIRECTION>
A light goes on in her eyes.

<ELLIE>

She throws Grant one of the stones. They look at each other in amazement.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good work Tim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at Grant pointedly. Tim looks up at Grant too, smiling from ear to ear. Grant GRUNTS, not so easily convinced.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUNDER rumbles as the storm overhead is about to bust loose. GENNARO, scared of more than one thing now, puts his foot down.

Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike. Is that okay?

</GENNARO>
<DIRECTION>
Grant turns and follows the others, Lex right in his tracks. Ellie and Harding go back to the triceratops, which is starting to come back to life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Grant reaches the Explorer, he turns back for one last look at Ellie. He raises his hand to wave, but she is turned the other way. Feeling silly, he drops his hand and goes into the woods. Just as he does, Ellie turns and waves to him, but with his back turned, he misses it too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In this way, they say goodbye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK AT THE CARS,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the reflections of the GROUP approach, the first raindrops fall on the windshields of the tour vehicles. They're big, fat drops, and they kick up little clouds of dust as they SMACK into the glass.

<DIRECTION>
It's going to be a hell of a storm.

Arnold reaches for the hand microphone.

<DIRECTION>
ACROSS THE ROOM,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DENNIS NEDRY, sweat forming on his upper lip now, is staring at his video monitor. The supply boat is still docked on the island shore, but is now being buffeted by heavy waves. Nedry whispers sharply into the phone, arguing with the MATE of the ship again, who he can see on the video monitor.

He's shaking in his shoes, but trying like hell to be casual.

Hammond and Arnold shake their heads. Nedry starts to leave, then turns back with an afterthought that is so rehearsed its almost obvious.
</DIRECTION>
<NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I finished de-bugging the phones, but the system's compiling for eighteen minutes, or twenty. So, some minor systems may go on and off for a while. There's nothing to worry about. Simple thing....

Nedry turns, stretches one finger out to his screen, and selects an option.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"EXECUTE."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the same time, he presses the start button on his digital stopwatch he holds in his hand. A digital clock on the computer screen starts to tick down from sixty seconds , and a musical clock starts to sound too - - something like the "Jeopardy" theme.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to leave - - but returns when he remembers the shaving cream can. He grabs it and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARK ROAD NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Night was completely fallen now, and the rain has started. It's a tropical storm, the rain falling in drenching sheets on the roofs and hoods of the Explorers, which are making their way slowly back to the visitor's center.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE REAR CAR,

GRANT and MALCOLM are alone. Grant is staring out the window, lost in his thoughts.

</NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
On cue, the security lock panel goes dark and the door CLUNKS ajar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE COOLER,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nedry hurries in and flips open the hatch on the bottom of the shaving cream can, revealing slotted compartments inside. He goes to the rack of dozens of thin glass slides. A sign says "VIABLE EMBRYOS - - HANDLE WITH EXTREME CARE!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the slides out of the rack one by one. They're labeled - - "STEGOSAURUS", "APATOSAURUS", "TYRANNOSAURUS REX" - - and puts them into the can.

The cars jerk to a stop. The lights in the vehicles and along the road go out, plunging them into blackness. Grant jerks his hands away from the steering column, immediately assuming it's his fault.

Nedry's jeep SPLASHES up to the giant gates that lead into Jurassic Park. NEDRY jumps out and hurries to the control panel on the side of the cement supports.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He FLICKS a switch and gates CLICK unlocked.
</DIRECTION>

He jumps back in the car and noses into the gates, shoving them open far enough to drive through.

He ROARS into the park grounds

Muldoon heads for the door just as all the video monitors in the control room go out with a faint electronic ZIP.

EXT. PARK ROAD NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
A wire mesh fence in front of us has a very clear sign:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DANGER! ELECTRIFIED FENCE! This Door Cannot Be Opened When Fence is Armed!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hand reaches out, grabs the fence by the bare wire, flips a latch, and shoves the door open. No sparks fly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DENNIS NEDRY runs from the fence back to his jeep, drops it in gear, and tears off down the park road. The rain is absolutely flowing down now, the road is rapidly turning to mud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE JEEP,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nedry can barely see through the windshield. He's driving as fast as possible, checking his watch every few seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leans forward, squinting to see through the windshield, wiping off the condensation with his free hand. A fork in the road rushes into view. He jumps on the brakes - - to late. The jeep careens into a signpost.
</DIRECTION>
<NEDRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
He throws the door open and hurries to the fallen sign: "To The Docks". He props it up - the directional arrow swings hopelessly on a nail. He clenches his jaws and growls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soaked, Nedry stomps back to his car.

Although he doesn't look too convinced, he drops the car in gear and speeds off to the left.

Tim finds something under the seat and sits up abruptly, holding what looks like a heavy-duty pair of safety goggles.
</DIRECTION>
<GENNARO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Where did you find those things?
	</DIALOGUE>

Tim stares out the back window of the Explorer with Grant and Malcolm in it, behind them. The image is bright fluorescent green.
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, cool! Night vision!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
As Tim watches, the door of the rear Explorer opens, and a hand reaches out, holding an empty canteen out to catch some rain water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE REAR CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant pulls the canteen back in, closes the door, and takes a drink. He and Malcolm wait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE FRONT CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim continues to stare out of the back window with the goggles. He swings his legs - - but suddenly stops. He feels something. He pulls off the goggles and turns back. He moves into the back seat with Lex who is tapping her hat, and reaches forward to still her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you feel that?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you feel that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
She don't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim leans over to the front passenger seat and looks at the two plastic cups of water that sit in the recessed holes on the dashboard. As he watches, the water in the glasses vibrates, making concentric circles - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - then it stops - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - and then it vibrates again. Rhythmically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like from footsteps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.

<GENNARO>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is that? M-Maybe it's the power trying to come back on.

<GENNARO>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Tim turns and looks out the side window. He can see the area where the goat is tethered. Or was tethered. The chain is still there, but the goat is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They all jump, and Lex SCREAMS as something hits the Plexiglas sunroof of the Explorer, hard. They look up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a bloody, disembodied goat leg.
</DIRECTION>
<GENNARO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Jesus. Jesus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENNARO>
<DIRECTION>
Tim whips around to look out the side window again. His mouth pops open, but no sound comes out. Through the goggles, he sees an animal claw, a huge one, gripping the cables of the "electrified" fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim whips the goggles off and presses forward, against the window. He looks up, up, than cranes his head back further, to look out the sunroof. Past the goat's leg, he can see - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - Tyrannosaurus rex. It stands maybe twenty-five feet high, forty feet long from nose to tail, with an enormous, boxlike head that must be five feet long by itself. The remains of the goat hang out of the rex's mouth. It tilts its head back and swallows the animal in one big gulp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gennaro can't even speak. His hand claws for the door handle, he shoulders it open, and takes off, out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	He left us! He left us alone! Dr. Grant! Dr. Grant! He left us! He left us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE ROAD,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gennaro runs away, as fast as he can, right past the second car, towards a cement block outhouse twenty or thirty yards away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches it, ducks inside, and pulls the door after him - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - but there's no latch, just a round hole in the unfinished door. Gennaro backs into a stall, frantic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The whole bathroom begins to shake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE REAR CAR,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant and Malcolm turn in the direction Gennaro went.
</DIRECTION>

<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Malcolm looks the other way, out the passenger window. As he watches, the fence begins to buckle, its post collapsing into themselves, the wires SNAPPING free.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that all about? - -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Grant now turns and watches as, ahead of them, the "DANGER!" sign SMACKS down on the hood of the first Explorer. The entire fence is coming down, the posts collapsing, the cables SNAPPING as - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - the T-rex chews its way through the barrier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They watch in horror as the T-rex steps over the ruined barrier and into the middle of the park road. It just stands there for a moment, swinging its head from one vehicle to the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE FRONT CAR,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rex strides around to the side of the car and peers down, from high above. Tim leaps into the front seat and pulls the driver's door shut. Both kids are terrified, breathing hard, unable to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>

<GRANT>

	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
The T-rex turns and strides quickly back towards them. It circles, slowly, bending over to look in at them through the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant and Malcolm sit trembling in the front seat, watching as the giant legs stride past their windows.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Malcolm freezes as the rex bends down and peers right in through his window. The dinosaur's giant, yellowing eye is only slightly smaller than the entire pane of glass
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The T-rex pulls away slightly, then reaches down and BUMPS the car with its snout, rocking it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE FRONT CAR,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lex is rummaging around in the back cargo area, looking for something, anything. She finds a flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE ROAD,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front car lights up from within as Lex switches on the flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dinosaur raises its head. It turns slowly from the second car to the first car, drawn by the light. Making a decision, it strides over to the first vehicle. FAST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE FRONT CAR,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim and Lex can only stare out of the windows as the T-rex reaches their car and starts to circle it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rex bends down and looks in through the front windshield, then the side window. Tim is eye to eye with the thing for a second, then the dinosaur raises its head up, above the car.
</DIRECTION>

</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
The Kids look up, through the sunroof, as the head goes higher, and higher, and higher, and then the rex turns, looks straight down at them through the sunroof, opens its mouth wide and - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - ROARS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The windows RATTLE, Lex SCREAMS, the flashlight goes on again, and the tyrannosaur strikes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH! The thing's head its the plastic sunroof, knocking the whole frame right out of the roof of the car and down into the vehicle. The bubble falls down onto Tim and Lex, trapping them, and the animal lunges down, through the hole, SNAPPING at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Plexiglas holds, though and protects Tim and Lex even as it pins them to the seats. The T-rex continues to push down, and the glass GROANS, crack lines racing across it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim, whose feet were caught above him, pushes back, only an inch of glass between him and the dinosaur's teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE REAR CAR,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant and Malcolm watch in horror as the dinosaur claws at the side of the vehicle with one of its powerful thigh legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It pushes, starting to tip the car over.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God!

<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Grant looks around, climbs over the seat. He tears apart the back area, searching - and finally finds a metal case. He opens it, finding flares. He grabs one and moves quickly back to the driver's seat and opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm grabs a flare, too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE FRONT CAR,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the glass windows SHATTER, the Kids are thrown to the side, and the Explorer tilts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rex bends down and nudges the car with its head, rolling it up on its side. Tim and Lex tumble around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the T-rex starts to nudge the Explorer toward the barrier. Over the barrier, there is a gentle terraced area at one side where the rex emerged from, but the car isn't next to that, it's next to a sharp precipice, representing a fifty or sixty foot drop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car, upside down now, is pushed near the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rex towers over the car. Like a dog, its puts one foot on the chassis and tears a the undercarriage with its jaws.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Biting at anything it can get a hold of, it rips the rear axle free, tosses it aside, and bites into a tire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tire EXPLODES, startling the animal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE CAR,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim and Lex are trapped inside the rapidly flattening car. As the frame continues to buckle, they crawl toward the open rear window, the car collapsing behind them. Mud and rain water pout into what little space there is left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim is ahead, nearing the back window, when there is a CRUNCH and a seat comes down, pinning him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE ROAD,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the dinosaur backs up, dragging the Explorer, swinging it left and right. It seems ready to fling it over the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant gets out of his car. He's holding the flare in one hand, which he pulls the top off of. Bright flames shoot out the end of it.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Hey! Over here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
The T-rex turns and looks at him
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant waves the flare slowly in front of him from side to side. The T-rex follows his moving arm, eyes locked on the flare. Grant looks over to the wall, and tosses the flare over the edge of the barrier. The rex lunges after it - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unclear with Grant's plan, Malcolm leaps out of the car and tries to scare up the T-rex's attention with his own newly lit flare. He begins to wave it at the animal. Grant sees him - -
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ian! Freeze! Freeze! Get rid of the flare!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<MALCCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the kids!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm inches back slowly, then takes off, running for his life down the road. He runs to the cement block outhouse Gennaro went into earlier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The T-rex sees the movement. It whirls and takes off after Malcolm, fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm runs as fast as he can, approaching the outside just steps ahead of the T-rex
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But not far enough ahead. Without even slowing down, the rex leans forward and flicks Malcolm into the air with its snout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's just a nudge a for the rex, but it sends Malcolm sailing right through a wooden portion of the wall, and into the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE RESTROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gennaro, who cowers in a corner, SCREAMS as teh head of the T- rex EXPLODES through the front of the building, sending chunks of cement flying in all directions inside. The roof collapses; Gennaro tries to protect himself from the falling junk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant gets on his feet and watches as the T-rex noses around in the rubble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It seems to find something. It lunges, and Grant can hear Gennaro SCREAMING, the sound piercing - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - until it abruptly stops.

Grant scrambles over to the car.

	Shhh! Don't move! It can't see us if we don't move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Lex looks at him like he's crazy, but freezes. They wait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM! A big T-rex foot print smacks down in front of them as the dinosaurs approaches the car again. It leans down, right past them, and SNIFFS the car, ragged bits of flesh and clothing hanging from its teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not finding anything, the dinosaur swings its head away, SNORTING loudly through its nose. Grant's hat flies off his head. Still, he doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rex walks to the back of the car. It bends down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAP! The car spins as it is pushed from behind by the rex. Grant and Lex are pushed in front of it, helpless. They scramble around on their knees, trying to keep ahead of the car, which the rex is now pushing even closer to the edge of the barrier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant and Lex crawl quickly, but the car is moving faster, catching up on them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim awakens and SCREAMS. He tries to untangle himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE ROAD,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the T-rex looms over Lex and Grant, who are trapped between the car and the sixty foot drop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE CAR,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the rex bends down and sees Tim. Tim backs away, furiously, but there's almost no room to move in there. The rex opens its mouth wide and stretches its tongue into the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim screams and kicks as the tongue tries to wrap around him. But it fails, and withdraws from the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE ROAD,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the T-rex still tries to get to Grant and Lex, pushing the car, spinning on its roof. Grant and Lex scramble, trying to avoid being caught by the T-rex and crushed by the car.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>

	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
They move, as the rex continues to move the car towards the edge. Grant finally gets on the wall, Lex follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The T-rex ROARS in frustration. It bends down for one final lunge at the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant sees it coming. He grabs one of the dangling fence cables on the other side of the barrier.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grab a hold of me!

She wraps her arm around his neck. He scrambles to the edge of the barrier, and starts to climb down.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Timmy! Timmy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
The cable is slick with rain, and it's all Grant can do to hang on as he and Lex slide rapidly down. Above them, the vehicle is now teetering over the edge, threatening to drop right on top of them if they didn't hurry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant GASPS, as Lex has unwittingly started to choke him as she holds on for dear life.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're choking me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
The car GROANS, nearly over the edge now. Grant looks to the side. There are other cables, out of the line of the car's impending drop. His feet scrambling along the concrete wall, Grant tries to swing over towards one.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grab a wire!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
But he falls short. His momentum carries them back the other way, but on the second swing Lex manages to grab hold of the second cable.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>

The car CRUNCHES into the leafy top of a tree, resting on its roof some fifteen feet below them.

The T-rex stares down at them, but they are safely out of its reach.

It ROARS once more, in a final fit of frustration, turns - -

EXT. PARK ROAD NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the rain continues to pour down, a gas-powered jeep ROARS down another park road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEEP NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DENNIS NEDRY drives the jeep as fast as he can in the treacherous conditions. He MUTTERS to himself, shaking his head.
</DIRECTION>
<NEDRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoulda been there by now - - shoulda been there - -
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
He hauls it around a corner and looks down, checking his watch. When he looks back up, his eyes go wide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a white wood guard rail fence, right in front of him. He stands on the brakes as hard as he can. The jeep fishtails, skidding out of control in the mud towards the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nedry hauls the wheel hard to the side to try to control the skid, but the jeep skids off the road, going halfway over the muddied embankment.
</DIRECTION>
<NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God damn it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
He drops the car in reverse and hits the gas. The wheels spin, sending mud flying everywhere, but the jeep goes nowhere, just digs in further.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nedry can't believe it. Frustrated, he gets out of the jeep. He stops suddenly - he can see another park road, down the sloping embankment, about twenty feet below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a large sign alongside the road. Nedry leans forward excitedly to get a better look. It reads "TO EAST DOCK." He scrambles to the front of the jeep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE HILLSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nedry CRANKS a winch its coil on the front end of the jeep.
</DIRECTION>
<NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
(mumbling to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem. Winch this sucker off the thing - - tie it do a thing - - pull it down the thing - - and pull it back up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
He loses his balance and slips - falling back on his rear. He slides down the muddy embankment, across the road below. Pissed, he gets to his knees and searches for his glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are my glasses? I can afford new ones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
He stands and grabs the winch, and goes to a sturdy-looking tree on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can make it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
From the distance, there is a soft HOOTING sound. There's some movement in the bushes - Nedry looks around for the source of the sound and movement. He doesn't find it. He nervously checks his watch and goes back to the winch, but faster.
</DIRECTION>
<NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem - - pop this thing right down - -
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
The HOOTING comes again and Nedry turns - again, nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A figure ducks around the tree and pops out on the other side, HOOTING playfully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nedry looks around one side of the tree - nothing. It pops up on the other side, HOOTING again. And Nedry looks again. Nothing. It seems like a friendly game of hide-and-seek. But Nedry begins to get rattled.
</DIRECTION>
<NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
That's nice. Gotta go. I'm getting out of here. C'mon you can make it!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He secures the winch and starts across the road, back up the embankment. He freezes, as he feels something behind him. He turns around slowly and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dilophosaur. It stands only about four feet high, its spotted like an owl, and has a brilliant colored crest that flanks its head. It doesn't look very dangerous. In fact, it's kind of cute.
</DIRECTION>
<NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Uh - - nice boy. Nice boy. Okay. Run along. I don't have anything for you! Go on! Go home! Dinner time! Are you hungry? They'll feed you! Go, boy. Girl. Whatever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
The dilophosaur just stares at Nedry, tilting its head curiously. Nedry looks around on the ground and finds a stick. He picks it up and chucks it at the thing. He throws it as far as he can.
</DIRECTION>
<NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice juicy stick! Fetch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
The dilophosaur gets into the spirit of the game, but not the object.
</DIRECTION>
<NEDRY>

He shakes his head and starts back towards the jeep, muttering to himself.

He's near the top when the dilophosaur suddenly hops out right in front him, startling him. Nedry loses his balance and falls back, right on his rear. He gets to his feet, angry.

</NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
The animals HISSES. The brightly colored fan around its neck flares wildly, two bulbous sacs on either side of its neck inflate. It rears its head back again - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - and it SPITS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPLAT! A big glob of something wet SMACKS into the middle of Nedry's chest. He reaches down and touches the goo that's dribbling down his slicker.
</DIRECTION>
<NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's disgusting!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEDRY>
<DIRECTION>
SPLAT! Another glob of goo SMACKS into the highlight, right next to Nedry's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands up. A look of confusion crosses his face. He lifts his right hand, the one that he touched the spit with, and looks at it strangely, flexing it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POW! This time the lugie hits Nedry right smack in the face. He SCREAMS and rubs it away, frantically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Because it hurts. Like hell. Nedry falls back, clawing at this eyes, in excruciating pain. He pulls his hands away, starting to hyperventilate. He flails his arms in front of him, blinking a mile a minute, but blinded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He staggers forward, to try to get into the jeep. He gets the door open, but SMACKS his head on the door frame and collapses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The can of shaving cream flies out of Nedry's jacket pocket - - and tumbles into runoff water, down the muddy hillside. Nedry gets to his feet again and staggers in the general direction of the jeep. He reaches the open door and feels his way in. He SLAMS the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is another HOOT. From inside the jeep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nedry turns and SCREAMS. The dilophosaur is right there, in the passengers seat. It HISSES louder than before, its crest fans angrily, vibrating, reaching a crescendo - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - and the thing pounces, SLAMMING Nedry back against the driver's window, SHATTERING it. As Nedry shrieks - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rain and mud wash over the shaving cream can, burying it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARK GROUNDS NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rain has all stopped now. GRANT and LEX are at the bottom of the large barrier leading up to the park road. Like it or not, they're in the park now, and are surrounded by think jungle foliage on all sides. They're both beaten up, and Grant's face is covered in blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's bent over a big puddle, splashing water on his face, rinsing the blood off and trying to bring himself to.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Poor Lex is scared as hell. She stands behind Grant, ramrod straight, her breath coming short, desperate GASPS. Her eyes are wide, and she doesn't look like she can move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Grant gets rid of the blood, his injury doesn't look so bad, just a gash on his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and looks up to the tree the Explorer fell in. It's stuck there, nose down in the thickest top branches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lex's GASPS are getting louder. She's terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, come on, don't - - don't -- don't - - just - -just - - stop, stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
He touches her, but it's awfully awkward, more of a pat on the head than anything strong or reassured.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But she responds to the contact, hurling herself forward and throwing her arms tightly around his waist. She clamps here, holding on for dear life, SOBBING.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lex, you gotta be quiet, please. Stop it. Shhhhh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
This seems to quiet her.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because if we make too much noise, he's going to hear us and come back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Lex bursts out crying again, a WAILING scream, nearly hysterical now. Grant holds her, no idea what to do. He turns and looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (a whispered shout)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Timmy?! Timmy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
He hears a CRACKING sound. He looks up to the tree again. The Explorer has fallen a few feet lower into the branches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant looks down at Lex, who is sitting on a rock.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad - - Dad - -

</LEX>
<GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex. I'm going to look after you. I'm going to help your brother. I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He left us! He left us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not what I'm going to do. Good!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Grant walks to the tree. Lex scampers into the culvert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TREE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANT takes a deep breath. grabs hold of the first branch, and starts his long climb. Fortunately, it's a good climbing tree, its branches thick and regularly spaced.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant moves at a good pace. He reaches the car's level, on the driver's side five or six feet to one side of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car's in rough shape. It's much thinner that it use to be, its nose completely smashed in, the front wheels driven solidly into a thick branch. They are what hold it in place.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tim? Tim?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Grant comes up to the car and looks in. TIM is huddled on the floor on the passenger side, frightened, hugging his knees to his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up at Grant with a tear and blood-streaked faced. His voice is barely audible.
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I threw up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's okay. Listen, give me your hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Tim doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't tell anybody you threw up. Just give me your hand, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches out. Tim reaches too, but they're still about a foot apart. Grant grabs hold of the steering wheel, to pull himself further in. The wheel turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the branch, the front wheel turns, losing a bit of their grip on the thick branch they're resting on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim and Grant grab hands. Grant holds on to him, getting an arm securely around his waist. They climb down. They stop on a branch.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
It's just like coming out of a tree house. Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he starts to move down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is impossible. How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So am I going to help you with your foot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if the car falls?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(or)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if the wheels fall?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
The car GROWNS forward on the branch, which sags in their direction. They look up. The car begins to shift dramatically towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no! GO, Tim, go! Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
They climb down, as fast as they can, as the big branch that is supporting the car CREAKS, ready to give way any second.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faster! Faster!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
The branch breaks. Disintegrates, really, and the car falls straight at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant and Tim let go of the branch they're on and fall, THUDDING into another branch a few feet down. The car SMACKS into the bug branch they just vacated, and stops there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant and Tim are half climbing, half falling down the tree now, slipping on the resin-covered branches, just trying like hell to get out of the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREEEE-POW! The second branch breaks, and now the car SMASHES and CRASHES through a network of thinner branches, headed right for them. It hits open space and goes into free fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant turns, and puts up his arms in defense --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and the car stops, SLAMMING into a thick branch just above him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant looks up, eyeball to eyeball with the front grill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The new branch starts to CREAK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant and Tim basically fall down the rest of the tree, the car BASHING its way through right behind them. They jump the last six or seven feet and hit the ground, hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant grabs Tim and rolls with him, to the side, just as the car SMASHES into the earth, nose first, standing upright that way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look up in relief, but the damn thing's still heading for them, now tipping over, falling straight at them, and there's no way they have time to get out of the way this time, so Grant just balls himself up on top of Tim to try to protect him and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- CRASH! The jeep falls on top of them. Grant, amazingly unhurt, looks up confused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're inside the jeep again, saved by the hole sunroof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

EXT. CULVERT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LEX is still in the culvert, terrified, slowly BANGING her head against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANT is at the mouth of the culvert, carefully studying the rinky-dink map of the park he picked up during the slide show.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay -- okay --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
He's trying to get his bearings from the crude, cartoon-like drawing on the map, but it's tough.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up, picking a direction, and shoves the map in his pocket decisively.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks back in at Lex.

EXT. PARK ROAD NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MULDOON and ELLIE race down the park road in an open-topped jeep like the one Nedry took earlier. Neither of them speak, they just stare ahead grimly, wondering what they're about to find.
</DIRECTION>
<MULDOON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There they are!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULDOON>
<DIRECTION>
They round a corner and come to the top of the hill, where the attack took place. The jeep skids to a stop and they jump out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The road is rutted, muddy mess. The cement block house is a pile of rubble. One of the Explorers is gone, the other stands untouched, both doors hanging open.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God. Where's the other car?

She runs to the Explorer. Muldoon follows, looking around.

He shines his light along the length of Malcolm's body. His shirt is soaked with blood, but his right leg is even worse off. The right ankle it bent outward at a strange angle from his leg, the trousers flattened, soaked with blood.

Malcolm's belt has been twisted around his thigh.

She turns and looks back at the empty road. She's on the verge of tears, but is fighting them back.

<MULDOON>

	Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks. People just disappear. No blood, no trace. That's the way it happens.

<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, no!

She walks to the edge of the road, her eyes following the deep ruts the Explorer made when it went over the edge. Muldoon gets ready to leave.

EXT. PARK ROAD NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MALCOLM, laid out in the back of the jeep, feels something strange. He looks down, at the one of the T-rex footprints in the road. It's filled with water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water in the puddle vibrates rhythmically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm's eyes widen. He looks around, frantically.

<MALCOLM>

	Look!

</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Wit her flashlight, she follows the trail the footprints made. They lead into the jungle and disappear.

EXT. PARK ROAD NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
MALCOLM's staring , wide-eyed, at the rings in the water, which are getting bigger now.

<MALCOLM>

<MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fairly alarmed here!

</MALCOLM>

ELLIE and MALCOLM come up over the embankment, excited.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotta move, gotta get out of here. Let's go - we gotta go, we gotta get out of here, right now! Go, go! Let's hurry, let's get out of here!

</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
They stop talking. The BOOMING is louder now, and faster. Much faster. They look back, over their shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie and Muldoon get into the jeep, Muldoon in the driver's seat.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Move now! Let's go, let's go, right now, right now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
The tyrannosaur SMASHES out of the jungle foliage, bursts onto the road, and runs straight at them, moving at least thirty miles an hour.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Muldoon fumbles for the keys, turns the jeep over, and SLAMS it into gear. He drops the clutch, hits the gas, and tears ass out of there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the jeep is slow to work through the first few gears. Terrified, Ellie dares to look down, to the side view mirror, which tells her "Objects Are Closer Than They Appear."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And they sure are. The T-rex is still gaining on the slowly accelerating jeep. All three of them stare back at the rex in terror - -
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faster, faster!

	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
- - which means they don't see the half-fallen tree branch right in front of them, blocking the path of the road. Muldoon looks back first, SHOUTS - -
</DIRECTION>
<MULDOON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DOWN!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULDOON>
<DIRECTION>
- - they all duck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The windshield hits the branch and SHATTERS as the jeep flies ahead, really picking up speed now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The T-rex just runs right through the branch, SMASHING it entirely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're bounced around pretty badly. Malcolm is knocked into the front, and in so doing knocks the gear shift into neutral. The engine RACES, the T-rex closes in again - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Losing ground now, the dinosaur makes a final lunge for the jeep and CRUNCHES into the left rear quarter panel - -
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faster, faster!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
- - but Muldoon SLAMS it back into gear and guns it. The T-rex gives up, fading into the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They drive in silence for a few moments, all scared out of their wits.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>

<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
Now, near the top of the tree, the three of them sit there, dangling their legs, looking out over the park.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's an incredible view. They can see in all directions. And with the full moon, there's a lot of detail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Most striking of all are dozens of sauropod heads, at the end of long necks, that tower over the park.
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Those are brontosauruses - - I mean, those are brachiosauruses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim. It's a great name. It's a romantic name. It means "thunder lizard".

<TIM>
<DIRECTION>
(digging that)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Thunder lizard!"

Grant finds a solid web of branch and settles himself in it, leaning back against the trunk of the tree, with a little room on either side of him. Lex nestles up next to him on the branch. Grant is surprised, but accepts it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim climbs off to the side, to a nook in the branch of his own. Silent of a moment, the three can hear the HOOTS of the animals as they call. Some are almost musical.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to that! They're singing!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he moves over to a higher branch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course no one's ever heard one from a dinosaur before, but - - I could swear that sounds suspiciously to me like a mating call

<DIRECTION>
(to me). In an all-female

<DIRECTION>
(or)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On an all-girl island?

He smiles, enchanted. He HOOTS himself, trying to imitate one of the calls. Immediately, five or six of the heads turn in their direction and HOOT back.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop! Stop! Stop! Don't let the monsters come over here!

	They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals. And these are herbivores.

Satisfied, Tim settles in for the night. Grant shifts too, getting comfortable, but something in his pocket pinches him. He winces and digs it out. It's the velociraptor claw he unearthed so long ago in Montana
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yesterday, actually. He looks at it, thinking a million thoughts, staring at this thing that used to be so priceless.

INT. RESTAURANT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELLIE comes into the darkened restaurant, following the source of the flickering light. A candle burns at a table in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN HAMMOND sits at the table, alone. There is a bucket of ice cream in the middle, and he's eating a dish of it, staring down morosely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie draws up to the table and Hammond looks up at her. His eyes are puffy, his hair is messed up - - for the first time we've seen him, the fire is gone from his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were all melting.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Malcolm's okay for now. I gave him a shot of morphine.

<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carousel.

</ELLIE>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ELLIE>
<HAMMOND>

	You're absolutely right. Yes, you're right. Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious. We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now. But that's all correctable for the next time around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John, John. John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion. And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here. That's the illusion.

	Control?! You never had control! I was overwhelmed by the power of this place. So I made a mistake too. I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now. You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up. The only thing that matters now are the people we love. Alan, Lex, and Tim. And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
There is a long pause. Hammond avoids her gaze. Ellie reaches out and takes a spoon out of one of the buckets of ice cream, and licks it. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's good.

EXT. PARK DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun comes up over Jurassic Park. The danger of the night before is overcome by the sheer beauty of the place - - it really is like the Serengeti Plain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over at the edge of a great open field, a huge tree marks the border between the open area and the thick of the jungle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP IN THE TREE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANT, TIM, and LEX are asleep in the branches of the tree, both kids now curled up under Grant's arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A heavy shadow falls over all three of them, blocking out the sun entirely. Grant awakens, only a little bit asleep, as - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - a brachiosaur's head pushes into the tree branches, right up beside them. It hesitates there for a second, seemingly staring at them. Grant just watches as it opens its mouth very wide and CHOMPS down on a branch over their heads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kids awaken with a start. Tim points, Lex opens her mouth to scream, but nothing comes out. Then - -
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>

	Veggiesaurus, Lex, Veggiesaurus!

</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
But Lex isn't taking any chances and scrambles back, away from its mouth. Tim and Grant come together on the branch, just staring at the dinosaur in wonder as it eats its breakfast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant gets another branch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim scampers up, trying to get the brachiosaur's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Come here, boy - - I mean girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he tries whistling)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant moves forward and tries to feed the brachiosaur. The animal gets the end of the branch and starts a tug-of-war with Grant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim tries to help him - - they really begin to have a good time with the brachiosaur.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HONK! The brachiosaur makes a loud honking noise, startling Grant and the kids.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>

	That's a girl. Hey Lex, you can touch it. It's a girl, just like you. Come on, it's okay. Lex, come on and touch it. It likes you. It's gotta like you. Come on Lex. Lex, come over and touch - - it's a girl, it has to like you. Lex, why don't you touch it. It has to like you. It's a girl.

	Come here, girl. This is a seventy-seven ton animal. Just think of it as a big cow!

Grant maneuvers in closer. He reaches out and grabs hold of the thing's lip with both hands and pulls it down, revealing the jaw at work.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>

The dinosaur keeps chewing, not objecting to the inspection.
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you smell that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
Lex tentatively edges forward in the tree to the inspection.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on girl, up here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
She barely touches the thing on the tip of its nose - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - and it SNEEZES. It's a vast explosion, and Lex falls back, dripping wet from head to toe.

<TIM>

	God bless you!

</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE GROUND,

Lex, her shirt is soaked, and face all wet, walks away from the tree. Tim and Grant follow.

Lex is embarrassed and ticked off.

Grant is still crouching on the ground below the tree where he landed, staring at something in the palm of his hand. They both come and look over his shoulder, curious. They stare in amazement - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - at a whole clutch of dinosaur eggs! All hatched, now empty. Grant picks up one of the fragments, a large one - nearly half an egg.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>

	Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps. They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.

INT. CONTROL ROOM DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mood in the room is hopeless. MALCOLM, his wounds bandaged, but in real pain, hangs around with ELLIE and MULDOON, hoping for some development while RAY ARNOLD is still at the computer terminal and looking a mess, he doggedly sorts through the computer system's lines of code. One. By one. By one. They BLIP by, reflected in his glasses. He turns and stares up at HAMMOND with a look of absolute incredulity on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<ARNOLD>

	No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -

Hammond turns to her, the twinkle back in his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us. We will never find the command NEDRY used. He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back. So shutting down the system - -

</HAMMOND>
<ARNOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not do it. You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARNOLD>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>

</HAMMOND>
<ARNOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Theoretically, yeah

Hammond walks away from the group.
</DIRECTION>
<ARNOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARNOLD>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How would we cut off the lysine?

</ARNOLD>
<DIRECTION>
He walks slowly across the room to a red metal box on the wall. He takes a key from his belt, unlocks the door, and opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a row of four switches inside. He flips them off, one by one, leaving only a single lever left.

<DIRECTION>
His hand hovers over it. . . and he flips the lever.

They wait, in tense silence. Hammond adjusts the wilting silk handkerchief in his breast pocket. He notices Malcolm staring at him, his eyes full of disapproval.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You're all right, John You're okay. It's just you don't have intelligence. You have "thinktelligence." You think narrowly and call it "being focused." You don't see the consequences. You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.

Finally, Arnold turns back to the box. He flips the row of safety switches back again, then hesitates by the main switch.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Here - - they're flocking this way.

Grant takes a few steps forward. As he watches, he can make out shapes in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dinosaurs. Dozens of them. All at once, he figures it out.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	STAMPEDE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
And that's exactly what it is, a stampede of at least forty dinosaurs, Gallimimus by name. Lex is ready to get out of there, but Grant and Tim hesitate, staring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dinosaurs kick up a flock of birds, which startles them, and they call change direction at once, the same way.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at the wheeling - - the uniform direction change! Like a flock of birds evading a predator!

</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Sure enough, they hear a ROAR, the very familiar roar - - - - of Tyrannosaurus rex.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Grant and the kids whirl at the sound, but can't place it, as it seems to come from all around them. They look back towards the stampede. The herd spontaneously changes direction again, and now they're headed straight at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three of them take off, across the meadow, toward the relative cover of the jungle. It's a real footrace, but the herd is far faster, and Grant knows they're not going to make it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They jump over a huge root network. There's a space under it to hide, and Grant stops the kids, shoves them underneath, then follows them. They cover their heads as the herd THUNDERS over the roots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chunks of everything fly everywhere as the herd plows overhead, their clawed feet striking the roots dangerously close to Grant and the kids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, they pass. Grant peers up, over the top root. He looks toward the trees, which the herd is now running alongside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ROAR comes from somewhere within the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant scans the trees, looking for any sign of the T-rex - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - and then it bursts out, ahead of the herd, cutting them off, throwing them into disarray, scattering them everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They all stare as the rex kicks it into overdrive, runs down one of the Gallimimus, and sinks its teeth into its neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The T-rex makes the kill in a cloud of dust and debris.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim and Grant half rise to their feet, staring in wonder.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanna go - -now!

But Grant and Tim are transfixed, watching the T-rex.

MULDOON and ELLIE emerge from one path and come into a slightly more open area. The huge raptor pen stands silently, surrounded and penetrated by jungle, the abandoned goon toward looming over it like a haunted house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Muldoon slows down, Ellie right next to him. They notice a hole in the fence that surrounds the raptor pen.

The metal is twisted, as if gnawed, the hole is large enough for an animal to slip through.

Ellie runs as fast as she possibly can - - a real broken field sprint, hopping over branches, flying across the open area at top speed. Over a log - - SPLASH!, she hits a water puddle. She comes to another log obstacle - - she grabs a tree and swings over it.

She nears the maintenance shed, and doesn't look back. She reaches the door, blasts through it, and SLAMS it behind her.

ELLIE watches as the banks of fluorescent lights in the maintenance shed come on, one by one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights are going on in rows, coming closer and closer to her. Finally, her row comes on. She follows the light and sees - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - a raptor, right there, behind the control panel! It SLASHES, taking a lunging sweep at Ellie, but gets stuck, its feet and legs tangled in the maze of pipes on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is our first good look at one of these things, and if it weren't so terrifying, we could admit that it truly is a thing of beauty. It's the biggest of the raptors, intensely muscled, coordinated as hell, a smoothly designed predator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie SHOUTS and falls back into the pipes on the other side of the aisle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The raptor untangles itself from the pipes and gives chase, just as Ellie SLAMS the mesh door closed. The raptor BANGS against the mesh door, Ellie falls to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She holds on by kicking the door shut as the raptor continues to push himself through the door. Ellie is able to get the door closed. She stands, but then falls back onto one of the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dead arm falls onto her shoulder. RAY ARNOLD is there, or what's left of him, stuck in the tangle of pipes. Ellie moves away, and his arm falls to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't realize that she has moved right back near the mesh wall - - and the raptor comes at her again. Ellie takes off running as fast as she can, back the way she came. She drags the flashlight with her, running over the dead arm and Arnold's legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She continues to run, her headset dangling, the flashlight dragging behind her on its cord.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches the stairs and hits them hard, flying up them. The raptor must be right behind her, she can hear the CLICKING and CLANGING as it scrambles up the stairs, but she doesn't look back.
</DIRECTION>

She reaches the top, throws open the door, hurls herself outside - -

ROBERT MULDOON creeps slowly through the jungle foliage, tracking his prey. He ducks and walks through a hollow log, underneath a fallen tree, following the RUSTLING sound up ahead of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can see just a trace of the raptor's gray flesh as it movies behind the bushes up ahead, staying camouflaged enough to deny him a decent shot. Thinking he's got a moment, Muldoon extends the back handle of the gun and clicks it into place. He prepares to take aim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A snake slithers across a tree branch, past what looks like the large iris of a flower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flower blinks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the eye of the raptor. Muldoon sees it. He raises his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instead of running away again, the raptor rises slowly out of the brush, fully revealing itself to Muldoon, HISSING at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The corners of Muldoon's mouth twitch up into a smile. He draws a bead on the animal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His finger tenses on the trigger. Suddenly, his smile vanishes, both eyes pop open, and a terrible thought sweeps across his face. His eyes flick to the side - -
</DIRECTION>
<MULDOON>

	Clever girl.

- - which is where the attack comes from. With a ROAR, another raptor comes flashing out of nowhere and pounces on him. The gun BLASTS, but wildly, and the raptor's claw SLASHES through Muldoon's midsection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Muldoon SCREAMS and falls back, the raptor locked on top of him, all tooth and claw all of a sudden.

As the second raptor makes the kill, the first raptor strides slowly forward and watches approvingly.

It throws its head back and SNARLS.

<DIRECTION>
Tim goes across the room, to an all-you-can-eat table on the other side, and quickly piles some food on a tray. He brings its back to the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lex digs in, munching on veggies, grabbing food with two hands. Tim enjoys his food, too.

Lex comes up with a spoonful of lime Jell-O from a plastic dinosaur egg cup - - but her hand freezes halfway to her mouth.

She runs to a panel of lights switches and kills them all, plunging the room into semidarkness. She helps TIM down an aisle and they hide at the end, behind a counter, breathing hard.

A raptor's head pops into view, visible through the round window in the middle of the restaurant door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It just looks for a moment, its breath steaming up the window.

INT. KITCHEN DAY

<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE DOOR TO THE KITCHEN,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the raptor stares down at the door handle, cocking its head curiously. It SNARLS and bumps the door handle with its head, but that doesn't do anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It reaches out, toward the handle, with one clawed hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE KITCHEN,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim and Lex stare in shock as the door handle starts to turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens. The first raptor stands in the doorway, draws itself up to its full height, and looks around the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, a second raptor joins it in the doorway. They move into the room, brushing against each other. The first raptor SNAPS as the second, as if to say "keep your distance."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the raptors split, taking two different aisles. Tim and Lex crawl away, Tim awfully weak now, down a third aisle, around the other side of the counter from the raptors, moving in the opposite direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Tim and Lex pass the raptors, one of the raptor's tails SMACK into some pots and pans, knocking them off the counter. They fall on the kids, who manage to keep quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kids keep moving as one of the raptors dips down, looking through an open cabinet to inspect the racket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim and Lex reach the end of the aisle and round a corner - - but Timmy's falling behind now, and he accidentally brushes against some hanging kitchen utensils.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both raptors turn. One jumps onto the counter, knocking more kitchen stuff to the floor. A ladle CLATTERS to a stop, and the strange metallic sounds confuse the raptors for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then they move, in Tim's direction, SNIFFING, heading right for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The raptor on the floor is just about to turn the corner to where Tim sits, exposed and exhausted, but both the raptors suddenly stop, hearing a CLICKING sound from the other end of the aisle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Lex, TAPPING a spoon on the floor to distract them. The raptor on the counter jumps down and starts cautiously towards Lex's noise, leaving Tim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lex sees a steel cabinet behind her, its sliding door slid up and open. She crawls inside, silently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim sees the raptors make the turn towards Lex, SMASHING more stuff around with their tails. He turns and sees a walk-in freezer in the far wall, with a pin-locking handle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Lex tries to pull the overhead door to the cabinet shut, one of the raptors rounds a corner and sees her reflection on a shiny cabinet front. Lex tries frantically to lower the cabinet door, but it's stuck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim takes a few deep breathes, summons what little strength he has left - -

- - and makes a break for the walk-in freezer. He's limping, dragging himself, really moving like a wounded prey now, and - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - the other raptor spots him. Both raptors go into a pre- attack crouch - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - and they pounce, one towards each of the kids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lex tugs on the cover, to the avail - - Tim's raptor charges after him, just open floor space between them - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - and Lex's raptor THUDS into a shiny surface bearing hr reflection. It chased the wrong image. It sags to the floor, semiconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the other end of the aisle, the real Lex SCREAMS as the other raptor bears down on Tim. Tim reaches the freezer, rips the door open, and falls inside. The floor is cold and slick and his feet go right out from under him. He sprawls across the floor, rolls out of the way - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - and the raptor slips and falls into the freezer too, right past him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim drags himself to his feet and out of the freezer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The raptor makes one last lunge, right on Tim's heels, its mouth wide open - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - but Lex SLAMS the door shut just as Tim is clear. The raptor's head is caught for a second, but it SNARLS, retreats, and Lex's gets the door shut all the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The raptor ROARS and SCREAMS inside. Lex jams the pin through the handle, locking it in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the other raptor staggers to is feet. Groggy, it SMASHES into stuff all over the kitchen. Lex throws her arms around Tim again for support and they take off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RESTAURANT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIM and LEX hurry across the restaurant. They stare back over their shoulders as they run. They CRASH into GRANT and ELLIE.

GRANT, ELLIE, and the KIDS race down the second floor corridor towards the control room, Grant helping Tim.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL ROOM DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the control room SMACKS open. GRANT, ELLIE, and the KIDS burst in. Ellie heads straight for Nedry's computer terminal. Grant moves Tim to the side, and races back to the door to lock it.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>

She sits at the computer and studies the screen. It's flashing to her, dominated by a maze-like grid. She studies it, confused.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no! The door locks - - Ellie! Boot up the door locks! Boot up the door locks!

POW! Something hits the door, hard, from the outside, the kids SCREAM, Grant hurls his back against it - - Grant loses his gun. He struggles. The raptor scratches his head.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ALAN!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
- - and Ellie leaps out of the chair and races over to the door to help him. A raptor SNARLS and SNAPS, RAMMING itself against the door, trying to force its way into the control room. It's all Ellie and Grant can do to hold the door against the onslaught, but it bucks against them viciously.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>

OVER AT THE COMPUTER,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lex slides quickly into the command chair at Nedry's terminal. She stares at the screen for a moment - -
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a Unix system. I know this. It's the files for the whole park. It's like a phone book - -it tells you everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
- - and then her fingers start to fly over the keyboard. Tim watches, amazed, as the computer starts to respond to Lex's commands.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got to find the right file. Oh no, this isn't right. This might be right, no this isn't it.

<TIM>

	C'mon, Lex! C'mon, Lex! Go, Lexie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
Reaching another menu, Lex spots a box on the screen that reads "DOOR INTEGRITY." She reaches out and touches it. The screen BEEPS - -
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There it is, I got it! This is it, I did it. Yes, yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
- - and the door latch panel BUZZES. Grant and Ellie put everything they have into it and finally the door SNICKS shut, locking the raptor outside.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>

<DIRECTION>
A phone RINGS. HAMMOND and MALCOLM look at each other, wide- eyed. Hammond lunges for it.

	Grant?! The children alright?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL ROOM DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the screens in the control room have come alive now, and data is scrolling by at incredible speed as every remaining system is the park comes back on line. ELLIE is at the keyboard with LEX now, figuring things out, and GRANT is on the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The children are fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL ROOM DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMMOND is on the phone, MALCOLM is trying to listen.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God.

</HAMMOND>
<GRANT>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, the phones are back up! Call the mainland! Tell them to send the damn helicopters - -
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Grant stops in the middle of his sentence. A SCREAM cuts in, then three GUNSHOTS, fast, and a horrible CLUNKING as the phone is dropped.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grant! GRANT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
But there's no answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL ROOM DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant's rifle lies on the floor, smoking, several spent shells alongside it. The front window of the control room has three huge impact shatter patterns in the glass, where the gunshots hit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIM goes into an open panel through the ceiling, and into the crawl space. LEX climbs the ladder, followed by ELLIE and GRANT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant looks over to the front window, scared as hell, just as - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - it SHATTERS in a shower of glass and a raptor EXPLODES into the control room. It lands on its feet on a work station console, images from wall projectors falling across its head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant vaults himself up into the ceiling, and knocks the ladder with his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The raptor tilts its head curiously, looking up at the swaying ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CRAWL SPACE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant, Ellie, and the kids dash across the ceiling panels, moving fast, but carefully, so as not to break through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH! The raptor's head bursts through a panel behind them, leaping up at them, SNARLING and SNAPPING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It drops down again, and they keep moving forward. But now it ERUPTS through a panel right in front of them. They SCREAM, its teeth CLICK just inches in from of Ellie - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - but the raptor can't hold itself up there, and it falls back to the floor of the control room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant looks around frantically and spots an air duct a few yards away.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Follow me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
They move for it, but the raptor's head CRASHES through the ceiling again, this time right underneath Lex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She SCREAMS and is lifted up, on top of its head, and pinned to the ceiling above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant SMASHES hit boot into the side of the raptor's head. The raptor SLAMS at him, latching onto his boot for a second before the raptor's own weight pulls it back down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lex goes down with the raptor, spinning into the hole in the ceiling, tumbling down. Grant grabs her by the collar at the last second, but Lex dangles there, above the raptor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The animal flips over onto its feet and crouches to pounce just as Grant summons his strength and jerks Lex back into the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The raptor springs, but too late. Grant and Lex scramble over to the air duct and join Ellie and Tim inside it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE AIR DUCT,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant, Ellie, and the kids crawl through the air duct as fast at they can, the thin metal BOOMING and creasing around them. They reach a metal gate that shows daylight beneath. Grant reaches out and pulls it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the gate, they can see the lobby of the visitor's center below. They're directly above the skeletons of the dinosaurs, the T- rex and the sauropod it's attacking. The unfinished skeletons are surrounded by scaffolding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROTUNDA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant and the others climb down out of the air duct and onto a platform of the scaffolding that stands alongside the skeletons. They continue down to the second platform, then the third. They suddenly see - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RAPTOR, standing to the side by the second floor railing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's much too far to jump to the lobby floor, so Grant climbs gingerly onto the nearest skeleton, the towering brachiosaur.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They climb down as fast as they can. Grant helps Tim down, Lex and Ellie follow. Ellie goes to the tail. Lex moves to the front. Grant lands on the main body in the middle with Tim. And the raptor watches them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up in the ceiling, the skeleton's anchor bolts GROAN in the plaster, starting to pull free. But for now, they hold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The raptor flies out and lands on the back of the middle section of the skeleton. SNAP! It CRACKS apart with the weight, sending the sections spinning in all different directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant and Tim twirl on the middle section. Tim begins to slide down. Grant tries to hold on to him - - but Tim loses his grip and falls to the ground right underneath the swinging, large middle section of the dinosaur skeleton.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Lex spins on the front section. She slips - - and tries to keep from falling as she hangs by her legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The anchor bolts in the ceiling RIP free, ZINGING past them like bullets. The entire brachiosaur skeleton collapses like a house of cards sending Ellie to the ground. She covers herself with her arms, trying to protect her head from the shower of falling bones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lex falls, landing on the ground with bones falling on top of her. She SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant, alone in the middle section, looks up and sees the cable about to SNAP - - he falls! The large section of the skeleton comes careening down, heading straight for Tim, who lays where he fell on the ground. It comes SMASHING down. . . with just enough space for him to be safe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The raptor tumbles to the floor in a cascade of splintering bone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It lands on its back a few yards away and staggers for a moment, the wind knocked out of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant lands in front of Tim. He stands, and goes to Tim. Lex sits up and sees the raptor regain its feet. She SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie stands. She notices the shadows of the second raptor, standing behind the visqueen. She stops dead in her tracks. She backs up towards Grant and Tim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The raptor comes out from under the plastic and looks around. Grant gets Tim out from under the skeleton. Lex joins them. They back away from the raptor, approaching from the left side. They back up towards the large rock in the middle of the room holding the other skeleton.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The raptor crouch in their pre-attack stance - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The group is caught in the middle of the two approaching raptors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lex looks back and SCREAMS. Grant and the others continue to back up. They look up and see - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - TYRANNOSAURUS REX! It's massive head descends down from above. A set of six-foot jaws clamp down on the raptor. Eighteen-inch teeth sink into its side, and the helpless animal HOWLS in agony as it's lifted up, up, up off the floor of the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant and the others look up in stunned amazement. They step back behind the rock for safety and look to the right. They see another raptor approaching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other raptor goes up in the air now, twenty feet off of the lobby floor, held fast in the mouth of the Rex. It stands in the entrance to the lobby in front of the massive hole it ripped through the Visqueen wall. It shakes its enormous head once, BREAKING the neck of the velociraptor, then drops it, dead, to the floor at its feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant, Ellie, and the kids skirt the battle royal on the lobby floor and dash of the door of the Visitor's Center.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second raptor turns from the humans and lunges at the Rex's side, leaping twelve feet into the air and rending the Rex's flesh as it comes down, slashing it open with its six-inch claw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rex BELLOWS in pain, and turns on the raptor, eyes raging, and strikes, just once, quickly, as fast as the head of a serpent. It catches the raptor by thick back end, buts one of its enormous feet down on it, and tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It rips the last velociraptor in half.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rex whirls around - as it turns, its heavy tail counterbalances, SNAPPING the other way, sweeping across the lobby and SMASHING right through the T-rex skeleton.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The skeleton collapses in an explosion of bones, falling to pieces around the living rex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rex stands majestically in the middle of the lobby, both skeletons swept away, SNAPPING like matchsticks as they settle around the animal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rex draws itself up to its full height - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - and ROARS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound is deafening, and the vibrations rattle the entire Visitor's Center. The sign which dangled over the lobby by its one remaining wire finally falls, CLATTERING to the floor at the Rex's feet, face up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH", it says.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE VISITOR'S CENTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hammond SQUEALS the Jeep to a halt in front of the steps. Malcolm is lying in the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant and the other practically fall into the Jeep.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>

Hammond hits the gas and the Jeep takes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HELICOPTER LANDING PAD DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter rotors whirl to life as the chopper waits on the landing cross. Two Jeeps ROAR up next to it, one driven by GRANT, the other by HAMMOND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HELICOPTER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One by one, they climb aboard, their faces white from their ordeal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELLIE comes on first, holding LEX. Then HAMMOND, carrying TIM. And GRANT, helping MALCOLM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one speaks. Hammond takes another look at his dream, Grant comes over and takes him back to the helicopter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter takes off immediately. As they rise into the air, they stare out the windows, looking down on the park as it spreads out below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWN IN THE PARK,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the helicopter soars over a vast plain. The Tyrannosaur, which is still feeding on the remains of the dinosaurs it ran down and killed, looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It throws its head back and ROARS, waving its little forelimbs at the strange thing in frustration. As the helicopter moves off, the T-rex just stares, silently, with huge, yellowing eyes. It's a moment of utter bewilderment for the rex, and we almost feel - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- - sad for her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK IN THE HELICOPTER,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hammond looks down at the park, his eyes full. He looks over at the kids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're in the back of the helicopter, with Grant. As they look out the window, Grant almost absently has his arms around both kids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Ellie looks at him. Both he and the kids seem so natural, so obviously comfortable and trusting with each other. She smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The four of them sit that way, in the back of the helicopter, huddled together. Survivors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant looks out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter sweeps low over a huge flock of sea birds that's feeding on a school of fish. As the chopper ROARS near, it kicks up the flock. Hundreds of birds sail off in all directions, powerful and graceful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant looks at the bids and breaks into a wide grin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The birds reform as flock again and fly straight into the sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
