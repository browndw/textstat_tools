One bikini beauty is singled out. She's a gorgeous brunette named SIDNEY. Sidney stands facing camera holding a TEC-9 and describing it.

	Hi, I'm Sidney. And I love to TEC-9. The popular TEC-9 is advertised by its makers as being tough as the toughest customer.

INT. MELANIE'S BEAHC APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Black Voice belong to forty-five-year old ORDELL ROBBIE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ordell wears clothes nice and likes wearing nice clothes. Stylish, athletic wear (Reebok), heavy, black leather jackets (Hugo Boss), warm-colored berets and baseball caps to cover his balding head are Ordell's "look." At this moment Ordell's wearing an open silk shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ordell narrates the video playing on the big-screen V. (the most expensive thing in the apartment). He holds a cocktail in one hand (screwdriver, his drink of choice) and the remote control in the other, pacing the floor in his I-can-talk-anybody-into-anything voice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOUIS GARA, who looks like he does his shopping at the Salvation Army (dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and dungarees), sits on the sofa staring blankly at the video, drinking Jack Daniels on ice. Louis, white, also in his mid forties, has lived over half of his life in penal institutions. The experience has affected both his body language and his thought process.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While acutely aware of the rhythm of life inside a correction facility, in the real world his timing is thrown. It's like a song he doesn't know the lyrics to but attempt to sing anyway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The third person watching the video is the person who lives in this apartment, MELANIE RALSTON. Melanie, thirty- three, is a tanned, blonde, California beach bunny. Like the kind you se in the old Crown International movies from the seventies like "Pom Pom Girls" "Malibu Beach" and "Beach Girls," except Melanie is older than any of those girls ever are. She's dressed in her Melanie- uniform of stringy Levis cutoffs and a stringy bra top. So far Melanie has been able to make a living out of lying in the sun, always finding a generous, wealthy man more than willing to pay her rent and pick up her tabs. In her prime (twenty two) it was Japanese industrialists, film production guys, and Middle Eastern businessmen who kept Melanie. And it was places like the Bahamas, Acapulco, and the Virgin Islands where they kept her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But now, at thirty three, she lives in an apartment in Hermosa Beach, California that Ordell pays for an drops in and out of. She's curled up in a reclining chair, smoking weed from a pipe, reading Movieline Magazine and paying no attention to the video.
</DIRECTION>
<ORDELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This TEC-9? They advertise it as being the most popular gun in American crime. Can you believe that shit? It actually says that on the little booklet that comes with it. "Most Popular Gun in American Crime," like they're proud of that shit.

I always try and steer a customer towards a 9- millimeter. Damn near the same weapon, don't have half the jammin' problems. But some niggas out there, you can't tell them anything. They want a .45. The killer had a .45, they want a .45.

Ordell puts one more shot in his head, BAM, tosses the weapon on top of the dead body and closes the trunk.

	You think you're a good guy. When you go into a deal you don't go in prepared to take that motherfucker all the way. You go in looking for a way out. And it ain't cause you're scared neither.

Cause me, once I decide I want something, aint a goddam motherfuckin' thing gonna stop me from gittin' it. I gotta use a gun get what I want, I'm gonna use a gun.

Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it aint gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million.

We cut to the detective and the special agent for the first time in the scene.

<DARGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Miss Brown, there's basically three types of people that we come along in the performance of our duty. One is, INNOCENT PEOPLE. Victims, witnesses, innocent bystanders... You ain't any of these. Then there's two; CRIMINALS. These sonabitches have dedicated their lives to a life outside the law. That ain't you either. Where you belong is the third category. The category we refer to as LOSERS.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARGUS>
<DIRECTION>
Jackie's eyes don't even narrow at the insult. She just says without expression;
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not a loser.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<DARGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?

Jackie remains unmoved by this monologue.

Nicolet joins back in.

<NICOLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, ol' Beaumont wasn't much for talkin', either. Yeah, he told us about you and Mr. Walker, but whoever the hell it was he worked for out here, he wouldn't say. Could it be the same person you were supposed to deliver this money to?
	</DIALOGUE>

	You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement -

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

While Johnny Cash continues crooning, Ordell puts on his gloves. Then opens up his glovebox, taking out a little Targa .22 pistol. He steps out of the car, slipping the pistol into his coat pocket. We STEDICAM in front of him as he walks across the street to Jackie's apartment. Once inside the complex, Ordell passes us and WE FOLLOW BEHIND HIM, up to Jackie's ground-floor apartment door.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAX IN CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max drives home, an almost moony romantic look no his face. He can't stop thinking about Jackie. During the night she'd have a gleam in her eyes, the look saying; "WE COULD HAVE FUN". Unless she was appraising kinda him with the look, making a judgment and what it said was; "I COULD USE YOU". Either way it was a turn-on.

Max pulls into the driveway of his small house in Torrance.

ORDELL AND JACKIE

She leaves FRAME, and Max enters it, closing the door behind him. Max stands by the door, a little surprised and a touch pissed at the nonchalantness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he stands on the threshold to her living room, waiting for her to return with the gun, feeling foolish, he thinks about hauling her ass back to the stockade. That'll change her expression, he'd bet.

In a clear, plastic frame. Melanie, circa 1976, at about sixteen wearing roller-disco skates. Melanie, in a green setting, about five years ago, wearing a pretty Oriental- style dress, with a "smile for the camera" look on her face.

<MELANI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... so first he tries to get into the cocaine business but realizes right away that shit's too competitive. Piss the wrong person off, you get shot. So he says, fuck that - moves over to guns. You can sell guns wherever there's a demand. No one gives a shit. He acts like he's this big international arms dealer, when, come on, the only people he ever sold to were dopers.

</JACKI>
<ORDELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORDELL>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.

</JACKIE>
<ORDELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a good idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORDELL>
<JACKIE>

	Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORDELL>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
	</DIALOGUE>

<ORDELL>

	No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jackie paces in front of him, white wine in one hand, Davidoff in the other, going over the details of tomorrow. One could notice a slight change in Jackie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a bit of an edge to Miss Brown that's bubbling underneath her cool surface. It's understandable. After all, she's been the architect of this half-a-million dollars switcheroo. She's moved heaven and earth to make all the pieces fall into place, and all the players thnk what she wants them to think.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she talks to Max she knows tomorrow all her hard work will either fail or succeed. But don't take this difference the wrong way. This edge I'm referring to is not one born out of fear (Jackie's nervous, but she's not afraid). It's more the edge an athlete might feel before an all-important competition.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stops, looks around, head darting from one direction to another. She looks in a panic. The CAMERA begins to twirl around her. She seems to be looking for something she doesn't see. She looks helpless and on the verge of tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the twirling CAMERA circles her, she screams;
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>

<LOUIS>

MAX CHERRY

Max is looking at dresses, paying no attention to the fitting room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He thinks, 'what the fuck is Max Cherry doing here?'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max, doing what he's doing, looks up and sees Louis staring at him across the floor. Max smiles and gives Louis a wave before turning his back to him and continues to do what he was doing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He quickly looks around the store to see anything else; any more surprise guests, possible police surveillance. Everything looks normal. The saleswoman is behind the register ringing up Jackie's purchase. The few customers there are doing customer stuff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he sees Melanie come out with a Robinson's/May bag and head down a different aisle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hurries down his aisle and cuts her off. Their whole fight is said tense and low.

Louis could kill her right now. Just take his gun out of his pants and shoot her in her snickering face. But instead of doing what he wants, he does what he should. He doesn't answer of look back. (If he looked back and saw that Melanie-smirk, he couldn't e responsible for what happens.)He changes directions, cuts down another aisle and hopes for both their sakes she shuts the fuck up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But our Melanie just keeps on being Melanie.

	Don't say anything else, okay? I'm telling you, keep your mouth shut.

Melanie was surprised by the spin, but is about to say something anyway when Louis put his hand up and says;

Louis whips out the Beretta Ordell gave him, shoots her... BAM... in the belly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She bounces OFF one of the cars and goes down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM... Louis shoots her again on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One; to make sure. Two; cause it felt good.

He hops in the car, and throws it into reverse.

We can se Melanie's bare legs sticking out from a row of cars. Louis stops the Toyota alongside the dead Melanie, and yells through the passenger window;

Max hears a commotion behind him and turns to see Louis and Melanie hurriedly making their way towards Designer Clothes.

He sees Jackie disappear into the fitting room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees Amy leaving the fitting room entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches Melanie, by herself, watch Amy leave. Melanie watches the fitting room for a few moments. Gathering her courage, then makes her move, entering the fitting room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max smiles to himself, "so far so good" he thinks. He throws a look towards Louis, only to see Louis staring dead at him with an unhappy look on his face. Max returns the look with a smile and a wave then turns his back on his before he can see a reaction.
</DIRECTION>

Max continues his fake browsing.

He sees Melanie come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag close to her chest.

She and Louis disappear.

He sees Jackie come out of the fitting room, go over to Amy and buy the dress. Jackie goes into her act, acting agitated and distracted as she talks to Amy, pays with cash, then leaves stopping to say;

<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in there. Looks like beach towels.

She's gone.

Amy is left alone by the cashier counter.

It's Max's turn.

As Max looks at Amy, then at the fitting room entrance, he says to himself;
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Max, old boy. You've spent nineteen years dealing with people who take incredible risks. You walk over to that counter, you're gonna find out what it's like.

Max walks toward the fitting room, enters it, walks down the length of stalls, and stops in front of the last one.

<DIRECTION>
He opens the door to the stall. Sitting in the corner is the Robinson's/May bag. He walks over to it, lifts out the towels, and sees all that money. He replaces the towels, picks up the bag and leaves. HE walks across the Designer Clothes, passes by Amy, says;

He's outside; nobody's stopped him. He keeps walking towards his blue Seville. He keeps walking unhurriedly, never looking back. He gets to his car, uses opening the car door as an excuse to look back at the mall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's normal. Nobody's after him, nobody's watching him. He made it. It worked.

Max allows himself a smile, gets into his Cadillac with his half-a-million bucks and drives away.

Ordell shrugs it off, and digs into the shopping bag. He pulls out the towels and sees forty-thousand dollars on top of a bunch of paperbacks. His stomach drops. He just looks inside the bag for the longest time.
