INT. DINING ROOM - TOM GRUNEMANN HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of TOM GRUNEMANN, attractive young executive, sitting at the head of the dining room table carving a turkey for Thanksgiving Day dinner. There are joyous sounds of celebration. The CAMERA PANS around the table revealing the happy family and guests. Among them are KLUTE and CABLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera stops at Mrs. Grunemann who sits at the foot of the table opposite her husband. She smiles across at him with pleasure. We cut to Tom Grunemann smiling back at her. We cut back to a closeup of Mrs. Grunemann looking back at her husband with love. We cut back to Tom Grunemann's chair - only now it is empty. The joyous sounds disappear on this cut. It appears that Tom Grunemann has disappeared before our eyes. One moment he is there, and the next moment he is gone. The camera pans back down the table, only now it is empty except for Grunemann's children and Mrs. Grunemann. She is now dressed in something dark. She and the three children sit eating another meal in emptiness. She has changed from a joyous woman to a woman bereaved.

<DIRECTION>
INT. RESEARCH PLANT: ON ROSS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The industrial frontier. SPECIAL AGENT ROSS steps into frame, glancing (perhaps idly, a little impatiently) in this direction at some loud industrial goings-on just beyond camera, then returns toward GROUP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The group includes CABLE and a YOUNGER FBI AGENT with clipboard, to whom KLUTE is supplying preliminary data. KLUTE's manner is somewhat rumpled, awkward.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question.

HOLLY thrusts the letter back toward camera, toward KLUTE crying out -

INT. RESEARCH PLANT: DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

	<DIALOGUE>
	And since then, recent months, she's reported several, you know, incidents: like breather calls, anonymous phone calls, also somebody maybe following her, watching her, things like that. So it's I guess you could say, conceivable Grunemann's still around there, just hangin around her, spooking her. But you know, that --

Verdant Pennsylvania farmland. Early morning. Near at hand an open field set about with bee hutches and patched with mist.

INT. BEDROOM - KLUTES HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see that we've been looking out from the bedroom window of this house. Klute turns to rolltop desk in bedroom and picture of Tom Grunemann, picture of Bree Daniel, and other material he has collected on the case. He puts them in his suitcase and closes the suitcase. He shuts rolltop desk.

INT. KLUTE'S HOUSE - DAY

We follow Klute through the house with suitcase. He puts away a last dish, shutting off water, gas, and electricity, and so on -- takes a last look around - reaches for the door handle. WE CUT TO --

A section of wall, a door coming open -- and the FIGURE of BREE entering and standing. We have gone from the warm sunlight of the country to mustv darkness.

<DIRECTION>
She appears chic, poised, and perfect as a magazine picture. But as she gets used to the darkness and her eyes focus on a line of equally beautiful girls sitting and waiting in folding chairs along a wall, we see that she is a great deal less certain of demeanor. Assailable. WE CUT TO -

EXT. KLUTE'S HOUSEYARD, HOUSE, BARN - DAY

Klute, stepping out, closes, locks and checks the house door, then moves on to his car -- a vintage Plymouth -- and tosses in his suitcase; and then takes a last turn around the yard itself; props open the cover of a beehutch, and lets down the rail gate of a sidefield. He approaches to roll shut his barn door -- and on this action we CUT again TO --

A MAN opens the door. We neither see or hear him clearly -- he is foreground, defocused. His shirt is untucked. Bree cocks her head, greets him cutely.

As Klute's car drives onto the turnpike surrounded by green country, we ZOOM into a close shot of Klute through the windshield of his car.

BREE unlocks the door, switches on a light, cases the apartment for a moment before entering, securing chain-lock, putting aside her things. There is a RECORD PLAYER near the first interior doorway. She switches it as she moves by. By time the first record has dropped, she has the shower turned on, is getting rid of her dress. We CUT BACK TO --

</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles again, hands the letter and wallet back out, closes the door (doesn't slam, just closes). Klute looks at it blankly for a time, starts to knock again, decides not to -- turns and descends the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BREE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bree listens through the door to his departing foot steps. They fade from hearing. She hastens to assemble her properties.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute comes out door and descends the stairs at the same even pace -- he walks into the vacant store below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It had once been a Boutique that sold happy clothes. There are some psychedelic posters and a few remnants of its former identity. Klute's suitcase is propped open on a cot behind a counter. The ceilings are low, forcing Klute to stoop as he enters. He seems out of place and out of scale. A case containing a tape recorder stands on the floor. On the table are a FOLDER of Klute's notes, and a paper bag. Klute enters and deliberately resumes his settling in. From the paper bag he sets aside an electric FAN, then lifts out from the shopping bag a cheap tin ALARM CLOCK and begins winding it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bree has shifted position to a window, is looking down at the street. She sees - and we hear - SOUND OF BUS APPROACHING, distantly. She grabs her properties, whips out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ON DOOR OF BROWNSTONE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bree skids to a stop just inside the door, scans quickly out in one direction then the other (in case Klute has been waiting in ambush on the sidewalk) then races -- PAN -- to BUS AT CURB -- makes it, pulls herself aboard --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute has been watching from his window. We hear the BUS PULLING AWAY. He turns back, plugs in the electric fan. Then hoists the TAPE RECORDER, unsnaps the cover. We see clearly what it is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AGENCY OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BREE is showing her notebook to an AGENT. He leans forward courteously, occasionally stroking his forehead with his fingertips -- a nice man with a headache.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- and I take acting classes with Lee Tainter --

	<DIALOGUE>
	-- here -- and then of course I have the modeling and the demonstrator work, the trade-fair work -- but naturally I feel ready for something more, well you know, sustain --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, thanks very much for coming in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT>
<DIRECTION>
She starts for the door -- he's already turning away -- then ducks back, hands him one of her Glossies, laughing prettily at her own forgetfulness.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
<DIRECTION>
(beautifully -- the business)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you very much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BREE comes out, pauses with notebook to cross out, the call completed, checks the list of those remaining, sets forth again. We hear TRASK'S VOICE OVER, very quick, very clipped.
</DIRECTION>
<TRASK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)

	Man, just a poor pretty little hooker, like to be an actress --

INT. MISSING PERSONS BUREAU - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP photograph of dead man. It is replaced with series of photgraphs of dead men. CAMERA pulls back to reveal KLUTE flipping through the file of the unidentified dead.
</DIRECTION>
<TRASK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you lookin' to get from her? You think she's got Grunemann hid somewhere, the attic, feedin him soup? Or maybe he's hidin in a dark alley and he'll jump on her and you jump on him. And third place, even if she does know somethin' she's right, she don't have to talk to you. You don't have police power, you can't make her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRASK>
<DIRECTION>
KLUTE closes the file.
</DIRECTION>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a lot of people to die unknown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<TRASK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRASK>
<DIRECTION>
As KLUTE slowly walks away we bring in TELEPHONE RING and BREE VOICE, OVER answering.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BREE APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera is looking up through lighted window outside at BREE on phone.

	Oh hon, I just don't know. I'm trying to stay out of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KLUTE APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA pans down from BREE's window to KLUTE's window at the bottom revealing KLUTE at tape recorder. The TAPE RECORDER is going, its light winking. KLUTE holds headset against one ear, makes a note or two. We hear BREE's and other GIRL'S VOICES, UNDER, FILTERED.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- comes in with these other yulds maybe two or three times a year, and five big ones baby, just one evening.

</BREE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Klute sets down the headset (we drop the VOICES far under, INDISTINGUISHABLE), makes a note, and thumbs open the box of a fresh reel; the present reel is near the end. We establish a pile of ALREADY RECORDED TAPES. We CUT BACK TO --

She hangs up, starts away. The PHONE RINGS AGAIN. She tries to ignore it. It persists. She finally turns back to answer it, and we CUT TO --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTING OFFICE - AD AGENCY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA STARTS on huge photo montage of the Family of Man and pans down to a group of beautiful girls sitting on a bench below. They are dwarfed by the enormous picture. Each one clutches an almost identical portfolio of pictures in her lap. Camera pans down row of portfolios until it stops at BREE - impatiently waiting her turn. WE CONTINUE THE TELEPHONE VOICES OVER, WILD TRACK STYLE. The MAN'S VOICE is thick with drink, and emotion. First the click, then --

<BREE_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bree Daniel --

<DIRECTION>
We FADE THIS CONVERSATION UNDER BUT HOLD, CONTINUING, as --

BREE PASSES CAMERA -- and we PAN TO SHOT OF KLUTE, at corner, unseen by her and apparently in surveillance of her. Then he too turns out of frame, and we CUT TO --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENN STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA is looking down at an enormous gift package on a platform. There is a sound of a recorded fanfare and with the pull of a string the package is opened revealing a brand new LINCOLN CONTINENTAL CONVERTIBLE. People applaud and the car starts to revolve. At the wheel of the car sits BREE. We CUT to a shot through the windshield of car --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BREE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sea of staring faces revolves around her. We cross fade with SPANGLER VOICE OVER (as if recalling a case record).
</DIRECTION>
<SPANGLER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bree Daniel, Caucasian, twenty eight, good physical health, no narcotics record, presenting an unusually strong personality some ways, high intelligence, a high bracket call girl.

</SPANGLER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOMEN'S PRISON ROOF - CAGED IN RECREATION AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPANGLER, a prison psychiatrist, sits on a bench eating a sandwich partially wrapped in wax paper and sipping from a carton of milk. He is obviously a man pressed for time. KLUTE sits beside him. Across from them some prisoners are taking their exercise. Through the metallic netting that surrounds them, we see the skyline of New York City. It only dramatizes more the sense of being caged.
</DIRECTION>
<SPANGLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(notes Klute's reaction)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stabs at record)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you want to know all this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPANGLER>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<SPANGLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not unusual.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPANGLER>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did she talk about him to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<SPANGLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPANGLER>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has she talked with you since prison?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<SPANGLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPANGLER>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think she's trying that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<SPANGLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh sure they try. The idea of a better life. But they don't really know much about life: They get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. Just the trick, the transaction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPANGLER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENN STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV world revolving around BREE through windshield of car. The circular motion slows down and then stops. Cut to BREE getting out of car and walking off platform. She looks a bit shaky. She is stopped by one of the spectators.

INT. CHURCH DISCOTHEQUE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are in the interior of what was once a church and is now a discotheque. Interior is painted purple; the record player stands on the altar over the crowd. Pews are massed around the dance floor. Stained glass windows are lighted from behind and are circled with light bulbs that flash on and off. For all of its obviously bizarre visual quality, there is a sense of relaxation. It is a late night gathering place of many who belong to the sexual underworld of the city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BREE and the OTHER GIRL advance to a pew. A MAN sitting there (the other girl's pimp) with a THIRD GIRL. BREE's companion greet him shyly, tenderly: she and BREE sit down, join in conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK SLOWLY -- other pews, other girls and a few men, the sisterhood -- To --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAR AREA IN BACK (WHAT ONCE MUST HAVE BEEN THE VESTIBULE OF THE CRURCH)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Among the people around the bar, pimps, whores, and a sprinkling of hopeful Johns and curiosity seekers. The camera picks a familiar face: CABLE. He watches BREE with a mixture of amusement and contempt. A GIRL comes over to him and tries to proposition him. They appear to be discussing price. Just as she thinks it is set, he walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP photograph of TOM GRUNEMANN pinned to a large piece of beaverboard KLUTE has placed on a wall. CAMERA PANS over various pictures and pieces of evidence KLUTE has pinned up in an attempt to make some sense from the puzzle of TOM GRUNMIANN's disappearance. CAMERA PANS over to KLUTE sitting on cot looking up at the pieces of the puzzle. There is a heated TV dinner in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TAPE RECORDER reels start turning (sound powered), the recording light starts winding (as BREE, above, dials). KLUTE pays it scant attention - he can catch up with the news anytime. He sits manfully in front of the TV dinner, starts peeling back the foil --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: BREE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She holds the phone, is answered. Her voice more natural, a little shy, a little covert.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. Bree.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(is greeted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. Well I could come over tonight - if you'd like -- if there's no one else.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I really want to just talk to you.

</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tape-recorder continues turning and winking as the conversation upstairs continues. KLUTE looks at TV dinner. He reaches for the headset of the taperecorder, holds it loosely against one ear. He exhibits a measure of new interest. The TAPE RECORDER stops running. He immediately rewinds, and starts listening through it again. We CUT TO --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARMENT DISTRICT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Large, dark buildings -- a DIM-LIGHTED WINDOW showing at an upper floor of one -- the street otherwise by and large deserted. A TAXI draws in, a FIGURE IN EVENING DRESS (Bree) gets out, approaches the building, glances around, either secretly or apprehensively -- presses a buzzer, waits, gets answering CLICKS, enters the dark hallway of the building, starts upstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ACROSS THE STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KLUTE shifts into view, looking in the direction Bree's gone, a little puzzled all in all. He doesn't immediately follow; he waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARMENT BUILDING - CUTTING ROOMS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We look past RACKS OF CLOTHING, as BREE arrives up the dark stairway into dark rooms -- the scene, mysterious, a little sinister. She seems fearful of it herself, advances slowly, looking around, calls -
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi? -_
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE PAST MR. FABER, TO BREE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Faber is SILHOUETTED for a moment, standing, watching her, from along an alleyway of garments. She sees him, is startled then relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
He moves toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE, TO MR. FABER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Faber is a man of 65 or so, rather handsome, and for this occasion very spruce, very erect, very nattily turned out. Bree complains cheerfully.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You scared me, Mr. Faber.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles, kisses her cheek, tests the fabric of her evening dress -- (in passing, as a matter of expertise).
</DIRECTION>
<MR_FABER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good material, not too good cut. I'd do better for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_FABER>
<DIRECTION>
Then he turns, lifts down a WOMAN'S DRESS CAPE, carrying it -- graciously gestures her to precede him --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORNER OF CUTTING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dim pool of light here. A private area here, sectioned off by rows of garments. A couch, rug, coffee table, a chair or two -- a place for Buyers to take their ease. BREE and MR. FABER enter. Her manner is suddenly elegant, assured, regal; his befits a man of the world. He fits the cloak around her shoulders and gestures to the couch; she sits. He pours a glass of wine for her, for himself. She speaks with a neat continental accent -- doing it fairly well, really -- a member of the international set.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
He sits in the chair opposite, sips his wine.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_FABER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enjoy.

	Sure dear, yes.

<MR_FABER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm.
	</DIALOGUE>

	And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --

She hesitates strangely, her fingers at the neck of the cape. Faintly --

</BREE>
<MR_FABER>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_FABER>
<DIRECTION>
She stands, unloosing the cloak, letting it fall on the couch. But she doesn't sit again -- begins to move here and there about the enclosure, her hands wandering about her dress and body -- an erotic restlessness.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>

<DIRECTION>
(tensely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_FABER>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but I felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling --

</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARMENT BUILDING DOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KLUTE arrives from across the street. It takes him a while (with a 'loid' probably) to slip the lock. He eases door open, moves inside --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORNER OF CUTTING ROOM: BREE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BREE is farther along in her narrative, more fervent in manner. MR. FABER sits at the edge of his seat, ducking his head now and then in pleasure, but making no move to molest her.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And next day at the beach -- our beach pavilion -- I saw him again, his eyes burning into me. I was helpless. Without his even speaking to me, without his even touching, I knew that somehow -- somehow --

</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
She casts away an accessory garment. Mr. Faber burns her with his eyes --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARMENT BUILDING - CUTTING ROOMS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KLUTE mounts into view at the head of the stairs, prowls along the aisles of clothing, looking -- sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV PAST GARMENT RACKS TO MR. FABER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute sees Mr. Faber first -- clearly a senior citizen -- sitting transfixed, fastened in some private dream. Then BREE drifts into view -- stands -- lets fall the evening dress about her ankles, poses -- drifts out of view again --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KLUTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute watches in that direction a moment longer. In his expression a certain curiosity -- a prurience -- but rather more strongly, disappointment, a measure of disgust. Not his affair. He turns away from it, into camera, and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near the entrance, outside the door to KLUTE's apartment below. We open on BREE. She shouts angrily, miserably --
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whyn't you just cut out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
We WIDEN TO INCLUDE KLUTE. Now she begins to get it. He turns, opens door to his room below. She comes slowly down steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KLUTE'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steps in the door, looks slowly around at his various appurtenances -- the bed, the necktie over the mirror, etc. -- and then, the TAPE RECORDER and then the STACK OF TAPE BOXES. Softly, venomously --
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh you bastard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
But then she adjusts -- a frightened but matter-of fact hooker --

</BREE>
<KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
(gestures upward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could I ask some questions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
She seems to have expressed it; the balance of power. She turns, goes out, heads upstairs. Klute unhurriedly takes up his folder of notes, then follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bree disposes her belongings. Klute moves to table. There is a group of plants on the table that long since died of neglect. He notices them and the disorganization of the room without comment, opens his folder, rummages for the photographs. Then, exasperatedly --
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I told the police everything: I don't even remember the schlub!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>

Klute doesn't respond. Klute sets out a photograph for her to look at.

KLUTE, BREE

<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They showed me that one. I understand it's Grunemann, but I told them, I just don't remember.

Klute tosses down a second photograph.

INT. CELLAR - ABANDONED BROWNSTONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is as black as a dungeon and as low. He lights a match, but sees no one. There is a sound of movement coming from the floor above, He runs up the steps to the floor above and sees a very faint light coming through one of the closed apartment doors. Carefully takes out a gun and then with one quick movement he breaks through the door.

INT. ABANDONED APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The walls, ceiling, floors are entirely covered with crudely painted psychedelic signs and sayings. The room is lighted by some candies stuck in bottles. Sitting on a blanket on the floor are several teenaged boys and girls having a pot party. They have obviously made a clubhouse for themselves in the abandoned house. It is a MOOT POINT whether they or KLUTE is more stunned at the sight that faces them. He puts his gun away in embarrassment. Again he has been made to feel like an awkward peeping tom in this hidden world of the city.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CELLAR - ABANDONED BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA wanders restlessly through the blackness and stops at a pinpoint of light coming through a low door. CAMERA goes through opening into long narrow furnace room with the ceiling so low that an ordinary man could not stand up. We hear the sound of breathing. CAMERA follows the sound through the darkness revealing a sweaty man huddled in the corner looking like some strange animal from a painting by Bosch. It is Cable.

The apartment is as expected -- but not overdone; a certain small amount of someone-lives-here litter. A few, large but not very good, ABSTRACTIONS on the walls.

	OK and one of them Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.

<DIRECTION>
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute, in pajama bottoms, lies in bed. A miserably hot humid night. KNOCK at the door. He answers. BREE stands in the doorway in bare feet.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell do you mean, pathetic?
	</DIALOGUE>

She walks in past him, sits down on the edge of his bed.

	It's kind of late.

	So you're not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or Tommy-baby --

He starts for the bed, as if to lift her onto her feet. She takes off her robe and swings her legs up, and under the sheet.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, if you don't use it somebody else just will. And you've done your whole bit with me, your entire duty, and so now this is my thing. So enjoy, Mr. Faber would say, enjoy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
Under the sheet she unlooses her pajama bottoms, kicks them away, starts unbuttoning the shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<BREE>

	Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --

He tries to rebutton the pajama shirt. She catches his hand, thrusts it underneath. In grief and anger --

Their bodies lock together descending toward camera --

Her hands slide about his shoulders. She is laughing softly, affectionately, mockingly --

</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE --

DISSOLVE --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FACES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute gasps deeply -- entering orgasm. As soon as she hears it, judges it, she drops her hands from his shoulders, stills her own movements, lies utterly passive, smiling calmly, letting him finish for himself. He can't stop -- cries out -- cries out again, burying his face against her -- is done.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he slowly raises up, shuddering, looking down at her. He knows what she's done to him, is helpless to do anything back. He rolls slowly out of the embrace of her legs and lies silently -- looking upward, very much as we saw him at start of scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FAVORIVG BREE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She waits, still smiling, for a while. But she's not done with him yet. She rolls to lie with her upper body on his, trailing her fingers across his face. Affectionately, as a good whore --

	You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John.

She sits up, gropes her pajamas from the floor, puts them on. In the same fond tone --

INT. THEATRE: READING SCENE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WIDE SHOT. An open casting call in an Off Broadway Theatre. Darkness, except for the work light onstage. A small GROUP there -- onstage -- including the figure of BREE. Just offstage, the figures of DIRECTOR (JANG) and a PRODUCER. And the rest of the theatre, the audience section, dotted with the heads of ACTORS, ACTRESSES waiting for their turns. Bree's voice rings out across the gloom.

<BREE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bree shrugs, steps down off stage with the others. Bree finds Jang's hand out for her script, smiles wanly, turns it over, continues on out of scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She finds something - someone -- impeding her way. Looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAST BREE TO KLUTE

<DIRECTION>
Klute has edged out into the aisle to intercept her.

(then quavering --)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did everything for Arlyn. I loved Arlyn I took her right into my apartment, my own sweet apartment on First. But she wouldn't stay off it -- the junk -- and I wept and I pleaded and I held her in my arms - and she started taking things, my things, and selling them for horse. My clothes. We could've had everything together, everything -- and then the bitch sold my mink!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANOTHER LATE NIGHT SPOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We dolly with KLUTE & BREE as they walk in front of a row of tables. This night spot is totally black except for a series of huge slide projections on the wall in back of the tables. The slides, which change every few seconds are elegant representations of the beautiful people living the good life as seen in such magazines as VOGUE, TOWN & COUNTRY & HARPERS BAZAAR. The customers sitting in the darkness below provide a direct contrast to the pictures in back. The silhouette figures of BREE & KLUTE stop at a table seating three people, two call girls and a pimp. CAMERA moves in.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arlyn Page?

The pimp looks distrustfully at Klute who reassures --

	Try Janie Dale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIMP>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JANIE DALE'S PENTHOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a very small penthouse. KLUTE & BREE stand in the small living room waiting for JANIE DALE. There are two very casually dressed prostitutes sitting around the living room. One sits at an upright piano playing of all things STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT. Another one sits on a couch talking to a Wall Street Broker who is spending his lunch hour. KLUTE finds himself staring down into a pile of pornography magazines on the coffee table. BREE is amused at his discomfort. JANIE DALE, the madame, who has been on the phone in the back, puts the receiver down and crosses to the girl on the couch. JANIE looks and talks a bit like Lauren Bacall.
</DIRECTION>
<JANIE_DALE>
<DIRECTION>
(to girl on couch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's old Mr. Clean from Cleveland. He wants to know when he can fly in and clean up the apartment and see you. I told him I have all the cleaning equipment and that he can come anytime, but it's up to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANIE_DALE>
<DIRECTION>
GIRL on couch rises.

<JANIE_DALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him that he'd better have his ass in here by one o'clock on Monday afternoon or you won't let him clean the bathroom floor, and tell him the price has gone up twenty bucks -- Old Dutcn Cleanser's not as cheap as it used to be.

	I deal with a high type client, business people, you understand? I can't send them someone that's all the time half zonked out.

	Do you know where she went?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<JANIE_DALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try Momma Reese.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANIE_DALE>
<DIRECTION>
THIS IS A CHEAPER APARTIENT THAN JANIE DALE'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girls look cheaper, and the customers, rather than Wall Street lawyers and brokers, look more like out of town salesmen who stay at local motor inns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOMMA REESE is older than JANIE DALE, heavier and with no pretense at chic. She indicates that she has not seen ARLYN in some time.
</DIRECTION>
<MOMMA_REESE>

	Try Bill Azure. If you can find him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOMMA_REESE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EIGHT AVENUE BAR - ABOUT 4 IN THE MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a hangout where black and white pimps wait to meet their whores after their night of street walking. This streetwalker world is far removed from the world of the call girl or the world of Janie Dale. CAMERA pans past a group of pimps at the bar taking bet on whose girls have made the most money that night. CAMERA then goes on to reveal KLUTE talking to another pimp (Azure). Azure represents a clear step down from Frank Ligourin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We catch only part of their dialogue.

	She liked me all right but she had what she liked better, you know what I mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AZURE>
<DIRECTION>
We START FADE SOUND as Klute repeats --
</DIRECTION>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you heard from her recently?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
-- and CUT TO --

<DIRECTION>
INT. LINGERIE SHOP: PROPRIETRESS, BREE, KLUTE
</DIRECTION>
<PROPRIETRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- She'd come in and I'd let her have something. Why not; she'd been a good customer, a beautiful person, a beautiful beautiful person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROPRIETRESS>
<DIRECTION>
Again we fade sound a little before picture, then CUT TO --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTSIDE ADULT MOVIE THEATER: KLUTE, STREETWALKERS - DAY OR NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside Theatre or Bookstore - Peepshow; an 8th Avenue establishment. SILENT ACTION this (or VOICES UNDER). Klute confers with one girl who summons and consults another. They seem to know of Arlyn -- haven't seen her recently -- refer him elsewhere --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE: MRS. VASEK, KLUTE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shabby place in a shabby neighborhood. Mrs. Vasek, the landlady, shifts barrels at the same time that she barks at Klute, in heavy accent.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_VASEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The whore, yeah. I threw out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_VASEK>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know where she went from here?

<KLUTE>

(reacts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was she living with a man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
We see Klute persisting - DISSOLVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WIDE SHOT: SLUM STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We still HOLD WIDE to establish the scene. This is a genuine slum. We see Bree, Klute move along street. We see Bree drop back a little, Klute waiting for her to catch up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET: BREE, KLUTE
</DIRECTION>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<BREE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell do you think's the matter.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could wait for you someplace.

	If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --

</KLUTE>
<BREE>
<DIRECTION>
(eagerly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Then you don't need me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if it's someone else I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts on, simply assuming that she'll follow. (There is a degree of acquaintanceship in their manners now - a reluctant collaboration.)
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure pull a lot of mileage out of a hundred dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
-- and follows on. He checks numbers, then crosses street diagonally toward a half-framed house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEWARK HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A downshot from second floor level toward the entry way where KLUTE & BREE appear. KLUTE strikes a match to inspect the names of tenants. He and Bree climb through stench and litter to the second floor -- a door. From somewhere near at hand come the sounds of someone RETCHING. A square of wood has been sawed out of the door itself, removing handle and lock -- light sifts through. Klute hesitates, decides against knocking, pushes in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARLYN'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The retching sounds are coming from the connecting room. No one visible here. A very few barren pieces of furniture. We hear ARLYN'S VOICE ask from the next room --
</DIRECTION>
<ARLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cappy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLYN>
<DIRECTION>
ARLYN enters rather eagerly. She sees Klute first, then Bree -- recognizes her -- retires flat against a wall, holding one palm outwards to shield her face. She is unbelievably gaunt. Inside one elbow, looking rather like a birthmark, we see a lacework of purple where her veins have pulped together.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arlyn? Honey?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, it's all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
From the connecting room a MAN'S VOICE (Berger's) calling out hoarsely.
</DIRECTION>
<BERGER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it Cappy? Cappy? --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERGER>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arlyn, it's all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
BERGER hastens, stumbles, into the doorframe carrying a CAR-RADIO with wires dangling, speaks before he sees them.
</DIRECTION>
<BERGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cappy, I got a radio!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERGER>
<DIRECTION>
He stops for an instant face-to-face with Klute. Then turns, plunges out of view again. Arlyn breaks after.
</DIRECTION>
<ARLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLYN>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the MUMBLE and WHISPER of their voices from the connecting room (as she reassures him). Bree looks inquiringly at Klute (is that Grunemann?): he shakes his head. Pause, then ARLYN reenters, wrapping her fingers together timidly -- wanting them out -- her only purpose.
</DIRECTION>
<ARLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLYN>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<ARLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't you see I'm strung out?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(cries out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, we're waiting for it -- he's got to have it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLYN>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll go. Just something you could tell us, first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
Arlyn seems to accept the bargain. He indicates to Bree to proceed, stands away a little. Arlyn covers her elbow with one hand. Bree manages as best she can.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a Dumper --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<ARLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, if he sees you, he won't come!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLYN>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<ARLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about him? Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLYN>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he come around often?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
Klute hands Grunemann's picture to Bree: Bree shows it to Arlyn. Arlyn inspects it, then uncertainly, weakly --
</DIRECTION>
<ARLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. He was an older man hon. The dumper was older.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLYN>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you remember his name? What can you tell me about him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
We hear FOOTSTEPS - UNDER, DIMLY - mounting the stairs. Bree notices them first, Klute persisting with Arlyn --
</DIRECTION>
<BERGER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (shouts desperately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arlyn, get them out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERGER>
<ARLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, I am begging you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLYN>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's important.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<ARLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not the Dumper, that's all! He was an older man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLYN>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you give me any more description than that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
Arlyn catches the footsteps, dodges past him toward the door, intending to reassure --
</DIRECTION>
<ARLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cappy? --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLYN>
<DIRECTION>
-- as the pusher, CAPPY, steps in. All of this is very quick, simultaneous, a confusion of voices. CAPPY takes one look at Klute --
</DIRECTION>
<ARLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right, they're all right --
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<BERGER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cappy? -- Cappy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERGER>
<DIRECTION>
Cappy's FOOTSTEPS race away down the stairs. BERGER plunges out from the connecting room, still carrying the car radio, shouting, pursuing --
</DIRECTION>
<BERGER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cappy it's all right! I got a radio -- don't run, don't --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERGER>
<DIRECTION>
We hear him STUMBLE AND FALL on the stairs outside, the sound of body reeling down. Arlyn shrieks and races after: Klute and Bree follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE: LOWER HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see BERGER lying at the foot of the stairs. As Arlyn clatters down toward him, Berger sways up onto his knees. His nose is bloodied, he cries. Arlyn casts herself on her knees beside him, pulls his face against her, croons to him, soothes and tends him.
</DIRECTION>
<ARLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh baby -- no it's all right -- oh my baby baby baby --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLYN>
<DIRECTION>
Klute and Bree are only a half-step behind. Klute offers to assist: Arlyn puts him away ferociously.
</DIRECTION>
<ARLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Berger, again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't cry my baby; I'll find him, I'll get it. Baby, baby, don't cry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Klute savagely, incoherently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave us alone! Get out and get out and leave us alone!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Berger)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My honey, my baby, my baby --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLYN>
<DIRECTION>
We DISSOLVE TO --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBWAY TRAIN: REFLECTION IN WINDOW OF BREE AND KLUTE SITTING SIDE BY SIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA moves in closer so we only see reflection of BREE looking at herself and at the world seeming to speed by at an inhuman pace as the lights of the tunnel zoom past her face. What she sees is the figure of a woman with life screaming past her out of control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUBWAY slows to a stop and a door opens. BREE sits with KLUTE staring at the open door and then without warning - gets up and runs off the train. The door closes, leaving KLUTE locked in the train.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUBWAY EXIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT of BREE's feet rushing up the stairs in darkness and then quick cut to her face as she hits the sunlight. She pauses for a moment - relieved to be out of the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOFTOP OF BREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA pans from night view of New York City to KLUTE sitting on the rooftop alone as if trying to comprehend all he has seen, the mystery of TOM GRUNEMANN's disappearance in this world and the mysteries of the behavior of BREE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SKYLIGHT INTO BREE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alongside of him the skylight of BREE's apartment lights up. He looks through the skylight and sees BREE enter her apartment. He can hear BREE talking to somebody, and then he sees that she is talking to FRANK LIGOURIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KLUTE watches through the skylight and hears bits and pieces of the scene between BREE and FRANK. He sees the same kind of symbiosis, the same kind of parody of loving that he saw between ARLYN & BERGER. As the scene becomes more intimate he leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CABLE'S (CITY) OFFICE: ON KLUTE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pristine, antiseptic, elegance off CABLE'S office is in its own way as unreal and dehumanized as the sexual underworld KLUTE has been exploring with BREE, and KLUTE looks as out of place in the one as he does in the other. TRASK sits beside KLUTE facing CABLE who is impeccably dressed. He is the total image of the executive in control.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believed her, Pete.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<TRASK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRASK>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<CABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE>
<KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles ruefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<CABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then, close the case.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I better keep looking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<CABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where, how?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE>
<KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
(the best he can offer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<CABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's got to make sense some way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
CABLE'S SECRETARY appears for a moment tapping her watch significantly.
</DIRECTION>
<SECRETARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Cable -- they are meeting in Mr. Camara's office.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRETARY>
<CABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes Evvie, thanks. Gentlemen, I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE>
<DIRECTION>
They rise, dismissed. He sorts a paper or two, continues to Klute.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How is it back there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<CABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're homesick.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reflects)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(briskly again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE>
<DIRECTION>
KLUTE and TRASK depart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CABLE closes the door and returns to his desk. He pulls out a tape recorder from a drawer in his desk, rewinds it and turns it on. We hear a playback of the previous scene with KLUTE and TRASK. He stands at the window listening with some satisfaction; as if listening to what KLUTE revealed keeps him in control of the situation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WINDOW - CABLE'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA pulls back from a CU of CABLE standing at the window to a wide angle looking at CABLE through the window. The window is 30 or 40 stories high. The wide angle lens almost makes the building look like it is standing on point, and CABLE, a man suspended in space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WIDE SHOT: DOCKS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TUGBOAT has pulled in. The SOUND of its heavy ENGINES, IDLING, runs underneath this entire sequence. A POLICE VEHICLE or two has parked at the head of the dock. We see several figures on the rear deck of the tug, but it's not clear at this distance what they're doing. The POLICE CAR WITH KLUTE arrives. He dismounts and proceeds from dock to tug-deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TUGBOAT DECK: GROUP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRASK glances toward Klute as he arrives, but doesn't greet him. His attention, like the others, is directed downward and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
off-scene (to the surface of the water actually, just outboard of the tug). We see beside Trask TWO Uniformed Cops (SUGARMAN and SPENCE) and DECKHANDS. And we hear, along with the throbbing of the engines, a stirring about of the water and a peculiar third noise -- rather commingled with the engines -- which we can't at first identify.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute joins the group, watches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPENCE brings into view, and shakes out, a giant neoprene body bag. INSTRUCTIONS among the group AD LIB, UNDER --
</DIRECTION>
<TRASK>
<DIRECTION>
(toward Klute)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were bringing a freighter down through Kill Van Kull; propellers washed it up on top.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRASK>
<DIRECTION>
SUGARMAN brings into view a METAL BASKET attached with short ropes. He complains --
</DIRECTION>
<SUGARMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you bring it up on deck?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGARMAN>
<DECKHAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you bring it up on deck?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKHAND>
<DIRECTION>
They slip the basket downward, out of frame (into the water).
</DIRECTION>
<DECKHAND>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (to other)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mickey, get something. Get the eels off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKHAND>
<SPENCE>
<DIRECTION>
(calmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll drop off theirselves when she comes out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPENCE>
<DIRECTION>
We CUT TO -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERGER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Berger sitting huddled against the tugboat cabin -- we haven't seen him before -- with his hands bunched in front of his mouth. We identify the noise which may have puzzled us before -- his SOBBING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWNSHOT: SURFAICE OF WATER, BASKET, BODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We catch a fleeting glimpse of the body being lifted, just before it breaks the surface of the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FAVORING KLUTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute looks on as EFFECTS trace the processing of the body. SPENCE kneels down out of frame to slide the bag around it. TRASK kneels down to make a brief examination -- straightens again. To Klute --
</DIRECTION>
<TRASK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll go to the Examiner. But I don't see nothin that means nothin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRASK>
<DIRECTION>
We MOVE WITH KLUTE as he turns and moves away a few feet along deck. Here he stands. Then SUGARMAN moves into view holding a clipboard. Routinely --
</DIRECTION>
<SUGARMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You help us with ID? We can't get nothin from him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGARMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He indicates the direction of Berger. Klute examines the clipboard data.
</DIRECTION>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arlyn Page was probably an alias. She went by the names Terry Arlyn and June Price. She may have been from Pittsburgh, someone told me. I can give you a list of people who knew her, if that would help to --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<SUGARMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No point, thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGARMAN>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he claiming the body?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<SUGARMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh uh, that'd mean funeral expenses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGARMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He spits, moves back in the direction of the group; Klute continues to stand. BERGER moves in his direction. Brokenly --
</DIRECTION>
<BERGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man could you help me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERGER>
<DIRECTION>
Klute doesn't understand his purport, reacts instantly, sympathetically --
</DIRECTION>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<BERGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, help me out. That's my baby there, dead. I got to get up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERGER>
<DIRECTION>
Klute stares at him -- a quiet horror -- as Berger insists --
</DIRECTION>
<BERGER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man you don't know what that does to me, my baby dead --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERGER>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- You've got to get up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<BERGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERGER>
<DIRECTION>
Klute shoves a bill in his hand, turns away very sharply, off the tugboat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOCK: KLUTE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute walks a longer distance this time, sits down on one of the pilings of the dock. Watching him we see what might be a profound awe and grief at all these things -- but is, in fact, a good deal more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EFFECTS, O.S. as Police Vehicles are loaded, driven away and as tug toots, runs up engines, puts out again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRASK moves into scene, sits on another piling, looks at him speculatively. Silence. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<TRASK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRASK>
<KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I looked it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
Then -- (we are assuming a complete understanding here between Klute and Trask, non-verbal. What Trask is asking, in effect, is: is this meaningful? Do we both suspect the same man?)
</DIRECTION>
<TRASK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRASK>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is late afternoon, but BREE is in her pajamas curled up in her bed. There are some magazines scattered around the bed and the television set is on an old movie. There are cracker crumbs in the bed and a cup of coffee and an open jar of peanut butter with the knife sticking out of the jar on the floor by the bed. It would seem that BREE has spent most of the day in bed. She looks like an unkempt child. The phone is ringing, but she does not answer it. The phone no sooner stops than the door bell rings. Reluctantly she gets out of bed and goes to the door. She looks through the spy hole and sees Klute's face. She undoes two locks and an obviously new chain and bolt and opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well hello -- come on in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
He barely enters the room. His manner is cool and remote.
</DIRECTION>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The same as Jane McKenna.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<BREE>
<DIRECTION>
(she betrays no reaction)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
Klute looks around the disorderly room. The plants in the windowsill have never been in worse shape. They look as if she deliberately let them die of thirst.
</DIRECTION>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<BREE>
<DIRECTION>
(harshly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just let me know when you are going out and where --

<DIRECTION>
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The empty apartment. He enters, switches a light on (dusk), tosses aside jacket, bookcase, etc., then sits down on the edge of his bed, with one foot propped up on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOOTSTEPS and A RAP at the door. He looks up, but doesn't move, doesn't answer. BREE opens it, enters. There are tear-tracks down her face, but she's no longer crying. She tries to smile, tries to explain her wants. Then with the unhurried, graven composure of absolute desperation, she sits on the edge of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I asked you something, would you not laugh? -- asked you to look at something?

<DIRECTION>
Klute looks at it again. Judiciously --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shows her a spot or two on his own forearm. She compares, is reassured. Embarrassedly, she tries to smile. It is unsuccessful. She gets up and moves about. Her manner in general is totally unguarded, honest, undramatic, searching.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look -- I hate everybody; and I'm sorry for everybody; and I'm scared all the time.

He only grunts. A sound like 'OK' or 'all right' -- an invitation to leave. But she won't be driven away. More urgently, helplessly:

She accepts it decently. Tries to smile again, nods.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK ----- OK
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
She gestures, tries to find something more to say, moves by degrees toward the door -- and would succeed in leaving. But then:
</DIRECTION>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--- Bree ---
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
Standing still, she starts again to cry -- and bravely to keep the crying to herself. The child bereft. He contends with himself, then crosses to her, puts his arms around her, soothes her hair. A completely asexual gesture at this point, a giving of comfort. She clings, trembles, burrows. Then -- a SERIES OF DISSOLVES: The street outside, at different times of night interposed, with Bree and Klute at different times of love, As Follows:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The street as we saw it just previously... still daylight... still somewhat populated, but drawing toward dusk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BPEE, KLUTE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darkness now, or close to dark; the room heavily shadowed. Bree and Klute sit together on the bed. He still strokes her hair. He has pulled a blanket around her shoulders. The transaction is still not overtly sexual, but the tenderness is more overt. He rubs his cheek against her forehead. She herself is quieter, comforted. She begins to stir against him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The street at night. Eleven o'clock, let's say. Some lit windows; a single car moving past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

All the windows dark this time. The deepest night, just before the sky begins to lighten.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BREE, KLUTE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute is alseep -- more or less -- on his stomach. Bree beside him lies awake. She trails her fingers about his back. A rather tentative, exploratory business. Her expression is more wondering than anything else -- what does she have here, and can she get used to it?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE STREET - DAY (DAWN)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The street's first stirrings. From not far off, the sounds of trash cans being collected.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BREE, KLUTE - DAY (DAWN)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute half sits up in bed. Bree is fast asleep with her head pillowed on his midsection. Some humor in this shot: he wants to move but doesn't want to wake her. At a point he risks it, reaches out for something beside the bed. Her eyes open immediately. He puts his hand on her face, trying gently to press her back.
</DIRECTION>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go back to sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
But she takes his hand -- and retains it -- rolls onto her back. Still relaxed, but a little more separate, thoughtful -- a mixture of the Bree we've seen before and the Bree we've glimpsed, the possible Bree. She observes:
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm still scared.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean different but still.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(frowns)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
She grins, then starts to reach for him, still receptive -- then feels another (and genuine) pang, turns her head away sharply.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her with concern, but only caresses her. She manages to explain --
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
	</DIALOGUE>

<KLUTE>

	Mm.

</KLUTE>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not just 'mm'. You don't know what I --
	</DIALOGUE>

He settles himself beside her, makes overtures. She responds, but:
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yup.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
She pretends to bite -- they tussle -- she feels a suddenly growing excitement, seizes him. Fiercely, welcomingly, full out.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
And we cut directly to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SPANGLER'S OFFICE: BREE, SPANGLER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bree standing, angry, antagonistic, demanding. In a way -- a Bree-like way -- she's seized psychiatry by the throat.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The son of a bitch seduced me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
She waits. Spangler says nothing.
</DIRECTION>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?

	</DIALOGUE>
</SPANGLER>
<DIRECTION>
WE CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE PLAZA OF LINCOLN CENTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sunlight is beaming on the graceful fountains and elegant architecture. Groups of cheerful tourists are admiring the civilized monuments to man's search for culture. CAMERA pans to ugly street across the way revealing Klute approaching and entering a dingy warehouse topped by an absurdly placed copy of the Statue of Liberty. This is the municipal storehouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNICIPAL STOREHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The abrupt cut from the bright sunlight leaves us in almost total darkness as we follow KLUTE. We are in a huge storeroom. As we grow accustomed to the darkness we see bits and pieces of incongruous objects scattered along Klute's path - old pieces of furniture, lamps, piggy banks, etc. - the remnants of the lives of the plundered, the destroyed and the dispossessed. Some is stolen property, some evidence for homicide cases, and some the unclaimed possessions of the unclaimed dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CUSTODIAN -- an ancient retainer sort, a civil servant, leads KLUTE into an old elevator cage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute and Custodian as elevator ascends; looking up the elevator shaft through the open cage we see a series of doors hanging over space seeming to lead nowhere. The whole sequence has the feeling of a dream of being lost in a black limbo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute and Custodian leave elevator on higher floor and walk down the long very low corridor past rows of locked vault doors. The Custodian stops at one and opens it. We are in a small dungeon-like room filled with banks of files from floor to ceiling. The Custodian counts to himself --
</DIRECTION>
<CUSTODIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four -- five -- what number'd I say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUSTODIAN>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four ninety-seven, Jane McKenna
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
Custodian finds it, unlocks for Klute's inspection. Reaches for paper Klute's holding.
</DIRECTION>
<CUSTODIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- And I keep the authorization, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUSTODIAN>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought there'd be more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
Klute pokes through a small collection of personal effects -- perhaps an ankle bracelet, rabbits foot, faded snapshot of a child, some letters, pitiful remnants of Jane McKenna's life. Klute closes the drawer, and the front of the drawer is marked McKENNA, JANE?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over the visual material of Klute's trip through the warehouse we hear WILD TRACK VOICE OVER bits and pieces of BREE talking with the psychiatrist.

	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.

(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.

	Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or --

(then more rapidly, plunging)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>

The old black lady motions to Trask who crosses to her. She points to a picture in the file. She has obviously found her missing person among the photographs of the unidentified dead. She starts to stand but then sits again, obviously shaken. Klute crosses to her and gently helps her out of the chair. He sees in her face the same sense of loss he feels for his friend.

A DOWNSHOT TO UNDERPANTS (as if from Klute's POV, connecting directly to the previous shot) -- then a FLASHBULB goes off and a hand and pair of tongs enter frame and flip the garment into a collecting box and we widen to reveal that it's now daylight and the scene has been invaded by POLICE TECHNICIANS. One is a photographer; another, a fingerprint man, is spraying surfaces with a can of fixative. In the foreground Klute and Trask are talking with Ross, the FBI man. Ross is looking through a dossier on Cable that Klute has compiled. Over the following conversation we show CLOSEUPS of material in the dossier. It contains photographs of Cable and his life from childhood to the present - including pictures of him with his mother and father - she a very dominant looking lady and he a very passive looking man; also graduation pictures and pictures with his former wife taken when he was still a very young man. They are the personal images of a life time.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSS>
<DIRECTION>
(to Klute)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSS>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<ROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSS>
<TRASK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cable's letters, Cable's phone calls. Cable's everything else. He's been a Dumper a long time. He just passed off his own peculiar habits on the other man -- it kept things goin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRASK>
<ROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, pretend I believe you. Tell me how you get an indictment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSS>
<TRASK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't. Yet. Oh we got everythin' else: first rate evidence Cable typed those dumper letters to Bree Daniel. And Jane McKenna: Klute found a couple in her personal remains. We got dates of Cable's trips here coincidin' with phone calls to Bree Daniel, also the dates of death of McKenna and Page. We got some hints of his personal history. His father, unsuccessful salesman, committed suicide when he was 13. His mother pinned all her hopes on her son. He won a national science youth award at the age of eight. They had no money, but she hired special tutors for him in the summer time. She saw a good thing. He graduated from high school at 14 -- college at 16 -- no friends -- The kids in his class thought of him as a freak. He got his Ph.D. at 18 -- married at age 21 to his then employer's daughter. The marriage lasted 4 weeks. Her father had it annulled. She says he was impotent. World War II he got in bad trouble about a German girl, no details. We think we know why he killed Grunemann -- he found out Cable was a dumper; Cable couldn't take that. We think we know why he killed McKenna -- she wanted to blackmail him for it. All fine. But we got no body, no direct witnesses, we can't go any-damn-where.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRASK>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the reason i told him we had no evidence Tom was still alive. We wanted to shake him into another phone call or another letter. It didn't work out just that way.

ATTENDANT comes over to motion Cable onto the helicopter.

Klute smiles awkwardly, raises his hand in a goodbye gesture.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HELICOPTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cable sits down next to window. The helicopter begins to rise. CAMERA goes into a medium close shot of Cable against the helicopter window. The helicopter ascends in front of a very tall office building made up of endless glass squares. A telephoto lens brings the glass squares of the building directly against Cable's head and shoulders giving us the feeling that Cable is almost levitating by himself. As one floor after another disappears behind him we see an almost manic exhultation in Cable's face; as if he is on top of things once more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We bring Klute along street, and into the Brownstone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute climbs the stairs to Bree's apartment -- knocks. He waits. No answer. He calls once --
</DIRECTION>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bree?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. He starts downstairs again -- then turns back, unlocks the door himself, enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is still disordered. Bree and Frank Ligourin look at him, silently. Bree has been assembling armfuls of dresses to carry away with her. Frank sits nearby in a chair. Klute smiles a little -- almost apologetically.
</DIRECTION>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm always getting surprises.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
Bree doesn't answer. She sets the armload of dresses over the back of a chair, moves aside to get others. Frank smiles cautiously, ruefully. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want you to do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
He still doesn't extract an answer. She returns with other dresses.
</DIRECTION>
<KLUTE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. I said I don't want you to do this.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.

He continues to look at her; she continues to gather possessions. Then trying to smile, to deal with it casually --
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, too much is going on here. I'm moving in with another girl, that's all. Just for a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(helpfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. This other girl's got a very big apartment, big, plenty of room.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, it's not necessarily how it looks, right? It's --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He thinks better of continuing. Klute looks from him back to Bree. He speaks gravely, spacing his words -- unable to speak any faster.
</DIRECTION>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Please. Not with this son of a bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank rises, both nervous and offended -- but dealing with Klute as between civilized men. Smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Klute, let's handle it like grownups? I mean we're all grown up now, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(ventures forward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- we all respect each other, you know what I mean? -- I respect you, Bree respects you -- you could say, it just didn't work out between you and she. But you got to respect her too -- you know, her best interests, best for her --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Klute hits him, pursues, recovers, and starts to beat him. BLOOD thickly descends the side of Frank's face, as he struggles away. Bree is screaming. Bree grabs at him from behind. He thrusts her off. But it allows Frank to break away through the still-open door. Klute pursues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LANDING AT DOOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank clatters down a stairs as Klute arrives in the doorframe, and as Bree, behind Klute, screams --
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
Klute is restrained -- restrains himself. Frank has faced around on the stairs, still bleeding extravagantly from his torn scalp. Earnestly --
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I'm gonna get you dropped.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Klute start's out after him -- Frank vaults away down the stairs -- we hear him stumbling and running -- Klute faces sharply around into the apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAST KLUTE TO BREE. She is running away from him again, to a corner of the apartment, fumbling at a sewing basket. He starts in, after her.
</DIRECTION>
<KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
(indistinctly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She swings about as he overtakes her, holding a pair of scissors -- simply and transcendently terrified. She strikes at him, slashing his forearm. He and she stand in absolute silence. He looks down at the stain of blood spreading through the fabric of his jacket sleeve. Then he turns out of the room and down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BREE'S BROWNSTONE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute comes out of door -- goes down steps to his own apartment. A passerby stops him for directions and doesn't seem to notice the blood on his sleeve. Klute goes into his apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: BREE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bree is in the middle of dialing the phone. Her hands are shaking; she misdials -- holds down the receiver for a moment then starts again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute stands in silence for a moment or two -- then takes rather more note of his forearm. (Not urgently but practically; it behooves him to stop bleeding.) He turns toward the bathroom, pulling his jacket off with the other hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: BREE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bree speaks to the phone, trying to make a simple point, trying to keep her voice even.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- until he gets back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I heard you, I understand that. I said I'm going to come over, I'll wait until he gets back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
She hangs up before the other party can object in detail -- takes up her purse and goes out, not even closing the door behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BATHROOM: KLUTE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute has knotted a hand-towel around his forearm, now uses teeth and fingers to pull the ends tight. Then -- intending to clean up -- he takes up a washcloth, reaches for the faucet --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BREE'S BROWNSTONE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bree comes out of door - goes down steps - hesitates in front of Klute's apartment struggling with the question of whether to knock. CAMERA pulls back to reveal we are watching her through the windshield of a car in the parking lot across the street. CAMERA pulls back further to reveal the back of Cable's head as he sits in the car watching her. Bree starts to knock on Klute's door but stops herself and walks down the street. Cable's head moves out of the shot. We hear the sound of the car door opening and closing. Through the windshield we see Cable cross in front of the car and start to follow Bree down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BATHRO0M: KLUTE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute finishes mopping up. SOUND OF TELEPHONE. He turns back out of the bathroom and answers it.
</DIRECTION>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?

<DIRECTION>
(listens, then soberly - )
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trask, I don't get that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET: BREE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bree is about a quarter block away from the Brownstone now, hurrying. She waves in the direction of a cab, misses it, continues on. We CUT TO --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET: CABLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cable stands looking after her, hesitates over choice of action, decides to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET: FIGURES: PAST BREE TO CABLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We establish the distance between them -- Cable 100 or so feet behind her, unnoticed by her, maintaining about the same pace, not -- at this point -- trying to overtake (perhaps waiting for less populated surroundings) We CUT BACK TO --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Klute continues his phone conversation, short spoken.
</DIRECTION>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who told you, his secretary?

	Has someone checked his hotel? He always stays at the --

<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll look around, I'll call you back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up. First he checks out the windows (but - if we want to be accurate - from mid room, without directly approaching the windows themselves). Then he secures a pistol from his jacket (and folds the jacket itself over his arm to conceal it, as a matter of public decorum), and goes on out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWELL: KLUTE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute's manner, over the next few minutes, exhibits an absolute, untheatrical, care and competence. A man -- Cable -- may in fact be hiding here somewhere to kill him. He sets about checking the likely places -- first of all the lower hallway, then the stairwell itself, moving steadily unalarmedly up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the top he notes -- but still without main concern that Bree's door is open. He calls ahead --
</DIRECTION>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bree --

<DIRECTION>
INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY

He enters, puzzles, starts checking around (quite thoroughly; she might be hiding from him). We CUT BACK TO --
</DIRECTION>

EXT. STREETS: BREE; FIGURE OF CABLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bree moves past CONSTRUCTION WORK, through one of those temporary pedestrian passageways. Behind her, nearer than before we see the FIGURE OF CABLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute comes quickly back downstairs, back into his room, takes up the phone. Through the still-open door we watch him begin dialing -- then CUT TO --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SPANGLER'S (OUTER) OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bree sits isolated on the waiting-room couch. She may have been here for fifteen minutes -- or an hour. She turns the pages of a magazine -- one handed, without even lifting it from the coffee table, with an absolute lack of interest, a mechanical gesture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear FOOTSTEPS approaching directly toward where we are watching Bree sit.
</DIRECTION>
<LELA>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Daniel --

WIDER - TWO SHOT

Bree looks up in a kind of frozen terror, as the Secretary smiles nicely -- lovingly down at her.
</DIRECTION>
<LELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --

(the same tone, completely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LELA>
<DIRECTION>
Bree moves to the desk and telephone. But we move with the Secretary as she moves into Spangler's inner office and switches out the lights (establishing TIME CHANGE: dusk now) and as we hear, O.S., the sound of DIALING and BREE'S VOICE --
</DIRECTION>

<FABER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes - yes dear, yes -- maybe half an hour, sure, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABER>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up. An ancient stirring, a kind of triumph. He glances about, then tightens his tie. Then it comes to him, after all -- he takes note of himself -- he leans forward against his desk and rubs his forehead with old bony fingers. We CUT TO -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY (NIGHT)

<DIRECTION>
KLUTE on phone.

He hangs up, immediately starts to dial again, then pauses to check a list he's laid out by the telephone. While he's doing this, his PHONE RINGS.

<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWAY OF GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quitting time. As Bree enters from street level, employees are coming down the stairs, pushing past her. She continues up on until at one point -- one more officious or more communicative than the others informs her --
</DIRECTION>
<FOREMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lady, it's closing up there.

He lets her pass, glances after her like the others, continues on his way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARMENT BUILDING: FABER RECEPTION AREA - DAY (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bree arrives at the head of the stairs -- as still others press past her on their way down -- and comes more or less directly up against the thickset RECEPTIONIST. She is packing her purse, preparing to depart, looks somewhat challengingly at Bree -- who sees no way to avoid the issue.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have an appointment with Mr. Faber.

<DIRECTION>
Bree goes on nervously in the direction indicated, toward --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CORNER OF OFFICES: NATHAN FABER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN stands bending over a bench with back to camera, conferring with another man as Bree approaches -- looking to us, as to her, exactly like his father. We hear the Receptionist's VOICE repeating --
</DIRECTION>
<RECEPTIONIST>

(CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Faber --

She has already started away. He calls after her evenly --

<NATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
She looks back quickly, smiles nervously --
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't important.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
But we hold on him for a moment as she continues out of scene -- until he turns away to other matters. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RECEPTION AREA: RECEPTIONIST, BREE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bree returns toward Receptionist, awkwardly --
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did Mr. Faber leave a message for me or anything? Mr. Faber Senior? Bree Daniel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I thought that was for tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<DIRECTION>
The Receptionist riffles through a stack of assorted envelopes -- hands one out to Bree -- and promptly takes her way off. Out. Bree starts to open the envelope then and there -- but OTHERS continue to move past her. She seeks a more private place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROWS OF GARMENTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bree shelters herself out of sight from everyone else -- though we continue to hear INTERMITTENT VOICES, O.S. and continue to maintain the sense of other presences.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see her open the envelope --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER: BREE, ENVELOPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She finds nothing inside but money -- bills totaling fifty dollars. We see her looking for a message, finding nothing. It comes to her slowly that she's been paid off and avoided. She bites her lips in pain. She pushes back out of hiding --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RECEPTIONIST AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- back to the reception area again. (By now this immediate scene has emptied, though we catch sight of a figure or two at scene-start, moving through the background, and continue to hear an occasional NOISE or VOICE O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bree looks about for someone -- then scouts for a pencil, finds one in a desk (or bench) drawer, starts to readdress the envelope (to direct it back to Mr. Faber). Then she breaks off from that, takes up a PHONE instead, dials -- waits -- then --
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bree Daniel. Has he called in yet? Well if he does, I'm at --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reads phone)

<DIRECTION>
(impatiently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just tell him Bree Daniel; he knows who.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>

She hangs up, goes back to readdressing the envelope. FOOTSTEPS are approaching in her direction. She glances up apologetically.

She pauses --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE PAST BREE TO CABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cable hastens toward her along a lane of garments. In this brief glimpse a ludicrous and terrifying figure -- a noise, a gesticulation (actually the gesture is arms out, palms downward, intended as a quieting gesture; and the hissing noise is intended as a shushing). Bree cries out, turns to run --

Cable and Bree. They are at some remove from the site of Cable's first appearance; there are other evidences of time-lapse. Cable's manner is that of slightly-strained patience -- a civility -- an attempt now and then to smile. Bree watches his every slight gesture, quivers to make a break for it, tries throughout to buy time.

The PHONE RINGS, an explosive noise. Bree startles. It has been put on night-ring, to sound all over the loft, and the noise is deafening. But -- the most bizarre element is Cable's absolute lack of response to it. It rings and rings as he talks and talks -- in the same expository tone as before, without raising his voice. It drowns out most of his words -- at most we catch only odd phrases of all the following -- but he seems not to hear it any more than the clamor of other things torturing his soul.

He turns and lifts a phone (one of the extension phones situated around the loft) -- though up to now he's given no evidence of even hearing the ringing. He just stands holding the phone for a time, then lowers it back on the receiver. With a sort of absolute quiet --

EXT. STREETS - DAY (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Klute -- probably in MLS -- running along street. He tries for a cab -- misses it -- halts the next by expedient of cutting bodily in front of it. The Driver starts to lean out to object. Klute mashes him back inside, enters the cab. We CUT BACK TO --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MLS, the two FIGURES: CABLE, BREE. They are somewhat separated -- Cable has gone to look down from one of the arched windows of the loft, while Bree remains in place. She is a prisoner, we can suppose -- when we cut closer we'll see her eyes continually shifting, her mind calculating her chances -- but he hasn't molested her. He bears her no animus at this point. His manner is rather quiet, undetermined. He feels some relief that the thing is, in effect, over -- and some puzzlement about what to do (with either her or himself) now. He returns toward her.

Nearing her again, he gestures several times, apologetically, seeking words.

	Will you let me go then?

He seems not to have heard the request. He sits for a moment. An intellectual interest, a curiosity. (Meanwhile, perhaps, we see her starting to slip her shoes off, in hopes of running.)
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?

	Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?

He rises, approaches her -- apparently taken in, credulous, grateful, wondering --

	You're willing to listen? You want me just to keep talking?

He hits her.

EXT. GARMENT BUILDING ROOF (DIRECTLY ABOVE FABER LOFT) - DAY (NIGHT)

<DIRECTION>
Klute has gun out - as he carefully makes his way across the roof. Man in hotel window across street holding drink - watches him with amused curiosity. Klute spots entrance to stairway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARMENT BUILDING: KLUTE - DAY (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute goes downstairs to back entrance of Faber loft. He slips inside. He hears THE SOUNDS OF THE BEATING -- a stirring of feet and indistinct impact sounds, a murmur of voices (but all quite muted, undramatic). He maneuvers through lanes of garments, trying to gain a line of sight. He understands what's going on, strains to intervene, but can't disclose himself. At a point, he drops to hands and knees, slides underneath the garment racks, drawing closer to Cable, trying to gain position. We intersperse his progress with further Bree-Cable fragments, as for instance --

KLUTE, SHIFTING CLOSER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute works his way steadily closer -- under steadily increasing pressure, as the pursuit and beating continue as SOUNDS, O.S. Even close at hand the noises are ambiguous -- the clatter of footsteps, grunts, a slap of flesh -- rather than distinct. Once or twice we hear CABLE'S VOICE clearly enough to make out words --
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Is that contempt? Is it?

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm the one who feels contempt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE>
<DIRECTION>
-- and once or twice a CRY from Bree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute tries to gain aim --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. TO BREE, CABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- but Cable is too close upon her, and they are too steadily in motion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KLUTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute moves on -- moves on -- gains position -- springs.

<DIRECTION>
CABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cable catches the sound, whirls, screams --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. TO KLUTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klute closes with him, knocks loose Cable's pistol - contends for it again, knocks it loose again. EFFECT -- under -- SIRENS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CABLE, KLUTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cable breaks loose, backs a step -- backs another step -- and then, turns and runs unhesitant against one of the windows, exploding it outward with him, both frame and glass.
</DIRECTION>

We see the body tracing its quick path down the dark side of the building.

Klute turns from looking down, moves to where Bree kneels on the floor. He hunkers down. In a gentle-enough VOICE, but matter-of-factly withal -- as if to a child --

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KLUTE is packing to leave. We follow him about as he carries clothing from closet and bureau, folds it into his suitcase on the table. We hear the familiar FOOTSTEPS on the stairs. Bree's KNOCK. He lets her in, keeps on about his business. His expression is sober; hers is quite tentative.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't at least expel her. She ventures in, sits on the table, swings her heels, watches him pack. His arm impairs him. At length --
</DIRECTION>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.

Pause. She compresses her lips, slips down from the table, starts smartly out of the room.

<KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
She returns and sits on the table again, waits. But Klute doesn't seem about to say anything more -- goes on packing.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREE>
<KLUTE>

(slowly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me.

	<DIALOGUE>

He complies, stands and looks, folding a necktie. But now she finds she has to look away. Somewhat brokenly --

	<DIALOGUE>
	Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?

	About what?

<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!

</BREE>
<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so.

He resumes packing, continues through the following.

	How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.

<KLUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.

Thereafter he guards his silence, staunchly goes on packing, as she comes at the thing from various sharp angles.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, I'm a city person. I'm sure it's just as good as here but I'm a city person, that's all, I am!

	Do you not believe I love you? I'm honestly, honestly just --

He has almost finished packing -- returns toward the suitcase with the tin CLOCK and electric FAN, tries to fit them in as conversation continues.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.

<KLUTE>

	OK.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you use these?

</KLUTE>
<DIRECTION>
He sets the fan beside her, hands her the LOUDLY TICKING clock. She holds it in her lap, numbly. He's packed -- closes various drawers, leaving in good order -- snaps the suitcase shut, lifts it stiffly down from the table. She remains sitting.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I carry something for you, to the car?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you kiss me?

<KLUTE>

	No. I'm sore.

	Well --

She smiles back. He goes. We hear the entryway door opening and closing.

<DIRECTION>
She slips down off the table. We CUT TO --

EXT STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - DAY

Klute is, let's say, about seventy feet on his way when she appears at the front door, calls after him.
</DIRECTION>
<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.

</BREE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns around and stops. He walks slowly back to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER: BREE, KLUTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He arrives in proximity to her. Then the following events in more or less the following order:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her inquiringly. She responds by sitting down, plunk, on the grubby front step of the Brownstone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Having stood for some time -- during which she has offered only twitching motions of her hands -- he sets down the suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Having set down the suitcase, but derived no answer, he reaches out one arm, and leans against the building front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She nearly arrives at the level of statement. Fretfully, indecisively --

<BREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh heck --

(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh heck --

Then, as a man not to be dallied with, he picks up the suitcase again. She looks at him strickenly, but it doesn't precipitate her into speech.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts it down again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then -- then, after all, goddamit, he reaches out, grabs her wrist, and simply hauls her along, suitcase in one hand, Bree in the other. As she yanks, shouts, struggles --
