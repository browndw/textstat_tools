Welcome to Padua High School,, your typical urban-suburban high school in Portland, Oregon. Smarties, Skids, Preppies, Granolas. Loners, Lovers, the In and the Out Crowd rub sleep out of their eyes and head for the main building.

:SC: PADUA HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAT STRATFORD, eighteen, pretty -- but trying hard not to be -- in a baggy granny dress and glasses, balances a cup of coffee and a backpack as she climbs out of her battered, baby blue '75 Dodge Dart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stray SKATEBOARD clips her, causing her to stumble and spill her coffee, as well as the contents of her backpack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The young RIDER dashes over to help, trembling when he sees who his board has hit.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey -- sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDER>
<DIRECTION>
Cowering in fear, he attempts to scoop up her scattered belongings.

He persists.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said, leave it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs his skateboard and uses it to SHOVE him against a car, skateboard tip to his throat. He whimpers pitifully and she lets him go. A path clears for her as she marches through a pack of fearful students and SLAMS open the door, entering school.
</DIRECTION>

INT. GIRLS' ROOM - DAY

BIANCA STRATFORD, a beautiful sophomore, stands facing the mirror, applying lipstick. Her less extraordinary, but still cute friend, CHASTITY stands next to her.

GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERON JAMES, a clean-cut, easy-going senior with an open, farm-boy face, sits facing Miss Perky, an impossibly cheery guidance counselor.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_PERKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure you won't find Padua any different than your old school. Same little asswipe mother-fuckers everywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_PERKY>
<DIRECTION>
Her plastic smile never leaves her face. Cameron fidgets in his chair uncomfortably.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_PERKY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any questions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_PERKY>

</CAMERON>
<MISS_PERKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then go forth. Scoot I've got deviants to see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_PERKY>
<DIRECTION>
Cameron rises to leave and makes eye contact with PATRICK VERONA, a sullen-looking bad ass senior who waits outside Ms Perky's door. His slouch and smirk let us know how cool he is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miss Perky looks down at her file and up at Patrick
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_PERKY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patrick Verona. I see we're making our visits a weekly ritual.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_PERKY>

She gives him a withering glance. He answers with a charming smile.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I missed you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<MISS_PERKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_PERKY>

</MISS_PERKY>

She motions for Patrick to enter her office and Cameron shuffles out the door, bumping into MICHAEL ECKMAN, a lanky, brainy senior who will either end up a politician or game show host.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You the new guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>

<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	North, actually. How'd you ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was kidding. People actually live there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many people were in your old school?

Prom posters adorn the wall. Michael steers Cameron through the crowd as he points to various cliques.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got your basic beautiful people. Unless they talk to you first, don't bother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
The beautiful people pass, in full jock/cheerleader splendor.

<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>

Several Stetson-wearing, big belt buckle. Wrangler guys walk by.

<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That I'm used to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse. They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
They pass an espresso cart with a group of teens huddled around it.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)

Several white boys in dreadlocks and Jamaican knit berets lounge on the grass. A cloud of pot smoke hovers above them
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big Marley fans. Think they're black. Semi-political, but mostly, they watch a lot of Wild Kingdom, if you know what I mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Michael waves to DEREK, the one with the longest dreads.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>

He points to the table of jocks, as they torture various passers-by.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
He points proudly to the ALLIGATOR on his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cameron stops listening as BIANCA walks by, and we go SLO MO. Pure and perfect, she passes Cameron and Michael without a look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cameron is smitten

<CAMERON>

</CAMERON>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bianca Stratford. Sophomore. Don't even think about it

</MICHAEL>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter. She's not allowed to date until her older sister does. And that's an impossibility.

ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A room full of bored seniors doodle and scare off into space MS. BLAISE, the one-step-away-from-medication English Teacher, tries to remember what she's talking about.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_BLAISE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, then. Oh, yes. I guess that does it for our analysis of The Old Man and the Sea. Any other comments?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with dread)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_BLAISE>
<DIRECTION>
Kat, the girl we saw as we entered the school, slowly cakes off her glasses and speaks up.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't we just read the Hardy Boys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<MRS_BLAISE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_BLAISE>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This book is about a guy and his fishing habit. Not exactly a crucial topic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
The other students roll their eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frankly, I'm baffled as to why we still revere Hemingway. He was an abusive, alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of cats.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY DORSEY, a well-muscled jock with great cheekbones, makes fun of her from his row.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As opposed to a bitter self-righteous hag who has no friends?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
A few giggles. Kat ignores him. A practiced gesture
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_BLAISE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's enough, Mr. Dorsey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_BLAISE>
<DIRECTION>
Really gets fired up now
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess the school board thinks because Hemingway's male and an asshole, he's worthy of our time
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up at Ms. Blaise, who is now fighting with her pill box.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Colette? Charlotte Bronte? Simone de Beauvoir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick, lounging in his seat in the back row, elbows a crusty-looking crony, identified by the name SCURVY, embroidered on his workshirt.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother Goose?

</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
The class titters. Kat wears an expression of intolerance

INT. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat now sits before Miss Perky.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_PERKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Katarina Stratford. My, my. You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_PERKY>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<MISS_PERKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild. By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_PERKY>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls. I was merely a spectator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<MISS_PERKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_PERKY>
<DIRECTION>
Kat smiles at her, daring her to say it.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tempestuous?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<MISS_PERKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_PERKY>
<DIRECTION>
She grimaces, as if she's referring to a medical condition.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_PERKY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You might want to work on that
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_PERKY>

Kat rises from her chair with a plastic smile matching the counselor's.

	As always, thank you for your excellent guidance.

	I realize the language of Mr. Shakespeare makes him a bit daunting, but I'm sure you're all doing your best.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEACHER>
<DIRECTION>
Bianca folds the note and passes it behind her with a flip of her hair to CHASTITY. Chastity opens the note and reads:
</DIRECTION>

Chastity frowns to herself.

The teacher shakes her head, but lets it go.

MANDELLA. a waif-like senior girl who sits off to the side trying to slit her wrist with the plastic spiral on her notebook, looks up and raises her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<TEACHER>

	Mandella -- since you're assisting us, you might as well comment. I'm assuming you read the assignment.

Mandella and Kat sit down in the quiet corner. They are eating a carton of yogurt with gusto.
</DIRECTION>
<MANDELLA>
<DIRECTION>
Your sister is so amazingly without. She'll never read him. She has no idea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat attacks
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fact that you're cutting gym so you can T.A. Sophomore English just to hear his name, is a little without in itself if you ask me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>

Kat's attention is caught by Patrick as he walks by with his friends, lighting up a cigarette. Mandella notices her staring.

<MANDELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a little.

</KAT>
<MANDELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An attempted slit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANDELLA>
<DIRECTION>
Kat stares at her, expressionless.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions. You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<MANDELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANDELLA>
<DIRECTION>
Thinks a minute
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, say you do it. You kill yourself, you end up in wherever you end up and he's there. Do you really think he's gonna wanna dace a ninety pound compulsive who failed volleyball?

Mandella's attention is struck by Bianca

Michael and Cameron observe Joey's leers at Bianca from their bench in another corner. Cowboys eating cue of a can of beans linger on the grass behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because they're bred to. Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.

	He always have that shit-eating grin?
	</DIALOGUE>

<MICHAEL>

Michael putters off, leaving Cameron dodging Patrick's grimy, grey Jeep -- a vehicle several years and many paint jobs away from its former glory as a REGULATION MAIL TRUCK - - as he sideswipes several cars on his way out of the lot.

INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
SHARON STRATFORD, attractive and focused, sits in front of her computer, typing quickly. A shelf next to her holds several bodice-ripper romance novels, bearing her name.

I hope dinner's ready because I only have ten minutes before Mrs. Johnson squirts out a screamer.

	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Walter holds up a letter to Kat

<WALTER>

Sharon looks up from her computer.
</DIRECTION>
<SHARON>

	What's a synonym for throbbing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHARON>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought we decided you were going to school here. At U of 0.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You decided.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<BIANCA>

Kat gives Bianca an evil look then smiles sweetly at

	Swollen...turgid.

</SHARON>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Bianca; upset)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who drove you home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Bianca glares at Kat then turns to Walter
</DIRECTION>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if she never starts dating?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then neither will you. And I'll get to sleep at night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough!

</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls out a small tape recorder from his black bag.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know what this is?

</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
He hits the "play' button and SHRIEKS OF PAIN emanate from the tape recorder.
</DIRECTION>
<BIANCA_AND_WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(in unison, by rote)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The sound of a fifteen-year-old in labor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA_AND_WALTER>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is why you're not dating until your sister does.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But she doesn't want to date.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly my point
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
His BEEPER goes off and he grabs his bag again
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<SHARON>

INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cameron sits with an empty chair beside him. Bianca arrives in a flurry of blonde hair.
</DIRECTION>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we make this quick? Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad. Again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<DIRECTION>
BIANCA Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part. Please.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERON>
<DIRECTION>
(looking down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine. Saturday? Night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<DIRECTION>
Bianca smiles slowly
</DIRECTION>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're asking me out. That's so cute. What's your name again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<CAMERON>
<DIRECTION>
(embarrassed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<DIRECTION>
Bianca seizes an opportunity.
</DIRECTION>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cameron.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser. My sister. I can't date until she does.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<DIRECTION>
She fingers a lock of her hair. He looks on, dazzled.
</DIRECTION>
<BIANCA>
<DIRECTION>
The problem is, she's completely anti-social.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a shame.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches out and touches his arm
</DIRECTION>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me see what I can do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<DIRECTION>
Cameron smiles, having no idea how stupid he is
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BIOLOGY CLASS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A frog is being torn asunder by several prongs and picks. Michael and Cameron go for the spleen.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're in school for one day and you ask out the most beautiful girl? Do you have no concept of the high school social code?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Cameron grins away
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you. So what's the point?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Cameron motions with his head toward Patrick, a few lab tables away. He's wearing biker glasses instead of goggles as he tries to revive his frog.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna go out with him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
The others at the lab table raise their eyebrows
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERON>
<DIRECTION>
(impatient)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No - he could wrangle with the sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<DIRECTION>
Michael smiles. Liking the intrigue.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What makes you think he'll do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He seems like he thrives on danger
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No kidding. He's a criminal. I heard he lit a state trooper on fire. He just got out of Alcatraz...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm serious, man, he's whacked. He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget his reputation. Do you think we've got a plan or not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I just said
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<DIRECTION>
Michael processes this.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set. You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list. With me by your side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you hated those people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
A cowboy flicks the frog's heart into one of the Coffee Kid's latte. Cameron presses on, over the melee.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So now all we gotta do is talk to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<DIRECTION>
He points to Patrick, who now makes his frog hump another frog, with full-on sound effects.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll let you handle that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WOODSHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boys and a few stray girls nail their pieces of wood
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael sits next to PEPE, a Coffee Kid, who holds out his jacket like the men who sell watches in the subway. Inside several bags of coffee hang from hooks.
</DIRECTION>
<PEPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some people like the Colombian, but it all depends on your acidity preference. Me? I prefer East African and Indonesian. You start the day with a Sumatra Boengie or maybe and Ethiopian Sidamo in your cup, you're that much farther ahead than someone drinkin' Cosia Rican or Kona -- you know what I mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEPE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael nods solemnly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS THE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick sits at a table with Scurvy, making something that looks like a machete out of a two-by-four.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cameron approaches, full of good-natured farm boy cheer
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, there
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<DIRECTION>
In response, Patrick brandishes a loud POWER TOOL in his direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cameron slinks away.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERON>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Later, then.

</CAMERON>
<DIRECTION>
Michael watches, shaking his head.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joey and his pals take turns drawing boobs onto a cafeteria tray with a magic marker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael walks up and sits between them, casual as can be
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you lost?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope - just came by to chat
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't chat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you. You know, just to see if you're interested.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs Michael by the side of the head, and proceeds to draw a penis on his cheek with the magic marker. Michael suffers the indignity and speaks undaunted.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(grimacing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hear me out. You want Bianca don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Joey sits back and cackles at his drawing.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does this conversation have a purpose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her. Someone who's up for the job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Michael points to Patrick, who makes a disgusted face at his turkey pot pie before he rises and throws it at the garbage can, rather than in it.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
That guy? I heard he ate a live duck once. Everything but the beak and the feet.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Joey turns to look at Michael.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
What's in it for you?
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hey, nothin' man Purely good will on my part.

He rises to leave and turns to the others.

INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Michael stands at the sink, trying to scrub Joey's artwork off his face as Cameron watches.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got him involved?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like we had a choice? Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Cameron grins and puts an arm around him
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're one brilliant guy
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<DIRECTION>
Michael pulls back, noticing other guys filing in.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Hey - I appreciate gratitude as much as the next guy, but it's not gonna do you any good to be known as New Kid Who Embraces Guys In The Bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cameron pulls back and attempts to posture himself in a manly way for the others, now watching.

</KAT>
<MANDELLA>

	William would never have gone to a state school.

</KAT>
<MANDELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does it matter?

</PATRICK>
<MISS_PERKY>

</CAMERON>
<BIANCA>

NEAR THE STAGE
</DIRECTION>

Mandella and Kat glow with sweat. When they hear the opening chords of the song, they look at each other and scream with glee as they begin to dance. They couldn't be having a better time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick signals to get the bartender's attention and looks across the bouncing surge of the crowd. He spots Kat and Mandella singing along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gleeful Kat -- dancing and looking completely at ease. None of her usual "attitude". Patrick is transfixed. And most definitely attracted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEAR THE STAGE Kat looks at Mandella.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>

(continuing to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>

The bartender arrives

<DIRECTION>
BARTENDER (shouting)

	<DIALOGUE>
	What can I get you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<KAT>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks up to Patrick.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)

Kat steams. And watches him watch the band
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not surrounded by your usual cloud of smoke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
The band takes a break, so they can stop yelling now
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I quit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
He leans back, making no attempt to hit on her. She moves closer.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
He motions toward the stage
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
She's completely taken aback. He uses the moment to his advantage and brushes her hair back as he speaks right into her ear.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I watched you out there I've never seen you look like that

His cocky side is back in a flash
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I got it, Rick.

</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
He tosses some bills on the bar
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rather than thank him, Kat simply watches him, trying to figure out his motive.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nine-thirty then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
A few people have gotten between them at the bar and she can't hear a word he's saying. She gives him one last look and heads back into the crowd.

<DIRECTION>
Kat glances sharply at her.
</DIRECTION>
<MANDELLA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; off her look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be Cruella with me. I'm in favor of romance. You're the one that wants to march on Washington every five minutes.

Kat pokes her, then looks back at the club dreamily.

INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat and the other students sit at their desks, taking a quiz Patrick's seat is conspicuously empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From outside, we hear the soft, unsure beginnings of a SONG. Kat looks up, then out the window, HORRIFIED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The song grows louder until we realize it's The Partridge Family's "I Think I Love You". Being sung by Patrick.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(0. S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"This morning, I woke up with this feeling, I didn't know how to deal with, and so I just decided to myself--"
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
The STUDENTS rush to the window. OUTSIDE Patrick stands beneath the window, crooning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scurvy is next to him, keeping the beat on the bongos and doing backup vocal s.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I'd hide it to myself. And never talk about it. And didn't I go and shout it when you walked into the room --"
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
He makes quite a sarcastic show of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CLASSROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Blaise touches her heart, as if the song is for her. Kat slowly walks to the window, peeking below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick smiles at her as he finishes the verse with a big finale.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>

The other students laugh, clap, cheer, etc. Kat sinks down, mortified, but with a slight smile
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DETENTION HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick and several other miscreants sit quietly, mulling over their misfortune.
</DIRECTION>
<MISCREANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice song, Verona.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISCREANT>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flog me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
He makes the appropriate hand gesture
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Chapin, the gym teacher, sits at the desk in front, ignoring them while he reads a girly weightlifting magazine
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
<DIRECTION>
(0. S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, Mr. Chapin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick looks up at the sound of her voice and sees Kat standing in the doorway. She gives him a smile and he perks up a little.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat walks into the room and addresses Mr. Chapin again. He turns fully to face her.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I'd like to state for the record that Mr. Verona ' s current incarceration is unnecessary. I never filed a complaint.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<MR_CHAPIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't have to. He disrupted a classroom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_CHAPIN>
<DIRECTION>
Kat glances over at Patrick and motions her head toward the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick shrugs, not knowing what she ' s talking about.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She motions again, and looks toward the window with an expression that says, "Make a break for it, moron."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat brings her attention back to Mr. Chapin while Patrick inches out of his seat toward the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other miscreants watch with glee.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a simple serenade warrants a week of detention. There are far more hideous acts than off-key singing being performed by the student body on a regular basis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick is halfway out the window now. And none too happy about it, considering they're on the second floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He eyes a large TREE a few feet away from MR. CHAPIN. He starts to turn away from Kat
</DIRECTION>
<MR_CHAPIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not gonna change my mind, Kat. Rules stick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_CHAPIN>
<DIRECTION>
Kat starts to panic, as Patrick has yet to make the jump for the tree.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, Mr. Chapin. There's something I've always wanted to show you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back toward her again, the very second before he would have spotted Patrick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat glances toward the window. Patrick's just about to make the jump.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_CHAPIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_CHAPIN>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
From behind, we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra at Mr. Chapin, just as Patrick makes the Jump.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The miscreants cheer, for both the daring' escape and the flash of skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Chapin reddens and tries to be stern.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_CHAPIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to let that slide, Katarina. But if I catch you doing that again, you'll be in here with the rest of these guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_CHAPIN>
<DIRECTION>
He motions to the remaining detention prisoners, without noticing Patrick's absence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat smiles at him.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Mr. Chapin.
	</DIALOGUE>

Kat bolts out the door. Mr. Chapin goes back to his muscle mag, wiping the sweat from his brow.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe.

</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
She sighs and dose so. When she gets to his level, she perches on the branch next to him. He grins at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then swings himself down with the grace and ease of a monkey, leaving her sitting there, realizing she's been duped.

She stops and picks up a toy gun that SHOOTS water at giggling hyenas and wails on it. The barker hands her a stuffed animal as her prize. She hands it to the small KID next to her and they continue walking.

<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?

<DIRECTION>
It's hard to even recognize them, as their hair and faces are so smeared with paint globs, but they still manage to find each other's eyes.

He wipes a smear of blue paint away from her lips, as he goes to kiss her.
