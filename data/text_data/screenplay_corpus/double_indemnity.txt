LOS ANGELES - A DOWNTOWN INTERSECTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is night, about two o'clock, very light traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the left and in the immediate foreground a semaphore traffic signal stands at GO. Approaching it at about thirty miles per hour is a Dodge 1938 coupe. It is driven erratically and weaving a little, but not out of control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the car is about forty feet away, the signal changes to STOP. Car makes no attempt to stop but comes on through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LIGHT NEWSPAPER TRUCK is crossing the intersection at right angles. It swerves and skids to avoid the Dodge, which goes on as though nothing had happened. The truck stops with a panicky screech of tires. There is a large sign on the truck: "READ THE LOS ANGELES TIMES". The truck driver's infuriated face stares after the coupe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COUPE continues along the street, still weaving, then slows down and pulls over towards the curb in front of a tall office building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COUPE stops. The headlights are turned off. For a second nothing happens, then the car door opens slowly. A man eases himself out onto the sidewalk and stands a moment leaning on the open door to support himself. He's a tall man, about thirty- five years old. From the way he moves there seems to be something wrong with his left shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He straightens up and painfully lowers his left hand into his jacket pocket. He leans into the car. He brings out a light-weight overcoat and drapes it across his shoulders. He shuts the car door and walks toward the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ENTRANCE OF THE BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above the closed, double-plate glass doors is lettered: "PACIFIC BUILDING". To the left of entrance there is a drugstore, closed, dark except for a faint light in the back. The man comes stiffly up to the doors. (CAMERA HAS MOVED UP WITH HIM). He tries the doors. They are locked. He knocks on the glass. Inside, over his shoulder, the lobby of the building is visible: a side entrance to the drugstore on the left, in the rear a barber shop and cigar and magazine stand closed up for the night, and to the right two elevators. One elevator is open and its dome light falls across the dark lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man knocks again. The night watchman sticks his head out of the elevator and looks toward entrance. He comes out with a newspaper in one hand and a half-eaten sandwich in the other. He finishes the sandwich on the way to the doors, looks out and recognizes the man outside, unlocks the door and pulls it open.
</DIRECTION>

Neff is walking towards elevator. Night watchman looks after him, relocks door, follows to elevator. Neff enters elevator.

Neff stands leaning against wall. He is pale and haggard with pain, but deadpans as night watchman joins him.

	Twelve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIGHT_WATCHMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens. Across a small dark reception room a pair of frosted glass doors are lettered: PACIFIC ALL-RISK INSURANCE COMPANY - FOUNDED 1906 - MAIN OFFICE. There is a little light beyond the glass doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neff straightens up and walks heavily out of the elevator, across reception room to doors. He pushes them open. The night watchman stares after him morosely, works lever, elevator doors start to close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWELFTH FLOOR INSURANCE OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(Note for set-designer: Our Insurance Company occupies the entire eleventh and twelfth floors of the building. On the twelfth floor are the executive offices and claims and sales departments. These all open off a balcony which runs all the way around. From the balcony you see the eleventh floor below: one enormous room filled with desks, typewriters, filing cabinets, business machines, etc.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neff comes through the double entrance doors from the reception room. The twelfth floor is dark. Some light shines up from the eleventh floor. Neff takes a few steps then holds on to the balcony railing and looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ELEVENTH FLOOR FROM ABOVE - NEFF'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two colored women are cleaning the offices. One is dry-mopping the floor, the other is moving chairs back into position, etc. A colored man is emptying waste baskets into a big square box. He shuffles a little dance step as he moves, and hums a little tune.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moves away from the railing with a faint smile on his face, and walks past two or three offices (CAMERA WITH HIM) towards a glass door with number twenty-seven on it and three names: HENRY B. ANDERSON, WALTER NEFF, LOUIS L. SCHWARTZ. Neff opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEFF'S OFFICE - DARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three desks, filing cabinets, one typewriter on stand, one dictaphone on fixed stand against wall with rack of records underneath, telephones on all three desks. Water cooler with inverted bottle and paper cup holder beside it. Two windows facing toward front of building. Venetian blinds. No curtains. Waste basket full, ash trays not emptied. The office has not been cleaned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neff enters, switches on desk lamp. He looks across at dicta phone, goes heavily to it and lifts off the fabric cover. He leans down hard on the dictaphone stand as if feeling faint. He turns away from dictaphone, takes a few uncertain steps and falls heavily into a swivel chair. His head goes far back, his eyes close, cold sweat shows on his face. For a moment he stays like this, exhausted, then his eyes open slowly and look down at his left shoulder. His good hand flips the overcoat back, he unbuttons his jacket, loosens his tie and shirt. This was quite an effort. He rests for a second, breathing hard. With the help of his good hand he edges his left elbow up on the arm-rest of the chair, supports it there and then pulls his jacket wide. A heavy patch of dark blood shows on his shirt. He pushes his chair along the floor towards the water cooler, using his feet and his right hand against the desk, takes out a handkerchief, presses with his hand against the spring faucet of the cooler, soaks the handkerchief in water and tucks it, dripping wet, against the wound inside his shirt. Next, he gets a handful of water and splashes it on his face. The water runs down his chin and drips. He breathes heavily, with closed eyes. He fingers a pack of cigarettes in his shirt pocket, pulls it out, looks at it. There is blood on it. He wheels himself back to the desk and dumps the loose cigarettes out of the packet. Some are blood-stained, a few are clean. He takes one, puts it between his lips, gropes around for a match, lights cigarette. He takes a deep drag and lets smoke out through his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls himself toward dictaphone again, still in the swivel chair, reaches it, lifts the horn off the bracket and the dictaphone makes a low buzzing sound. He presses the button switch on the horn. The sound stops, the record revolves on the cylinder. He begins to speak:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Office memorandum, Walter Neff to Barton Keyes, Claims Manager. Los Angeles, July 16th, 1938. Dear Keyes: I suppose you'll call this a confession when you hear it. I don't like the word confession. I just want to set you right about one thing you couldn't see, because it was smack up against your nose. You think you're such a hot potato as a claims manager, such a wolf on a phoney claim. Well, maybe you are, Keyes, but let's take a look at this Dietrichson claim, Accident and Double Indemnity. You were pretty good in there for a while, all right. You said it wasn't an accident. Check. You said it wasn't suicide. Check. You said it was murder. Check and double check. You thought you had it cold, all wrapped up in tissue paper, with pink ribbons around it. It was perfect, except that it wasn't, because you made a mistake, just one tiny little mistake. When it came to picking the killer, you picked the wrong guy, if you know what I mean. Want to know who killed Dietrichson? Hold tight to that cheap cigar of yours, Keyes. I killed Dietrichson. Me, Walter Neff, insurance agent, 35 years old, unmarried, no visible scars --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He glances down at his wounded shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until a little while ago, that is. Yes, I killed him. I killed him for money -- and a woman -- and I didn't get the money and I didn't get the woman. Pretty, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<DIRECTION>
He interrupts the dictation, lays down the horn on the desk. He takes his lighted cigarette from the ash tray, puffs it two or three times, and kills it. He picks up the horn again.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(His voice is now quiet and contained)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It began last May. About the end of May, it was. I had to run out to Glendale to deliver a policy on some dairy trucks. On the way back I remembered this auto renewal on Los Feliz. So I decided to run over there. It was one of those Calif. Spanish houses everyone was nuts about 10 or 15 years ago. This one must have cost somebody about 30,000 bucks -- that is, if he ever finished paying for it.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Palm trees line the street, middle-class houses, mostly in Spanish style. Some kids throwing a baseball back and forth across a couple of front lawns. An ice cream wagon dawdles along the block. Neff's coupe meets and passes the ice cream wagon and stops before one of the Spanish houses. Neff gets out. He carries a briefcase, his hat is a little on the back of his head. His movements are easy and full of ginger. He inspects the house, checks the number, goes up on the front porch and rings the bell.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was mid-afternoon, and it's funny, I can still remember the smell of honeysuckle all along that block. I felt like a million. There was no way in all this world I could have known that murder sometimes can smell like honeysuckle...

HALLWAY - DIETRICHSON HOME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spanish craperoo in style, as is the house throughout. A wrought-iron staircase curves down from the second floor. A fringed Mexican shawl hangs down over the landing. A large tapestry hangs on the wall. Downstairs, the dining room to one side, living room on the other side visible through a wide archway. All of this, architecture, furniture, decorations, etc., is genuine early Leo Carrillo period. Neff has edged his way in past maid who still holds the door open.

Phyllis Dietrichson stands looking down. She is in her early thirties. She holds a large bath-towel around her very appetizing torso, down to about two inches above her knees.

LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neff comes into the room and throws his briefcase on the plush davenport and tosses his hat on top of it. He looks around the room, then moves over to a baby grand piano with a sleazy Spanish shawl dangling down one side and two cabinet photographs standing in a staggered position on top. Neff glances them over: Mr. Dietrichson, age about fifty-one, a big, blocky man with glasses and a Rotarian look about him; Lola Dietrichson, age nineteen, wearing a filmy party dress and a yearning look in her pretty eyes. Neff walks away from the piano and takes a few steps back and forth across the rug. His eyes fall on a wrinkled corner. He carefully straightens it out with his foot. His back is to the archway as he hears high heels clicking on the staircase. He turns and looks through the arch.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The living room was still stuffy from last night's cigars. The windows were closed and the sunshine coming in through the Venetian blinds showed up the dust in the air. The furniture was kind of corny and old-fashioned, but it had a comfortable look, as if people really sat in it. On the piano, in couple of fancy frames, were Mr. Dietrichson and Lola, his daughter by his first wife They had a bowl of those little red goldfish on the table behind the davenport, but, to tell you the truth, Keyes, I wasn't a whole lot interested in goldfish right then, nor in auto renewals, nor in Mr. Dietrichson and his daughter Lola. I was thinking about that dame upstairs, and the way she had looked at me, and I wanted to see her again, close, without that silly staircase between us.

She was playing me -- with a deck of marked cards -- and the stakes weren't any blue and yellow chips. They were dynamite. I went back to the office that afternoon to see if I had any mail.

KEYES: OFFICE - (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A minor executive office, not too tidy: large desk across one corner, good carpet, several chairs, filing cabinet against one wall, a dictaphone on the corner of the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keyes is sitting behind the desk with his coat off but his hat on. A cigar is clamped in his mouth, ashes falling like snow down his vest, a gold chair and elk's tooth across it. On the other side of the desk sits Sam Gorlopis. He is a big, dumb bruiser, six feet three inches tall -- a dirty work shirt and corduroy pants, rough, untidy hair, broad face, small piggish eyes. He holds a sweat-soaked hat on his knee with a hairy hand. He is chewing gum rapidly. As Neff opens the door, Keyes is giving it to Gorlopis.
</DIRECTION>
<KEYES>

<KEYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Gorlopis. Now listen here. Let's say you just came up here to tell me how to make meat loaf. That's all, understand? Because if you came up here to claim on that truck, I'd have to turn you over to the law, Gorlopis, and they'd put you in jail. No wife. No kids --

	</DIALOGUE>

(He speaks as if to a child)

He pounds the pit of his stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<KEYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every time one of those phonies comes along he ties knots in my stomach. And yours was one of them, Gorlopis. That's how I knew your claim was crooked. So what did I do? I sent a tow car out to your garage this afternoon and they jacked up that burned-out truck of yours. And what did they find, Gorlopis? They found what was left of a pile of shavings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEYES>
<GORLOPIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What shavings?

</GORLOPIS>

	That's one way of putting it.

He puts a blank form in front of him and points.
</DIRECTION>
<KEYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right there. It's a waiver on your claim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEYES>
<DIRECTION>
Gorlopis hesitates, then signs laboriously.
</DIRECTION>
<KEYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you're an honest man again.

He goes out, closing the door after him. Keyes takes his cigar stub from his mouth and turns it slowly in the flame of a lighted match. He turns to Neff.
</DIRECTION>
<KEYES>

	</DIALOGUE>

<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute, Keyes. I don't rate this beef. I clipped a note to that Gorlopis application to have him thoroughly investigated before we accepted the risk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<KEYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you did, Walter. I'm not beefing at you. It's the company. The way they do things. The way they don't do things. The way they'll write anything just to get it down on the sales sheet. And I'm the guy that has to sit here up to my neck in phony claims so they won't throw more money out of the window than they take in at the door.

<KEYES>

	I get darn sick of picking up after a gang of fast-talking salesmen dumb enough to sell life insurance to a guy that sleeps in the same bed with four rattlesnakes. I've had twenty- six years of that, Walter, and I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEYES>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you loved every minute of it, Keyes. You love it, only you worry about it too much, you and your little man. You're so darn conscientious you're driving yourself crazy. You wouldn't even say today is Tuesday without you looked at the calendar, and then you would check if it was this year's or last year's calendar, and then you would find out what company printed the calendar, then find out if their calendar checks with the World Almanac's calendar.
	</DIALOGUE>

	That's enough from you, Walter. Get out of here before I throw my desk at you.

Back in my office there was a phone message from Mrs. Dietrichson about the renewals. She didn't want me to come tomorrow evening. She wanted me to come Thursday afternoon at three-thirty instead. I had a lot of stuff lined up for that Thursday afternoon, including a trip down to Santa Monica to see a couple of live prospects about some group insurance.

</PHYLLIS>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's that again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That would make it easier for you, too. You wouldn't even have to talk to him. I have a little allowance of my own. I could pay for it and he needn't know anything about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. Why shouldn't he know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I know he doesn't want accident insurance. He's superstitious about it.

<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A lot of people are. Funny, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>

	If there was a way to get it like that, all the worry would be over. You see what I mean, Walter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. I've got good eyesight. You want him to have the policy without him knowing it. And that means without the insurance company knowing that he doesn't know. That's the set-up, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there anything wrong with it?

<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What crown block?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>

	I don't know what you're talking about.

	Of course, it doesn't have to be a crown block. It can be a car backing over him, or he can fall out of an upstairs window. Any little thing like that, as long as it's a morgue job.

I stopped at a drive-in for a bottle of beer, the one I had wanted all along, only I wanted it worse now, to get rid of the sour taste of her iced tea, and everything that went with it. I didn't want to go back to the office, so I dropped by a bowling alley at Third and Western and rolled a few lines to get my mind thinking about something else for a while.

Neff stands by the window with his coat off and his tie loose. Raindrops strike against the glass. He turns away impatiently, paces up and down past a caddy bag with golf clubs in it, pulls one out at random, makes a couple of short swings, throws the club on the couch, paces again.

<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, he had. And I wanted a home. Why not? But that wasn't the only reason. I was his wife's nurse. She was sick for a long time. When she died, he was all broken up. I pitied him so.

	<DIALOGUE>
	And now you hate him.

	Yes, Walter. He's so mean to me. Every-time I buy a dress or a pair of shoes he yells his head off. He won't let me go anywhere. He keeps me shut up. He's always been mean to me. Even his life insurance all goes to that daughter of his. That Lola.

<PHYLLIS>

	The other night we drove home from a party. He was drunk again. When we got into the garage he just sat there with his head on the steering wheel and the motor still running. And I thought what it would be like if I didn't switch it off, just closed the garage door and left him there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you what it would be like, if you had that accident policy, and tried to pull a monoxide job. We have a guy in our office named Keyes. For him a set-up like that would be just like a slice of rare roast beef. In three minutes he'd know it wasn't an accident. In ten minutes you'd be sitting under the hot lights. In half an hour you'd be signing your name to a confession.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Walter, I didn't do it. I'm not going to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not if there's an insurance company in the picture, baby. So long as you're honest they'll pay you with a smile, but you just try to pull something like that and you'll find out. They know more tricks than a carload of monkeys. And if there's a death mixed up in it, you haven't got a prayer. They'll hang you as sure as ten dimes will buy a dollar, baby.

<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we just sat there, and she kept on crying softly, like the rain on the window, and we didn't say anything. Maybe she had stopped thinking about it, but I hadn't. I couldn't. Because it all tied up with something I had been thinking about for years, since long before I ever ran into Phyllis Dietrichson. Because, in this business you can't sleep for trying to figure out the tricks they could pull on you. You're like the guy behind the roulette wheel, watching the customers to make sure they don't crook the house. And then one night, you get to thinking how you could crook the house yourself. And do it smart. Because you've got that wheel right under your hands. And you know every notch in it by heart. And you figure all you need is a plant out in front, a shill to put down the bet. And suddenly the doorbell rings and the whole set-up is right there in the room with you... Look, Keyes, I'm not trying to whitewash myself. I fought it, only maybe I didn't fight it hard enough. The stakes were fifty thousand dollars, but they were the life of a man, too, a man who'd never done me any dirt. Except he was married to a woman he didn't care anything about, and I did...

<DIRECTION>
She goes quietly. He watches her down the corridor. Slowly he closes the door and goes back into the room. He moves across the window and opens it wide. He stands there, looking down into the dark street. From below comes the sound of a car starting and driving off. The rain drifts in against his face. He just stands there motionless. His mind is going a hundred miles a minute.

INT. NEFF'S OFFICE - (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neff sits slumped in his chair before the dictaphone. On the desk next to him stands a used record. The cylinder on the dictaphone is not turning. He is smoking a cigarette. He kills it then lifts the needle and slides off the record which is on the machine and stands it on end on the desk beside the other used record. He reaches down painfully to take another record from the rack beneath the dictaphone, looks at it against the light to make sure it has not been used, then slides it into place on the machine and resets the needle. He lifts the horn and resumes his dictation.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first thing we had to do was fix him up with that accident policy. I knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted was his signature on an application. So I had to make him sign without his knowing what he was signing. And I wanted a witness other than Phyllis to hear me give him a sales talk. I was trying to think with your brains, Keyes. I wanted all the answers ready for all the questions you were going to spring as soon as Dietrichson was dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Neff takes a last drag on his cigarette and kills it by running it under the ledge of the dictaphone stand. He drops the stub on the floor and resumes.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A couple of nights later I went to the house. Everything looked fine, except I didn't like the witness Phyllis had brought in. It was Dietrichson's daughter Lola, and it made me feel a little queer in the belly to have her right there in the room, playing Chinese checkers, as if nothing was going to happen.

A BOARD OF CHINESE CHECKERS CAMERA WITHDRAWS AND GRADUALLY REVEALS THE DIETRICHSON LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The checker-board is on the davenport between Phyllis and Lola. Mr. Dietrichson sits in a big easy chair. His coat and tie are over the back of the chair, and the evening paper is lying tumbled on the floor beside him. He is smoking a cigar with the band on it. He has a drink in front of him and several more inside him. In another chair sits Neff, his briefcase on the floor, leaning against his chair. He holds his rate book partly open, with a finger in it for a marker. He is going full swing.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose you realize, Mr. Dietrichson, that, not being an employee, you are not covered by the State Compensation Insurance Act. The only way you can protect yourself is by having a personal policy of your own.

	I know all about that. The next thing you'll tell me I need earthquake insurance and lightning insurance and hail insurance.

Phyllis enters through the living room archway with Neff behind her. She leads him towards the door. On the way he picks up his hat. In the BACKGROUND Dietrichson begins to ascend the stairs, carrying his coat and glass. Phyllis and Neff move close to the door. They speak in very low voices.

</PHYLLIS>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, baby. There's a clause in every accident policy, a little something called double indemnity. The insurance companies put it in as a sort of come-on for the customers. It means they pay double on certain accidents. The kind that almost never happen. Like for instance if a guy got killed on a train, they'd pay a hundred thousand instead of fifty.

Besides, I had other problems to work out. There were plans to make, and Phyllis had to be in on them...

	A desk job. Is that all you can see in it? Just a hard chair to park your pants on from nine to five. Just a pile of papers to shuffle around, and five sharp pencils and a scratch pad to make figures on, with maybe a little doodling on the side. That's not the way I see it, Walter. To me a claims man is a surgeon, and that desk is an operating table, and those pencils are scalpels and bone chisels. And those papers are not just forms and statistics and claims for compensation. They're alive, they're packed with drama, with twisted hopes and crooked dreams. A claims man, Walter, is a doctor and a blood-hound and a cop and a judge and a jury and a father confessor, all in one.

	That was it, Keyes, and there was no use kidding myself any more. Those fates I was talking about had only been stalling me off. Now they had thrown the switch. The gears had meshed. The machinery had started to move and nothing could stop it. The time for thinking had all run out. From here on it was a question of following the time table, move by move, just as we had it rehearsed. I wanted my time all accounted for for the rest of the afternoon and up to the last possible moment in the evening. So I arranged to call on a prospect in Pasadena about a public liability bond. When I left the office I put my rate book on the desk as if I had forgotten it. That was part of the alibi.

Phyllis leans back. They stare at each other desperately. After a moment Neff bends forward slowly and turns the ignition key to the OFF position.

Neff twists the ignition key to ON and instantly pulls the hand-throttle wide open. With a last feeble kick of the starter, the motor catches and races.

Neff comes out at the top of the ramp and starts to walk down the street, not too fast. CAMERA PRECEDES HIM. He walks about ten or fifteen yards. At first his steps sound hard and distinct on the sidewalk and echo in the deserted street. But slowly, as he goes on, they fade into utter silence. He walks a few feet without sound, then becomes aware of the silence. He stops rigidly and looks back. CAMERA STOPS WITH HIM. He stands like that for a moment, then turns toward the CAMERA again. There is a look of horror on his face now. He walks on, CAMERA AHEAD OF HIM again. Still his steps make no sound.

	That was all there was to it. Nothing had slipped, nothing had been overlooked, there was nothing to give us away. And yet, Keyes, as I was walking down the street to the drug store, suddenly it came over me that everything would go wrong. It sounds crazy, Keyes, but it's true, so help me: I couldn't hear my own footsteps. It was the walk of a dead man.

Neff sits before the dictaphone. There are four cylinders on end on the desk next to him. He gets up from the swivel chair with great effort and stands a moment unsteadily. The wound in his shoulder is paining him. He is very weak as he slowly crosses to the water cooler. He takes the blood stained handkerchief from inside his shirt and soaks it with fresh water.

The office door opens behind him. He turns, hiding the handkerchief behind his back. In the doorway stands the colored man who has been cleaning up downstairs. He is carrying his big trash box by a rope handle.

	That was the longest night I ever lived through, Keyes, and the next day was worse, when the story broke in the papers, and they were talking about it at the office, and the day after that when you started digging into it. I kept my hands in my pockets because I thought they were shaking, and I put on dark glasses so people couldn't see my eyes, and then I took them off again so people wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them.

Phyllis nods silently.

</NORTON>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What sort of things?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NORTON>

<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes meet for a fraction of a second.
</DIRECTION>
<NORTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had your husband been moody or depressed lately, Mrs. Dietrichson? Did he seem to have financial worries, for instance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORTON>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was perfectly all right and I don't know of any financial worries.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NORTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There must have been something, Mrs. Dietrichson. Let us examine this so- called accident. First, your husband takes out this policy in absolute secrecy. Why? Because he doesn't want his family to suspect what he intends to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORTON>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NORTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Commit suicide. Next, he goes on this trip entirely alone. He has to be alone. He hobbles all the way out to the observation platform, very unlikely with his leg in a cast, unless he has a very strong reason. Once there, he finds he is not alone. There is a man there. What was his name, Keyes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORTON>
<DIRECTION>
Norton flips his fingers impatiently at Keyes who doesn't even bother to look up.
</DIRECTION>
<KEYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His name was Jackson. Probably still is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEYES>
<NORTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jackson. So your husband gets rid of this Jackson with some flimsy excuse about cigars. And then he is alone. And then he does it. He jumps. Suicide. In which case the company is not liable.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know that, of course. We could go to court --
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORTON>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know anything. In fact I don't know why I came here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<DIRECTION>
She makes as if to rise indignantly.
</DIRECTION>
<NORTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a moment, please. I said we could go to court. I didn't say we want to. Not only is it against our practice, but it would involve a great deal of expense, a lot of lawyers, a lot of time, perhaps years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORTON>
<DIRECTION>
Phyllis rises coldly.
</DIRECTION>
<NORTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what I want to suggest is a compromise on both sides. A settlement for a certain sum, a part of the policy value --
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORTON>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't bother, Mr. Norton. When I came in here I had no idea you owed me any money. You told me you did. Then you told me you didn't. Now you tell me you want to pay me a part of it, whatever it is. You want to bargain with me, at a time like this. I don't like your insinuations about my husband, Mr. Norton, and I don't like your methods. In fact I don't like you, Mr. Norton. Goodbye, gentlemen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and walks out. The door closes after her. There is a pregnant pause. Keyes straightens up in his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<KEYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice going, Mr. Norton. You sure carried that ball.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEYES>
<DIRECTION>
Norton pours himself a glass of water and stands holding it.
</DIRECTION>
<KEYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only you fumbled on the goal line. Then you heaved an illegal forward pass and got thrown for a forty-yard loss. Now you can't pick yourself up because you haven't got a leg to stand on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEYES>
<NORTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't eh? Let her claim. Let her sue. We can prove it was suicide.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORTON>
<DIRECTION>
Keyes stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<KEYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we? Mr. Norton, the first thing that hit me was that suicide angle. Only I dropped it in the wastepaper basket just three seconds later. You ought to take a look at the statistics on suicide sometime. You might learn a little something about the insurance business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEYES>
<NORTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was raised in the insurance business, Mr. Keyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORTON>
<KEYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. In the front office. Come on, you never read an actuarial table in your life. I've got ten volumes on suicide alone. Suicide by race, by color, by occupation, by sex, by seasons of the year, by time of day. Suicide, how committed: by poisons, by fire-arms, by drowning, by leaps. Suicide by poison, subdivided by types of poison, such as corrosive, irritant, systemic, gaseous, narcotic, alkaloid, protein, and so forth. Suicide by leaps, subdivided by leaps from high places, under wheels of trains, under wheels of trucks, under the feet of horses, from steamboats. But Mr. Norton, of all the cases on record there's not one single case of suicide by leap from the rear end of a moving train. And do you know how fast that train was going at the point where the body was found? Fifteen miles an hour. Now how could anybody jump off a slow moving train like that with any kind of expectation that he would kill himself? No soap, Mr. Norton. We're sunk, and we're going to pay through the nose, and you know it. May I have this?

Keyes' throat is dry after the long speech. He grabs the glass of water out of Norton's hand and drains it in one big gulp.
</DIRECTION>

Norton is watching him almost stupefied. Neff stands with the shadow of a smile on his face. Keyes puts the glass down noisily on Norton's desk.

He hangs up, takes off his hat and drops hat and briefcase on the davenport. He looks around the room and crosses to lower the venetian blinds and draw the curtains. He gathers up the morning paper which is lying untidily on the floor and puts it in the waste-paper basket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door bell rings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neff stops in sudden alarm. It can't be Phyllis. The time is too short. For a second he stands there motionless, then crosses to the door and opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the open door stands Keyes.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Keyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Keyes walks past him into the room. His hands are clasped behind his back. There is a strange, absent-minded look in his eyes. Neff closes the door without taking his eyes off Keyes.

<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>

He prods his stomach with his thumb.

	The little man is acting up again. Because there's something wrong with that Dietrichson case.

He has stopped in front of Neff. They look at each other for a tense moment. Neff hardly breathes.

Keyes shakes his head suddenly.

	Listen, Walter. I've been living with this little man for twenty-six years. He's never failed me yet. There's got to be something wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEYES>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe Norton was right. Maybe it was suicide, Keyes.

	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<DIRECTION>
There is another longer pause, agonizing for Neff. Finally Keyes continues:
</DIRECTION>
<KEYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. A man takes out an accident policy that is worth a hundred thousand dollars if he is killed on a train. Then, two weeks later, he is killed on a train. And not in a train accident, mind you, but falling off some silly observation car. Do you know what the mathematical probability of that is, Walter? One out of I don't know how many billions. And add to that the broken leg. It just can't be the way it looks, Walter. Something has been worked on us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEYES>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Such as what?
	</DIALOGUE>

Keyes doesn't answer. He goes on pacing up and down. Finally Neff can't stand the silence any longer.

The hallway is empty except for Phyllis who has been standing close to the door of Neff's apartment, listening. The door has just started to open. Phyllis moves away quickly and flattens herself against the wall behind the opening door. Keyes is coming out.
</DIRECTION>
<KEYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night, Walter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEYES>
<DIRECTION>
Neff, behind him, looks anxiously down the hallway for Phyllis. Suddenly his eye catches a glimpse of her through the crack of the partly opened door. He pushes the door wide so as to hide her from Keyes.

<NEFF>

	Good night, Keyes.

He has reached the elevator. He pushes the call button and turns.
</DIRECTION>
<KEYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'd like to move in on her right now, tonight, if it wasn't for Norton and his stripe-pants ideas about company policy. I'd have the cops after her so quick her head would spin. They'd put her through the wringer, and, brother, what they would squeeze out.

	Not too much. Twenty-six years experience, all the percentage there is, and this lump of concrete in my stomach.

He pulls back the elevator door and turns to Neff with one last glance of annoyance.

Keyes gets into the elevator. The door closes. The elevator goes down.

Neff stands numb, looking at the spot where Keyes was last visible. Without moving his eyes he pulls the door around towards him with his left hand. Phyllis slowly comes out.

Neff motions quickly to her to go into the apartment. She crosses in front of him and enters. He steps in backwards after her.

	Until all this dies down. You don't know Keyes the way I do. Once he gets his teeth into something he won't let go. He'll investigate you. He'll have you shadowed. He'll watch you every minute from now on. Are you afraid, baby?

</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I'm afraid. But not of Keyes. I'm afraid of us. We're not the same any more. We did it so we could be together, but instead of that it's pulling us apart. Isn't it, Walter?

<LOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were up at Lake Arrowhead. That was six years ago. We had a cabin there. It was winter and very cold and my mother was very sick with pneumonia. She had a nurse with her. There were just the three of us in the cabin. One night I got up and went into my mother's room. She was delirious with fever. All the bed covers were on the floor and the windows were wide open. The nurse wasn't in the room. I ran and covered my mother up as quickly as I could. Just then I heard a door open behind me. The nurse stood there. She didn't say a word, but there was a look in her eyes I'll never forget. Two days later my mother was dead.

<LOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Phyllis. I tried to tell my father, but I was just a kid then and he wouldn't listen to me. Six months later she married him and I kind of talked myself out of the idea that she could have done anything like that. But now it's all back again, now that something has happened to my father, too.

	Yes, and two days before he fell off that train what was Phyllis doing? She was in her room in front of a mirror, with a black hat on, and she was pinning a black veil to it, as if she couldn't wait to see how she would look in mourning.

	No, he wasn't, Walter. Look, you can't be sure of killing a man by throwing him off a train that's going fifteen miles an hour. The only way you can be sure is to kill him first and then throw his body on the tracks. That would mean either killing him on the train, or -- and this is where it really gets fancy -- you kill him somewhere else and put him on the tracks. Two possibilities, and I personally buy the second.

	Look, it was like this. They killed the guy -- the wife and somebody else -- and then the somebody else took the crutches and went on the train as Dietrichson, and then the somebody else jumped off, and then they put the body on the tracks where the train had passed. An impersonation, see. And a cinch to work. Because it was night, very few people were about, they had the crutches to stare at, and they never really looked at the man at all.

	There it is, Walter. It's beginning to come apart at the seams already. A murder's never perfect. It always comes apart sooner or later. And when two people are involved it's usually sooner. We know the Dietrichson dame is in it, and somebody else. Pretty soon we're going to know who that somebody else is. He'll show. He's got to show. Sometime, somewhere, they've got to meet. Their emotions are all kicked up. Whether it's love or hate doesn't matter. They can't keep away from each other. They think it's twice as safe because there are two of them. But it's not twice as safe. It's ten times twice as dangerous. They've committed a murder and that's not like taking a trolley ride together where each one can get off at a different stop. They're stuck with each other. They've got to ride all the way to the end of the line. And it's a one-way trip, and the last stop is the cemetery.

Dead, I mean, and how things would be if she was dead. Because the way it was now she had me by the throat. She could hang me higher than a kite any day she felt like it. And there was nothing I could do, except hold my breath and watch that day come closer and closer, and maybe pray a little, if I still knew how to pray... I saw Lola three or four times that week.

This man has been observed to visit the Dietrichson home on the night of July 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th. We have succeeded in identifying him as one Nino Zachetti, former medical student, aged twenty-eight, residing at Lilac Court Apartments 1228½ N. La Brea Avenue. We have checked Zachetti's movements on the night of the crime and have found that they cannot be accounted for. I am preparing a more detailed report for your consideration and it is my belief that we already have sufficient evidence against Zachetti and Mrs. Dietrichson to justify police action. I strongly urge that this whole matter be turned over to the office of the District Attorney. Respectfully, Barton Keyes.

Neff sits, staring blankly at the wall. The cylinder goes on revolving, but no more voice comes -- only the whir of the needle on the empty record. At last he remembers to replace the horn. He hangs it back on its hook. The machine stops. Neff gets up from the chair, walks slowly to the door and goes out.

12TH FLOOR, BALCONY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neff has just come out of Keyes' office. He walks slowly back towards the reception room entrance, then stands there looking out through the glass doors. All the employees have now left. Neff is entirely alone. He moves as if to go out, then stops rigidly as his face lights up with excitement of a sudden idea. He turns quickly and walks on to his own office and enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEFF'S OFFICE (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neff walks across to his desk, lifts the telephone and dials a number. (During the ensuing telephone conversation, only what he says is heard. The pauses indicate speeches at the other end of the line).
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Phyllis? Walter. I've got to see you... Tonight... Yes, it has to be tonight... How's eleven o'clock? Don't worry about Keyes. He's satisfied... Leave the door on the latch and put the lights out. No, nobody's watching the house... I told you Keyes is satisfied. It's just for the neighbors... That's what I said. Yeah. Eleven o'clock. Goodbye, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Neff hangs up and stands beside the desk with a grim expression on his face, takes a handkerchief out and wipes perspiration from his forehead and the palms of his hands. The gesture has a symbolic quality, as if he were trying to wipe away the murder. Over his face comes the commentary.

	I guess I don't have to tell you what I was going to do at eleven o'clock, Keyes. For the first time I saw a way to get clear of the whole mess I was in, and of Phyllis, too, all at the same time. Yeah, that's what I thought. But what I didn't know was that she was all set for me. That she had outsmarted me again, just like she always had...

HALL STAIRWAY OF DIETRICHSON HOME (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights are turned on. Phyllis is coming down the stairs. She wears white lounging pajamas, and she is carrying something small and heavy concealed in a scarf in her right hand. She reaches the front door, opens it slightly, fixes the catch so that the door can be opened from outside. She switches off the porch light and the hall light. She moves towards the living room, where there is still light on.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was all set and waiting for me. It could have been something in my voice when I called her up that tipped her off. And it could have been that she had the idea already. And an idea wasn't the only thing she had waiting for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the long table behind the davenport, one of the lamps is lit. The only other light in the room is a standing lamp beside the desk. A window toward the back is open, and through it comes the SOUNDS OF MUSIC, probably a neighboring radio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phyllis enters and crosses to the table. She puts out the lamp, then moves over to the desk and puts out the lamp there. The room is filled with bright moonlight coming in at the windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phyllis crosses to the chair by the fireplace (the one she sat in the first time Neff came to the house). She lifts the loose cushion and puts what was in the scarf behind it. As she withdraws the scarf, there is a brief glint of something metallic before she covers the hidden object with the cushion again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to the low table in front of the davenport and takes a cigarette from the box. She takes a match and is about to strike it when, just then, she hears a car coming up the hill. She listens, motionless. The car stops. A car door is slammed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Calmly, Phyllis strikes the match and lights her cigarette. She drops the match casually into a tray, goes back to the chair, sits down and waits, quietly smoking. There are footsteps outside the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over the chair in which Phyllis is sitting, the hallway is visible through the arch. The front door opens. Neff comes in, he is silhouetted against the moonlight as he stands there. He closes the door again.

<DIRECTION>
Neff sits down on the arm of the davenport, close to her.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like the first time I was here. We were talking about automobile insurance. Only you were thinking about murder. And I was thinking about that anklet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what are you thinking about now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm all through thinking. This is goodbye.

</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye? Where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's you that's going, baby. Not me. I'm getting off the trolley car right at this corner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suppose you stop being fancy. Let's have it, whatever it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a friend who's got a funny theory. He says when two people commit a murder they're kind of on a trolley car, and one can't get off without the other. They're stuck with each other. They have to go on riding clear to the end of the line. And the last stop is the cemetery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe he's got something there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bet he has, Two people are going to ride to the end of the line, all right. Only I'm not going to be one of them. I've got another guy to finish my ride for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you've got it all arranged, Walter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You arranged it for me. I didn't have to do a thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just who are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An acquaintance of yours. A Mr. Zachetti. Come on, baby, I just got into this because I knew a little something about insurance, didn't I? I was just a sucker. I'd have been brushed-off as soon as you got your hands on the money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Save it. I'm telling this. It's been you and that Zachetti guy all along, hasn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't make any difference whether it's true or not. The point is Keyes believes Zachetti is the guy he's been looking for. He'll have him in that gas chamber before he knows what happened to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what's happening to me all this time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be silly. What do you expect to happen to you? You helped him do the murder, didn't you? That's what Keyes thinks. And what's good enough for Keyes is good enough for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's not good enough for me. Walter. Maybe I don't go for the idea. Maybe I'd rather talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes people are where they can't talk. Under six feet of dirt, for instance. And if it was you, they'd just charge it up to Zachetti, wouldn't they. One more item on his account. Sure they would. That's just what they're going to do. Especially since he's coming here, tonight... Oh, in about fifteen minutes from now, baby. With the cops right behind him. It's all taken care of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that'd make everything lovely for you, wouldn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. And it's got to be done before that suit of yours comes to trial, and Lola gets a chance to sound off, and they trip you up on the stand, and you start to fold up and drag me down with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Walter. Maybe I had Zachetti here so they won't get a chance to trip me up. So we can get that money and be together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's cute. Say it again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He came here the first time just to ask where Lola was. I made him come back. I was working on him. He's crazy sort of guy, quick-tempered. I kept hammering into him that she was with another man, so he'd get into one of his jealous rages, and then I'd tell him where she was. And you know what he'd have done to her, don't you, Walter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, and for once I believe you. Because it's just rotten enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're both rotten, Walter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only you're just a little more rotten. You're rotten clear through. You got me to take care of your husband, and then you got Zachetti to take care of Lola, and maybe take care of me too, and then somebody else would have come along to take care of Zachetti for you. That's the way you operate isn't it, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suppose it is, Walter. Is what you've cooked up for tonight any better?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<DIRECTION>
Neff gets up from the davenport. He listens to the music for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like this music anymore. It's too close. Do you mind if I shut the window?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Phyllis just stares at him. He goes quietly over to the window and shuts it and draws the curtain. Phyllis speaks to his back:
</DIRECTION>
<PHYLLIS>
<DIRECTION>
(Her voice low and urgent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<DIRECTION>
Neff turns, something changes in his face. There is the report of a gun. He stands motionless for a moment, then very slowly starts towards her. CAMERA IS SHOOTING OVER HIS SHOULDER at Phyllis as she stands with the gun in her hand. Neff stops after he has taken a few steps.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter? Why don't you shoot again? Maybe if I came a little closer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Neff takes a few more steps towards her and stops again.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's that. Do you think you can do it now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Phyllis is silent. She doesn't shoot. Her expression is tortured. Neff goes on until he is close to her. Quietly he takes the gun out of her unresisting hand.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you shoot, baby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Phyllis puts her arms around him in complete surrender.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell me it's because you've been in love with me all this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I never loved you, Walter. Not you, or anybody else. I'm rotten to the heart. I used you, just as you said. That's all you ever meant to me -- until a minute ago. I didn't think anything like that could ever happen to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, baby. I'm not buying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<PHYLLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not asking you to buy. Just hold me close.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYLLIS>
<DIRECTION>
Neff draws her close to him. She reaches up to his face and kisses him on the lips. As she comes out of the kiss there is realization in her eyes that this is the final moment.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Out of the shot the gun explodes once, twice. Phyllis quivers in his arms. Her eyes fill with tears. Her head falls limp against his shoulder. Slowly he lifts her and carries her to the davenport. He lays her down on it carefully, almost tenderly. The moonlight coming in at the French doors shines on the anklet. He looks at it for the last time and slowly turns away. As he does so, he puts his hand inside his coat and it comes out with blood on it. Only then is it apparent that Phyllis' shot actually did hit him. He looks at the blood on his fingers with a dazed expression and quickly goes out of the room, the way he came.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DIETRICHSON HOME - (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neff comes out of the house. He closes the front door with his right hand. His left arm hangs limp. He takes a few steps down the walk, then suddenly hears somebody approaching. He moves behind the palm tree near the walk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man comes up the steps towards the front door -- Zachetti. Just as he reaches the door, Neff calls to him.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey you. Come here a minute. I said come here, Zachetti.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>

Zachetti turns and approaches him slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The name is Neff.

</NEFF>
<ZACHETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? And I still don't like it. What do you want?

</ZACHETTI>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, kid, I want to give you a present.

He takes some loose change out of his pocket and holds out a coin.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's a nice new nickel.

<ZACHETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ZACHETTI>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suppose you go back down the hill to a drug store and make a phone call.

</NEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Neff starts to drop the nickel into Zachetti's handkerchief pocket. Zachetti knocks his hand away.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACHETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep your nickel and buy yourself an ice cream cone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACHETTI>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The number is Granite 0386. Ask for Miss Dietrichson. The first name is Lola.

<ZACHETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lola? She isn't worth a nickel. And if I ever talk to her, it's not going to be over any telephone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACHETTI>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tough, aren't you? Take the nickel. Take it and call her. She wants you to.

<ZACHETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? She doesn't want any part of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACHETTI>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know who told you that, and it's not true. She's in love with you. Always has been. Don't ask me why. I couldn't even guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Zachetti just stares at him. Neff moves again to put the nickel into Zachetti's pocket. This time Zachetti allows him to do it.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now beat it. Granite 0386, I told you.

He motions toward the street below.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Zachetti goes slowly past him. Neff grabs him and pushes him almost violently down the walk. Zachetti goes out of shot. The sound of his steps dies away as Neff looks after him. Then, far off in the distance, the SIREN OF A POLICE CAR is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neff moves off through the shrubbery toward the side of the house where he parked his car.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The desk lamp is still lighted. Outside the windows, the dawn is slowly breaking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neff is still clutching the horn of the dictaphone. There are eight or nine used cylinders on the desk beside him. A widening stain of blood shows on the left shoulder of his gray jacket. He is very weak by now, and his voice holds a note of utter exhaustion.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's almost four-thirty now, Keyes. It's cold. I wonder if she's still lying there alone in that house, or whether they've found her by now. I wonder a lot of things, but they don't matter any more, except I want to ask you to do me a favor. I want you to be the one to tell Lola, kind of gently, before it breaks wide open... Yes, and I'd like you to look after her and that guy Zachetti, so he doesn't get pushed around too much. Because...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he stops his dictation with an instinctive feeling that he is not alone in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he turns in his chair the CAMERA PULLS BACK slowly. The office door is wide open. Keyes is standing a few steps inside it. Behind him, on the balcony outside, stands the night watchman and the colored janitor, peering curiously into the room over Keyes' shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, and without taking his eyes off Neff's face, Keyes reaches back and pushes the door shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neff hangs up the dictaphone horn. He looks at Keyes with a faint, tired grin and speaks very slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Keyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Keyes moves towards him a few steps and stands without answering.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up pretty early, aren't you? I always wondered what time you got down to work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Keyes, staring at him, still does not answer.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or did your little man pull you out of bed?

Neff makes a motion indicating the used cylinders standing on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted to straighten out that Dietrichson story for you.

</NEFF>
<KEYES>

<KEYES>
	<DIALOGUE>

	You can't figure them all, Walter.

</KEYES>
<NEFF>

	That's right. You can't, can you? And now I suppose I get the big speech, the one with all the two- dollar words in it. Let's have it, Keyes.

</NEFF>
<KEYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're all washed up, Walter.

<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Keyes. That was short anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>

They stare at each other for a long moment, then, with intense effort Neff gets up on his feet and stands there swaying a little. His face is covered with sweat. His shoulder is bleeding. He is on the verge of collapse.

</NEFF>
<KEYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something like that, Walter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEYES>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I've got a different idea. Look here. Suppose you went back to bed and didn't find these cylinders till tomorrow morning, when the office opens. From then on you can play it any way you like. Would you do that much for me, Keyes?

<KEYES>

Neff starts to move towards the door, staggering a little, holding himself upright with great effort.
</DIRECTION>
<KEYES>
<DIRECTION>
(In a voice of stony calm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll never even make the elevator.

Neff has reached the door. He twists the knob and drags the door open. He turns in it to look back at Keyes' implacable face.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So long, Keyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Neff goes out, leaving the door wide open. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS his staggering walk along the BALCONY TOWARDS THE ELEVATOR LOBBY. The sound of his breathing is so harsh and loud that for a moment it dominates the scene. Finally he reaches the swing doors leading into the lobby and starts to push them open. At this moment he collapses. He clutches the edge of the door and as it swings around with him he falls to the floor. He tries to struggle up but cannot rise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In background comes the sound of a telephone being dialed.
</DIRECTION>
<KEYES_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello... Send an ambulance to the Pacific Building on Olive Street... Yeah... It's a police job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEYES_VOICE>

There is the sound of the phone being replaced in its cradle. Then there are footsteps growing louder along the balcony and Keyes walks slowly into the shot. He kneels down beside Neff.
</DIRECTION>
<KEYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How you doing, Walter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEYES>

Neff manages a faint smile.

(Slowly and with great difficulty)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know why you didn't figure this one, Keyes? Let me tell you. The guy you were looking for was too close. He was right across the desk from you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<KEYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Closer than that, Walter.

Neff fumbles for the handkerchief in Keyes' pocket, pulls it out and clumsily wipes his face with it. The handkerchief drops from his hand. He gets a loose cigarette out of his pocket and puts it between his lips. Then with great difficulty he gets out a match, tries to strike it, but is too weak. Keyes takes the match out of his hand, strikes it for him and lights his cigarette.

<NEFF>

(Slowly and with great difficulty)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know why you didn't figure this one, Keyes? Let me tell you. The guy you were looking for was too close. He was right across the desk from you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<KEYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Closer than that, Walter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEYES>
<DIRECTION>
The eyes of the two men meet in a moment of silence.

<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you too.

Neff fumbles for the handkerchief in Keyes' pocket, pulls it out and clumsily wipes his face with it. Then, clutching the handkerchief against his shoulder, he speaks to Keyes for the last time.

<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At the end of that... trolley line... just as I get off... you be there... to say goodbye... will you, Keyes?

WITNESS ROOM IN DEATH CHAMBER - SAN QUENTIN (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Showing the witness room and approximately one-half of the gas chamber. BOOM SHOT towards guard standing BACK TO CAMERA at entrance door. Except for this guard the room is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guard opens the door. Two other guards enter, followed by a group of witnesses and newspaper men, each of whom removes his hat as he enters the room. They form a group around the outside of the gas chamber, some looking in through the glass windows, some standing in the background on low platforms against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA SLOWLY BEGINS TO MOVE IN AND DOWN, AND CENTERS ON Keyes, as he enters the room and stands behind the door. His face is seen through the bars of the door, which is then closed, and CAMERA MOVES TO A CLOSEUP. His eyes follow the action of the closing door, then slowly look towards the gas chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GAS CHAMBER, EMPTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On its windows show reflections of the spectators, including the face of Keyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the gas chamber opens in the background, and beyond that another door opens. Neff comes in between two guards. He is wearing a white open-necked shirt, blue denim pants, and walks barefooted on a cocoanut matting. He moves into the gas chamber, looks through the windows in the direction of Keyes and nods quickly, recognizing him. The guards turn him around and seat him in one of the two metal chairs, with his back to the witnesses. They strap his arms, legs and body to the chair. The guards go out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOOR TO THE GAS CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is open. The three guards come out of the gas chamber into the ante-chamber, where stand the warden, executioner, two doctors, the minister and the acid man, and possibly several guards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The executioner and one guard close the door. The guard spins the big wheel which tightens it. The wheel at first turns very quickly, then, as it tightens, the guard uses considerable force to seal the chamber tight. The guard steps out of the shot. The gas chamber is now sealed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WITNESSES AND KEYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are intently watching Neff in the gas chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ANTE-CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The warden looks slowly around the room, sees that everyone is in his proper place and that the stethoscope, which one doctor holds, is connected with the outlet in the wall of the gas chamber. Also that the man in charge of the acid is ready. The warden makes a motion to the acid man. The acid man releases the mixed acid into a pipe connecting with a countersunk receptacle under Neff's chair. (This action is only suggested). The warden looks at the clock, then turns to the executioner and nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE EXECUTIONER - MED. SHOT - CAMERA SHOOTING DOWN FROM HIGH ANGLE TOWARDS EXECUTIONER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes a metal lever. (This immerses the pellets of cyanide in the acid under the chair.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GAS CHAMBER - MED. SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA IS SHOOTING ABOVE Neff's head (just out of shot), towards spectators standing outside the gas chamber, Keyes in the center. Gas floats up into scene between CAMERA and spectators. Keyes, unable to watch, looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FIRST DOCTOR - CLOSE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he listens on stethoscope connected with the gas chamber. He glances at the clock above his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SECOND DOCTOR - CLOSE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands to right of the gas chamber door, taking notes on a pad. He glances towards First Doctor (out of scene) and looks through venetian blinds into the gas chamber. The acid man stands near him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FIRST DOCTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA SHOOTING FROM HIGH ANGLE TOWARDS HIM as he listens on stethoscope. The doctor glances at the clock again. He takes his stethoscope from his ears. He nods to the warden, This indicates that the man is dead. CAMERA PANS with warden as he turns to open the door connecting the ante-chamber with the witness room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WITNESS ROOM - LONG SHOT FROM HIGH ON BOOM DOWN ON WITNESSES GROUPED AROUND GAS CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door connecting with the ante-chamber opens. A guard comes through.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all, gentlemen, Vacate the chamber, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
The guard withdraws and closes the door by which he entered. The witnesses slowly start to file out. A guard has opened the outer door. The witnesses put their hats on as they pass through. A few go close to the windows of the gas chamber to look in at the dead man before they leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the witnesses have now left, except Keyes, who stands, shocked and tragic, beyond the door. The guard goes to him and touches his arm, indicating to him that he must leave. Keyes glances for the last time towards the gas chamber and slowly moves to go out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE DEATH CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA SHOOTING IN THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR AT KEYES, who is just turning to leave. Keyes comes slowly out into the dark, narrow corridor. His hat is on his head now, his overcoat is pulled around him loosely. He walks like an old man. He takes eight or ten steps, then mechanically reaches a cigar out of his vest pocket and puts it in his mouth. His hands, in the now familiar gesture, begin to pat his pockets for matches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he stops, with a look of horror on his face. He stands rigid, pressing a hand against his heart. He takes the cigar out of his mouth and goes slowly on towards the door, CAMERA PANNING with him. When he has almost reached the door, the guard stationed there throws it wide, and a blaze of sunlight comes in from the prison yard outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keyes slowly walks out into the sunshine. stiffly, his head bent, a forlorn and lonely man.
