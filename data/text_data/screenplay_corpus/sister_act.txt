INT. ST. ANNE'S ACADEMY - AKRON, OHIO - CLASSROOM We are in a parochial school classroom, in the late Sixties. The children all wear uniforms and sit at little desks. SISTER IMMACULATA stands at the front of the room; she is a middle-aged nun, very severe. The children are all terrified of her.

INT. GIRLS ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christine is now in the deserted St. Anne's girls room. She is standing on tiptoes, looking in the mirror. She has taken her hair out of its neat barrettes; she is combing it out. She applies lipstick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christine reaches into her schoolbag; she pulls out a stack of glittery bracelets and slips them on. She unbuttons the top few buttons of her stiff white blouse. She sprays herself with dime store cologne.

INT. CHRISTY'S APARTMENT - ANGLE ON A LARGE, TATTERED POSTER-NIGHT (TODAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taped over a crack on a wall. The poster shows a glittering CHRISTY VAN CARTIER: singing star of a fifth- rate Vegas lounge. Christy wears tight spangles and a major wig on the poster. She has clearly lived up, or down, to all of Sister Immaculata's expectations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS through the dark bedroom in which the poster hangs; a neon sign flashes outside the window, casting a red and blue haze over the premises. A dressing room table is cluttered with dozens of bottles of nail polish and makeup, and garish clothing and flashy jewelry are scattered everywhere.

We hear the movement of BED SPRINGS as someone sits up in the dark.

</VINCE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
VINCE LAROCCA stands at the mirror, adjusting his clothing and checking his hair. Vince is a powerful, charismatic man who rules an organized crime empire with personal magnetism and threat. Vince's hold over Christy is obvious, if unfortunate; he can seem expansive and generous one minute, ruthless and dangerous the next.

<DIRECTION>
Vince kisses two fingers, and blows the kiss to Christy. He leaves.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on various neon Vegas landmarks -- the Golden Nugget, Caesar's Palace, Bally's, etc. Scrunched in between two larger hotels and casinos is the MOONLIGHT HOTEL AND CASINO. The Moonlight isn't all that small, it's just seen better days.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A spotlight hits a solitary figure on a small stage. The man is caped and dramatic, but not especially talented; an Elvis impersonator who's just a shade off in voice, looks and style.
</DIRECTION>
<ELVIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Are you lonesome tonight? Welcome to the Moonlight Hotel and Casino's incredible Platinum Oldies Spectacular.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELVIS>

Backstage, there's still a look of resolve in Christy's eye as she waits to go on with MICHELLE and TINA, her back- up singers.

	But you can't quit. What'll happen to us?

Onstage, Elvis glances into the wings to be sure the Ronelles are ready.
</DIRECTION>
<ELVIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please welcome our own girl group extraordinaire, our beehives of beauty -- the fabulous Ronelles!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELVIS>
<DIRECTION>
Elvis disappears. The spotlight hits Christy, who wears a high beehive wig and a sequinned, early Supremes-style gown. Michelle and Tina wear matching gowns and wigs. The band begins a doo-wop vamp.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, girls.

	WISH HE WAS MINE. THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
As they sing, their moves and gestures are carefully choreographed in vintage girl group style.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lot of talent and hard work has clearly gone into the number. While Christy does her best, her singing voice is not on a par with those of the other Ronelles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lounge itself is practically empty, except for a few drunken Shriners and a couple of college kids. POLICE LIEUTENANT EDDIE MULCAHY sits at a ringside table with his eyes locked on Christy. An easygoing charmer, Eddie gives her a wink, but she responds with an up-yours look and a turn to the other half of the room as the song continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small, cramped room with cracked plaster walls and a sputtering fan for ventilation. Christy has her own dressing table and mirror, and the Ronelles share a table a few feet away. Clothing and costumes hang on nails or are draped over chairs as the girls change into street wear.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Screw this dump. It's a roach motel with sequins. Every guy I meet is either married, a cop, or a lush from Des Moines.

	<DIALOGUE>
	But what about us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHELLE>

<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And where did it get me? I'm stuck in this rathole! You're holding me back, just like Vince! I should be headlining!

A pock-faced weasel of a man named JOEY opens the door and leans into the room.

<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want? This is a private area! Get lost!

Joey leaves. Michelle and Tina hover around the box, very excited. They pick it up, trying to tempt Christy.

<MICHELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From Vince! With love!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHELLE>
<TINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michelle and Tina can't restrain themselves: they open the box. Inside is a rather gaudy fur coat. Michelle and Tina are impressed.

<MICHELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a fur!

	Right. I'll be... at the apartment. Call me. Thanks. Again.

<DIRECTION>
Christy reaches for the doorknob, without looking at the door. She fumbles a bit. She finds the door.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mink. Wow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
Christy walks backwards, out the door. She turns; she is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vince -- is she... okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<VINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe.

</DIRECTION>
<WILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLY>
<VINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She did.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(making a decision)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring her back. Now. For a talk.

<DIRECTION>
With guns drawn, Willy and Joey run after Christy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RECEPTION AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy, clearly terrified, is walking quickly away from Vince's office. She passes through a glass door which leads to the cubicle area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT of the cubicle area, which resembles a darkened maze. Christy hears Joey approaching; she runs into the cubicle area.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christy? He only wants to talk to you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Christy, crouched behind a half-wall. She is clutching the coat.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLY>
<DIRECTION>
There is a stuffed toy, a "Garfield the Cat," attached to the wall near Christy, with suction cups. Christy tries to pull the cat's feet off the wall, very quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
Christy finally just yanks the cat off the wall. She hurls it as high and as far as she can, to the opposite end of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on the flying stuffed cat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joey sees the blur of the cat; he SHOOTS it, and the cat explodes.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Christy! There's no place to go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
Christy steadies herself against a Xerox machine. She accidentally activates the machine, which lights up and starts HUMMING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Willy, as he hears the Xerox machine. He quickly moves toward the SOUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willy reaches the Xerox machine; the area is deserted. He starts moving quickly down the aisle A chair, the kind on casters, comes rolling out of one of the cubicle doorways; the chair hits Willy and he falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy runs out of the cubicle; Willy is on the floor, struggling to get up. As Christy sprints away, Willy SHOOTS at her. He misses, but a glass partition SHATTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy runs for an open elevator, but it has been summoned from another floor and the doors are beginning to close. She runs even faster. A BULLET whistles past her ear and hits the back wall of the elevator. She reaches for the doors a moment too late, and the elevator is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy scrambles to the door beside the elevator and runs into a stairwell as two more BULLETS bite pieces out of the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taking the stairs three at a time, Christy is flying, still clutching the mink. The thugs are gaining on her. A BULLET hits metal and RICOCHETS off several walls and steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the next landing, Christy opens the door and ducks into a corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exhausted but powered by adrenaline, Christy sprints past doors to the end of the hall, still with the mink. Joey appears from the stairwell just as Christy ducks into a supply room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUPPLY ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy shoves a cleaning cart aside and wades through a pile of dirty linen. Joey opens the door just as Christy dives head first into the laundry chute.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAUNDRY CHUTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy, lying atop the mink, flies through the chute like a subway train through a tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chute spits Christy out like a bullet into a huge bin of dirty linen. Two workers glance around as they load large washing machines with laundry. Christy climbs out of the bin and dashes for a door. Working in a hotel, the workers have seen everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAUNDRY CHUTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joey flies through the chute.

INT. BASEMENT

<DIRECTION>
Joey suddenly flies into the bin. He climbs out with his gun in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which way?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
The workers point to the door, and Joey rushes across the room. One of the workers is now wearing the mink coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joey comes out of the hotel and finds an empty street. He looks in every direction, but the nearby streets have swallowed Christy into safety for the moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The central offices of the Las Vegas Police Department.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MULCAHY'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie's office is a glassed-in area set in the middle of the station's main floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy is huddled in a chair, surrounded by Eddie and two other detectives, CLARKSON and TATE.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right between the eyes! Down and out! The guy was gone! I... I couldn't believe it!

<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You couldn't believe it? Vince the Prince?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<CHRISTY>

<CLARKSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tough break. Whoa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARKSON>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you expect? Vince is as dirty as they come. We've been finding bodies around here for years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know anything about bodies! I mean, he didn't bring it home. He was good to me... sometimes. He was sweet. He took care of me. Who am I supposed to go out with? He owns a casino. He let me sing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't do you a favor.

<TATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, she'll sing great. When she sings for us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TATE>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sing -- like testify? Are you nuts? I just want you to protect me! You're cops!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<TATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Busy cops. We don't have time to be bodyguards for anyone who comes in here with some cockamamie story. Mink coats and laundry chutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TATE>
<CLARKSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unless, of course, you're willing to testify.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARKSON>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this, some squeeze play? Can't you just protect me without any strings?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
The three detectives move in closer now and really apply the pressure.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could put you into our witness protection program.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<TATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A hiding place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TATE>
<CLARKSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A new identity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARKSON>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you'd have to agree to testify. The whole nine yards.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if I don't?

</CHRISTY>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</EDDIE>
<TATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wait.

</TATE>
<CLARKSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You listen for the footsteps.

<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then one day they find you.

</EDDIE>
<TATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They open a window.

</TATE>
<CLARKSON>

</CLARKSON>
<TATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten flights down.

<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten flights?

</CHRISTY>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd lose. You'd die. All over the sidewalk. And into the street.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right! I get the picture! I'll do it! I'll testify!

</CHRISTY>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get a stenographer.

</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Tate leaves. Christy looks to Eddie for a bargain now.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, here's what I want. I know about this stuff. A five-star hotel. With room service.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe Hawaii.

</EDDIE>
<CLARKSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Diamond Head.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. And I'll need a new look. Like a disguise.

	Maybe Armani.

</EDDIE>
<CLARKSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- Calvin Klein.

<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For sportswear. And a limo. And my hair -- up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<CLARKSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It could work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARKSON>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune? Let me spell it out for you. You have to hide like you don't even exist. You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay -- no limo.

</CHRISTY>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie smiles. Christy doesn't like the sound of this at all a
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAINED CLASS WINDOW - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesus delivers the Sermon on the Mount in vibrant red, blue and green stained glass. An ORGAN plays a hymn -- badly. Notes are missed, skipped over and mutilated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN DOWN to a procession of nuns who march into a chapel at the ancient St. Katherine's Convent. The organ isn't getting any better, and we see it is being played by SISTER ALMA, a seventy-year-old nun with arthritis and a hearing aid. Apparently the hearing aid is malfunctioning, because Sister Alma doesn't seem to realize how badly she's playing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the last nun in the procession enters the chapel, she closes the door behind her. Across the lobby, the front door opens and Eddie enters with a very reluctant Christy.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Eddie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate you. I totally hate you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Safest place in the world. You think Vince would look for you here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
As Christy looks around the lobby, various religious artifacts loom at her; we see them from her terrified P0V. ANGLE on a crucifix, casting an ominous shadow, a stack of hymnals, and a large, framed Sunday School-style portrait of St. Katherine. Christy shudders.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nuns, Eddie. There are nuns here. Everywhere. It's crawling with 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a convent. All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With nuns? With rulers? No way. I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
Christy turns to head back to the entrance, but Eddie catches her arm.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vince has put out a contract on you. A hundred grand. You've seen him in action.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Christy searches his eyes for a lie, but realizes he's telling the truth.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But... but Vince loves me. How could he... I mean, five years...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And one bullet. That's all it's gonna take.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly scared)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Vince has contacts all over the place! This is San Francisco! They'll be looking for me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent. Nobody knows you're here but me. We're trying to get a quick court date. A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
(panicking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't stay here! I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pray.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From inside the chapel, the CHOIR begins to sing a hymn -- horribly. The voices don't blend, and individual notes are real migraine material. Christy looks aghast. Eddie urges her into a corridor, and she follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The office is bare and austere. MOTHER SUPERIOR sits at her desk with her hands folded. Like all the nuns at the convent, she wears the traditional full-length habit and wimple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mother Superior is in total command of all she surveys, and she seldom raises her voice or her blood pressure as she rules. Control is her passion; within the walls of the convent, she has created a world she can trust because it's a world she controls.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Mother Superior is not in control at this particular moment. BISHOP GEORGE O'HARA stands before her with a majestic presence and some bad news.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely not. I am very sorry, but no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<O_HARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_HARA>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But she's been exposed to the underside of life. She is the underside of life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<O_HARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_HARA>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're a small convent, Bishop. Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<O_HARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother. The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_HARA>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, Bishop...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<O_HARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality. To all in need.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_HARA>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I lied.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<O_HARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mother Superior's jaw locks. She realizes she is stuck with the situation and will have to control it as best she can. There is a KNOCK at the door, and Eddie and Christy enter.
</DIRECTION>
<O_HARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome, Lieutenant. Everything is in order.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_HARA>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aces. Bishop -- maybe a cup of coffee, down at the corner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
The thought of being left alone with Mother Superior panics Christy, like a child left in the principal's office.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you're not leaving me alone...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<O_HARA>
<DIRECTION>
(reassuringly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're never alone in this house, my child.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_HARA>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie touches her gently on the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One month, two tops. Behave yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bishop...

EXT. THE CONVENT - A FEW SECONDS LATER

Eddie and Bishop 0'Hara are leaving, by the convent's front door. As they exit, they hear the CHOIR, singing horribly. They both wince at the sound, and then chuckle.

Christy is pacing, outraged at her new situation.

<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I joined this convent some thirty years ago. At that time, the world knew some measure of peace. And hope. Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise. And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed. Drugs. Gangs.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(staring at Christy's outfit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spandex. And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.

	Fine. Got it. Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right? I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice. So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me. I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low. So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb. Capisce?

INT. CONVENT CHANGING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small room, with a sewing machine, some bolts of fabric, and several wooden cabinets. There is a wooden screen in a corner, marking a changing area. Christy is behind the screen; we hear her, but do not see her, Mother Superior stands beside the screen, catching the various items of clothing which Christy tosses to her.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about a robe? One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket. "Guest of St. Katherine's"

A group of nuns are praying, their heads bowed. They hear a muffled SCREAM, from elsewhere in the convent. They look up, puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONVENT CHANGING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy is standing before a full-length mirror, staring at herself, in complete shock. She now wears a habit and wimple. Mother Superior is doing final adjustments on the wimple.

<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all. While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.

</DIRECTION>

INT. CONVENT DINING HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large, whitewashed gothic room, with oak beams and a crude iron chandelier. There is a long, central wooden table, with rough wooden benches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The convent's population is standing around the table in silence. There are about thirty nuns in all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mother Superior moves to the head of the table, with Christy following her. She motions for Christy to stand at her right.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good afternoon, Sisters. I apologize for my tardiness. I would like you to welcome a new member of our order, Sister Mary Clarence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on SISTER MARY ROBERT, the nun standing beside Christy. Sister Mary Robert is naive and mouse- like, but very sweet. She has only been at the convent a few years; she wears the simpler habit of a novice. She sneaks a look at Christy. Her eyes widen, and then she resumes staring at her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary Clarence comes to us from a somewhat more progressive convent. She is eager for a more disciplined life, and will make every effort to conform to our ways.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone sits, including Christy. SISTER MARY PATRICK, a nun seated at the middle of the table, waves her hand. Mary Patrick is extremely cheerful, a truly upbeat person.

	Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence. Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.

<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Silence? No talking? All day?

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Vince leaves the police station with his henchmen, Joey and Willy, and LARRY NARREN, an attorney. Vince is steaming as they walk through the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They grilled me for six hours in there. And my hotshot lawyer -- where the hell were you?

Vince reaches his car. As Joey opens the door for him, another car drives by, and stops. Eddie is driving; he leans out the window.

<EDDIE>

Vince lurches toward Eddie; Larry restrains him. Eddie drives off, chuckling.

Larry covers his ears with both hands.

	Keep the message vague, but let 'em know. The price has gone up. Christy Van Cartier -- a quarter of a million. Dead or nearby.

</VINCE>
<DIRECTION>
Vince looks grim and vindictive, as he gets into the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONVENT VEGETABLE GARDEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vegetable patch is located behind the convent, on a patch of land surrounded by high walls. Various sections have been partitioned with string and then furrowed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several nuns are working in the patch, weeding and raking. They wear large, ungainly straw hats over their wimples.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy has been given a hoe and a straw hat. She is hacking at the dirt, with great disinterest. She picks up a carrot from the vegetable patch; she looks around to see if anyone is watching. She starts to gnaw on the carrot. She becomes aware that someone is watching her. She looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sister Mary Robert is watching Christy eat the carrot, breaking her fast. Christy drops the carrot on the ground, as if it burned her. Mary Robert resumes hoeing in the next furrow over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy stares at Mary Robert, narrowing her eyes. Christy looks around; all the other nuns are busy at their tasks. Christy decides that she will try and make Sister Mary Robert talk. She picks up the carrot and tosses it at Mary Robert. Mary Robert jumps. She waggles a finger at Christy, scolding her. Mary Robert resumes hoeing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy is now determined. She takes her hoe, and tiptoes nearer to Mary Robert. Very gently, she uses the handle of the floe to lift Mary Robert's skirt, and gooses her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary Robert vips, very loudly. All the other nuns turn and stare at Mary Robert, scolding her. Christy waggles her finger at Mary Robert, scolding her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy, giggling to herself, resumes hoeing. She sees Mother Superior, standing at the end of the furrow. Mother Superior looks extremely grim; she has not missed anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUNSET - THAT NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT of the sun going down, ending the nuns' Vow of Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear Christy SCREAM, O.S.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONVENT HALLWAY - THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This hallway is marked by a series of heavy wooden doors with tiny, grilled windows. These are the cells where the nuns sleep. Nuns are entering their cells and closing their doors for the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mother Superior glides down the hall, followed by a dusty, bedraggled Christy. Christy is devouring a slice of brown bread.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this all the food I get?

INT. CHRISTY'S CELL

<DIRECTION>
The door swings open, and Mother Superior and Christy enter. The room is tiny, with bare plaster walls. There is a narrow wooden bed, with a thin muslin-covered mattress. There is a small nightstand and a wooden stool.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Our lives are simple. We have little need for material possessions.

	Right, sure thing. But what about, like, appliances? Like a little color portable? Boom box?

	Wait. No. You're kidding. Lights out? At nine? My day's just starting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure. If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life. And its direction. Or lack thereof.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong with my life?

</CHRISTY>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From all I've heard, just about everything. Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. If you're fooling anyone, it's only yourself. God has brought you here. Take the hint.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<DIRECTION>
Mother Superior leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After the door shuts, Christy stands and looks out the one small window in her cell. She leans her head against the wall. She is trying not to think about what Mother Superior has said. Still, the mess her life has become overwhelms her. She fights back tears.

INT. BATHING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stone room that is very medieval-looking. One wall is divided into stalls by wooden partitions. In each stall is a nun, standing beneath a crude shower head that releases a thin stream of lukewarm water. We see only the nuns' heads and shoulders.

<DIRECTION>
Still sleepy, Christy leans against the wall of her stall, her eyes closed. Lost in thought, she begins singing softly to herself.

Bishop O'Hara is leading the Sunday mass. He stands in the pulpit. The choir nuns stand in a fenced-in area to his left. The remaining nuns, including Christy and Mother Superior, sit in the first few pews.
</DIRECTION>
<O_HARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are a small congregation this morning. Too many mornings. Something has gone terribly wrong. Where is faith? Where is celebration? Where is everyone? Still, rather than regret the absence of our neighbors, let us rejoice in the fellowship of those present. Our choirmistress, Sister Mary Lazarus, has informed me that our choir, while always superior, has been toiling especially hard on this week's selection. Sister?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_HARA>
<DIRECTION>
Mary Lazarus raises her hand, and the choir begins singing. They sing a traditional hymn, "Let Thy Thoughts Be Guided." As always, their singing is dreadful; they have no tempo or pitch, and the hymn becomes an off-key drone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the hymn continues, the CAMERA PANS OVER the chapel. Aside from the nuns, it is almost empty; only a few elderly people are in attendance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON CHRISTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

She immediately tries to assume a pious expression, tilting her head and folding her hands in prayer; she looks like a somewhat demented Sunday School calendar.

INT. CONVENT SCHOOLROOM - AN HOUR LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A plain whitewashed classroom, with battered student-style desks. A group of about eight local TEENAGE GIRLS has gathered. The girls wear extremes of hair, makeup and clothing; they are bored and scruffy, clearly the local bad Girls. Sister Mary Patrick is leading the class, in her usual perky manner.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	And you listen to that?

Mother Superior is seated behind her desk; she is very angry. Christy sits across from her.

	A balloon and a banana! Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<CHRISTY>

	Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough. I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age. I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.

	We are nuns. We seek solutions through prayer.

<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes it's not enough!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are correct. Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation. Such as your own, for example. How do you feel about physical labor?

	It never solves anything.

A second telephone RINGS, and Willy answers it. Vince meanwhile has pushed a button on his phone and is involved in a second romantic call.

INT. CONVENT CRAFTS ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a large, open room where the nuns create various gift items which the convent sells to support itself. Several nuns sit at a table, diligently hand-painting Christmas cards and making Christmas tree ornaments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the other side of the room is a large, free-standing loom, which resembles a grand piano. The loom is wooden; a tapestry is half-completed. Mary Patrick is seated at the loom, which is a complicated mechanism. Christy stands beside her.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver. Have you ever used a loom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_PATRICK>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not in years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<MARY_PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy. I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_PATRICK>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<MARY_PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To sell, of course. I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's. We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_PATRICK>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But don't you get money? From the Vatican?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<MARY_PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary Clarence. Goose. We're completely self-supporting. Like all convents. Like yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_PATRICK>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, right. At my old place, we used to... wash cars. Groom dogs. So... nice loom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<MARY_PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't it lovely? Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as she deftly works the loom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed. Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed. Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed. Keep tension on the warp. Is that clear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_PATRICK>
<CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
(pretending to be fascinated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just about. Show me again.

CRAFTS ROOM - AN HOUR LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on the wall hanging, which has progressed considerably.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Christy, leaning against the wall, thumbing through a magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Mary Patrick, hard at work at the loom.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shuttle, beat, shed. And watch your heddles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_PATRICK>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love my heddles. Show me again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
Mother Superior appears.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<MARY_PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_PATRICK>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really catching on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Mary Patrick, I need you in the office. Mary Clarence, carry on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<DIRECTION>
Mother Superior gestures to the loom. Christy sits at the loom, and waves as Mother Superior and Mary Patrick exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy stares at the loom; a look of horror crosses her face. She has not been paying attention to Mary Patrick's instructions. She cracks her knuckles, as if she were about to play the piano. She grabs two parts of the loom, at random. She moves these parts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on the loom. As a result of Christy's movements, the loom collapses, piece by piece. The tapestry unravels, the many skeins of wool snap, and the mechanical apparatus disintegrates, until finally the entire loom shudders and falls to the floor, as Christy watches, aghast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mother Superior is striding down the hall; she is livid. Christy trails behind her, trying to keep up.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, this isn't my kind of thing! I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
Mother Superior stops dead in her tracks; she turns and stares at Christy. Then she smiles, in a rather frightening manner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

	But I'm going insane! All these people do is pray and work, work and pray! I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food! Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet? Get me outta her!

As the line goes dead, Mother Superior enters. Christy takes her dust rag and pretends to polish the receiver. She sings as she works.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>

Still singing, Christy breezes out of the room. Mother Superior looks mystified.

</MARY_ROBERT>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you? Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents? We can call the Enquirer.

	No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out! I want to get in?

	Excuse me?

</MARY_ROBERT>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She won't? Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<MARY_ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She says I should wait. She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life. She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet. In a mature manner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_ROBERT>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She said that? Reverend Mother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
Mary Robert nods, solemnly. Suddenly, from the streets outside the convent, we hear a BLAST OF hot dance MUSIC, and the SOUND of laughter and carefree conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, then there's only one thing to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<MARY_ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_ROBERT>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life. In order to make a responsible decision. This is going to be very painful for me. You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent. Wait.

<DIRECTION>
Christy stands, and goes to the crucifix hanging on the wall. She speaks to the crucifix, and listens, as if Jesus is advising her.

Another BLAST OF MUSIC from the street. Christy turns to the crucifix. She gets confirmation.

EXT. STREET
</DIRECTION>

The outer wall of the convent. A door swings open, and Christy sticks her head out. She looks both ways, and steps outside. She beckons to Mary Robert, who appears from behind her. Mary Robert looks very wary. Christy pulls her along.

EXT. A STREET NEARBY

Christy and Mary Robert walk along a street a few blocks from the convent.

	Are you sure this is what Reverend Mother had in mind?

	I know it is. It's life. Experience. Take a deep breath.

Christy breathes deep, and then lets out a whoop. She spins, letting her habit billow around her.

Mary Robert's eyes widen. She points to herself -- "Me?" Christy nods. Mary Robert lets out a tiny little whoop, and does a little, timid hop.

<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a start.

EXT. SOCIAL CLUB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A neighborhood hang-out, the windows bright with neon beer signs. The exterior is colorfully painted; the club all but explodes with good times. A group of teenagers lounge on the steps, sipping beers and smoking. Among the teenagers are the girls from Christy's Christian Youth group. Christy and Mary Robert approach, and the group falls silent.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you doing.

	It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program. How old are you? You shouldn't be smoking. Have you ever seen a diseased lung? Hand 'em over.

</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
Lawanda reluctantly hands over her cigarettes. Christy turns to a TEENAGE BOY who's drinking beer.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you, with the devil's brew passing through your lips.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
The club is alive with activity; the bar is crowded, couples are making out at small tables, and the dance floor is packed. The atmosphere is a combination of hazy darkness and colored lights; the club should have the feeling of a hot neighborhood party, with people of all ages and races. The MUSIC percolates, and Christy starts to move to it. She and Mary Robert find a table in the corner, and signal a nearby waitress.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A couple of bowls of chili.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(holding up the beer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And another round of these.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
The waitress looks at the two women strangely; the club has never hosted nuns before.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(to the waitress, confidentially)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to do this. So I can become a nun.

	Initiation. You understand. Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?

</MARY_ROBERT>
<CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
(to the waitress)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she wants to be a nun.

</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
The waitress leaves, shaking her head. Christy and Mary Robert watch the action at the club.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the room, MIKE the bartender stares at the nuns, especially Christy; he tries to place her.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are all these people?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_ROBERT>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is your neighborhood. Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
From across the room, Mike the bartender continues to study Christy's face. He takes out a copy of Vince's fax photo and stares at it. He covers Christy's hair in the photo with his hands, creating a wimple. There is no question in his mind; the two are the same. Mike has a dangerous look in his eyes as he takes a gun from the drawer and slips it into his pocket beneath his apron.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a LIVE BAND on a small stage at one end of the club. They start playing a hot dance number, and the club really begins to cook, as the dance floor fills. Christy and Mary Robert, both still seated, start to move with the music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A very good-looking LOCAL DUDE comes over to the nuns table. He is clearly amused at their presence.
</DIRECTION>
<DUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Sisters -- how you doin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDE>

<DUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come they let you out? Out of that convent place?

</DUDE>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time off. For bad behavior.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oww! A nun havin' fun! I don't believe it! It's good to have you ladies in this fine establishment. So... anybody on the move?

	<DIALOGUE>
	You watch yourself!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
Christy decides she'd better keep an eye on Mary Robert; she grabs another DUDE, and heads for the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the music percolates, Christy and Mary Robert dance; Christy is very hot, and Mary Robert picks up on her moves. The CLUB PATRONS are delighted, and cheer as the nuns start to get down.
</DIRECTION>
<CLUB_PATRON_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it, Sisters!

</CLUB_PATRON_1>
<CLUB_PATRON_2>
	<DIALOGUE>

As the song, and the nuns' exuberant dancing, peak, the Club Patrons cheer, shouting "Hallelujah!" and "Amen!"

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Christy and Mary Robert are walking back to the convent. They are both in very good spirits.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those people are wonderful! Why don't we ever see them in church?

	Good point. Especially that dude you were with. I'd like to see him down front.

</CHRISTY>
<MARY_ROBERT>

(giggling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary Clarence! You're so... different from the other sisters. Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.

<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey.

</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
As the two women laugh together, they don't notice the car that begins to follow them, creeping slowly forward with its headlights out.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences. I've learned so much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_ROBERT>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything. I mean, nothing really happened. We just... took a walk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
The car's bright lights suddenly switch on, and the nuns turn, startled. The car hurtles toward them. They scream, and Christy grabs Mary Robert and throws her out of the car's path; the two women land on a pile of garbage bags.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Struggling to her feet, Christy sees the car go into reverse, and then pull forward again. She sees a glint of light reflect off a gun as the car's driver (Mike the bartender) leans out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Mary Robert)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
Christy shoves Mary Robert towards an alley. As she does so, the gun GOES OFF with a red flash. The shot misses the two women and SHATTERS a plate glass window of the store behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Running up the alley, Christy and Mary Robert hear Mike's FOOTSTEPS chasing them, growing louder as he gains on them.
</DIRECTION>

</MARY_ROBERT>
<CHRISTY>

Christy grabs the ladder of a fire escape, and shoves Mary Robert up the ladder ahead of her.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Climb! Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
As Christy and Mary Robert climb the fire escape, another GUNSHOT ECHOES in the alley, ricocheting off the fire escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nuns climb higher up the building. Mike pursues, looking for a shot between the steps and the landings, but not finding any openings. He takes the steps two at a time and begins to gain ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the fourth floor landing, Christy's heel gets stuck in the grating. She pulls frantically at the laces.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn it!

</CHRISTY>
<MARY_ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary Clarence!

</MARY_ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Mike arrives at the landing just as Christy twists her toot out of the shoe, and surprises him with a lunge for the gun. Mike's hand is knocked back against the metal frame of the fire escape, and the gun flies loose, RATTLING down the metal steps to the landing below. Christy shoves Mary Robert into the open window of an apartment, and follows her in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT

Christy and Mary Robert leap into the bedroom of an Hispanic couple, their arms wrapped around each other in bed. At the women's entrance, the couple looks up, stunned to see two nuns in their bedroom.

<DIRECTION>
INT.CONVENT CORRIDOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy sits alone outside Mother Superior's office, listening to the loud TICKING of the clock on the wall. She seems small and vulnerable, like a child sent to the principal's office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and Eddie emerges from the office.

<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd she say?

	Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<EDDIE>

	She's counting on it. She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.

</EDDIE>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?

Mother Superior glances up from her work. She is justifiably outraged.

	A decent life? Excuse me? As what? A janitor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.

</MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you can't kick me out! Guys want to kill me! You're a nun! A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep? I mean, I'm a major sinner! All-time great! Hall of Fame! Aren't I, like, your dream come true? Your Olympic event?

<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>

	You have, I believe, some minimal background in music. Therefore, you are to join our choir. You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart. As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.

Mary Lazarus cuts off this chitchat, thrusting a hymnal at Christy.

<CHRISTY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever.

</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
Mary Lazarus hands Christy a hymnal, and raps her baton. The choir begins to sing; Christy doesn't even bother trying. She is horrified; the choir is the worst-sounding group in history. They seem to be singing in several random keys, and they even have trouble with the words. No one looks up from their hymnals. Sister Alma, the organist with the hearing aid, is plodding along.

INT. CHOIR REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

The choir continues its dreadful rendition of the hymn Let Thy Thoughts He Guided. Christy is not singing; she is clearly in pain. Mary Lazarus stops the song. One of the nuns has to nudge Sister Alma to stop her playing.

Everyone falls silent. Mary Lazarus walks across the room, eyeballing each member of the choir.

Christy goes over to the piano. She examines the sheet music for "Let They Thoughts He Guided." She sits at the piano, beside Sister Alma. Christy picks out the hymn on the piano, accompanying herself.

<MARY_ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_ROBERT>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary Robert, I've watched you. You never really sing. You whisper. Nothing comes out.

(because Sister Alma is hard of hearing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A C!

</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
Sister Alma plays the note. Christy points the baton at Mary Robert. Mary Robert whispers the note.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Louder! Like you're onstage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
Mary Robert sings a little louder.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like people are eating, and there's silverware, and you want them to hear you.

Mary Robert sings louder still.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think about that guy you were dancing with!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
Mary Robert finally lets out her full voice, which is huge and glorious. After singing a single perfect note, she stops abruptly; she has scared herself.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_ROBERT>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see? We've got the voices. They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me. We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.

<MARY_PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(puzzled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chops?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_PATRICK>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The goods. The sound. The sale. Let's rearrange a few things. Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto. Get over here. Mary Robert --with the sopranos.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
The two nuns trade places.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sister Alma -- a C.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
Sister Alma plays the note, and the nuns try to duplicate it, but the results aren't much better than before. Christy uses her pitchpipe; she circulates among the nuns, giving each her note, urging them closer to pitch.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Middle section, hold that note, for dear life. Sopranos, an A. Sister Alma?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
Sister Alma hits the note. Christy shuffles a couple of more nuns to other sections, then gets a third note going with the altos, using her pitchpipe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For one moment, the nuns all realize they are singing a perfect chord. They are elated.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We did it! We actually sang a chord!

</MARY_PATRICK>
<MARY_ROBERT>

	<DIALOGUE>
	That was exciting!

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you like discipline. Hard work.

	Of course. I'm a nun. Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.

<MARY_PATRICK>

	Two days. An hour or so.

INT. CONVENT LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a basement utility room. A large industrial washer-dryer stands along one wall; the machine makes a repetitive CHUNG-CHUNG sound
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The choir nuns are busily doing laundry; some iron, others fold sheets, others stack towels and garments on a long table. Christy is helping Mary Patrick fold a sheet. Everyone is working rhythmically, to the drone of the washer-dryer.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That machine.

There is a murmur from all the other nuns -- "Oh, yes.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(as a confession)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, I am, I know it! All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic. Perky. I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine. She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_PATRICK>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So use it. When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration. Most music is. So don't hold back. Let all that joy go right into your voice. Make me happy. Let me hear it. Perk out. Perk down.

The nuns have really gotten into the song, with Christy encouraging them verbally. They are sounding better and better.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SISTER MARY FREDERICK, a member of the choir, steps into the laundry room and lets loose with a sudden, piercing whistle. The nuns immediately stop singing, and a moment later Mother Superior enters.
</DIRECTION>

The room is quiet except for the sound of the washer- dryer. The nuns all get very busy at their laundry tasks.

INT. CHAPEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the end of the first verse, Christy signals the choir to stop. There's a hush in the chapel as Christy glances at the vacant pews. Then she turns to Sister Alma and nods. Sister Alma strikes a bold, stirring chord.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several of the nuns blink. Bishop O'Hara glances at the organ with surprise. Mother Superior sits up with a stiffened back and a severe expression.

As the chord grows in force, Christy gives the choir a beat.

EXT. CONVENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nuns are out in force, painting the walls of the convent, mostly with rainbows and flowers and bright, shining suns. The CAMERA PANS to Christy, who is adding her own original touch to the mural, using cans of spray paint. Christy's section includes an image of a nun in a miniskirt and spike heels, accompanied by neon letters that read "St. Kate!" People gather in the street, watching the nuns' activities. The convent begins to crackle with energy and life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A drug deal is going on in a house up the street, but the DEALERS give only a curious glance to the action at the convent.
</DIRECTION>

INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the window of her office, Mother Superior watches the painters and feels her control slipping away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - LATER
</DIRECTION>

Christy leads the members of the choir down the middle of the street. They get lots of attention each step of the way. As each nun raps, the other nuns make rhythmic boom- box noises.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rehearsal room is filled with high energy as the choir is separated into several groups. Christy has got the whole thing running like a disciplined Broadway cast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary Patrick leads one group in the corner as they practice synchronized movements with tambourines. Colorful streamers are tied to the tambourines, and they make colorful patterns in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sister Alma pounds the piano with newfound energy, as Mary Robert and the sopranos reach higher and higher for notes they've only dreamed of in the past.
</DIRECTION>

Christy and Mary Lazarus have corralled the rest of the nuns into a practice of intricate dance steps, somewhat like the Temptations in skirts. Mary Lazarus keeps the beat with a yardstick.

The nuns give him room, and the Driver zips off down the street. A small crowd has begun to gather, and it is growing by the moment, murmuring encouragement for the nuns. Christy turns to the Dealer, as other cars drive slowly past.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
The Dealer glances at the surly crowd, then gives the nuns a disgusted look. He puts the gun away.
</DIRECTION>
<DEALER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I'll find another neighborhood to do my business. You can' t stop me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEALER>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we can stop you here, they can stop you there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
The Dealer turns and walks back to his house with anger. The crowd APPLAUDS and CHEERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The picture suddenly becomes GRAINY, and we hear the voice of a NEWS REPORTER.
</DIRECTION>
<NEWS_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.0.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a truly remarkable scene, as the nuns from St. Katherine's literally drove the crack dealers from the neighborhood, led by the feisty Sister Mary Clarence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEWS_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see a TV screen with an image of the nuns and neighbors still celebrating. On top of the TV are several framed photographs of Vince Laflocca, his wife and children.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Vinnie, get in here. You gotta see this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Carrying a roast beef sandwich and a can of beer, Vince appears from the kitchen and glances at the TV screen to see a shot of the convent. He looks at Connie and makes a sour face.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Nuns? You got me in here to see nuns? Isn't there a ball game on or something?

</DIRECTION>
<CONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look -- she's adorable!

</CONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Vince leaves the room, and we see Christy again as she leads the choir.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie is cooking spaghetti in his efficiency apartment and watching the NEWS on TV at the same time. He pours himself a glass of wine and stirs the spaghetti sauce.
</DIRECTION>
<NEWS_REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This tiny convent has experienced an amazing turnaround. The sisters have revitalized and taken back their neighborhood, all due to the energy and talent of the convent choir, a group led by this gifted young nun. Tell us, Mary Clarence1 what makes you so special?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEWS_REPORTER>
<CHRISTY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm not special, Bob. It's just hard work... and prayer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie all but spits out his wine. His eyes are wide as he watches Christy being interviewed. In one stride, he grabs his hat and coat and is out the door on the run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONVENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sunday morning bell is CHIMING as crowds of people stream into the convent. The entire neighborhood looks cleaner, and the people walk with a spring in their step. Three local TV stations have remote news crews on the scene doing follow-ups on the story.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHAPEL HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Last in line, Christy follows the other choir members down a hallway toward the chapel. Suddenly, a hand reaches out and grabs her, and a second hand covers her mouth as she is pulled into an empty cell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shocked and terrified, Christy struggles to free herself, but is suddenly relieved to see that her abductor is Eddie.

Eddie releases her, and she falls onto the bed.

	This Sunday's hymn is inspired by the lesson of Mary Magdalene. You know the one. Mary Magdalene was a young lady with a past. She was no stranger to sin. She was no stranger to practically everybody. Many condemned her. The whole neighborhood. But one man refused to do so. One man said, hey now, wait a minute. Listen to the story.

<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara. Privately. I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.

</MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But -- why?

</CHRISTY>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must go where I can be of use.

</MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But -- there's so much more to do right here. And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed. After how long? A few weeks? I have been here thirty years. And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A part of what? Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday. You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them. They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party. You and I know that life is not so simple. There will be disappointments. Rude shocks. And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, so I just got things started. But you could build on that. You could keep it going.

Christy, frustrated, leaves the room. Mother Superior looks up, she is truly torn, a proud woman unsure of her choices.

EXT. CONVENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

The moon casts shafts of silver light down to the courtyard of the convent. Most of the lights in the neighborhood are out at this late hour.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CONVENT KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kitchen is dark, lit only by a flickering candle carried by Christy. Three more candles appear, carried by Mary Robert, Mary Patrick and Mary Lazarus. The door to the freezer opens, and light spills out. Christy removes several pints of ice cream and distributes them to the nuns.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(delighted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ice cream!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_ROBERT>

	Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_PATRICK>
<MARY_LAZARUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a sin. It's a wicked indulgence. Is this butter almond?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_LAZARUS>
<DIRECTION>
Christy and the nuns sit on stools, enjoying their ice cream by candlelight.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's contraband. Don't ask. But I wanted to give you a treat. A sort of... thank-you gift.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<MARY_ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A thank-you? For what? You're the one we should be thanking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_ROBERT>
<MARY_LAZARUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there any syrup?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_LAZARUS>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular. I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful. Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<MARY_ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary Clarence, don't be silly. You're an example to us all. You've taught us so much. We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows? Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_ROBERT>
<MARY_PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_PATRICK>
<MARY_LAZARUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could cut a demo. Look for a label.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_LAZARUS>
<CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
(knowing she has to leave)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's true, wouldn't that be great. Of course, we never know when things are going to change. Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.

<DIRECTION>
Christy and the nuns qiggle, and continue eating their ice cream, in a spirit of true friendship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mother Superior watches this scene, hidden in the shadows by the door to the kitchen. She has begun to see Christy in a new light. She looks thoughtful, and walks off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAS VEGAS POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tate sits at his desk in the detective room, reading the sports section. HENRY PARKER, the accountant for the police department, looks stressful as he enters the room and heads for Eddie's glassed-in office. Tate glances up as Parker passes his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<TATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're too late. Mulcahy just left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TATE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need his signature on some things. They can't be processed without it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARKER>
<TATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave 'em. He'll sign 'em later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TATE>
<DIRECTION>
Parker looks annoyed -- he doesn't like deviations from procedure -- but after a moment of indecision, he sets the file folder on Tate's desk and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tate finishes the newspaper and shoves it aside. Bored, looks at his watch, then flips the file folder open and glances at its contents; routine money vouchers for equipment, supplies, etc. Tate is about to close the folder and shove it aside when something catches his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<TATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is this...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TATE>
<DIRECTION>
He examines a money voucher for a generous donation to St. Katherine's Convent in San Francisco. It only takes a moment to put two and two together, and Tate scrambles for his phone and dials a number.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Henry Parker waits for the elevator. When it opens, he's surprised to see Eddie step out.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tate said you were gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARKER>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I get all the way down to my car, and, of course -- where are the keys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I left the money vouchers with him. He said you'd sign them in the morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie nods and moves on as Parker enters the elevator. After a few steps, Eddie suddenly looks disturbed. He picks up his pace. A little panicky, he begins to jog toward the squad room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VINCE'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vince is on the telephone. He signals Joey and Willy, and they move quickly toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is it. Get ready to move. No mistakes. Grab her, get her to the Moonlight. We meet there, and we take care of her.

Vince begins to write down the address.

<DIRECTION>
INT. SQUAD ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tate is hunched over the telephone, talking quietly with his back to the rest of the room. The voucher for St. Katherine's is in his hand as Eddie moves quickly toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<TATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	St. Katherine's Convent on East Barton. It's gotta be the place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TATE>
<DIRECTION>
Tate hangs up the phone and BOOM! Eddie hits him from behind like a linebacker, drilling him to the floor. Other detectives look up from their desks with confusion and alarm. Eddie pins Tate to the wall and snatches the voucher from his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the leak, you son-of-a-bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Clarkson and another detective restrain Eddie before he can hit Tate.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get him out of here! Downstairs, in the cell! I want his ass locked up now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Nobody dares even question Eddie at this moment, and two detectives drag Tate away. Eddie grabs Tate's phone and dials long distance.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clarkson, get on the other line. Call Frisco Central. Tell 'em to get two squad cars outside St. Katherine's convent, and stop anybody with an out-of- state license plate from getting near the place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Clarkson dials quickly. Eddie listens to Tate's telephone as it RINGS and RINGS and RINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONVENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the nuns are in the chapel as the choir rehearses a hymn, along with Gina and her girlfriends. Those who are not in the choir clap their hands in rhythm. War in the background, we can hear the telephone RINGING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie's police car streaks past an entrance ramp with the SIREN screaming. It blazes through traffic, weaving in and out at breakneck speeds. A moment later, Joey and Willy pull onto the highway at a fast rate. The race is on, with Eddie securely in the lead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONVENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>

In the rehearsal room, the choir members are putting on their robes. Christy and several nuns are all trying to primp in front of one small mirror.

<DIRECTION>
The neighborhood has turned out to see the choir off. Banners hang from the fire escapes of the building across the street: "ST. KATE'S - THE GREATEST!", "GOOD LUCK TONIGHT!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Catholic school bus pulls up to the convent and parks in front. Several nuns in choir robes come outside and hurry onto the bus. A moment later, Eddie's police car streaks up to the side entrance of the convent, parking around the corner from the bus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONVENT

Eddie runs into the convent and finds Mother Superior at the bottom of the stairs.

Everyone makes a final check of their appearance, and then the group leaves the room to head for the bus. Mary Robert and Mary Patrick are the last to leave, except for Christy.

Christy primps in the mirror one last time, then leaves the room. She is puzzled to suddenly see Eddie running toward her from a side staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie...?

Eddie grabs her hand and pulls her toward the side staircase.

Christy and Eddie hurry down the steps to the side entrance, and she almost trips on her choral robes. Eddie opens the door and starts outside, but Christy stops in her tracks.
</DIRECTION>

Eddie jerks her hand, and Christy follows him reluctantly to the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EDDIE'S CAR

INT. REHEARSAL ROOM

Several members of the choir rush into the room with panic in their eyes.

	They need you? A bunch of nuns? For what? Moral guidance? Make-up tips?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't get it! It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time. They're singing for the Cardinals. It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.

INT. WOMEN'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy enters the bathroom; it is deserted. She fondles her rosary beads, and sinks to her knees. This position doesn't work for her; she stands. She looks around her; she glances up, toward heaven. She decides to do things simply, and speaks in a matter-of-fact tone.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, it's me. Mary Clarence. Christy. It's Chris Carter. I need some help here. I can't believe I'm doing this. Okay, look, I know I should just get back in the car, and get the hell out of here. Save my skin. I mean, it's not wrong, Vince really wants to kill me. Why do you make guys like Vince? But if I don't sing at St. Matthew's... Mary Robert. Mary Patrick. It means so much to them. They're counting on me -- and I like that. Maybe Reverend Mother is right, maybe I am a bad influence, maybe I'm just some Vegas slut, but... can we cut a deal here? I mean, I still don't believe in, like, most of the Commandments, and stuff in church still gives me the willies, but -- if I go back and sing, if I do a good deed, will you promise I won't get killed? All I want is a sign. Lightning. Thunder. Anything.

Suddenly, Christy hears "AVE MARIA" coming from a radio or TV outside the bathroom. She looks up; a ray of sunlight illuminates a grimy, dime-store Christmas tree ornament hanging from a room deodorizer. The ornament is a glittery angel; it sparkles in the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy leaves the bathroom, still not quite sure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GAS STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy looks through the grimy window of the gas station office. A bored Mechanic is watching a small portable TV. On the TV is an episode of "THE FLYING NUN": Sally Field, in full habit, is soaring along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Christy hears the loud ROAR of a motorcycle starting up over by one of the gas pumps. The BIKER turns and looks at Christy: he has long hair, and a beard and moustache, and he looks, well, a bit like Jesus.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God...

Vince and Joey enter a storage room that is cluttered with boxes. Christy is tied to a chair in the back of the room, with Willy standing guard over her.

	You will be judged, Vincent. We all will.

Vince stands; the charm hasn't worked. He's getting angry.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean -- judged? I don't get judged, baby. And who are you to talk? You were nothing. You couldn't even sing. I must have been out of my mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCE>
<WILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's acting weird, Vince. Ever since we picked her up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLY>
<JOEY>

	It's spooky. It's like she ain't even afraid or nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>

Vince grabs the front of Christy's habit and squeezes it tightly around her throat.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel sorry for you, Vincent. And I forgive you.

This really throws Vince, and angers him further. He glares at Christy, and then releases her. He turns to Joey and Willy.

	But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?

</VINCE>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<WILLY>

Vince, Joey and Willy head for the lounge.

<DIRECTION>
Mother Superior steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<DIRECTION>
(with authority)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guarantee you, she is no broad. She is Sister Mary Clarence, of St. Katherine's Convent. She is a model of generosity, virtue and love. You have my word, gentlemen. She is a nun.

<WILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hear that? Now aren't you glad we didn't shoot her?

</WILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Vince has had enough. Facing Christy, he raises the gun and points it right between Christy's eyes, only inches away. The nuns all recoil with horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM! The gun goes off, but Christy isn't hit. She blinks her eyes open, shocked to be alive. Instead, it's Vince who falls, crumpling to the floor, and clutching his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the room, Eddie holds a smoking police revolver. The nuns all swarm around Christy joyously.

</EDDIE>
<CHRISTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That depends. Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news. I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.

</MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Christy, watching this. She grins.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>

	Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent. So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?

</MARY_ROBERT>
<CHRISTY>
