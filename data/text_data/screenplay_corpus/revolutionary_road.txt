EXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT, 1947. FLASHBACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
City lights. The soaring bridges and glowing windows of New York City. The SOUNDS of a cocktail party.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT, 1947. FLASHBACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A party of bohemian types in the village. Artist's canvases propped up against the walls. A narrow hallway with couples talking intimately. Two rooms crammed with young people smoking and drinking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man and a woman in their 20's stand alone in a corner...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANK WHEELER, intelligent good-looks, and APRIL JOHNSON, a patrician beauty, a woman amongst girls. He's been making her laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what do you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm studying to be an actress. You?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a longshoreman.

</FRANK>
<APRIL>

(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I mean really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean really too. Starting Monday, though, I'm doing something a little more glamorous. Night cashier at a cafeteria.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mean how you make money. I mean what are you interested in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey - if I had the answer to that one, I bet I'd bore us both to death in half an hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
She laughs. He smiles, revelling in her attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT, 1947, LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later, Frank and April dance. They move well, in sync, looking into each other's eyes. He slides his hand down the silk of April's dress until it rests in the small of her back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on their hands. Their fingers slowly entwine as they lose themselves in each other...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT, PRESENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on Frank's face, seven years later, full of doubt and tension as he watches his wife, April, on stage and as we hear the hollow VOICES of a very bad amateur play...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, mercifully, the curtain falls. Nothing. Then vigorous, relieved applause.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank hears a voice from behind, through the applause:
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God that's over...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
April takes the final bow. She's fighting not to cry. Frank applauds her loudly. Looks around to see who else is joining him. But there is no noticeable crescendo in the applause.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Frank hears the voice again:
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...And she was very disappointing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He can't argue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT, MOMENTS LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank now moves against the crowd of exiting audience members towards the stage. He keeps his head lowered, avoiding eye- contact, until he feels a hand on his sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. AND MRS. GIVINGS, an older couple, are standing in his way.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_GIVINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank! Very nice Frank!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_GIVINGS>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Mrs. Givings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank steps around her.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_GIVINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't tell you how much we enjoyed it. You have a very talented wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_GIVINGS>
<DIRECTION>
Frank forces a smile as he goes.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll pass it along!

</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
April sits alone at her dressing table crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACK STAGE - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAST mills backstage. The mood is subdued, but some have decided to make light of the disaster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank moves through the crowd. Across the room, he sees -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILLY CAMPBELL, 30's, determinedly bright, up on her tip- toes. Her husband SHEP, 30's, heavy-set, is still in costume, shell-shocked and pebbled with sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLY>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<MILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's through there...!

(points)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You `bout ready for that drink?

</MILLY>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Couple of minutes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank enters. The chair in front of the mirror is empty. A cigarette burns in the ashtray. Frank glances at a standing screen in the corner. April's costume is draped over the top. He goes towards it, deciding what to say.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(heartfelt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	April, sweetheart. You were great. I mean it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the bathroom opens. April enters in street clothes. Frank's been talking to an empty room.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. You about ready to leave? I've just got to get this makeup off, then we can go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
She sits in front of the mirror, too embarrassed to look at him. FRANK can see that her face is blotchy from crying. He puts his hand on her shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... I guess it wasn't a triumph or anything, was it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
APRIL looks at him in the mirror. She holds his look just a second. And from her expression, he knows he said exactly the wrong thing.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess not. I'll be ready in a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take your time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He removes his hands and lights a cigarette. APRIL begins to take off her makeup.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you do me a favor? Milly and Shep wanted us to go out with them afterwards. Will you say we can't? Say it's because of the baby sitter or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, the thing is, I already said that we could. I mean, I just saw them out there and I said we would.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(tense)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Then would you mind going out again and saying you were mistaken? That should be simple enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you think that's a little bit rude, April?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I'll tell them myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Okay. Take it easy. I'll tell them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He backs to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIGH-SCHOOL CORRIDOR - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
April and Frank walk down a long empty echoing corridor, past school lockers, booster club posters and silent classrooms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They don't touch. They don't speak. The tension between them is palpable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHEELER CAR - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank drives. April stares ahead. Their faces are lit by the dashboard. After a while...
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean it, baby. You were the only person in that play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over at her.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We just never should've let you get mixed up in the damned thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've studied for Christ's sake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could we sort of stop talking about it now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. I just don't want you feeling bad about it, that's all. Because it's not worth it. I mean, it's bad enough having to live out here among these damn people - what'd you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said yes. All right, Frank. Could you just stop talking now, before you drive me crazy, please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
Frank clenches his jaw and flips on the indicator.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing? Why are we stopping?

The car comes to a stop at the side of the road.

<DIRECTION>
INT. WHEELER CAR - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank turns off the ignition. He slides towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Frank, please don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his arms around her.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby, it's okay...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't touch me.

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	April...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why can't you...just... LEAVE ME ALONE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
Frank slides back behind the wheel. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It strikes me, that there's a considerable amount of bullshit going on here.... And there's one or two things I'd like to clear up. Number one, it's not my fault the play was lousy. Number two, it's sure as hell not my fault you didn't turn out to be an actress, and the sooner you get over that little piece of soap opera the better off we'll both be. Number three, I don't happen to fit the role of dumb, insensitive suburban husband; you've been trying to hang that one on me ever since we moved here. Number four -

</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the door and is out of the car, flashing across the headlights. Frank struggles with his door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY SHOULDER - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
April stands in the dark 30 yards from the road looking over an expansive countryside. There's only a few lights in the distance. This is still farmland.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank comes up behind her, careful to keep his distance.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you doing? Come back to the car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Just let me stand here a second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
Frank raises his arms in exasperation. A car approaches. He puts a hand in his pocket and tries to look casual. The car's headlights light up April's back, then pass.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	April?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, can't we sit in the car and talk about it, instead of running all over Route Twelve?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haven't I made it clear I don't particularly want to talk about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Jesus, I'm trying to be nice about this thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How kind of you. How terribly, terribly kind of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. I don't deserve this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're always so wonderfully definite, aren't you, on the subject of what you do and don't deserve?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and walks past him back towards the car.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He stumbles after her. Other cars whizz by, but he's past caring.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute, God damn it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>

She leans against the car and folds her arms.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You listen to me. This is one time you're not going to get away with twisting everything I say.

<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ, I wish you'd stayed home tonight!
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>

	You know what you are when you're like this? You're sick. I really mean that. You're sick!

</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you know what you are?

(eyes raking him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're disgusting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just because you've got me safely in this little trap, you think you can bully me into feeling whatever you want!
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You in a trap! You in a trap! Jesus, don't make me laugh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, me.

<DIRECTION>
(clutching at her chest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me! Me! Me! Oh, you poor, pathetic little boy ­­ Look at you! Look at you, and tell me how by any stretch of the imagination you can call yourself a man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his fist, she flinches away, and BONG! BONG! BONG! BONG! He punches the hood of the car. Then, silence. The look April gives him is probably the worst look he's ever received: a look of pitying boredom.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't look at me like that, April.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could we please go home now?

</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
She calmly walks around and gets in the car. After a moment, Frank follows...

<DIRECTION>
A small, attractive suburban house in the morning sunshine. Frank walks out to the car, stops and looks back at the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
April stands at the window. The SOUND of the car pulling away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD TRAIN STATION - MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stands on a grey platform, amongst a crowd of commuters. The morning commuter train eases into the station.
</DIRECTION>

INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - MORNING.

<DIRECTION>
Frank sits against the train window holding a "New Yorker." Around him, the train is crowded with men reading newspapers.
</DIRECTION>

INT. GRAND CENTRAL PLATFORM - MORNING.

<DIRECTION>
In one swift movement, all the doors of the commuter train swing open as a hundred feet step down onto the platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An empty stairwell in Grand Central: a tide of grim, determined commuters rise into view. A mass of suits and hats. Frank is amongst them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MIDTOWN STREET - MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knox Headquarters -- a squat, formidable structure. Thick HONKING traffic. Crowded sidewalks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank walks with the crowd past a display window: bright cardboard images of fashionable women grin and point their pencils at a list of product benefits - "SPEED, ACCURACY, CONTROL."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pride of place at the center of the display is a new Knox 500 Electronic Computer with a sign that reads: "Performs A Man's Lifetime of Work in Just 30 Minutes!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KNOX BUILDING ELEVATOR - MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank rides crushed against the wall in a crowded elevator. He glances over at -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAUREEN GRUBE, 23, ripe, a little obvious, but undeniably sexy. She meets his look. And looks away.
</DIRECTION>

INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, FRANK'S CUBICLE - MORNING.

Frank opens the bottom right drawer of his desk, props up his feet and lights a cigarette.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to need your help this morning, Old Scout.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Seated beside Frank, JACK ORDWAY, 40's, tall and effete with greying hair, appears to be hard at work, hunched over a file. He is, in fact, propping up his head with his hand while shielding his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the next few hours, you're to warn me of Bandy's every approach and you may have to screen me from public view in the likely event I that I throw up. It's that bad.

INT. MRS. GIVINGS' CAR - DAY, 1948. FLASHBACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Givings sits behind the wheel, driving slowly along a suburban street talking at high speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank sits beside her wearing sunglasses. April sits in the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We don't yet see what Mrs. Givings is describing, only as it plays on their faces.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_GIVINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, I knew the moment you came off the train what you were looking for... A small remodeled barn, or a carriage house ­ And I just hate to be the one to tell you that sort of thing just isn't available anymore... But I don't want you to despair. There is one place down here I want to show you... Now of course it isn't very desirable at this end.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gestures)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you see, Crawford Road is mostly these little cinder-blocky, pick-up trucky places ­ plumbers, carpenters, little local people of that sort.

Frank turns around to April, lowers his glasses. April stifles a giggle.

	<DIALOGUE>
	But eventually...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she points, her arm fully extended)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eventually it leads up to Revolutionary Road, which is much nicer. Now, the place I want to show you, is a sweet little house and a sweet little setting. Simple, clean lines, good lawns, marvelous for children. It's right around this next curve... Now, you'll see it ­ there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_GIVINGS>
<DIRECTION>
They all look.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_GIVINGS>
<DIRECTION>

Bandy holds out an envelope from behind his desk.

<FRANK>

</FRANK>
<BANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These folks in the provinces look up to us, Frank. We need to be efficient. We can't have this kind of back and forth, and so forth. It's just not efficient. Am I right?

	Now, if you'll look in the inactive file under SP-1109 you'll find copies of all the stuff we sent to the agency... and that way we can trace the thing back to its original sources.

The waiter brings over the phone. Frank dials. He holds his finger to his lips. He uses an authoritative tone.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello Mrs. Jorgensen. Frank Wheeler here. Just wanted to let you know that I've had to send Maureen Grube down to Visual Aides for me. I'll probably need her the rest of the day... Okay? Fine. You too.

Frank hangs up and smiles at Maureen.

INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we're moving behind April as she moves through the silent house. She carries a basket of dirty laundry on her hip. She pulls the bedding off the couch. The distant SOUND of children playing.

INT. ALGONQUIN RESTAURANT BAR - AFTERNOON, LATER.
</DIRECTION>

The dining room is now almost empty. Waiters and busboys eat in the corner.

INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on a hand opening an old cigar box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
April is sitting with the box at the kitchen table. It contains various sentimental knickknacks from her past, including photos of the kids, of her and Frank in New York with friends, and a photograph of Frank in uniform beneath the Eifel tower on liberation day... She studies it.

Frank comes over with the coffee, and two cigarettes. He lights them both, and gives her one.

Maureen covers herself with the sheets.

<MAUREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It certainly wasn't.

</MAUREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Frank inspects the contents of the mantle: photos of Maureen at the prom; Maureen with her parents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maureen tentatively fingers her hair that has now gone to frizz. The sheet slips down. She grabs at it. Then wills herself to calm down and act sophisticated.

Frank gets up and pulls on his jacket.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank approaches the door with his key. He takes a moment to gather himself, but before he can, the door opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
April is dressed in a black cocktail dress. She looks wonderful. She smiles. She steps forward and takes his face in her hands. She kisses him.
</DIRECTION>

	First of all, I missed you all day and I want to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the way I've been since that stupid play. I'm sorry for everything and... And I love you... Now wait here till I call you. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
She goes, leaving Frank in stunned silence. He takes a large drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From inside the house, the sound of the children's voices. Whispering, giggling. Then April's voice:

JENNIFER, 7, MICHAEL, 5, and April sit around the table wearing paper birthday crowns.

They sing Happy Birthday.

INT. SHOWER - NIGHT.

He turns off the water. He stands there in the silence, regaining control.

<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.

Frank steps out of the bathroom. April turns from the mirror wearing the silk negligee and comes towards him with two glasses.

She hands Frank a glass of brandy.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough to live on for six months without you earning another dime. And with the money we could get from the house and the car, longer than that.

</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What we get for the house...What are you talking about? Where are we going to live?

	Yes. What's stopping us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's stopping us? Well, I can think of a lot of things. For instance, what kind of a job could I possibly get?

</FRANK>
<APRIL>

	You won't be getting any kind of job, because I will.

<FRANK>

	I'm serious about this Frank. Do you think I'm kidding or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I know, I know. I just have a couple of questions, is all. For one thing, do you mind telling me what exactly I'm supposed to be doing while you're out earning all this money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
She draws back, shocked that he doesn't get it.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you see that's the whole idea? You'll be doing what you should've been allowed to do seven years ago. You'll have time, Frank. You'll have time to find out what it is that you actually want to do, and when you figure it out you'll have the time and the freedom to start doing it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweetheart, it's just not very realistic, is all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I happen to think this is unrealistic. I think it's unrealistic for a man with a fine mind to go on working like a dog year after year at a job he can't stand, coming home to a place he can't stand, to a wife who's equally unable to stand the same things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
Frank is silent. How could anyone possibly argue with her?
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to know the worst part? Our whole existence here is based on this great premise that we're somehow very special and superior to the whole thing, and you know what I've realized...? We're not! We're just like everyone else. Look at us! We've bought into the same ridiculous delusion. This idea that you have to resign from life and settle down the moment you have children. And we've been punishing each other for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen: we decided to move out here. No one ever forced me to take the job at Knox. I mean who ever said I was supposed to be a big deal, anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I first met you, there was nothing in the world you couldn't do or be.

</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was a little wise guy with a big mouth, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were not! How can you even say that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...All right... So, I'll have time. And God knows that's appealing. It's very appealing. And I mean, everything you say might make a certain amount of sense, if I had some definite talent maybe. If I were an artist or a writer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Frank, listen to me: It's what you are that's being stifled here. It's what you are that's being denied and denied and denied in this kind of life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>

Frank is standing leaning against a coffee bar in Grand Central Station. He is finishing a beer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is rush hour, and amidst the sea of people, he is the only one not moving.

<JOHN>

	Okay, okay, okay ­ I know it's none of my business. And besides, I know the answer. You want to play house, you got to have a job. You want to play very nice house, very sweet house, then you got to have a job you don't like. Anyone comes along and asks "Whaddya do it for?' he's probably on a four-hour pass from the State funny farm. All agreed...? Ma?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually... Something kinda funny happened the other day. I did some dumb little piece of work to get myself off the hook with Bandy, and suddenly I'm The Bright Young Man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SHEP>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's always the way, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEP>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's incredible. I knocked this thing off in a couple of minutes and now they want me to join their team of `specialist' salesmen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SHEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEP>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'd be funny, if they weren't talking about so much damn money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
April turns and looks at Frank. Long and hard. If he can feel her look, he doesn't show it.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEP>
<DIRECTION>
(stealing a glance at April)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you tempted?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEP>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's kind of ironic, don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
April suddenly stands up. Frank and Shep watch her walk down to the water's edge.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEP>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stares after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LONG ISLAND SOUND BEACH, WATER'S EDGE - AFTERNOON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
April stands in the water staring out over the sea. The waves break against her ankles. Whether it occurs to her or not, she's staring in the direction of Europe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank comes up beside her.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you turned the job down?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet... It's just an option, that's all. With the money they're talking, things could be different for us here. We could get a better place. Travel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
April shakes her head and drags on her cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, the point is - we could be happy here. At least for a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
She stares out at the sea.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is possible that Parisians aren't the only ones who know how to lead interesting lives, April.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to him.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you've made up your mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Like I said, it's an option.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...And supposing you're right. You make all this money and we have this interesting life here. Won't you still be wasting your life toiling away at a job you find ridiculous? Just like your father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(sharp)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we let that be my business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your business?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(exhales)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's too hot for this. I'm going to get wet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>

She just looks at him. He walks into the ocean. She stands on the shore, watching him swim away from her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHEELER FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
April paces the family room. Her hair is a defiant mess. She still wears her bathing suit under her clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank sits on the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The windows are open, and most of the lights are off. It's a very hot night.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want to go, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, April. Of course I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't! Because you've never tried at anything. And if you don't try at anything you can't fail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell do you mean I don't try? I support you, don't I? I pay for this house. I work ten hours a day at a job I can't stand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to!
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullshit! I'm not happy about it. But I have the backbone not to run away from my responsibilities!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It takes backbone to lead the life you want, Frank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>

He shakes his head and gets up.

<APRIL>

</APRIL>
<FRANK>

	Is it alright with you if I go to the bathroom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
She disgustedly twists out her cigarette, and immediately lights another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHEELER BATHROOM - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank splashes water on his face like a boxer between rounds. He looks up at his reflection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches for a towel, but there isn't one. He turns to the shelf behind him and pulls down a fresh towel. Something catches his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches to the back and retrieves a small brown paper package.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens it, his face slowly registering what it means...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHEELER FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
April wheels around as -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank storms in, a rubber syringe in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you going to do with this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what do you think you're going to do? You're going to stop me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're damn right!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead and try!
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
He comes at her across the room with the syringe in his hand. She moves away.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen. Listen to me. You do this - you do this and I swear to God I'll -
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll what? You'll leave me? Is that a threat, or a promise?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes it in her face.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did you buy this, April? I want to know!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know you really are being melodramatic about the whole thing. As long as it's done in the first twelve weeks, it's perfectly safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's now April! Don't I get a say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course you do! It would be for you, Frank, don't you see? So you can have time. Like we talked about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can it be for me if the thought makes my stomach turn over?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it's for me... Tell me we can have the baby in Paris, Frank. But don't make me stay here. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't have the baby in Paris.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not? I don't need everything we have here. I don't care where we live! I mean who made these rules, anyway? The only reason we moved out here was because I got pregnant. Then we had another child to prove the first one wasn't a mistake. I mean how long does it go on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
He turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank. Do you actually want another child? Well, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
He won't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, tell me. Tell me the truth, Frank. Remember that? We used to live by it. You know what's so good about the truth? Everyone knows what it is, however long they've lived without it. No one forgets the truth, Frank, they just get better at lying. So tell me: do you really want another child?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
Frank turns towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I know is what I feel. And anyone else in their right mind would feel the same way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(quiet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I've had two children. Doesn't that count in my favor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ! The fact that you even put it that way! You make it sound like having children is a punishment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love my children.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you're sure about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is that supposed to mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	April, you just said our daughter was mistake. How do I know you didn't try to get rid of her, or Michael for that matter? How do I know you didn't try to flush our entire fucking family down the toilet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No that's not true. Of course I didn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But how do I know April?

</FRANK>
<APRIL>

	Stop. Please just stop, Frank.

April's face.

</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...And the new job's going to pay for that too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	April if you need a shrink, it'll be paid for. Obviously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>

April turns to the book shelves. Her back to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank waits, his heart beating quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Okay. I guess there isn't much more to say, then, is there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes are bright with tears.

<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I guess Paris was a pretty childish idea, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Everything hangs on Frank's answer...
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess maybe it was.
	</DIALOGUE>

April closes her eyes. Tears run down her cheeks. He walks over to her, but he doesn't touch her.

	We can be happy here April... I can make you happy here.

INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stands at the picture window watching...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
April approach the children. She squats on the ground so she can be at their height and talks to them. Michael tries to get into her arms. Jennifer turns away and walks sulkily across the grass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank looks into his coffee cup. He doesn't look like a man who won an argument.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KNOX WAITING ROOM - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank sits smoking nervously in an oak-paneled waiting room. The door opens behind him. He gets to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for waiting. Mr. Pollock can see you now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<DIRECTION>
He follows her through the door. The door closes behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the scene in dumb-show through the glass door. Bart looks up as Frank enters. An "I knew it all along" smile spreads across Pollock's face. He offers his hand to Frank. Frank smiles thinly. They shake.

INT. VITO'S LOG CABIN - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two drumsticks spinning in a spotlight. They click out a rhythm, and crash into a number.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cut back to reveal a small, low-ceilinged joint. On-stage are the Steve Kovack quartet, four perspiring middle-aged men with day jobs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YOUNGISH COUPLES, and the odd middle-aged COUPLE navigate the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A smattering of lost SINGLES line the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Wheelers and Campbells sit squashed into a booth on the side of the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several empty glasses have accumulated. Milly is beating the edge of the table with red drink straws. She's a few drinks ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They have to SHOUT over the MUSIC.

	Oh, sure. Give us girls a couple of days and we can get over anything!

Frank turns his attention to Milly. He's a good dancer. His movements are fast and aggressive, his mind on April.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milly is a little too drunk, and hurries to keep up, perspiring through her dress. He spins her around and around, back and forth into his arms. Milly begins to look slightly dizzy.

April and Shep dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shep can't dance well, but he's trying. April, on the other hand, is a wonderful dancer. She dances out as far as their joined hands allow and does a little twitching, hip-bobbing curtsies before twisting back, all seemingly effortless. It is joyous, released.

She climbs into the back seat. He pulls off his jacket and climbs in after her. He folds the jacket under her head for a pillow...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She remains perfectly still, allowing him to kiss her, to search under her clothing, to kiss her skin and finally, to lift her skirt and pull her clothing aside and make love to her against the vinyl seat cover...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As suddenly as it began, it's over. Shep collapses against her. April stares into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEP>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	April... This is what I've always wanted... I love you.

</SHEP>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't say that.

</APRIL>
<SHEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean it, I love you.

</SHEP>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, just be quiet for a minute, then you can take me home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
They begin to quietly assemble themselves.

<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stands at the mirror putting on a clean shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHEELER KITCHEN/DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
April stands at the kitchen table chopping vegetables. She wears an unflattering floral dress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stands in the doorway watching.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's beautiful out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes; it's lovely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
He glances at the calendar.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what today is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't look at him.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's twelve weeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over to her. He takes her in his arms. She stiffens.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, this has been kind of a crazy summer. We've both been under a strain. I mean I know you're upset.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I'm not sleeping with you and you want to know why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
She looks him straight in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm sorry Frank, but I don't really feel like talking about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls herself free of his grasp. He watches as she adds the vegetables in the pot on the stove.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. What do you feel like talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would it be all right if we didn't talk about anything? Can't we just take each day as it comes, and do the best we can, and not feel we have to talk about everything all the time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles patiently.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think I suggested we talk about everything all the time. My point was, we've both been under a strain and we ought to be trying to help each other as much as we can right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
She's utterly uninterested and it's making him nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean God knows my own behavior has been pretty weird lately... I mean, as it happens... there is actually something I'd like to tell you about...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
She continues folding the napkins.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been with a girl in the city a few times.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, she stops moving. She looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A girl I hardly even know. It was nothing to me, but she got a little carried away. She's just a kid... Anyway, it's over now. It's really over. If I weren't sure of that I guess I could never have told you about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(relieved)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby, I don't know. I think it was a simple case of wanting to be a man again after all that abortion business. Some kind of neurotic, irrational need to prove something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I don't mean why did you have the girl; I mean why did you tell me about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
He is suddenly unsure.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean what's the point? Is it supposed to make me jealous, or something? Is it supposed to make me fall in love with you, or back into bed with you, or what? I mean what am I supposed to say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
He tries that same patient smile, but it's not convincing.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you say what you feel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't feel anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In other words you don't care what I do or who I fuck or anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No; I guess that's right; I don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
She is frighteningly calm.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck who you like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
His panic mounts.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you see...Don't you see, I want you to care.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I know you do. And I suppose I would if I loved you. But you see I don't think I do anymore. And I only just figured that out. And that's why I'd just as soon not do any talking right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
She goes back into the kitchen. Frank follows her.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, now don't give me this shit! You know God damn well you love me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think so?!

Frank and April stare at each other, breathless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHEELER DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank and the Givings' sit with cocktails. It's painfully awkward. Moving boxes are everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry dinner's late. Can I get anyone a refill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<MRS_GIVINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, don't worry. It's nice just to sit for a bit and socialize...You really didn't need to go through all the trouble of cooking. I can see you have a lot to do with packing and what not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_GIVINGS>
<DIRECTION>
Frank looks at April. She avoids his look.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, there's been a change of plans.

Frank looks at April.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought maybe it was obvious... April's pregnant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
April manages a forced smile.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_GIVINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, April! I can't tell you how pleased I am. Oh, but I expect you'll be needing a bigger house, now, won't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_GIVINGS>

He fixes Frank with the stare of a prosecuting attorney.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

</JOHN>
<MRS_GIVINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh John, really. I don't think we need to --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_GIVINGS>
<DIRECTION>
John holds up a hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm asking the man a question. If he doesn't want to give me the answer, I'm assuming he'll have sense enough to tell me so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suppose we just say that people anywhere aren't very well advised to have babies unless they can afford them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(nods slowly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Okay; it's a question of money. Money's always a good reason...

</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
John paces the room, with his hands behind his back like a detective at a murder scene.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's hardly ever the real reason. What's the real reason? Wife talk you out of it, or what?

</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
He turns the force of his smile on April.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little woman decide she isn't quite ready to quit playing house?

She walks across the room and stabs out her cigarette. Then immediately lights another.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, nah, that's not it. I can tell. She looks too tough. Tough and female and adequate as hell.

He swings around to face Frank.

<JOHN>

John holds up his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened, Frank? You get cold feet, or what? You decide you're better off here after all? You figure it's more comfy here in the old Hopeless Emptiness after all, or --

</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Frank's face.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>

	Wow, that did it! Look at his face! What's the matter, Wheeler? Am I getting warm?

<DIRECTION>
He lets out his braying laugh. April starts to laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy! You know something? I wouldn't be surprised if you knocked her up on purpose just so you could spend the rest of your life hiding behind that maternity dress. That way you never have to find out what he's made of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now look, I think that's just about enough out of you. I mean, who the hell do you think you are? You come in here and say whatever crazy God damn thing comes into your head and I think it's about time someone told you to keep your God damn -

	He's not well, Frank.

April stares at Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_GIVINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go, son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_GIVINGS>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Givings moves John towards the door. Mrs. Givings slowly stands. April is the only one left seated.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big man you got there, April.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
He winks at April and puts his hat on.

</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
April's face.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Matter of fact, the way you look right now, I'm beginning to feel sorry for him, too. I mean, you must give him a pretty bad time, if making babies is the only way he can prove he's got a pair of balls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You... fucking..!

<MRS_GIVINGS>

	He's not well, Frank!

Silence. Mr. Givings slowly releases Frank. He is breathing heavily.

	I'm sorry April, I'm so sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_GIVINGS>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right... Sorry, sorry, sorry! Okay Ma? Have I said `Sorry' enough times? I am sorry, too. Damn; I bet I'm just about the sorriest bastard I know. Course, get right down to it, I don't have a whole hell of a lot to be glad about, do I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
He takes another step towards the door, then stops and turns back, laughing again.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, but I'm glad about one thing, though.

Frank goes to the liquor cabinet, pours a whiskey and drinks it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
April watches him from across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay, don't tell me. Don't tell me; let me guess. I made a Disgusting Spectacle of Myself. Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to April.

<FRANK>

	And everything that man said is True. Right? Isn't that what you're going to say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apparently I don't have to. You're saying it for me.

</APRIL>

He comes towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you're wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why am I wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because the man is insane. He's fucking insane! Do you know what the definition of insanity is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it, Frank?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The inability to relate to another human being. It's the inability to love.

</FRANK>

She looks at him. Then she begins to laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The in -- the in; the inabil; the inability to --

</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. -- Oh, Frank, you really are a wonderful talker! If black could be made into white by talking, you'd be the man for the job. So now I'm crazy because I don't love you -- right? Is that the point?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Wrong. You're not crazy and you do love me; that's the point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a step towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the laughter goes out of her face. She backs away.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I don't. In fact I loathe the sight of you. You're just a boy who made me laugh at a party once and if you come any closer, if you touch me or anything I think I'll scream.

</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
He takes her by the arms.
</DIRECTION>

He SLINGS it against the wall.

	What're you going to do now? Are you going to hit me? To show how much you love me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no, don't worry, I can't be bothered! You're not worth the trouble it'd take to hit you. You're not worth the powder it'd take to blow you up. You're an empty --

<DIRECTION>
He begins to shake with anger.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

He points at her belly.

<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you still talking? Isn't there any way to stop your talking? I NEED to think. Can't you see that?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want me to scream again, Frank? Because I will, if you say another word! I mean it!

Frank has no choice - they're outside. The neighbors would hear and call the police. He reluctantly backs away, then turns back the way he came, glancing over his shoulder as he goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHEELER FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stands at the window watching the section of woods where he left April.

The kitchen has been tidied and is bathed in sunlight. The table has been carefully set for two.

<DIRECTION>
April stands at the stove wearing a fresh maternity dress. She seems serene.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. I'll have scrambled too.

Frank sits at the table.

INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - MORNING, MOMENTS LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank and April sit across the kitchen table, eating. For several moments, only the sound of their cutlery.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's kinda nice having breakfast without the kids for a change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
April reaches out to pour him some orange juice. Her hands shake slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I thought you'd probably want a good breakfast today. I mean it's kind of an important day for you, isn't it? Isn't this the day you have your conference with Pollock?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. That's right, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I imagine it is a pretty big deal; for them, anyway. What exactly do you think you'll be doing? You never have told me much about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haven't I? Well... I think this whole thing is about Knox getting ready to buy up one of these really big computers, bigger than the `500'. Did I tell you about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't believe you did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you know -- Basically it's just a...a big, fast adding machine. Only...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a pencil from his inside pocket and delicately sketches the computer on the napkin.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Instead of mechanical parts, you see, it's got thousands of little individual vacuum tubes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up the drawing and looks at it. It's surprisingly delicate.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I see. At least I think I see; yes. It's really sort of -- interesting, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't know, it's -- yeah, I guess it is sort of interesting, in a way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should value what you do Frank. You're obviously good at it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles, flattered and surprised. He slips the pencil into the inside pocket of his suit.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess I'd better be getting started.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He stands. April stands up too, smoothing her skirt.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, though, April; this was really nice... I mean it was a swell breakfast. Really; I don't know when I've ever had a -- a nicer breakfast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you... I'm glad; I enjoyed it too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
They stand there gazing at one another across the table. Suddenly, inexplicably, his eyes are filled with tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and walks to the door. He puts his hand on the handle and turns back once more.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you don't -- You don't hate me, or anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No; of course I don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
She comes over to him.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a good day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
He leans down and kisses her tenderly. They look at one another a moment longer.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, then... So long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He steps through the door. She catches the door before it shuts and watches him through the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHEELER DRIVEWAY - MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
April walks out onto the driveway as the car reverses away down the drive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHEELER CAR - MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank backs the car onto the road. He slides the car into drive and then catches sight of April in the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHEELER DRIVEWAY - MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
April sees Frank looking back at her. She waves. Frank waves from the car and drives off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then April is alone. She shivers from the morning chill. She turns and looks back at the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
April enters through the screen door and goes to the table. She looks down at Frank's diagram and carefully places it aside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She carries the dishes to the sink and begins to wash them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, her body convulses as she tries to hold back from crying. And then there is no stopping the tears...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
April is standing by the phone, with her hand on the receiver, rehearsing. She is smoking. She dials.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello... Milly? Everything all right? My voice sounds what...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
April uses both hands to grip the receiver.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, no, I'm afraid I'm not feeling any better... If it's not an inconvenience for you... This evening would be great. What...? Oh, well- no, not if they're outdoors playing. Don't call them in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
The cigarette shreds in April's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just give them - you know, give them each a kiss for me, and give them my love, and tell them - you know... All right, Milly. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
She hangs up and begins to cry again. Takes a breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOOTSTEPS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move behind April as she walks through the silent house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The distant SOUND of children playing outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each room she passes is a pocket of silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
April makes the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She arranges her shoes on the floor of the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
April reaches onto a shelf behind some clothes. Pulls out the brown paper package.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
April stands at the stove over a pot of rolling, boiling water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She removes the rubber syringe from its paper packaging and drops it into the pot. She checks her watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
April carries the pot of boiling, sudsy water down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHEELER BATHROOM - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
April places the pot into the tub. She lays towels across the floor. And closes the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHEELER BATHROOM - DAY, MOMENTS LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUND of running water. The empty mirror. April's face rises up into the reflection with a gasp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move with April down the hallway, her face is pale.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - DAY, LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now April stands at the picture window. She is shaking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DROPLET of blood slides down her knee. She looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the floor, two droplets of blood appear between her bare feet...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see the bright maple leaf of blood seeping through her skirt. She is shaking more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks slowly out of the room, towards the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I need an ambulance.... Yes... One one five Revolutionary Road.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAMPBELL KITCHEN - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milly folds laundry. She looks up to see -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ambulance turns into the Wheeler's driveway. Her face clouds with instinctual foreboding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shep steps out into a hospital hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank paces, helpless in the waiting room, his face a mask of bewildered, childlike confusion. He looks up to see -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shep coming towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank? They tell you what happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEP>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, Shep. I couldn't even understand half the things he told me. He said the fetus was out before they got her here. He said they had to operate to take out the whatdycallit, the placenta and now she's still bleeding. He said she'd lost a lot of blood before the ambulance came, and now they're trying to stop it, and he said a whole lot of things I didn't get, about capillaries, and he said she's unconscious. Jesus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SHEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about sitting down, Frank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEP>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell do I want to sit down for!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SHEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Take it easy.

</SHEP>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SHEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, have a cigarette.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEP>
<DIRECTION>
Shep offers the pack. Frank doesn't take one.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She did it to herself, Shep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Shep's face as he realizes what he's saying.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She did it to herself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Shep takes a cigarette for himself. He lights it with trembling fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get some coffee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEP>
<DIRECTION>
Frank looks over at Shep as if he'd forgotten him. He nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shep stands and walks down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - COFFEE MACHINE - AFTERNOON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shep stands at a coffee machine, gathering himself. He looks up. He begins to feed coins into the machine. His hands are trembling. He drops a coin. It rolls under the machine. He has to get down on his hands and knees to retrieve it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shep walks tentatively, holding a cup in each hand, slopping coffee onto the floor...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rounds the corner and stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank is no longer in his chair at the end of the long echoing hallway. Shep looks around...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then suddenly, the double doors are flung open and a number of nurses hurry out. Behind them, comes Frank, supported by two Doctors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shep runs to them as they move Frank over to a chair. He's in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No. No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
They try to make him sit, but he stays stubbornly on his feet, the chair skidding behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try to sit down, Mr. Wheeler.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<SHEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down Frank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEP>
<DIRECTION>
Frank looks at Shep - his face is a terrifying blank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD - MAGIC HOUR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A toyland of white and pastel houses along the road. The crisp green lawns. The blue televisions flickering behind the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the WHISK of running footsteps on the asphalt, the rush of a man's breath...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank is running down the middle of the street, tears streaming silently down his face...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAMPBELL LIVING ROOM - EVENING, ONE YEAR LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four high-ball glasses with glistening cubes of ice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shep puts the finishing touches on four drinks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. and MRS. BRACE, a pleasant looking young couple fresh from the city sit on the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...It was the worst experience of my life. Such wonderful people. Weren't they Shep? Poor April.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLY>

Shep picks up the drinks and carries them across the room. He stands there beside the three of them, but he can't bring himself to sit down and join in.
</DIRECTION>

</MRS_BRACE>
<MILLY>

Shep nods.

Shep turns and walks out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - EVENING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shep walks across the lawn to the edge of the property. He looks out over the suburban houses. At what was once the Wheeler house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shep's face, looking out. His eyes are filled with tears. Milly comes up behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLY>

	You okay?

</MILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Shep and Milly look out over Revolutionary Road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY PARK - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same silence over a beautiful day in the city. And from the silence, the faint sound of wind through the leafy branches of trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two children play in a playground in a small park.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Jennifer and Michael. They seem happy, engrossed. Other kids play around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watching them from a bench is Frank. He is a little older, a little thinner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on Frank's face. The SOUND of his children playing.
</DIRECTION>

INT. GIVINGS' LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Givings crouches on a cotton work sheet painting varnish onto a chair. Mr. Givings sits reading the paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A new puppy sleeps curled up on the rug nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_GIVINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't tell you how pleased I am about the little Revolutionary Road place, Howard. Remember how dreary it looked all winter? All cold and dark and -- well, spooky. Creepy- crawly. And now whenever I drive past, it gives me such a lift to see it all perked up and spanking clean again, with lights in the windows. And do you know, I was just thinking, I've loved that little house for years, and the Braces are the first really suitable people I've ever found for it. Really nice, congenial people, I mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_GIVINGS>

Mr. Givings fiddles with his hearing aid.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_GIVINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, except for the Wheelers, you mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_GIVINGS>
<MRS_GIVINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I was very fond of the Wheelers but they always were a bit -- a bit whimsical, for my taste. A bit neurotic. I may not have stressed it, but they were often very trying people to deal with, in many ways. Actually, the main reason the little house has been so hard to sell is that they let it depreciate so dreadfully. Warped window frames, wet cellar, crayon marks on the walls, filthy smudges around all the--

<DIRECTION>
Mr. Givings reaches up to his ear and SUDDENLY... SILENCE... but for the faint sound of wind.

He gazes out the window as behind him Mrs. Givings continues to talk, but we can't hear a thing.

He has turned off his hearing aid.
