A QUOTATION AGAINST A BLACK SCREEN:

'REJOICE, O YOUNG MAN, IN THY YOUTH ...'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound now of a C-130 air cargo plane roaring over us and we cut sharply to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIRSTRIP - BASE CAMP - VIETNAM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the C-130 coasts to a stop, the hatch rotating down on a hot, dusty lifeless airstrip somewhere in Vietnam. Nothing seems to live or move in the midday sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES RUN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DOZEN NEW RECRUITS step off the plane, unloading their duffel bags, looking around like only the new can look around, their hair regulation-clipped, crisp, new green fatigues fitting them like cardboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHRIS TAYLOR is just another one of them - as he turns into a tight closeup, to look at a motorized cart pulling up alongside ... He's about 21. Newmeat. His face, unburned yet by the sun, is tense, bewildered, innocent, eyes searching for the truth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They fall now on a heap of BODY BAGS in the back of the cart. Two soldiers begin loading them onto the plane. Flies - hundreds of flies - buzz around them, the only cue to their contents.
</DIRECTION>
<GARDNER>
<DIRECTION>
(next to Chris, Southern accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That what I think it is?

</GARDNER>
<SOLDIER_1>
<DIRECTION>
(a look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess so ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER_1>
<DIRECTION>
An uncomfortable look between them.
</DIRECTION>
<SERGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, let's go ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGENT>
<DIRECTION>
As they move out, Chris' eyes moving with the body bags being loaded onto the plane. Moving over now to a motley HALF DOZEN VETERANS bypassing them on their way to the plane. They look happy. Very happy, chatting it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass the newboys - and they shake their heads, their eyes full of an almost mocking pity.
</DIRECTION>
<VETERANS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I'll be dipped in shit - new meat! Sorry bout that boys - 'sin loi' buddy ... you gonna love the Nam, man, for-fucking-ever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VETERANS>
<DIRECTION>
Chris looking at them. They pass, except for the last man who walks slower than the rest, a slight limp. His eyes fall on Chris.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're frightening eyes, starved, hollow, sunken deep in his face, black and dangerous. The clammy pallor of malaria clings to him as he looks at Chris through decayed black teeth. Then the sun flares out on him and he's past. And Chris looks back. Disturbed. It's as if the man was not real. For a moment there. As if he were a ghost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris walking, duffel bag on the shoulder, looks up at the lollipop sun burning a hole through the sky. A rushing SOUND now. Of frightening intensity, an effect combining the blast of an airplane with the roar of a lion as we hardcut to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JUNGLE - SOMEWHERE IN VIETNAM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun matches the intensity of the previous shot as we move down into thick green jungle. We hear the sound of MEN coming, a lot of men. The thwack of a machete. Brush being bulled. We wait. They are getting close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CREDITS continue to run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUBTITLE reads: December 1967 - Bravo Company, 25th Infantry Division - Somewhere near the Cambodian Border.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sweating white face comes into view. CHRIS - cutting point. Machete in one hand, whacking out a path for the platoon, M-16 in the other, he looks like he's on the verge of heat exhaustion. Breathing too hard, pacing himself all wrong, bumping into things, tripping, not quite falling, he looks pathetic here in the naturalness of the jungle. An urban transplant, slightly neurotic and getting more so.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His rucksack is coming apart as well, about 70 badly packed pounds banging noisily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him BARNES now comes, the Platoon Sergeant. Then the RTO, his radio man, humming lightly. Others are behind, the column snaking back deep into the brush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We cut around some FACES of the Platoon - all to be seen later. Young faces, hard and dirty after weeks in the field, exhausted yet alert, fatigues filthy, slept-in, torn, personalized, hair way past regulation length, medals, bandanas. A jungle army. Boys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris glancing down at his raw bleeding blisters. Transfers the machete to his other, slightly less blistered, hand. The kid cuts on - struggling but trying, on his last reserves of strength, smashing almost straight forward through brush, not even bothering to look ahead. He smells something, looks around, slows his pace, eyes working ... around to the base of a tree. He moves past it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And as he does so, the camera from his POV comes around on a dead decomposing 10-day-old GOOK - eyes starting from its sockets, worms and flies feasting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris draws his breath in, terrified. Barnes suddenly appears alongside, his hard humourless eyes looking annoyed from the gook to Chris.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you waiting for? He ain't gonna bite you. Move out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
Chris looks at him with pent-up hatred and crashes on.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the PLATOON PC, LIEUTENANT WOLFE sweats heavily as he speaks in his radio. He is also new to the field, a dark little feisty guy, about 24, very hairy, especially in the eyebrows, an intense get-ahead look.
</DIRECTION>
<LIEUTENANT_WOLFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two Bravo, Two move it out. Six says we're jamming 'em up back there. Over.

	Tell that dipshit to get fucked. Get that other freshmeat up here. Gardner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
As Barnes picks up his pace, irritated now at this reprimand from the CO - coming up on Chris, who is soaked now from head to foot in sweat, dizzy, feeling sick, about to vomit.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell's the matter with you Taylor! You a sorry ass motherfucker. Fall back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs Chris's machete out of his hand and bulls his way into the foliage, tearing it apart, setting a new pace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris being bypassed by the column, their eyes on him. He is swatting at the red ants that are all over his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GARDNER, another new recruit, fat, hustling up to replace him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big and black medic - DOC - comes over, gentle eyes and manner; with him is Sergeant ELIAS, concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, black ants are killers, you look sick man. You need a little salt.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reaching into his satchel)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sergeant Elias, a handsome, graceful dark-haired Indian kid of 23, the squad sergeant, is taking items out of Chris' pack - air mattress, extra unnecessary clothing, extra canteens, grenades, gas mask, books.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head, amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're humping way too much, troop, don't need half this shit. I'll haul it for you but next time you check it out with me okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Chris nodding, grateful, panting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men passing, watching. Chris sorry about this, trying to keep up face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUNNY, a young 18 year-old with an angel's face, is pissing in the dead gook's face.

<DIRECTION>
KING passes, glances at him.

<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a sick mother Bunny.

Bunny laughing about it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris standing there one moment, fighting for his breath, suddenly passes out, going over with his 70 pound rucksack, hitting the ground with a loud bang.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(concerned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
On Chris - his eyes opening. He seems all right.

Chris crumples backwards. Elias helps him.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. COMPANY PERIMETER #1 - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The COMPANY - about 100 men who seem insignificant amid the size of the surrounding jungle - is digging into a perimeter of some 100-yard radius. A RESUPPLY CHOPPER lifts off in a flurry of blowing leaves. Bare-chested soldiers chop down trees, clear fields of fire, set out claymores, fill sandbags, chow down. Little fires snake up against the greying red horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COMPANY PERIMETER 31 - DOC'S POSITION - DUSK

We cut close on a pair of grungy feet - the staple of the infantry - moving up to DOC, the Medic, bandaging them for FU SHENG, a Hawaiin kid.

EXT. COMPANY PERIMETER #1 - RODRIGUEZ - POSITION - DUSK

Back in the perimeter RODRIGUEZ sets his M-60 in the newly dug foxhole. SAL, next to him, is shaving in his helmet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COMPANY PERIMETER #1 - KING'S POSITION - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KING looks like a king. A lion of a black man but with a sleepy, gentle face, not to be roused, is painfully trying to scrawl a letter home with the pencil held awkwardly, mouthing the words. FRANCIS, a young baby-faced black with long lashes and soft eyes, peeks over his shoulder, shaking his head.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, King, it ain't d-e-r-e man, it's d-e-a-r, and Sara don't have no two r's in it, fool. Shame on you.

EXT. COMPANY PERIMETER #1 - COMPANY PC - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sgt. Elias washes himself, attentive to his body, slender and well-muscled, and extremely handsome youth. Of Indian blood, with long black hair, generous smile, wide facial bone structure, gypsy eyes, and the cleanest white teeth, he could be a young Greek god. He is given somewhat to panache, a silver wristband on his arm, a bandana of black parachute silk hanging from his neck, his fatigues tightened down at the ankle, he pulls his pants down, checking for crotch rot, applying talcum powder to the area, his buttocks facing us.

At the COMPANY COMMAND POST a beehive of activity with its four radios, personnel, some Vietnamese scouts milling around. CAPTAIN HARRIS is running down a field map with his THREE LIEUTENANTS. Harris, a broad-shouldered fine-looking military specimen with the requisite Southern accent and football coach mannerism, is directing his remark to 2nd Platoon's LT.WOLFE, who looks a little nervous.

</BIG_HAROLD>
<DIRECTION>
They're both black, Junior with huge goggle eyes and a face of pimples and pockmarks, his teeth yellowed and decayed, some of them missing. Harold is about twice his size, about 250 pounds, a baby huey concentrating real hard on preparing his stove to eat with.

<DIRECTION>
(checking his raw blisters)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... the hardest thing I think I've ever done is to go on point, 3 times this week - I don't even know what I'm doing. A gook could be standing 3 feet in front of me and I wouldn't know it, I'm so tired. We get up at 5 a.m., hump all day, camp around 4 or 5 p.m., dig foxhole, eat, then put out an all-night ambush or a 3-man listening post in the jungle. It's scary cause nobody tells me how to do anything cause I'm new and nobody cares about the new guys, they don't even want to know your name. The unwritten rule is a new guy's life isn't worth as much cause he hasn't put his time in yet - and they say if you're gonna get killed in the Nam it's better to get it in the first few weeks, the logic being: you don't suffer that much. I can believe that ... If you're lucky you get to stay in the perimeter at night and then you pull a 3-hour guard shift, so maybe you sleep 3-4 hours a night, but you don't really sleep ... I don't think I can keep this up for a year, grandma - I think I've made a big mistake coming here ...

As he speaks, we cut around to various shots of the platoon members on the perimeter - shaving, eating, cooking, playing, etc ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLATOON PC - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Towards the end of this voice over, we cut to Sgt. BARNES moving towards the PLATOON PC. A powerful face, a quiet, angry fixed stare, a thick trimmed moustache that helps conceal a network of plastic surgery grafts and scars. The distortion from the jaw up the left side of his face to his forehead, punctuated by a severe indentation above the left eye where a bullet once penetrated his skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walking with him is Sgt. O'NEILL as they join WOLFE, Sgts. ELIAS and WARREN at the PLATOON PC where they're huddled over maps. Warren is a black, thin, tall, paranoid man with untrusting eyes, silent and bitter.

Barnes doesn't bother acknowledging the question, barely glancing at the Lieutenant, to him a necessary evil. Everybody knows who's really in charge of the Platoon. Barnes flicks his gaze to Elias.

	Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and Francis from your squad.

	I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.

They all look at each other. O'Neill spits in the dust, a freckled, short red head with a hard worried face, a lifer, 30 going on 60.

<O_NEILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.

Concluding the debate, no further argument, Barnes rises. The meeting's closed. Lt. Wolfe hasn't said a word, looking as Elias departs, without a word.

Chris is scared, nervous with his last-minute equipment adjustments, his pack obviously overweight for a night mission as he hauls it up.

Gardner shows him his girl. She's real dog u-g-l-y, and what makes it worse is Gardner's put the standard photo of Raquel Welch alongside it, tits and all. But he misses the irony of it.

The file stops. King, an experienced point man, listens.

Chris - carrying Tex's linked ammo - looks around, tense. Behind him is Gardner, trying to smile, starts to whisper something ('Hey Taylor ...') when he's abruptly shushed.

The file moves on. Gardner's pack rattling a little too loud. A weird rush of cold wind now rattles the trees and the MONSOON comes. A hard slanting rain, sudden, tropic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUINS - JUNGLE - NIGHT (RAIN)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A piece of an old Buddhist temple, under a sulky moonlight now in a state of decay, the jungle surging to engulf it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Men are setting up quickly and relatively quietly in the ruins - alongside a miniscule trail. The rain is coming down harder than ever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris and Tex setting out their claymore mines, raveling back their detonating cords to their position, drenched. In the far distance, an ILLUMINATION ROUND brightens the sky for a brief moment. Various ad lib curses and directions are lost in the sound of the rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AMBUSH - BARNES' POSITION - NIGHT (RAIN)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the Ambush CP, Ace whipsers into his radio. A soft hissing sound.

<DIRECTION>
('tough luck', closes his teeth)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris lets it go, scans the jungle and trail with the scope. The POV is greasy and blurred. He puts it aside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a series of resonant SNORES crack through the jungle. Chris starts, then sees it's from JUNIOR lying out there, spreadeagled in the rain. Chris prods him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Junior!

	CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHRIS' POSITION - NIGHT (RAIN)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later. A pool of muddy water has formed, in which a pair of buttocks sit. Move up to Chris still on duty, looking at his watch, drawn, drenched, pathetic, rainwater coursing down his face.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (continuing his letter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... 'Course Mom and Dad didn't want me to come, they wanted me to be just like them - respectable, hard- working, making $200 a week, a little house, a family. They drove me crazy with their goddamn world, grandma, you know Mom, I don't want to be a white boy on Wall Street, I don't want my whole life to be predetermined by them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
A large RIPPING SOUND as the wind blows down a big tree branch onto the jungle floor. He starts, peering out. Nothing. He looks at his watch again.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I guess I have always been sheltered and special, I just want to be anonymous. Like everybody else. Do my share for my country. Live up to what Grandpa did in the First War and Dad the Second. I know this is going to be the war of my generation. Well here I am - anonymous all right, with guys nobody really cares about - they come from the end of the line, most of 'em, small towns you never heard of - Pulaski, Tennessee, Brandon, Mississippi, Pork Bend, Utah, Wampum, Pennsylvania. Two years' high school's about it, maybe if they're lucky a job waiting for 'em back in a factory, but most of 'em got nothing, they're poor, they're the unwanted of our society, yet they're fighting for our society and our freedom and what we call America, they're the bottom of the barrel - and they know it, maybe that's why they call themselves 'grunts' cause a 'grunt' can take it, can take anything. They're the backbone of this country, grandma, the best I've ever seen, the heart and soul - I've found it finally, way down here in the mud - maybe from down here I can start up again and be something I can be proud of, without having to fake it, maybe ... I can see something I don't yet see, learn something I don't yet know ... I miss you, I miss you very much, tell Mom I miss her too - Chris.

He moves towards Junior, shakes him, but Junior seems to be out of this world.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Junior scowls, swears, looks around for his rifle in the mud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris crawls back to his position, curling himself up in his soaked poncho, teeth chattering from the cold, rain splattering over him. A long beat. He sighs, the sigh kicking off the next image.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHRIS' POSITION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris jerks awake - very suddenly, very frightened. THE RAIN HAS STOPPED. The jungle sounds are loud. Cicadas, night animals, water dripping hypnotically from leaf to leaf. And the whirr of a million mosquitoes out after the rains, chewing at Chris' face. He looks around, startled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tex is asleep. Junior is asleep. What happened? He looks at his watch. The mosquitoes are eating him alive. He buries his head in his green towel which he wears around his neck, but he can't see. A beat. He moves again, miserable from the bites. Another beat. Then suddenly the sounds of the jungle shift - some of the animals dropping out. A different tone. A piece of wood is stepped on, a rustle of bush ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris sees something, lifts an edge of the towel to peek out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shoadow of a figure is frozen there in front of him about 15 yards. It looks like a man. But it doesn't move. At all. It listens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris, his heart in his mouth, tries to peer through it. It's a bush. It has to be. No human being could stand that still. His heartbeats are up. The moments take forever. But deep down - somewhere in his psyche - he knows who it is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure now shifts, ever so slightly - and moves. It IS a human being. Oh my God!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris looks around. Tex seems like a mile away. Why doesn't anyone fire! He casts a desperate look at his rifle, at his grenades encrusted with mud, but in spite of all his training, he is frozen with indecision and fear at the sight of his enemy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure seems to whisper something back, then turns and comes down the trail. Now a second and third figure appear behind him - all in helmets and packs. All coming right past Chris' position. Ten yards. Nine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris is rigid with terror. Stark eyes. Pleading with Tex to wake up, but out of reach. He is about to have an anxiety attack, his heartbeats so far up he is sure they will hear him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first figure is now directly in front of Chris on the trail, looking left and right. A rattle of his equipment, a creak of leather. A smell. The man's face now catches the moonlight and his eyes come around on Chris.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oriental eyes. Looking right at him. Startled. Chris staring back, hypnotized. It all happens very fast. The figure murmurs something in Vietnamese. A warning. He swivels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A flash of muzzle fire. A raking cough of automatic fire. A grenade explosion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris is hurled to the ground, helmet bouncing off, scattered, confused, jarred. All hell breaks loose around him with NOISE and SHOUTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tex, kissing the ground, is yelling at him.
</DIRECTION>
<TEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THE CLAYMORE! GET THOSE FUCKERS!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEX>
<DIRECTION>
Chris, not knowing what he's doing, is fumbling with the claymore handles, presses them. INSERT: They won't give. He tries again and again to the squeeze the life out of them. Tex is screaming at him.
</DIRECTION>
<TEX>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THE SAFETY! TAKE THE SAFETY OFF YOU ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEX>
<DIRECTION>
Lunges over and grabs the handle from Chris. Clicks the safeties off and blows them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three EXPLOSIONS rip out into the night - and one of the ENEMY is caught in a brief instant looking like an X-ray, his body lifted and swirling in the air, then enveloped in swirls of smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris, trying to keep up, grabs his M-16, lays out a stream of fire. The sound all around him is deafening.
</DIRECTION>

Gardner, freaking out, stands crouched, confused, tries to run, collapses.

Tex is now on the M-60 machine gun, yelling at Junior who is cringing on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<TEX>

He lays out red tracer bullets like laser beams, then suddenly reels back, whiplashed, screaming. A grenade explosion rocks them.

	<DIALOGUE>
	HOLD IT UP! HOLD IT UP!
	</DIALOGUE>

The firing has ceased. A silence, punctuated by occasional shouts and fast moments, has enveloped once more the cemetery. Doc crashes through the bush, kneels over Tex, who continues to howl in deep pain.

Chris watching, suddenly feels himself dizzy, instinctively runs his hands over the back of his neck. Feels the warm blood there. A moan comes from his lips. Junior looks at him.

Doc finishes tourniquetting Tex, cradles Chris onto the earth, his flashlight probing the wound. Tex in background continues to thrash and moan.

Tex's eyes roll wildly, uncomprehending. Doc and Big Harold looking at Barnes, wondering. Tex is suddenly silent, shocked. Barnes stands, an icy glare, goes. Junior scrambles over to Tex's side. Doc runs off.

Big Harold cradles Chris, his big black hands like a mother, reassuring him.

EXT. GARDNER'S POSITION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At one of the positions Doc is working feverishly to knock the life back into Gardner who lies there, his shirt stripped off on his cottage cheese belly. A huge sucking chest wound. He's dying. You know it because he knows it. The eyes do the talking, numb, terrorized yet strangely detached, accepting, not protesting or concerned any longer.

Most of the ambush has assembled and is watching, Chris moving in to see. Doc is mumbling to him, low key.

EXT. BASE CAMP - DAY (WEEK LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris is driven up in a jeep to his Company PC - marked 'Bravo PC' on a C-ration box. It's midday on a hot lazy afternoon, few people out in the 102 degree sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris' Company is on the outskirts of the base camp, their barracks regulation wood, canvas, and fine mesh screening, red dust everywhere, bunkers down on the perimeter, reams of barbed wire and concertina, a sand-bagged MESS HALL and CHAPEL, 81 mm mortar pits, observation towers, recoiless rifles, 50-caliber machine guns.

Chris gets out of the jeep, stiff-necked, a bandage around it, still in some pain. The first man he intersects is KING, carrying crates of beer.

<KING>

</KING>
<DIRECTION>
King has long sleepy eyelids and cat's eyes, a large pink tongue and big white-edged cotton picker's nails - a lazy, gentle nature, content with the world.

<CHRIS>

<CRAWFORD>

	Sounds like it.

</CRAWFORD>
<DIRECTION>
They pause, wipe the sweat off. King lighting up a half-smoked joint, hitting a few puffs, eyes shooting around, making sure he's not spotted, passing it to Crawford.
</DIRECTION>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheeit, gotta be rich in the first place to think like dat. Everybody know the poor always being fucked by the rich. Always have, always will.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAWFORD>
<DIRECTION>
The joint proferred. Chris waits a beat, shrugs, takes it, smokes.
</DIRECTION>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suck it in. Hold it ... That's it. Now let it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>

Chris blows it out.

	CUT TO:
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTHOUSE - LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
King, Crawford and Chris pour kerosene over the cans at a secure distance from the outhouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
King lights it. The cans pop and start crackling. A line of burning barrels. Rings of dirty black smoke rise against a soft blue sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They watch, stoned. Chris turns to both of them.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... you know that night we got hit ... I ...

</KING>
<CRAWFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	History, man, history.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAWFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Chris surprised at their attitude. The joint suddenly hits him, a look in his face, eyes looking around different. Over at King.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(deadpans)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'm starting to feel that stuff ...

<KING>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Later ...

</KING>
<DIRECTION>
Chris alone, breathes deep, feeling the full effect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A relief against the long harsh, hot day. We see lights on all over the camp, sounds of music, laughter from the barracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERWORLD HUTCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
King leads Chris down to a specially constructed cellar-like hutch dug deep into the ground on an isolated edge of the battalion perimeter. Ammo casing and canvas are piled over it, and sandbags surround it. From the outside very little sound can be heard as they go down through a trap door made of ammo crates. Past a lookout (Adams) pulling security, hitting a joint but alert. King motions to him, it's cool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside is another world. Chris looking around amazed. It's like a private cabaret for the 'heads' who are there cooling out. Boxes of food from the States, beers, whiskey bottles, crates functioning as tables, hammocks hanging from poles, electric fans, tape decks, paraphenalia.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys are all dressed up in their Saturday night rags. The clothes are clean, the headbands, the medallions are out, anything distinctive and individualistic. On the tapedeck, Jefferson Airplane's 'Go Ask Alice'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To Chris it is a new world. And RHAH, the resident head, sitting there in all his finery puffing a huge burning red bowl in a three foot long Montagnard pipe, seems to be the lord of final judgement in this smoky underworld.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across his naked chest, birds and snakes are tatooed. Around his neck a black skull and white ivory cross side by side. On his knuckles 'Love' and 'Hate' are tattooed. In his eyes, a dancing Satanic fire. A poor rural Southern white, in his grizzled late 20's, he could be a Biker King. Giving Chris the once-over.
</DIRECTION>
<RHAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHAH>
<KING>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<DIRECTION>
Chris wondering what he's doing here. His eyes roving over LERNER, CRAWFORD, MANNY, FLASH, FRANCIS, HOYT, TUBBS, DOC, other from the Platoon, about 9 or 10 of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rhah eyes him back, hands him the bowl.
</DIRECTION>
<RHAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lame Taylor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHAH>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>

<KING>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... go ahead on, smoke it man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<DIRECTION>
Chris understands, takes the bowl. Hesitates. Then smokes it. The contact fumes are almost enough to knock him out. He starts coughing. They're all laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<RHAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your shit's in the wind troop. Baaaaah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHAH>
<DIRECTION>
Lerner replies, his tongue hanging out in parody.
</DIRECTION>
<LERNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LERNER>
<RHAH>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at Lerner with distaste)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHAH>
<DIRECTION>
Building up to it, his eyes shaking with conviction at the whole insanity of the world, he neighs with all the venom he can muster.
</DIRECTION>
<RHAH>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHAH>
<DIRECTION>
They all laugh and applaud. King smoking from the pipe passing it back to Chris who takes another hit, doesn't cough this time, looking around, wondering about these guys.
</DIRECTION>
<LERNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LERNER>
<RHAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHAH>
<DIRECTION>
They go on ad-libbing with each other, teasing Doc, who's fairly straight, saying he wants to go to med school in the fall. 'Be what?''A gynecologist, man.''What dat?' Francis suggests, 'Dats a pussy doctor, man - he's gonna be Doctor Feelgood, man!' They're all cracking up, finding every joke funny. As Chris finishes his hit on the pipe, looks up across the smoke, already dazed, surprised to see ELIAS suddenly there - leaning out of his sling in a far corner of the hooch. A Monkey is draped around his neck with silver bracelets, rings, a necklace - like a sensual little Egyptian whore, Elias playing with it, spaced out in a sleeveless vest, tiger pants. Dancing eyes on Chris, he swings out the hammock, comes over with the monkey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile Manny has broken into a high falsetto snatch of blues directed at Chris, joined by Big Harold and Francis, all of them clicking their hands.
</DIRECTION>
<MANNY_BIG_HAROLD_DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oooh Chris, you look like you is high oh yeah, he looks like he is high Ooooh Chris, you know you gonna be that way all night oh yeah I think that you are ... Yeah! up now and up to par oh yeah.

Elias pulls out a Remington 870 shotgun, jacks it to the rear, points it at Chris.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put your mouth on that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Chris does so slowly, a little worried. Elias takes a hit and blows it down the bore - 'shotgunning' it into Chris' lungs. Chris staggers back, coughing. Everybody laughes 'hey dude - you done had your ass blown away' etc ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elias smiles his big white-tooth smile.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>

</CHRIS>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feelin' good's good enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
As he sucks in a huge mass of smoke off the bowl. His eyes performing a funny little hop, skip and jump, as he holds it, his face turning red.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The monkey jabbers and jumps around on his neck, worried. Elias then blows the smoke out in its face, the monkey hating it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Group laughes.

INT. THE BARRACKS - NIGHT

In comparison to the darkness of the hooch, a highly lit atmosphere, attracting bugs ... dusty gear lying around a disordered hooch, loud and finger-snapping COUNTRY WESTERN MUSIC playing from a tape deck, a well-known tune, circa 1967.

Lt. WOLFE wanders down the aisle, beer in hand, slightly lonely, bypassing FU SHENG, the Hawaiin and TONY, a mustached hairy- browed Italian kid from Boston, who are playing some kind of dice game. They hardly acknowledge the Lieutenant who stops by RODRIGUEZ, the Mexican-American kid who is on his cot in his neatly arranged area writing a letter home with a pencil, forming his words with his mouth, as always minding his own business. Religious objects comprise his few decorations.

Wolfe winks at him, continues on to the POKER GAME going on in the center of the barracks, the main action. BARNES, Sgts.O'NEILL and WARREN, the quiet sullen black, SANDERSON and SAL play as ACE, the tiny radio kid, and MOREHOUSE look on; all of them drinking beer and bourbon chasers from a bottle.

Barnes, raking in the chips, is the big winner, a light bead of sweat on his forehead and a somewhat glassy look to the eye the only indication he is drunk - his shirt peeled off revealing a muscular, scarred body.

The Hutch looks now like a Turkish bath with minimum visibility, the smoke fumes dense. They are all up dancing on their feet - King, Tubbs, Big Harold, Hoyt, Lerner, Crawford, Flash, Doc, Elias - a few light gestures with their hands above shoulder level, passing around the grass pipes while they shuffle, fingers clicking. The song - Smokey Robinson's "Tracks of My Tears" - accompanies them from a vintage tapedeck.

Rhah watches it all, puffing away on his magic dragon pipe, the shadows dancing on the walls.

It looks like a Saturday night dance party. A yearning for tenderness, for feminity, for a moment of peace in this nightmare life. Their eyes closed, thinking of dance partners that can't be here tonight. Singing their souls out.

<DIRECTION>
An overwhelming 103 degree heat. Chris is once more on point, a little better now but obviously struggling with a thick unyielding bamboo thicket that forces him forward in a caveman crouch. Napalm jelly is hanging from the trees in great canopies of spider webs, obliterating the sky.

The bunker, dug into the ground and camouflaged with brush, is staring right at him, not more than 20 feet away. Chris is a dead man if ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes, checking the terrain, signals radioman Hoyt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes edging up to the bunker, eyes everywhere. Chris following. The tension builds. They come up to the edge of it, peer in. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes walks around it, slips in from back. Chris covers him, other guys coming up now, making a small perimeter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris now starts to see things he didn't see. Right in front of his nose - there is a trench from this bunker to another and another. There is now in his view a complex of bunkers and thatched hootches and lean-tos all blending into the forest. A ghost city ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elias and others fanning out now, careful ... whispered conversations in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris moves past a rope with freshly washed laundry stretching between two trees, clothes stirring in the wind. He looks up as King points out a treehouse, then looks down as Lerner whispers something and points - NVA rucksacks are laid out on the ground in an orderly platoon-sized pattern.

Manny, the skinny black boy with the coloured beads, is out on flank - alone, smoking a cigarette, humming.

EXT. NVA BUNKER - CHRIS' POSITION - DAY
</DIRECTION>

On the other flank, Chris, also alone, waits, listening to the sounds of the jungle. He too is smoking a cigarette. The eeriness is everywhere. Rays of morning light peeking through the cathedral dome of the jungle. Bird calls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NVA TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elias climbs deeper and deeper into the hole, a rope attached to his waist leading out to the surface, his flashlight now coming around on a shaftway demarcating a TUNNEL that seems to stretch for at least 100 yards. The light revealing cobwebs all along it, but tall enough for a small man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHRIS' POSITION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's quiet, weird. Chris takes his pants down, squats. He thinks he hears something, tenses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a soft rustling sound now. And as he focuses on it he realizes it is coming from very close to him. Something light and sinuous moving over the leaves. He looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bright yellow and orange-ringed krait viper is crawling right between his two legs. It stops, senses another life standing over it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris frozen with dread.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The snake crawls on, pulling its long, long 15 foot body behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On Chris, eyes dilated, slowly regaining his breath looking around everywhere now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NVA TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elias moving down the tunnel, fearless. We expect something any moment to come out and nail him but nothing does. He stops. His flashlight revealing a kitchen and an NVA hospital set up. A hammock swings as if someone just deserted it. In another hammock is a dead man. Elias advances cautiously.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. NVA BUNKER - COMPLEX - SANDERSON POSITION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spec 4 Sanderson, the big handsome blond kid, is moving through an abandoned bunker. With him is Sal, a tough street kid with an intense face, all whiskered. Sanderson noticing now a metal box of 50-caliber ammo, U.S. marking, half-buried in the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDERSON>

Barnes runs up. Black smoke sweeping through the trees. Sal suddenly appears, stepping out of the smoke, stunned. The front of his body is soaked in blood from a thousand shrapnel holes, his clothes shredded, he stares at Barnes, dazed. Both his arms are gone and blood is geysering out like a water fountain. He crumbles - dead or dying.

</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
The Young Man hops up and down in a reflex fear of the sounds of the bullets as they thud into the dirt. Yet his eyes remain fixed on Chris in wonderment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris, firing out the magazine, seems to expend his bloodlust. He ceases, noticing - for the first time - the eyes of the Young Man. They aren't stupid - nor fearful - but filled with resignation and despair - a despair that Chris, in disgust of himself, recognizes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris lowers the rifle, silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Young Man's impassive face shines now with tears. That sad young look - as if death itself would've been a release. Chris turns his eyes away, an awkward sense of shame.

	Yeah sure you are, you're real sorry ain't you. You're just crying out your hearts about Sandy and Sal and Manny - they're laughing at us! Their family is out there in the fucking bush blowing us away and they're laughing at us!

</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
Chris standing there, watching, sensing something awful is going to come and unable to do anything about it. It comes - suddenly and without warning. Bunny is looking at O'Neill, the Vietnamese couple are muttering something. In one fluid move, Bunny swivels and with unbelievable savagery clubs the young one-legged man in the side of the head with the butt of his 16.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. CENTRAL AREA - VILLAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tiny knot of men are ringed around Barnes who is questioning a sturdy-looking man who is the VILLAGE CHIEF. He has been stripped of his shirt, scars all over his body, scared. He has his ID papers out, trembling, showing them to Lerner who speaks some pidgen Vietnamese.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd he get these wounds?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
Lerner translates, the man talking back.
</DIRECTION>
<LERNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says he was hit in a bombing raid.

<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a dink fosure.

</TONY>
<BARNES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ask him what the weapons are doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNES>
<LERNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says they had no choice. The NVA killed the old honcho when he said no. He says the rice is theirs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LERNER>
<BARNES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullshit ... who the hell was the dink we just nailed on the riverbank?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
Chris and O'Neill come up, watch. Others coming from different places - sensing the narrowing drama. But half the platoon is still at work in the village. We hear shouts, grenade explosions, occasionally gunfire.
</DIRECTION>
<LERNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... He says he doesn't know, NVA haven't been around in a couple of months. Maybe it was a scout or ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LERNER>
<DIRECTION>
The men around Barnes grumble.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah sure it was. What about all that fucking rice and the weapons ... who they for?

<DIRECTION>
(a blank look)
</DIRECTION>
<ACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're goddamn right he does!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACE>
<DIRECTION>
Lerner translating. The Village Chief's WIFE is now on the scene, a middle-aged woman with angry features, yelling at Lerner trying to answer for her husband, a high-pitched barrage of indignant words directed mostly at Barnes, and interspersed with the spitting of her betel nuts on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Village Chief trying to talk her down. But things are definitely getting out of control. And the heat from the sun is only aggravating the situation, pounding down on the actors in the drama, their fatigues soaked in sweat and anger.
</DIRECTION>
<LERNER>
<DIRECTION>
(finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He swears he doesn't know anything! He hates the NVA but they come when they want and ...

<LERNER>

	She's going on, I don't know - why are we shooting the pigs, they're farmers ... they got to make a living, all that crap ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LERNER>
<DIRECTION>
The Woman is still ranting when Barnes turns to her, quite casually levels his M-16, and puts a bullet in her head. She goes down as if pole-axed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stunned pause. The Chief looking at his wife. The Villagers in background reacting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wolfe looking ... Chris looking, shocked. Doc, possibly the straightest of them all, very uncomfortable. They are all shocked insome way, but do nothing against the power of Banres. Barnes walks over to the pig pen with the other Villagers, very casually, confronts them.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
(to Lerner)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him he talks or I'm gonna waste more of 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
Lerner shaken up, muttering to the Village Chief who is in shock, kneeling next to the body of his wife, muttering in a high whine of pain.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead, Lerner, ask him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
A group of Villagers huddle to one side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lerner, shaken, is yelling at all of them, demanding an answer.
</DIRECTION>
<LERNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't know Sarge, they don't know!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(half believes it)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes turns his attention on the other villagers, his intentions apparent. Everybody feels them. They're next. Barnes is unperturbed, very much in command of the situation, no rage, no emotions expressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris has never seen such a thing in his life - but can't react. Can't stop it, just watches it like he's not quite there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same goes for Lieutenant Wolfe, for all of them. The very outrageousness of Barns' killing seems to quell all protest.
</DIRECTION>
<ACE>
<DIRECTION>
(sensing the impending massacre)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Sarge can we get in on this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACE>
<DIRECTION>
Tony advances, the hairy Italian kid from Boston.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go all the way, let's go for it! Let's do the whole fucking village. Come on, Sarge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
Chris' eyes ... Rodriguez next to him, is neutral but willing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francis is hesitant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fu Sheng and Junior are ready to go for it. Lt.Wolfe is powerless, frozen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sgt.Warren stepping up. The massacre is just about to break.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Villagers know it, kneel in prayer, mutter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes suddenly grabs and drags a young 19 year-old Woman, the Village Chief's daughter, across the pen, throws her down on her knees, in front of the stunned Village Chief. She's screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This his daughter, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
Lerner nods. Barnes pulls his .45, puts it alongside her head.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (to Village Chief)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lie ... You Vee Cee ... I caca ado Vee Cee!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
He chambers the .45, the Woman begging Barnes for her life, cradling his knees. He sticks the gun down above her skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris wanting to cry out, to do something - but can't!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FIGURE suddenly flares out in the sun, advancing on them. It is Elias.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BARNES!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes looks around. They all look around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elias walks right up to him, followed by his men - King, Rhah, Crawford, others from the rear party. He looks around. The corpse of the Wife ... the Young Daughter sobbing.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>

</BARNES>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
The stock of his rifle swings up fast and hard smacking Barnes full in the face, breaking two teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes staggers back, hurt, bleeding. Elias is on him like a leopard. Battering him with his fists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They struggle in the dust, two titans, their faces equally consumed with rage, clawing, spitting, punching, kicking, pounding each other's skulls in the dirt. A dust storm swirls around them, the men closing around like excited apes at a bloodfeast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Most of the men seem to be pulling for Barnes - Chris just watching neutral.
</DIRECTION>
<LIEUTENANT_WOLFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BREAK IT UP! ELIAS! BARNES!

But they rool on, smashing each other's faces in. Both quick, fast, agile, mean fighters. Sgts.O'Neill and Warren drag them apart.

	No I don't. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Who wants to be reminded? A silence of shame. The Men moving away, Warren, Ace, Tony, Rodriguez, Barnes looking back once, a cold glare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Village Chief is a broken-looking man, huddled over his wife's body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elias stands there, frustrated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris glances at him, moves out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SMALL VILLAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A zippo cigarette lighter with the engraved initials: 'From Mai lin to my Bunny Boy'. It sparks a thick flare as Bunny lights the dry straw on the roof of the Hutch where he killed the Old Woman and Young Boy.

Their legs sticking out at the threshold. The hooch burning fast, aided by the strong sun.

EXT. VILLAGE - EDGE OF WOODLINE - DAY

Hidden at the edge of the woodline, King hands back a bowl of grass to Rhah, the chief head. They're puffing away.

</RHAH>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VILLAGE - DITCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a ditch running alongside the Village, partially concealed by foliage and anthills, Tony, Morehouse, and the ubiquitous Bunny have a 12-YEAR-OLD VIETNAMESE GIRL pinned to the ground, gagged and squirming, naked. They are fucking her to death. Junior looks on, both curious and disgusted, but doesn't take part.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take her up the ass ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
As they roll her over, like excited dogs in heat.
</DIRECTION>

Chris, coming up, sees their heads dipping up and down on the other side of the anthill, knows what they're doing. He makes a conscious decision to do something. He runs over.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LET HER GO! YOU HEAR ME! YOU ASSHOLE! LET HER GO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>

He strides right into them, shoves them off hard. The girl is in tears.

	NO - YOU STUPID FUCK ... DON'T ... DON'T ... YOU TOO BUNNY. MOREHOUSE. OFF! NO! DON'T ... DON'T!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He seems disconnected, dazed by the sun, like he's talking to dogs - loud, repetitive words coming out of an anger he can barely control, trying to restore some sanity to a world gone totally nuts today. Don't they understand? Don'tthey have any sense of a mind? Any kind of decency?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Men looking at him as if he's the one who's gone nuts, not them. Bunny looking at Morehouse looking at Tony looking at Junior. The irony is lost on them, as Chris pushes through to help the poor girl put her scanty clothes back on.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Get outta here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
The men grumble and slink off quietly. Elias watching as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris helps her to her feet, wounded in the intestines, she can barely stand, blood saoking in her nether regions. Chris slings her up as gently as he can and carries her.

EXT. VILLAGE - PIG PEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near the pig pen, a DOZEN SUSPECTS are being led away on ropes by Tubbs, Warren, Rodriguez. The others left behind look back at their village in ruins, homes burning, livestock dead or scattered, belongings thrown and broken in the dirt. BABIES wail, the adults squat there on their heels watching with absolutely no trace of outward emotion.

Past this Bosch-like canvas, Chris - carrying the girl - walks dazed by the horrors of this long afternoon.

EXT. VILLAGE TRAIL - DAY

EXT. PERIMETER #2 - CHRIS' POSITION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Chris is turning in his sleep, perturbed, writhing. The whispering is more and more urgent. Death is all around. He shoots up out of his poncho liner as if shot, stunned. Scared. Looks around. All is quiet. Men sleeping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elias is huddled in his poncho on guard next to his foxhole. Chris joins him, sitting, wiping the sleep from his eyes.

Elias' eyes seem to go to some inner place, his passion surging.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... we been kicking other people's asses so long I guess it's time we got our own kicked. The only decent thing I can see coming out of here are the survivors - hundreds of thousands of guys like you Taylor going back to every little town in the country knowing something about what it's like to take a life and what that can do to a person's soul - twist it like Barnes and Bunny and make 'em sick inside and if you got any brains you gonna fight it the rest of your life cause it's cheap, killing is cheap, the cheapest thing I know and when some drunk like O'Neill starts glorifying it, you're gonna puke all over him and when the politicians start selling you a used war all over again, you and your generation gonna say go fuck yourself 'cause you know, you've seen it, and when you know it, deep down there ...

He shrugs, a certain bravado masking his own uncertainty.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... You ever think about reincarnation, all that stuff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
A lightning quick movement follows. Elias' hand passing over his face like a mime, a click of the fingers and he leans closer to Chris. A new expression on his face. Devil's eyes, mocking child, danger in his soul, excitement, sex - the Elias that Chris saw in the smoking session in base camp. Chris smiles, sucked in, almost laughs and then the face is gone again.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, goes on all the time. Maybe a piece of me's in you now, who knows. But when you die - really die - that's a big return ticket.

EXT. JUNGLE - STREAM - DAY (RAIN)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Platoon moves along a shallow STREAM bordering the jungle. A thick RAIN falls amid cracks of distant thunder. Chris, Rhah, Francis, Big Harold, others are at the rear of the platoon, their ponchos pulled over them like big sad grey tents. There's a holdup ahead and the Men rest on rocks or stand. The rain makes a pointilistic pattern, the men collages of grey, their rifles slung upside down to keep dry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes is up ahead, out of the stream bank, on the radio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JUNGLE CHURCH - DAY (RAIN)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lerner's on point, resting in the shadow of a decaying old French Catholic Church from the 19th Century. The jungle has long ago won the battle, vines creeping into the cracks, remnants of arches layered around the church at the epicenter. Behind Lerner is Sgt.Warren and his radioman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY (RAIN)

EXT. JUNGLE - STREAM - DAY (RAIN)

Back at the stream, Rhah, looking old and whiskered under his poncho hood, lights up a roach, puffs it. Another crack of thunder. Chris comes over, sits with him on his rock. Rhah passes him the joint. He smokes.

His eyes moving to Sgt.Warren lying alongside a tree - calmly trying to stack his intestines back into his ruptured stomach. Another RPG comes in.

Chris makes a conscious decision, moves up - bit by bit, shielding himself with tree stumps, ant hills, laying out fire, trying to get closer to Lerner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francis following his progress, bug-eyed.

Fu Sheng now comes up with his M-60 - Harold his loader, belts of ammo flapping against their bodies. He fires from the hip, providing cover fire for Chris, then pops down.

Chris, firing out another magazine, crawls closer to Lerner, trying to ascertain if he's still alive.

<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lerner! Lerner, can you hear me man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Lerner groans. A fresh burst of AK fire rakes the area. Lerner jerks spasmodically with the impact of the rounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris spots the sniper. In a hole in the ground. Twenty-five meters off. Snapping the magazine out of his AK to reload. A live gook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris tears off a volley at him but the gook disappears in the hole. This is the moement, Chris realizes it, it's now or never if Chris intends to get the gook. He's got to make a move before the man has reloaded his weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls his grenade, pops the pin. He lets the spoon fly off, activating the grenade-timer, as he humps to his feet and runs for the gook hole, concentrating, concentrating. That head is going to pop up any second with a freshly-loaded weapon and tear his head off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris won't make it back to the hole. The throw has to be perfect. He won't get another chance. He heaves the frag, drops and rolls away. The throw is perfect, the golden arc of flight from the outfield nailing the baserunner. It twists cleanly in the hole. The explosion muffled but deadly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris scrambles to his feet, a look of almost total surprise on his face. He can't seem to believe he did it. Pointing his M-16 before him, he advances on the hole, looking over the muzzle to see the badly-mangled NVA man twisted at the bottom.
</DIRECTION>

Chris hurries over to Lerner. He's in bad shape, hit in several places, vaguely conscious.

It explodes. This is about three times the intensity of the RPG. The jungle floor shakes, trees splinter. Barnes is knocked to his knees, rimaces in pain. Hoyt, Barnes' radio operator, screams out as a fist-sized chunk of hot shrapnel sticks in his back. He's screeching, frantically trying to shuck the radio from his back, his fatigue shirt smoking.

Barnes jerks the radio off Hoyt's back, knocks the man to his knees and unsheathes his bayonet. Ripping off the back of his shirt, Barnes sets to digging out the shrapnel.

Next to the Church deployed in the jungle, Rhah looks on, silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris in his position, waits. It is so silent in comparison to the racket from the battle across the forest. The Mist clings to the trees, moist and lovely. Then, a flicker of movement, sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris hears it, tightens. His POV - at fifty yards. An evanescence of beige and green uniforms moving towards him very fast, scurrying. They look like headless ghosts.

Chris opens fire.

EXT. ELIAS' JUNGLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elsewhere, Elias stands silently, listens to the forest. In the distance the firefight can hardly be heard. His helmet gone, his hair hanging free, he is at his best now - alone. He hears it. Somebody running through the jungle, about 100 yards, boots on leaves, coming towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to move lateral to the sound. His steps unheard, better at this than the enemy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE ENEMY FIGURES now appear, crouched and moving very fast with light equipment through the mist.

Elias swerves up in immediate foreground, his back to us, FIRING. All three Figures fall.

EXT. BARNES' JUNGLE - DAY

Barnes, moving through the jungle, reacts to the fire, resetting his course. Like a hunter stalking a deer. Suddenly there's more firing. Then silence -

EXT. ELIAS' JUNGLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO MORE ENEMY lie dead in the jungle. A rustle of movement, then a CRY - chilling, jubilant, a war cry.

A pair of feet moving lightly over the jungle. A glimpse of Elias. In his full glory. Roaming the jungle, born to it.

An NVA SOLDIER, jungle-whiskered, dirty, smart, crouches, listens, looks to his PARTNER. What are they fighting here? The First One mutter something sharp and they split fast in the direction they've come.

They get about six steps when Elias suddenly rises up from the bush, not ten yards in front of them, his shots ripping into them, driving the surprised life from them. Elias is gone.

Barnes moving, stops, listens. Something is running towards him. But it's hidden by the bush. He brings his rifle up smooth and quick, waits, then as the bush parts, Elias is standing there. Looking at Barnes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes sees him, starts to lower his rifle, but then stops. He raises it back an inch, sights it. Pause. A cold searing look of hatred coming over his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In that moment, Elias understands. Quick as a deer, he makes his move, trying to plunge back into the bush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes fires. Once, twice, three times - the blast rocking the jungle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elias jerking backwards into the bush, mortally wounded. Bird cries. A crime against nature.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes calmly lowers his rifle, and walks away from it.
</DIRECTION>

Chris, cutting through the jungle, hears the shots. He stops, listens. Someone is moving through bush towards him, leaves and foliage shaking.

Barnes steps through into his sight - sees him.

TWO CHOPPERS are coming into a LZ in front of the Church. The two platoons, Second and Third, reinforcing, are being evacuated as quickly as possible, one load (6-8 men, depending on the wounded) after other.

Chris catching a glimpse of him, waiting to get on the chopper, turning to look as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hoyt and Sgt.Warren, both wounded, are hurried aboard on litters. The chopper lifting off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris and others now running to the corpses of Flash, Morehouse, and Fu Sheng lying under dirty ponchos, their boots sticking out. The ponchos are blown away in a burst of wind off the chopper blades, revealing their faces - dirt stuffing their eyes and mouths, waxen figures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris and the others lifting them and carrying them towards the next chopper now coming in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They throw the bodies on. Tubbs and Crawford, both wounded, now move past Chris, into the chopper. Chris running back, with King carrying a litter - their eyes falling on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes talking with Wolfe and Ace, making signals under the roaring sounds of the chopper. Shaking his head. No. No Elias.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris and King looking at each other, mute. They numbly start loading Big Harold, minus his leg, onto the stretcher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Third Chopper is down now, waiting, roaring blades silhouetting off the face of the cathedral. A ROCKET BLAST suddenly goes off not too far from the chopper, incoming fire. The DOOR GUNNER signaling for them to hurry, laying out fire.

Chris and King hustling Big Harold's 250 pounds into the chopper. Climbing in with him. Wolfe, Barnes, Ace running in with them. The perimeter is bare.

Chris' eyes flitting over Barnes as he jumps in. The chopper lifting off as another explosion rocks the area. The Door Gunner sees something, opens up.

Barnes is looking. So's Lt.Wolfe, so's Ace. So's the Door Gunner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elias is coming out of the jungle. Staggering, blood disfiguring his face and chest, hanging on with all his dimming strength, looking up at them - trying to reach them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris shakes Wolfe, his words drowned out by the roar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chopper Captain looking down, dips. His co-pilot pointing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The NVA are coming out of the jungle, closing on the spot where Elias is.

Incoming rounds are hitting the chopper. The Door Gunner maniacally firing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes looking down at the man, can't believe it.
</DIRECTION>

Elias is on his last legs now, obviously being hit by the incoming fire of the NVA. He falls to his knees, still stretching upwards for life.

The Chopper Captain shakes his head at Wolfe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chopper dips one more time firing at the NVA, low and fierce over the jungle.

</RHAH>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes stands there, silhouetted in the trap door, looking down at the men who are stunned to see him here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He steps down into the hutch, his face now lit by candle light. A bottle of whiskey in his hand, drunk, ugly, sweating, but as always, with dignity, possessive of his silence. He feels their fear in the silence, enjoys it.

King, the biggest one there, is about to say something, but the moment passes.

	</DIALOGUE>
</KING_AND_OTHERS>
<DIRECTION>
But Barnes is too quick and very strong and takes the blows, getting outside Chris' arm, twisting and flipping him in a wrestler's grip - throwing him hard onto his back on the dirt floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The expression of the Men watching slumps, their hopes dashed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes springs around on Chris, straddles him, one hand pushing his face back, hits him hard. Once. Twice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris grimaces, groans, helpless now. A flick of sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A knife whipped out of Barnes' boot and pressing against Chris' throat. Chris bleeding from the nose and mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rhah suddenly spinning into action, fast now, realizing what Barnes intends to do.
</DIRECTION>
<RHAH>

</RHAH>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes' eyes tremble in the candle light, his scars ugly, a spasm clenching and locking his facial muscles. Then suddenly he is calm again, very calm. We sense a man of enormous self-control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he flicks his knife across Chris, leaving a mark below his left eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris gasps. Looking up at Barnes rising off him. The boots alongside his face.

The Men looking on, the tension lowering.

EXT. AIR SHOTS - JUNGLE, CHURCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris sits at the very edge of a Huey Chopper, bandana around his forehead, long hair blowing in the wind, Barnes' mark below his eyes, slicked out now like a jungle veteran, looking down at the VILLAGE where the massacre occurred.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Village is still a smoking ruin, a few peasants and water buffalo straggling like ants to reconstruct.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bunny, next to Chris, pops his gum, indifferent. Barnes, next to him, shifts, reads a map.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rodriguez is praying, his mouth moving without audible words, getting ready for the drop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
King is making last minute adjustments in his pack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bunny now nudges Chris, points. The Church in the Jungle where Elias was killed is visible. An outline of the Cemetery. Uncomfortable memories play over Chris' face.
</DIRECTION>

	They sent us back into the valley the next day - about 2,000 metres from Cambodia - into a battalion perimeter. Alpha Company had been hit hard the day before by a sizeable force and Charlie Company had been probed that night. There were other battalions in the valley, we weren't the only ones but we knew we were going to be the bait to lure them out. And somewhere out there was the entire 141st NVA Regiment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
The BATTALION PERIMETER now breaks in the clear ahead. Smoke grenades of various colors are being popped on the cleared LZ. It's not big, its radius 200 yards, heavily sandbagged, deeply dug, rolls of barbed wire protecting it, radio antennas sprouting from the CP - and surrounded on all four sides by jungle.
</DIRECTION>

The First Chopper rocking down, whipping up dust clouds. Chris jumps out, moving out fast as the Second Chopper starts in.

At the Battalion CP, the Major confers with Captain Harris and two other Captains. Two NVA PRISONERS are sitting on their knees, interrogated by Vietnamese Kit Carson scouts and a U.S. Sergeant, their hands tied.

EXT. PLATOON CP - PERIMETER #3 - DUSK

All this is watched from a distance by Ace and Doc and Lt.Wolfe at the Platoon CP. Ace and Doc are digging the foxhole, the ace of spades in Ace's helmet band, sharing the information with Tony and Francis.
</DIRECTION>
<ACE>

EXT. PERIMETER #3 - CHRIS' FOXHOLE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the edge of the perimeter, King puts out his claymore, unraveling it back towards his FOXHOLE, intersecting MEN form the Third Platoon, who file out on a night ambush, skirting the trip wires, demoralized, silent. Eye exchanges, but no words.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris sits on the foxhole watching the ambush go out, smoking a joint by himself, depressed. King comes in with the claymore wires, attaching them to their detonators. Their foxhole - as are all of the Platoon's - is positioned just inside the treeline bordering the LZ, so that they are quite isolated from the center of the perimeter where they first landed.
</DIRECTION>

At the LZ, King runs out, gets on the last SUPPLY CHOPPER with some other men. It lifts off, swirling dust, the last rays of daylight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris watches from a Battalion CP area, waves back - the chopper sound receding in the horizon, the comparative silence of the jungle now creeping up on the perimeter. He turns and starts back to his foxhole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man is watching him. He's sitting on a sandbag, face in shadow. It startles Chris, something about him. Something different. A deep West Virginia drawl.

Goes over reluctantly, flicks his lighter, cupping it from the wind. The flame catches a sudden, uneasy expression in Chris' face as he sees the Smoking Man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We come around and see what Chris sees in the light of the flame. A face that smiles at him like a death's head, a large ugly blister on his mouth, whiskered, pale - but smiling. A sick man wouldn't smile like this, but he is smiling too intimately, as if he knows Chris from way back. But he doesn't. Or does he? Perhaps it was the man Chris first saw at the airstrip when he came in-country. The same expression of evil, of a man who has seen too much and died, but still lives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris feels an unnatural fear passing through him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Man stands, sucking on his cigarette, stretches. He is thin and very tall, towering over Chris.
</DIRECTION>
<SMOKING_MAN>

</SMOKING_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
He goes. Chris watches him, wondering. The man never looks back, a leisurely, confident stroll. In that moment, there is an EXPLOSION from way out in the jungle, about a quarter of a mile. Then another, then small arms fire. Chris looks, knows.

At the Platoon CP, Barnes stands, legs akimbo, watching the jungle, anticipating the coming fight as overhead we now hear the 155 SHELLS whistle from a 10-mile distance - passing above them - then pounding down into the jungle in the near distance. Barnes turns, glances at Wolfe, smiles.

Silence, then a vague MURMURING - becoming clearer and clearer. It's in Vietnamese. The radio is then bashed in, the sound like thunder in the Captain's ear. He looks at his RTO, both of them shocked.

EXT. NVA JUNGLE - NIGHT/DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the Jungle itself, the ENEMY is moving. Flurries of movement and sound, blurred visuals. Hands taping a piece of cloth to a tree, moving on - revealing a luminous arrow pointing left ... Figures moving past it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hands unraveling a thin wire waist-high, backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hands sliding along another wire. We now see a moving helmet with a luminous plaque on the back of it, leading a file up the wire. To a Jump-off point about 50 yards outside the U.S. perimeter. Figures crouch. Whispers. Movement. A pen flashlight on a drawing of the foxhole positions. The NVA moving out in several directions at once.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. PERIMETER #3 - CHRIS' FOXHOLE - NIGHT

</RHAH>
<DIRECTION>
FLARES now shoot up over the perimeter. Reds, greens, yellows, squeaking as they float doen on their parachute hinges throughout the ensuing battle. The perimeter is illuminated at spotty intervals - sometimes arctic bright, sometimes inexplainably dark til new flares shoot up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris, Francis, Rhah all look up at the light, and hug their holes even tighter, feeling naked in the light. Flares cut both ways.

Runs out of the foxhole. Chris suddenly reacting to a noise out front, gripping Francis and pointing to the sound.

<DIRECTION>
A BODY is thrashing towards them, about twenty-five yards, not yet visible but a little awkward and lungy in it's movement, as if desperate.

The SOLDIER now runs in like a fullback going down for the tackle, sprawling into the hole, knocking Chris and Francis down beneath him.

He is sweating, terrified, a white boy with an unrecognizable, filthy face, no rifle, no helmet, his fatigues torn all over.

</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
SHAPES moving in the trees. Chris blows his claymore handles. One explosion on top of the other out front. Then return fire. Flashes from a muzzle, rak-a-tak, rak-a-tak, rak-a-tak, the heavier sound of an AK-47.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris opening up with his 16. Then being blown down by a grenade explosion at the edge of the foxhole. Then nothing. A pause. Chris' ears ringing, slightly concussed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly from down the perimeter there is the sound of a faulty LOUDSPEAKER crackling out from the jungle. A pidgen English, the words mauled, then a snatch of patriotic North Vietnamese music, played from a scratchy old record.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris uneasy, looking at Francis who looks terrified. The SOUND now of a whistle. Two hoots, then a sharp third. Then yelling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris grabbing Francis' arm, pointing. There is a VOICE directly out to the front of them - muttering something in Vietnamese, no more than 20 yards away but unseen. It's like hearing a casual conversation from another room, then the sounds of several bodies moving in separate directions - encompassing the foxhole.

Not a moment too soon. An RPG ROCKET whistling in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FOXHOLE takes a direct hit, caving in, whirls of smoke spinning off it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris and Francis look back covered with debris. They hear movement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHADOWS are swarming towards the foxhole, firing into it to finish them off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francis grabs Chris' leg, indicating they get out of there. Chris hesitates - a moment, a decision made now in angry passion - rises up and charges the NVA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHADOWS scatter and tumble, caught by his surprise close-range fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris moving forward into them, blasting, agile, his instincts finely tuned, and totally insane in this moment of time, indifferent to his life. He YELLS insanities, pumping himself up with the adrenaline of courage.

Chris smashing a wounded SHADOW with the butt of his gun down into the foxhole. He jumps back into it, reoccupying it. Blasting the dead gook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Opening fire out to the front, driving the Shadows back.

<DIRECTION>
Francis watching this, amazed. After a moment of doubt, he too tears back out to join Chris in the foxhole, unbelieving, as he jumps in with him.

</NVA_SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
And jumps right into the hole blasting Bunny point-blank in the chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bunny struggling to consciousness at the bottom of the hole. THUCK! A boot in the gaping hole where his chest was. Bunny, his eyes uncomprehending. A muzzle is jammed into his mouth, breaking his teeth with an ugly sound. Another yell from the NVA trooper. A flash of orange red light. Bunny's face blown to bits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Junior, dizzy from the blow to his head, looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A yellow flare somewhere out there and a SHADOW above him digging a bayonet into his belly with a grunt. A long oozing sigh of belly gas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An explosion. The Shadow with the bayonet staggering blind without eyes, holding his brains with his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes throws open the empty LAAW rocket casing he has just fired off and charges forward with a yell, cutting down another NVA in Bunny's old foxhole. Jumping into the hole, the bottom of which is a liquid pit of guts, blood, ooze. Another Enemy running in on him. A short burst of fire. Barnes hit. Firing into each other. Barnes draggin him down into the pit with him, grappling alongside the corpse of Bunny. Barnes uses an entrenching tool to finish him off.

One of them is coming over the sandbags. He sees Wolfe. Wolfe sees him. In the same moment.

Chris lays out a curtain of fire. A GRENADE goes off near him, blowing off his helmet. Dazed, Chris rushes forward firing from the hip - sucked into Barnes' suicidal vacuum. He cuts down an Enemy as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes, given a new lease, limps angrily forward and tackles a wounded Enemy trying to crawl away, terrified at the sight of Barnes coming after him. Barnes lets out a vivid scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And beats the soldier mercilessly, half the stock of his M-16 flying apart broken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris swivels alert on his knees. A pause. No more enemy. Turns to Barnes, his back to Chris still beating at the dead corpse.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Barnes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes swivels instinctively off the corpse and for a petrifying moment Chris sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A maddened scar of a face, lips specked with foam. The EYES - refracted in a red-green flare overhead - the pupils distorted into angry red points.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For Chris it is no doubt the most frightening single image he has seen in his life. It will be in his nightmares forever. The essence of evil: wrath, obsession, anger, fear, hatred, permanence - he is paralyzed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes smashes him full across the face with the broken stock of his M-16. Not even conciously, for at this point, his mind has gone over the edge and the entire world is his enemy. American or Vietnamese, it makes no difference as he strikes Chris harder and harder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris struggles, moans, his teeth and nose cracked. Barnes emits another chilling yell an springs like a humpback up on his good right leg, the left bent - set to deliver the killing blow, the mangled rifle pulled to its highest arc.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nooooooooo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
The PHANTOM FIGHTER JET comes now like a great white whale. One big beautiful monstrous beat of deafening sound. Its silver and white belly hurtling low over the treeline in one giant leap of sound momentarily illuminated by a flare. Then a monstrous ROAR of anger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bomb ripping Barnes off the body of Chris and spitting Chris across the jungle floor - crashing into a tree some 30 yards away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PERIMETER #3 - CHRIS' JUNGLE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE BACK IN. Vague sunlight. Blurry. Chris fluttering his eyes. A sharp MOVEMENT in the bush. His eyes fight their way open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOFT EYES are watching him from behind foliage. A soft, furry head, alert, rigidly still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris fights his way up to his elbow, in pain, looking at the eyes. The head turns and in one fluid move, bolts. Gone. Like the wind. A deer. A big brown deer. Or was it? Chris will never be quite sure. But whatever it was, it was surely a sign of grace - the grace of Elias. This he knows as he feels himself for the first time alive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And in pain. His left hand torn and bleeding, shrapnel in his side, cuts on his face, dried blood caking him. Looking around his garden of eden. A messy jungle floor. Cordite fumes. Burned bush and trees. Torn sandbags. Dead NVA. Bird songs somewhere in the distance. It is the very crack of dawn, a pink- red sun casting long oblique light patterns through the trees. A holy light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris pushes himself to his feet, feels his weight and the pain. He walks. In the near distance, towards the LZ area, there's the sound of Armored Personnel carriers grinding, men moving, calling out in Americanese. But Chris is alone here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He fishes up an AK-47 from a dead NVA. Checks it, a weapon. Walks on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PERIMETER #3 - BARNES' FOXHOLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Past scores of NVA bodies. Past the Foxhole where Bunny lays dead in the bottom, faceless. Looking over at Junior bayoneted to the ground, dead. NVA everywhere around the hole, some of them still moving, badly wounded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris looking around, then noticing a movement a little further out in the Jungle. Then he sees who.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The uniform is shredded, the figure obviously hurt in several places (thigh, back, neck, hand) but not mortally so, now struggling to right itself, dragging its face up from a belly- down position. Streaked with dirt and blood, we see Barnes once again re-emerging from the dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris steps over to him, a solemn look on his face. Barnes looks up, begs.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get me a Medic will ya. Go on ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
Chris doesn't move. Barnes looks at him again, reading the intention that has crossed Chris' mind. An expression of surprise crosses his face, then amazement, almost shock.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you in hell ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
Chris shoots him. Once. Twice. Three times. Silence ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes is finally dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris looking at the corpse, numbed, no exultation in his expression. Just cold satisfaction and little feeling left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him, the SOUND of a big machine moving. He turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge Nazi flag on an antenna looms up in the bush, followed by the great belly of a turreted dragon crunching down a tree for its breakfast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big tough GERMAN SHEPARD comes boudning at him sniffs, followed by a flak-jacketed MONSTER MAN - filthy and greasy, unshaven face, earring in his left ear, 'DEATH CORPS' scrawled on his shirtless flak jacket and a drawing of a death's head, he looks like a cross between a pirate and a hell's angel. Behind him, a SECOND MONSTER MAN and the ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER grinding its engine, a human skull hanging from its turret.
</DIRECTION>
<MONSTER_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Dog)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bozo! Get back here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONSTER_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes passing on Chris like so much meat.
</DIRECTION>
<MONSTER_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (to Chris)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you walk outta here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONSTER_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Chris nods. The Soldier pointing to the LZ behind him as a sign he should go that way. The other Soldier already stripping the NVA dead, as the APC grinds on into the jungle, reconnoitering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris walks out of the jungle, head bowed, nauseated, mixed feelings roiling him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PERIMETER #3 - FRANCIS' FOXHOLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In another foxhole, Francis waits, the sounds of the approaching APC cutting through. He thinks about it a moment. It must be fast. It must be a hard cold decision. Now!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls out his K-bar and with one last anguished hesitation, drives it into his thigh muscle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francis yells out and collapses in his hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PERIMETER #3 - O'NEILL'S FOXHOLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In another foxhole, O'Neill, unscratched but covered with dirt, waits tentatively as SOLDIERS arrive at his hole. They're a little awed by the sight of the tough-looking O'Neill emerging from his foxhole like Sgt.Rock, dozens of dead NVA littered around him.
</DIRECTION>
<APC_SOLDIER_1>

	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PERIMETER #3 - RHAH'S FOXHOLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rhah, alive and well, is poking around the NVA corpses with a long gnarled walking stick, looking like a crazy Johnny Appleseed with his pants rolled up on his thin hairy ankles and wearing a red bandana tied in a four-knot around his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As one of the APC SOLDIERS carves an ear off a dead NVA, Rhah works his way through the torn bloody pocket of an NVA Troop in full rigor mortis, extracting what he thought was there - a wrapped cellophane of heroin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rhah's face glows with satisfaction as he tastes it, then snorts it. With a certain satisfaction of triumph over the grim circumstances.
</DIRECTION>
<RHAH>
<DIRECTION>
(to the powder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that's good shit ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHAH>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PERIMETER #3 - LZ - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHRIS is hauled out on a litter. Morphined, his eyes watching it all from somewhere deep in his brain. Passing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Groups of SOLDIERS looking like bowery bums and moving like rats through the smoke and garbage snooping for souvenirs with wheezy tired eyes and grunts of greed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Passing a bulldozed PIT with heaps of NVA BODIES in them. a BULLDOZER pushing another set of bodies in, like photos of a Nazi death camp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nearby, two burly SOLDIERS lift a WOMAN NURSE and with a once- through build for momentum, toss the fresh body into the pit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris, numb, goes by.
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO_OPERATOR>
<DIRECTION>
(into radio, exhausted)

</2ND_RADIO_OPERATOR>
<DIRECTION>
CAPTAIN HARRIS doesn't respond; at this point he doesn't give a shit, standing apart from the radios looking numbly at the remnants of his boys filtering by on litters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris intersects him now, Harris' eyes looking blankly, then nodding sickly trying to give him encouragement. Just coming to the edge of tears, choking it back, and turning back. These are his sons who are lost. A good officer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rodriguez, wounded, is lifted up in his litter and moved out to the waiting MEDIVAC CHOPPER, a huge red cross painted on a white square.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doc goes by on another litter, then Ace, Adams, Huffmeister, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Francis is littered by, bandages around his leg, a big smile on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Taylor, you okay man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCIS>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. How 'bout you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jes' fine man, jes fine! Ain't never felt better! Both of us two timers man, we're out.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you at the hospital man, we gonna get high-high yessir ...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Medic points to the chopper.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's your ride man, you ready?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Chris starts towards it, the Medic assisting him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PERIMETER #3 - LZ - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sgt.O'Neill watches the loading process forlornly from the distance. Captain Harris intersects him.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got Second Platoon Sergeant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIS>
<O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
(reflexively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes sir -
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
And as Harris moves away, O'Neill is left thinking. Finally there is a certain frustration to his actions; he has taken such great pains to stay alive that the tuition he pays is precisely to stay in this Jungle. Inevitably his time will come - one way or another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes now follow the MEDIVAC CHOPPER upwards, whatever is left of his shrunken soul yearning to go with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT/INT: PERIMETER #3 LZ CHOPPER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the Chopper rises off the battlefield, Chris, who is sitting at the edge so that he has a full view out the open door, waves back at Rhah.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PERIMETER #3 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rhah, at the edge of the treeline, vigorously shakes his walking stick at him, his other hand a fist, waving them, emitting his cry.
</DIRECTION>
<RHAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baaaaaaaaa!!!!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHAH>
<DIRECTION>
Defiance. Pride. Dig me, I'm Rhah - and there isn't nobody like me in the world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT/INT: PERIMETER #3 - LZ CHOPPER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chopper - with its huge red cross painted on - now rising to meet God. Smashed on morphine, Chris looking out at the waving ants below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the trees, the skyline and the chopper is moving fast over the devestation. The jungle forever locked in his memory, Chris looks back, copious, quiet tears flowing from his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think now, looking back, we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves - and the enemy was in us ... The war is over for me now, but it will always be there - the rest of my days. As I am sure Elias will be - fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called possession of my soul ... There are times since I have felt like the child born of those two fathers ... but be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
The music surges now to its full strength as we replay bits of film with each actor's name listed - some with silly, clowning looks, others sober, haunted. Gardner, Tex, King, Rhah, Lerner, Sanderson, Manny, Big Harold - all the boys ... and then Barnes staring quietly into the camera, and lastly Elias - shirt off, bowl of grass in hand, his big, beautiful smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
