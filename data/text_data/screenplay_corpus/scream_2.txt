She doesn't notice as Phil pulls a long sharp hunting knife from inside his coat jacket. Maureen's hand moves up Phil's jacket... something stops her. She feels something on her fingers... something wet. She pulls her hand back, the reflected movie illuminating bloody fingers.

A newsvan pulls up and parks next to a trough of other newsvans and REPORTERS. Some are doing live remotes, others ready themselves for the next onslaught.

Gale gets out of the newsvan, her cellular affixed to her ear.

	I don't know... no one's talking. What's the studio's position? Never happen. They'd be stupid to pull the movie. With all this free press - they're gonna have huge numbers this weekend. It'll break box office records. Of course I have bumps.

Sidney moves down a hallway. Not your typical school building. Through open doorways, film equipment is glimpsed. Editing bays and the like. She's in the Film Department.

She comes upon an open door and peers in. A large room, a class is in progress. She slips in quietly.

INT. CLASSROOM - SAME

Sidney takes a seat at the back of the room. A handful of FILM STUDENTS sit around on torn couches heavy in discussion. Sid goes unnoticed as she watches a whirlwind debate. A SNOTTY GUY is pontificating a point.

The place is a circus. The front steps of the student center have been roped off to form a platform. A podium and mike have been placed center.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CROWDS have gathered for the press conference that is being held by the university. Reporters and cameras have been roped off to the side. On stage, DEAN FISHER, a sharp looking woman in her forties is talking to spectators.

</DEREK>
<SIDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get my jacket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Sidney, indifferent, moves through the open front door, back inside the house. Her face and mind detached from what's going on. Derek remains on the porch, watching the spectacle. Slowly, the door behind him closes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DELTA ZETA LIVING ROOM - SANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid moves through the living room, she grabs her coat when the phone RINGS. She looks at it suspiciously... knowingly... she reaches for it.
</DIRECTION>

</SIDNEY>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello Sidney?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The VOICE. Low and haunting. Sidney closes her eyes. When she opens them tears are immediate But still, she refuses to crack.
</DIRECTION>
<SIDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDNEY>
<MAN_S_VOICE>

</SIDNEY>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To see every ounce of blood drain from your body.

The Voice has never sounded more evil... more seductive. Sidney doesn't flinch. She holds steady.
</DIRECTION>
<SIDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then come and get me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDNEY>
<DIRECTION>
And with that Sidney hangs up the phone, SLAMMING it down. Silence. And then...
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My pleasure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The Voice comes from inside the room... behind her. Sidney spins around and finds herself staring at the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GHOST MASKED FIGURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But not the one from the movie theater. The one from Sidney's nightmare long ago. It stands in the foyer archway, staring at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sustained moment. A stand off. Sidney doesn't move. But then the killer withdraws his trademark. A long, steel hunting knife... blood stained.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIDNEY BOLTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the GHOST LEAPS at her. She SCREAMS, dodging him,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE PORCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Derek hears her SCREAM. He turns to the front door. He finds it locked. He starts to BEAT on it.

</DEREK>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE LIVING ROOM

<SIDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Derek. He's in the house. Help... me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDNEY>

She struggles with the door, there are too many locks, the Ghost is already upon her. She looks to the stairs, thinks better of it... flies through the dining room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRONT PORCH - SANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Derek is going nuts trying to get into the house. He moves along the porch to the windows, looking through. He watches as the Ghost Figure chases her into the kitchen. Derek looks about the porch. He rears his foot back and kicks in the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - SAME

Sid moves through the kitchen to the back door. She struggles with the lock as the Ghost is right behind her. She barely makes it out the back door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACK YARD - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large, fenced in yard. Lots of big oak trees. Sid flies down the back porch and into the yard. She moves across it, passed trees and shrubs. She spots a closed fence door in the back of the yard. She looks behind her to find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOTHING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She scans the yard, the Ghost Figure has completely disappeared. She moves behind a big tree, hiding behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid stops, catches her breath, then peers from behind the tree. The yard is completely empty. She goes for the fence door, slowly moving around the tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUMP! A noise in the darkness. She spins around, still making her way around the tree, moving backwards, walking right into a FIGURE. She SCREAMS, spinning around, finding herself face to face with...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CICI'S BODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hanging, dangling, hung from the tree, her stomach a ripped, bloody mess. Sidney SCREAMS IN UNFORGETTABLE HORROR. She steps back, falling right into the arms of...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEWEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns, SCREAMING.
</DIRECTION>
<DEWEY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Sidney smiles at this just as the car door rips open on the passenger's side. Two hands reach in and yank Police Guard #2 from the car. He starts to CRY OUT but it's cut short.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid SCREAMS as the Police Guard behind the wheel struggles with his seat belt. He looks up to see a Ghost Masked Figure move around the side of the car towards his door. He reaches for his gun but it's too late. The Ghost has the door open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A flash of silver and the Police Guard's throat is slit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BACK SEAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sidney SCREAMS and SCREAMS, BEATING on the door of the car. It won't open. She's trapped like a caged animal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE FRONT SEAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ghost pulls the Police Guard from the car, then gets in, behind the driver's seat. The Ghost puts the car in drive and takes off down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sidney looks behind her as the guard's dead bodies lay sprawled in the middle of the road. She turns to the door, BEATING and CLAWING at it. She leans back, manic, and KICKS at the window with her feet. No use.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMPUS DRIVE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car makes its way down the deserted street
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BACKSEAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sidney is beyond frantic. She eyes the Ghost through the gate. She turns and twists looking for an escape. Through the window, she sees approaching headlights. She SCREAMS through the closed window as a car passes by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sidney takes notice as the car turns onto another campus street. Big, stone school buildings line each side of a thin, road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She eyes the Ghost through the rearview window. The white masks turns as hidden eyes bore through her. The Ghost hits the gas, picking up speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sidney looks to the book bag on the seat beside her. She rips it open, rustling through it frantically. She pulls books, pencils, paper... Sid grabs a long, yellow No.2 pencil. She grips it hard, looking to the metal grate just behind the driver's seat. The Ghost's neck is right up against it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid takes the pencil and positions it right behind the Ghost's head, ready to attack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without pause, Sid RAMS the pencil through the grate, into the Ghost's neck. It lodges there as the Ghost falls forward in pain, losing control of the wheel for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car jumps the curb and SLAMS against a building. The Ghost yanks the wheel, over correcting. He tries to bring it back to the road but doesn't see the lamp post that stands directly in the car's path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Squad car makes direct contact with the lamp post, SLAMMING into it, bringing the car to a CRASHING HALT, lodging it agaisnt the building's stone exterior.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smoke rises from a bashed engine as it emits a fatal rumbling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All is still. In the backseat, Sidney rises from the floorboards. She looks up to see the Ghost Masked figure slumped over the steering wheel. Out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid quickly pulls herself together, looking about, sizing up her options. She tugs on the door handle. It won't budge. She looks to the passenger's side of the car. It's flush against the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she notices the metal grate. The edge has been pried apart in the crash. Sidney reaches for it, pulling on it, bending it backwards...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREAK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid tries to stifle the noise it makes, all the while eyeing the Ghost who remains unconscious. She creates an opening large enough for her to crawl through. She lifts herself up and pulls herself through to the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRONT SEAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid falls down into the seat, her eyes never leaving the Ghost. She lay crumpled up against the smashed passenger's door, the only sound is her own TERRIFIED BREATHING. She watches the Ghost Masked Figure. His body doesn't move. She contemplates her next move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The only way out is through the driver's door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After what seems an eternity, she slowly reaches over with her foot and nudges the Ghost. No movement. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She slides across the seat towards the Ghost, moving to his side. She reaches with her hand and pushes on the Ghost's shoulder. His body moves, slumping back against the back of the seat. It clears space for her to pass through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sits up on her feet, facing the Ghost. With her leg, she reaches over him, straddling him. She leans against the steering wheel, her arm quickly reaching for the door knob.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HONK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her back brushes against the horn. Sid TENSES, her face a little more than a foot from the Ghost Mask. He doesn't move. He's completely out cold. Sid pushes the car door open and starts to slide completely over the Ghost when she stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks to the Ghost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON HER FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she fights with a decision. Then, with a fierce determination, Sid reaches for the Ghost Mask. She finds the edge and begins to peels the Mask away when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GHOST COMES TO LIFE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lunging forward. Sidney SCREAMS, leaping, falling out the car door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid hits the pavement hard. She lifts herself up when her entire body is YANKED VIOLENTLY BACKWARDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ghost has hold of her foot, pulling her back into the car. Sidney KICKS and WRITHES breaking free. She hops to her feet as the Ghost emerges from the car. Sidney SLAMS the car door shut. It catches the Ghost, knocking him backwards.
</DIRECTION>

Sid tears off, down the street, running, burning up the pavement.

Dewey moves fast, limping his way to the level's edge. He approaches the railing and makes his way around to the shining light.

He reaches it, finding nothing but a camera and tripod. It sits alone against the railing. Dewey surveys the second level. Empty seats everywhere. Completely bare.

Gale finds herself in the student studios. She stands in a huge control booth that overlooks a dubbing stage. Lots of glass walls and doors. It has a maze quality.

Gale moves out a side door and into a dubbing room. Darkness everywhere Gale stops for a second, listening as she main door CREAKS open. And then FOOTSTEPS are heard, making their way towards her.

<DIRECTION>
Gale proceeds deeper into the studio. She moves into a sound proof room and closes the door. Not seeing the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GHOST FIGURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That stands behind her. She turns around and SCREAMS. She starts out, but then realizes he's standing in the control booth. She's protected by a clear, large, plexiglass window that wraps around the room. The ghost moves out the side door, heading her way. He disappears out of view. Gale freaks. She races to the door, trying to secure it. There's no lock.

Gale shoves everything she can find against the door, not seeing or hearing Dewey as he POUNDS against the sound proof barrier behind her.

She also doesn't see the Killer that appears behind Dewey. He moves on him swift and focused.

<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE DUBBING STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gale can't take her eyes off the door. Her face is terrified. If she'd only turn around, she would see Dewey - his face terror stricken as a knife is hurled into him repeatedely. With each thrust, blood is splattered against the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CONTROL BOOTH
</DIRECTION>

Dewey SCREAMS for his life, caught completely off guard. He falls forward onto the control panels. Suddenly, microphone feedback tears through the studios as Dewey's CRIES are heard throughout the stage.

<DIRECTION>
IN THE DUBBING STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dewey's DEATH SCREAM rips through the room.
</DIRECTION>

Gale turns to the window to see Dewey, his face smashed against it, blood smeared across the glass. She moves to the window, her face only inches from his. A moment as their eyes meet. Dewey's life is near gone. His eyes reveal it.

She manages to pull the door open just enough to slide through. And she's off and running.

Gale finds a door and plows through it, stopping only long enough to lock it.

Mickey leaps to his feat. The Killer right behind him. He now finds himself in Sid's predicament. He doesn't know where to run. The two Killer's close in on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sidney gets to the corner of the house. She stops... she doesn't want to leave Mickey. She turns back around just in time to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey sandwiched in between the two Ghosts. They're knives strike at the same time. One through the stomach, the other through the back. They withdraw their knives. Mickey's body suspends, momentarily hanging in the air. Then collapses to a heap on the ground.

<DIRECTION>
Both Ghosts turn to Sid at the same time. She takes off running, along the side of the house, through a row of shrub that take her to...

EXT. STREET - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid is back on the campus street, running down the middle of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She spots a car stopped at a red light half a block up. KIDS are inside, rock music BLARES. Sid SCREAMS and SCREAMS but they don't hear her. She runs, feet pounding, toward them but the light turns green and the car takes off. It's taillights fading in the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns finding herself alone in a parking lot. The theatre sits in the distance. She spots someone entering the theatre. It looks like Hallie.
</DIRECTION>
<SIDNEY>

Gale races down the empty campus street. She eyes an emergency phone that's attached to a street lamp. She goes for it.

Gale rips the phone from its cradle, presses the CALL button.

Just then, Gale hears a NOISE. A door opening. She looks up to see Sidney disappear through the side theatre door.
</DIRECTION>
<GALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SIDNEY!

</GALE>
<DIRECTION>
But Sidney has already disappeared inside. Gale yells into the phone.

INT. THEATRE SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The theatre is big and old. Plush chairs, balcony, huge proscenium stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sidney enters through a side house door. She pulls on it, releasing the emeregency lock. She makes her way down the aisle toward the orchestra section.
</DIRECTION>
<SIDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDNEY>
<DIRECTION>
The stage is dark and bare with the exceptions of the furniture from the DEATHTRAP set. BUMP! A noise from the stage wings.
</DIRECTION>
<SIDNEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hallie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Sidney moves down front to the little bridge that extends out over the orchestra pit. She crosses it and moves to stage center, peering into the wings on either side of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Complete darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DRIP! DRIP!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something drips down from above and onto Sidney. She wipes it from her face when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK! A spot light turns on from the back of the house, illuminating Sid center stage. She jumps at this, unnerved. She looks to her hand, covered in crimson. Then out to the house... the light is blinding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLANK! A NOISE from above..ropes, pulleys moving. Sid looks up as a set wall comes PLOWING down at her. She leaps out of the way, falling to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wall falls into place on the stage. It is the back wall of the set that's dressed with framed pictures and antique weapons and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEWEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Who hangs from it, pinned up against the wall, very much deadk, arms outstretched, crucified. His body a bloody mess. Sidney stops, stunned. She stands frozen in unspeakable horror. Her entire being ripped apart. She breaks into tears. And then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid backs up, moving, racing toward the wings when another wall flies in, sealing the backstage area off, trapping her. She looks in shock at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALLIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Strung up, her body hanging lifeless. Sid SCREAMS, turning, running to the other side of the stage when a third wall comes flying in, creating the three walled set of DEATHTRAP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Attached to it, is the body of Joel. Dead. Blood everywhere. And then, Sid hears...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAPPING!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A single pair of hands from somewhere in the house... applauding. She turns around and spots a FIGURE moving down the aisle. She can't make out who it is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid bolts. She spots the set door up center, near Dewey's body. She goes for it, ripping it open to find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COTTON WEARY STANDING IN THE DOORFRAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid SCREAMS. But then sees his face, he looks scared. And then, Cotton's body falls forward to the floor, his arms and legs bound by electric tape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid turns back to the front of the stage. The Figure is now walking across the bridge, holding something... a light attached to a video camera. She's being filmed. Sid looks back to Cotton who looks up to her with pleading eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quick, untie me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTON>
<DIRECTION>
Sid is paniced. She doesn't know what to do. She leans down to untie him but stops.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(from behind video camera)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've seen this movie before, haven't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>

Sidney looks to the voice. The camera is pulled away to reveal...

He smiles at her.

<DEREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smile for the camera.

Sidney remains silent.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sid, c'mon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTON>
<DIRECTION>
Side backs away from Cotton. She doesn't trust either one of them. Derek watches her, amused.
</DIRECTION>
<DEREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on, untie him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEREK>
<SIDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Derek begins filming again.
</DIRECTION>
<DEREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must be dealing with some serious trust issues right about now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEREK>
<DIRECTION>
Sidney says nothing. She egdes away, moving to the wall where Hallie hangs.
</DIRECTION>
<DEREK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sidney, you can't keep your back to the audience like that. Could you cheat a little forward for me?

</DEREK>
<COTTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Sidney.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTON>
<DEREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're really stumped, aren't you? You know there's two killers but you don't know who they are. I'm a given. The boyfriend. Way obvious. But now you're torn. Everyone else appears to be dead. Except for Cotton. Hmmm? Hmmm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEREK>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Hallie comes to life behind Sid, reaching out, grabbing her. Sid JUMPS. She spins around to find Hallie breaking out in a torrent of GIGGLES. Very much alive.

	Paaaaiiin... yah, such pain... The story of your life, Sid.

Sidney's eyes go back and forth between the two.

<DEREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should really see your face right now, Sid. It's doing some freaky shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEREK>
<DIRECTION>
Derek's right. Sid's face appears completely tortured.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLIE>
<DEREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEREK>
<DIRECTION>
Sidney stares them down. She's been here before.
</DIRECTION>
<SIDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDNEY>
<DEREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good question. You took the bait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEREK>
<HALLIE>

Sid turns to Cotton. She kneels down and begins to untie him.
</DIRECTION>
<DEREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope. You had your chance.

	We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLIE>
<DEREK>

	You'd me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It's a whole world, Sid. You're really popular amongst the demented.

	Actually Cotton, and I think critics would agree, it's the other way around.

	Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?

<SIDNEY>

	You're not going to get away with this.

	Of course not. Who wants to? What's the point if we don't get caught? Where's the glamour in that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLIE>
<DEREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The way I see it. We'll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEREK>
<HALLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLIE>
<DEREK>

</DEREK>

Cotton pull and twists on his bound wrists. Sid had loosened them somewhat. He tries to finish undoing them.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A twist ending if you will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLIE>
<DEREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing's been done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEREK>
<HALLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLIE>
<DEREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And we didn't want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money's worth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEREK>
<HALLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we found a compromise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLIE>
<DEREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or it found us.

Hallie moves in on her.

<DEREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, we're trying to send a message to Hollywood. I'm really getting tired of all the happy endings. It's just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.

<SIDNEY>

	But nobody wants to see that. It'll never go. They'll rewrite you. You don't want that.

	Sorry, Cotton. I guess you were just meant to be a killer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE_SALT>
<SIDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll never get away with this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Debbie moves to Cotton, shrugging.
</DIRECTION>
<DEBBIE_SALT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who would you like to shoot first, Cotton?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE_SALT>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, Cotton leans up, freed from his bindings. With the knife in hand, he lunges for Debbie Salt. It strikes her, lodging into her chest. She goes back. Cotton doesn't stop, he stabs her again and again. She goes down. Dead.
</DIRECTION>
<GALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALE>
<DIRECTION>
Gale rushes to Cotton as he jumps to his feet. She helps him with the last of his bindings. Sid looks about at the body count on stage. It's mounting. She takes a deep breath. Relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<GALE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, Cotton, what a nightmare. I'm so sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALE>
<COTTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTON>
<DIRECTION>
Gale gives him a hug.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON COTTON'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<GALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALE>
<DIRECTION>
He hugs her back. She doesn't see as he rises the knife behind her, bringing it down in one swift, maniacal move. Gale's body jerks, a moment of shock and then she goes limp as the knife lodges in her back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sidney turns just in time to see Cotton toss Gale's body down into the orchestra pit. He turns, facing Sidney. The bloody knife in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SIDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NOOO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Cotton moves to Derek's body where the video camera lay, he pulls the tape from it.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I'm the victim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTON>
<SIDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Cotton, don't do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDNEY>
<DIRECTION>
He holds up the video cassette. Murder in his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTON>
<SIDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's over, Cotton.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDNEY>
<COTTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not until you're dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTON>
<DIRECTION>
Cotton lunges for her. Sid tears off, slipping through the set door to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACKSTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid runs to the rear of the stage. She moves in the narrow space that exists between the scrim and the back wail. She races down it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She almost reaches the end when COTTON RIPS THROUGH THE SCRIM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sidney ducks, bypassing him. She comes to the stage door. It's locked. She turns, seeing the metal ladder that's attached to the wall. It leads to the catwalk above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid goes for it. She climbs up the ladder with lightning speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cotton, up and running, is close behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CATWALK SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The catwalk sits above the open fly space where flats and a large chandelier are stored in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid reaches the top and takes off running down to the ending.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND THAT'S AS FAR AS I'VE GOTTEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT HAPPENS IS SID AND COTTON FIGHT TO THE FINISH, HE CHASES HER THROUGH HANGING FLATS, THEN DOWN THE FLY RAIL, BACK TO THE STAGE. SID GETS FINDS A KNIFE AND STABS COTTON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE STABS HER BACK. THEY FIGHT, CONTINUING TO STAB EACH OTHER UNTIL THEY BOTH DROP CENTER STAGE. THEY LAY NEXT TO EACH OTHER, NEITHER ABLE TO MOVE. THEIR EYES SLOWLY CLOSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END (FOR NOW)
</DIRECTION>
