INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. BERLIN. DAY. CREDITS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1995. A modern apartment, all cool and glass. MICHAEL BERG is preparing breakfast, laying the table for two. He is 51, dark- haired, saturnine. He is doing everything with deliberate quietness, taking the occasional glance towards the bedroom to check he's not making too much noise. He is boiling an egg, which he takes out of boiling water and puts on a sparkling clean plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL puts the yolk-stained egg-cup and plate into the sink, his breakfast eaten, then, as noiseless as he can, turns on the tap to run water. The bedroom door opens, and BRIGITTE comes out, naked. She's attractive, younger. The credits end.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIGITTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't wake me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIGITTE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were sleeping.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<BRIGITTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You let me sleep because you can't bear to have breakfast with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIGITTE>
<DIRECTION>
It's half-serious. MICHAEL doesn't react.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing could be further from the truth. I boiled you an egg. See?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL produces a second boiled egg in a cup, seemingly from nowhere, like a magician, and puts it on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd hardly have boiled you an egg if I didn't want to see you. Tea or coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
BRIGITTE has re-appeared from the bedroom, now in a dressing gown. She's still half-serious.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIGITTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does any woman ever stay long enough to find out what the hell goes on in your head?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIGITTE>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL smiles to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIGITTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIGITTE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm seeing my daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<BRIGITTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your daughter? You've kept very quiet about her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIGITTE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have I? She's been abroad for a year. Did you say tea?

</BRIGITTE>
<DIRECTION>
He closes the door, then turns to the open door of the bedroom. He looks at the mess of last night's love-making. Then he goes to the window and looks out. A yellow U-Bahn goes by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAM. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
December 1958. MICHAEL, now 15, is sitting on a tram. He is in a well-cut suit he's inherited, ill-fitting, with two-tone shoes and tangled mop of hair. Sweat breaks out all over his face. A WOMAN is staring at him. He's plainly feeling ill.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1958. It has come on to rain. MICHAEL is walking along the street, looking more and more sickly. There is an archway leading to a courtyard, and impulsively he darts inside to get out of the rain. He begins to vomit. Opposite him is a wood workshop open to the yard. A uniformed TRAM CONDUCTRESS walks past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL'S body is turned away, his face invisible, his hand over his mouth. She puts down her ticket machine on the pavement and seizes him by the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA SCHMITZ has ash-blonde hair and is in her mid-thirties. She disappears. He's sick again. She reappears with a bucket of water to sluice down the pavement. She wipes his face down with a wet cloth. Then she fills another bucket.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, kid. Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Effortlessly, HANNA takes MICHAEL in her arms. She holds his head against her breasts. MICHAEL buries himself and slowly he stops sobbing. Then he lifts his head.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where do you live?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA and MICHAEL walk at a fair pace along a street, dotted with the scaffolding of new building. HANNA is carrying his satchel, she is pulling him by the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BLUMENSTRASSE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They come up the road. It is now snowing. MICHAEL stops outside his block, as if nervous she might come in.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's here. I'll be fine now. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look after yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL smiles `Thank you' and goes in. HANNA is left alone. She looks round, frowning, then sets off, stopping uncertainly at the crossroads to check for the way she came. MICHAEL turns and watches, curious at her indecision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BERG APARTMENT. BLUMENSTRASSE. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARLA BERG is at the stove in the kitchen. She takes dinner through for the BERG family, at a round table in a traditional apartment, under a five-candled brass chandelier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL'S father, PETER, is a balding, abstracted man, eating in oppressive silence. Next to him, his older brother THOMAS, 18, his older sister, ANGELA, and his younger sister, EMILY. MICHAEL has his book in front of him, not touching his food.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm worried about him. He looks terrible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The boy's saying he doesn't need a doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<EMILY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He does.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't need a doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
CARLA looks reproachful.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not going to argue about this. People have to take responsibility for their own lives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM. BERG APARTMENT. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL is lying in a single bed, his face violently inflamed. CARLA is with the DOCTOR, a much older man.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remind me, how old are you now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael's fifteen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's scarlet fever. He'll be in bed for several months. At least.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL turns into the pillow, a wet patch beneath his head. Delusional with fever, he senses a presence at the door. He turns. It's EMILY. But at once CARLA's arm pulls her away.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep away. He's contagious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
They vanish. The door closes. In the corridor the DOCTOR is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Burn the sheets. Complete isolation. And three months is the minimum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
INT & EXT. BERG APARTMENT. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1959. A sunny day in March. MICHAEL's bed has been moved beside open windows so he can profit from the weak sun. He is sitting up, working on his stamp collection. CARLA is moving round behind him, tidying the room.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you feeling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better. By the way, I meant to tell you, the day I got ill... a woman helped me. A woman in the street.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She helped you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. She brought me home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have her address?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL is standing holding a small bunch of flowers. He is looking puzzled at a row of bells with numbers only. The woodyard is busy. WORKMEN come out of the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRS & LANDING. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL comes up the stairwell, once grand, now in decay - green linoleum and faded red paint. The sound of a sentimental song at the open door of a small apartment. Inside, HANNA is ironing in a sleeveless smock, blue with red flowers. Her hair is fastened in a clip. She looks at him a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flat is without decoration, an enfilade of small rooms. A stove, a sink, a tub, a boiler, a table, a few wooden chairs. There is no window, just a balcony door to let light into the room. HANNA carries on ironing.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I brought you these flowers. To say thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put them down there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL puts them beside the sink. HANNA has a blanket and a cloth over the table : nothing disturbs her rhythm, as she irons one piece of laundry after another, then folds it and puts it over one of the chairs.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would have come earlier, but I've been in bed for three months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're better now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you always been weak?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no. I'd never been ill before. It's incredibly boring. There's nothing to do. I couldn't even be bothered to read.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA carries on ironing. He is becoming as comfortable with the silence as she is. She starts ironing a pair of knickers. He watches her bare arms moving back and forth. She looks broad-planed, strong. She is at peace with being watched. She puts one pair of knickers down, then does another. Then she upends the iron.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to go to work. I'll walk with you. Wait in the hall while I change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL goes out into the hall. The kitchen door is slightly open. HANNA takes off her smock and stands in a green slip. Her stockings are hanging over the back of a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She picks one up, rolls it, smooths it up over her calf and knee, then attaches it to her suspender. She reaches for the other. The flesh is bare between her legs. MICHAEL watches, riveted. HANNA seems oblivious. But as she is about to put the second stocking on, she looks at him. She drops her dress, and straightens, holding her stare. In response, he blushes, then panics and runs out of the flat. The door slams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRS. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL runs down the stairs in terror and shame, and out the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COURTYARD. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WORKMEN look up, curious, as MICHAEL flies by, slamming the outer door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM. DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL is lying in bed. He looks up at the sound of a tram going by outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET. DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tram making its way along the quiet street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM. DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL gets out of bed and quickly gets dressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL, reading a book, watches unobserved, fascinated as HANNA collects tickets. She calls out the name of the next stop. She doesn't see him as she works.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL is standing on the other side of the street from HANNA'S courtyard. He is in two minds about whether to go in. The WOODWORKERS are loading a van. He waits for them to finish before he slips in through the archway, making his way to the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LANDING. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL is sitting on the steps of the first landing. Then, as if from nowhere, HANNA is suddenly standing behind him, in uniform, carrying a box of coal in one hand, a scuttle in the other. She looks tired but not surprised to see him.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are two more buckets downstairs. You can fill them and bring them up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA walks straight past him. For a moment he tenses as if there might be some contact. But she goes by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CELLAR. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL opens the door. He turns on a dim light. There is a flight of wooden stairs into the murk of a huge pile of coke, poured in from the street. He goes down to the bottom, and picks up a bucket. He digs in to the coke, and at once it comes tumbling down on him in a cloud of dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA is at the kitchen table, drinking a glass of milk. She has taken off her jacket and loosened her tie. MICHAEL comes in with the two buckets of coal, his face and clothes filthy. She roars with laughter, full-throated.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look ridiculous, look at you, kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL sees himself in the mirror, but she has already got up, going towards the tub in the corner of the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't go home like that. Give me your clothes, I'll run you a bath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA opens the tap. There's a boiler, and steaming hot water comes out. MICHAEL takes off his sweater, then stops.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, do you always take a bath in your trousers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA takes his sweater and goes to open the balcony door. He undresses. She puts his sweater on the balcony rail.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right, I won't look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
On the contrary, she turns and walks straight towards him. MICHAEL is naked. HANNA takes his clothes from the chair. He gets into the bath. She goes to the balcony. In the bath, he submerges himself. HANNA goes out and shakes his clothes out in the open air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he comes up from under the water, she is laying his clothes back on the chair. She picks up the shampoo and hands it to him.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wash your hair, I'll get you a towel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL washes his hair, then submerges again. When he comes back up, HANNA is holding out a large towel. He gets out, turning away to hide his erection. From behind, she wraps his body and rubs him dry. Then she lets the towel fall. She puts her body against his back, and he realises she's naked. He turns and faces her.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. That's why you came back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL looks at her, awed.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're so incredibly beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, kid, you know that's not true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
At once she puts her arms round him and they kiss. MICHAEL goes down onto the floor, HANNA on top of him. All the time, she's staring into his eyes. He can't take it. He closes his eyes and, about to come, begins to scream. She puts her hand over his mouth to smother the noise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINING ROOM. BERG APARTMENT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The family is half-way through their meal. MICHAEL is sitting watching them eat, thinking about his lovemaking with HANNA.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've inconvenienced your mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many more times? I've said I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You scared her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's hardly my fault, I got lost, that's all. That's why I was late. Can I have some more?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches for more stew. THOMAS goes on eating, a look of contempt on his face, too superior to engage in this.
</DIRECTION>
<EMILY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can anyone get lost in their own home town?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The doctor told me I had to take walks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<EMILY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So?

<MICHAEL>

</EMILY>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not lying. Michael never lies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
CARLA smiles benignly. EMILY knows she's right. They all eat on for a few moments.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, I've decided, I want to go back to school tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CARLA>

	If he wants to go back, then he must.

MICHAEL can't breathe, as if some decisive moment in his life has been reached. PETER is looking at him, seeming to know what's going on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCHOOL. DAY

A massive brownstone building. The whole SCHOOL is coming out, but MICHAEL is first, in a desperate hurry, waving goodbye to his friends and running quickly away.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
</DIRECTION>

HANNA is at the sink. MICHAEL comes in, precipitate, tearing off his clothes and embracing her at the same time. He drops his trousers and lifts her onto the sink. He comes in about twenty seconds. He stands sweating.

	All right, kid, it's not just about you.

INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA has fallen asleep on MICHAEL'S chest. He is awake, looking at the birthmark on her left shoulder. The sound of the wood yard below. He kisses the birthmark. She stirs.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
She opens her eyes. A look of suspicion.

<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your name.

INT. CLASSROOM. SCHOOL. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TEACHER, in his sixties, has scrawled the words `Odysseus', `Hamlet' and `Faust' on the blackboard. The class of BOYS is attentive. Next to him, his friend HOLGER SCHLUTER. Across the way, RUDOLF.
</DIRECTION>
<TEACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The notion of secrecy is central to Western literature. You may say the whole idea of character in fiction is defined by people holding specific information which for various reasons - sometimes perverse, sometimes noble - they are determined not to disclose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEACHER>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL looks content. The bell goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR. SCHOOL. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BOYS come pouring out cheerfully into the corridor and head to the next classroom. MICHAEL'S demeanour has changed. There's a knowingness, a swagger, a confidence which is new. MICHAEL lingers for a moment, then slopes off in the opposite direction, alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCHOOL. DAY

MICHAEL comes out the back door of the school, unobserved, climbs over the railings and starts to run down the street.

</HANNA>

</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what to say. I've never been with a woman. We've been together four weeks and I can't live without you. I can't. Even the thought of it kills me.

</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA looks at him thoughtfully.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>

	Come on, it's a surprise. We thought you'd like it. We've been planning it for weeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOPHIE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. Really. I promised someone I'd do something else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
The others are furious with him. They all go off.

EXT. STREET. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL is cycling towards HANNA'S apartment, his hair wet from the lake, looking equally unhappy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA is sitting unhappily as MICHAEL reads to her. They are both in a bad mood.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh kid, kid. Stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing's wrong. It's nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA just shrugs. She goes and sits at the table to drink tea. MICHAEL is irritated.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never ask, you never bother to ask how I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It just happens to be my birthday. It's my birthday, that's all. In fact, you've never even asked when it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look if you want a fight, kid...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't want a fight. What's wrong with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What business is it of yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
She has snapped at him, razor-like.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's always on your terms. Everything. We do what you want. It's always what you want. My friends were giving me a party!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well then why are you here? Go back to your party. Isn't that what you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA puts down her cup, angry. She goes into the bedroom and slams the door. He sits, the magic of the day gone. He gets up and opens the bedroom door. HANNA is on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it's always me that has to apologize.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. HANNA lets time go by. Then :
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to apologize. No-one has to apologize. No-one can make you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA reaches for a book from beside the bed. She throws it down on the cover.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	War and Peace, kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA is on the edge of the bath, running water. She has a pale blue flowered smock. She is running with sweat. The smock sticks to her. MICHAEL gets out a book. HANNA drops lavender oil into the bath. MICHAEL stands in the bath and she washes his body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are making love on the bed. It's intense. At one point she moves on top of him. She holds his head between her hands, as if she would crush the life out of him. Then she lets go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are both sweating, exhausted. She looks a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you must go back to your friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY

MICHAEL has gone. HANNA washes out milk bottles and empties them into the sink. Then she picks up her luggage and leaves the empty apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SWIMMING LAKE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL is sitting on the pier watching as HOLGER, RUDOLF and SOPHIE swim competitively out to a pontoon, then turn back, full of energy and high spirits. MICHAEL watches for a while, then suddenly he gets up and starts to run away from them all.
</DIRECTION>
<SOPHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael. You all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOPHIE>
<DIRECTION>
But MICHAEL is running away across the lakeside beach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LANDING & HANNA'S APARTMENT. DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL opens the door. He goes in. The apartment is emptied, the rented furniture in place, all trace of HANNA gone. He looks round. He looks at the empty bath, the tap above it. He opens the kitchen cupboards - some coffee, sugar, that's about it. He goes into the bedroom, the bed stripped bare. He lies down on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL lying on the bed, curled up, in his clothes, like a foetus, asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The family at breakfast. MICHAEL slips quietly in the main door, trying to go to his room without being heard. EMILY runs to look.
</DIRECTION>
<EMILY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILY>
<DIRECTION>
Sheepishly MICHAEL appears.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where were you last night? What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I stayed at a friend's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carla.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
PETER looks. He seems to know exactly what's been going on.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the boy something to eat. I think we all knew you'd come back to us eventually.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SWIMMING LAKE. DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL is alone in the deserted pool. He is on the jetty. He takes off his clothes and slips into the water. Just his head, like a seal's, at one end, just out of the water, quite still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COURTHOUSE. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1995. MICHAEL sitting alone, thinking back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SWIMMING LAKE. DUSK

1958. The sun slants, and for a few seconds the water dazzles. He slips his head under.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COURTHOUSE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1995. MICHAEL still sitting thoughtfully by himself in the empty court. Then he looks up. An ASSISTANT has appeared.
</DIRECTION>
<ASSISTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr Berg. It is eight o'clock. Your daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSISTANT>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRASSERIE. BERLIN. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JULIA is already at the table in a chic modern brasserie. She is a sympathetic young woman of around 23. MICHAEL approaches. When she sees him, she gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was early.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIA>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL leans in and kisses her on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Julia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
They're uneasy. She looks a moment, then they sit down.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later. They have eaten. They both have big glasses of red wine. It's more relaxed.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how will you decide?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<JULIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I'm happy back in Berlin, I suppose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've seen your mother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
JULIA nods.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted to get away. There was nothing more to it. It was Paris, but it could have been anywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Away from your parents?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
JULIA doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm aware I was difficult. I wasn't always open with you. I'm not open with anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<JULIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew you were distant. I'd always assumed it was my fault.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Julia. How wrong can you be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
JULIA colours, on the verge of tears. Then she looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT & EXT. CAR. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They drive through the gleaming streets. It's been raining - Berlin is glistening. Their voices :
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I admit it now, I was nervous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<JULIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was nervous too. It's silly isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is silly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<JULIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for dinner.

<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see you very soon.

EXT. CAR. DAY
</DIRECTION>

MICHAEL lets JULIA out, and is watching her safely to her door from the car.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIA>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL suddenly gets out himself.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Julia, wait. I want to ask you a favour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<JULIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What favour?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to take you on a trip. I want to show you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<JULIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tomorrow, maybe. Can I pick you up in the car?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
JULIA doesn't need to say anything.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At ten, say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
JULIA smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL hugs her, his heart aching with love. JULIA goes in to her place. MICHAEL is left standing still in the plaza outside, not moving. Underneath the sound of what follows, thirty years previously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LECTURE ROOM. HEIDELBERG LAW SCHOOL. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1966. A WOMAN LECTURER has a class of about 75 STUDENTS. From their hair, their dress, it could only be the 1960s.
</DIRECTION>
<LECTURER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those of you for the special seminar group on The Legal System in the Third Reich, please stay on in this room. Professor Rohl will be here in a moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LECTURER>
<DIRECTION>
Nearly all the STUDENTS leave, talking among themselves. Just eight are left, dotted around the huge room. MICHAEL is one of them, now 22, in a corduroy jacket and tie. There is a lull. MICHAEL looks round at the group of oddballs, then finds ROHL, distinguished, greying, is already in front of them.
</DIRECTION>
<ROHL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we seem to be quite a small group. A small group and a select one. Clearly, this is going to be a unique seminar. Let me start by thanking those of you who've chosen to take part. Good for you. A reading list, gentlemen. Karl Jaspers, The Question of German Guilt...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROHL>
<DIRECTION>
A calm STUDENT with long hair smiles at MICHAEL. She looks like Francoise Hardy. She murmurs.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And ladies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTHE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STUDENT DIGS. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL is working alone at his desk, a light on. The door of his extremely modest student digs is open. MARTHE appears at the door, silently. He looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So this is where you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTHE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
But neither of them move. MARTHE just smiles from the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You take work seriously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTHE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<MARTHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're rather a serious boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTHE>
<DIRECTION>
MARTHE shrugs slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's how I was brought up. What about you? Are you serious?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<MARTHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're sure you want to work tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTHE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I do. But I won't work every night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<MARTHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTHE>
<DIRECTION>
They smile at one another. She goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The seminar group, long-haired, hippyish, is on the train : PROFESSOR ROHL, with MARTHE, DIETER and a few others. MICHAEL catches MARTHA'S eye. They smile. Then he opens the window, cheerful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOWN HALL. MANNHEIM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STUDENTS are having a cigarette in front of the huge building. Two black vans with barred windows come by, carrying prisoners. The first one veers close to MICHAEL on the pavement, then disappears into the inner courtyard. ROHL smiles at MICHAEL.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why all the police?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ROHL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're worried about demonstrators.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROHL>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For or against?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ROHL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROHL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOWN HALL. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A courtroom has been improvised inside the town hall. There are large windows, with milky glass, down the left-hand side. As ROHL and the STUDENTS arrive, the court is a melee of PHOTOGRAPHERS, LAWYERS and PUBLIC. The three JUDGES are already in place, next to six selected CITIZENS. MICHAEL and the others take places in the gallery
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All photographers are now asked to leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
The PHOTOGRAPHERS go.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The defendants, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
From being noisy and chaotic, the court is now silent.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first thing I'm going to do is hear motions from each of the defendants' lawyers. They're going to be arguing that there's no reason to keep the defendants in jail until the outcome of the forthcoming trial.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
DIETER grins at MICHAEL in anticipation.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am going to take these cases one by one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL is leaning down to get stuff out of his briefcase, as MARTHE shakes a pen which isn't working.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want a pen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<MARTHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got a pen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTHE>
<DIRECTION>
So MICHAEL doesn't hear as the JUDGE speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hanna Schmitz.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
There is a row of six DEFENDANTS. The fifth woman is HANNA, her hair tied in a knot, her gaze fixedly into the middle distance, not looking towards the SPECTATORS. She is wearing a grey dress with short sleeves. They all sit, sideways to the gallery. HANNA rises to her feet. The words seem to come very quietly, across a great distance.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your name is Hanna Schmitz?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
It is only when the JUDGE repeats the name that MICHAEL looks up, hearing it for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you speak louder please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Hanna Schmitz.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL is rigid, blank, just staring.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. You were born on October 21st, 1922?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At Hermannstadt. And you're now 43 years old?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You joined the SS in 1943?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was your reason? What was your reason for joining?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were working at the Siemens factory at the time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd recently been offered a promotion. Why did you prefer to join the SS?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA has a DEFENCE COUNSEL, a young man, beside her, who is about to get up. But the JUDGE forestalls him.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll re-phrase my question. I'm trying to ascertain if she joined the SS freely. Of her own free will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone waits.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard there were jobs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was working at Siemens when I heard the SS was recruiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you know the kind of work you'd be expected to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were looking for guards. I applied for a job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL is intent now, so are the STUDENTS beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you worked first at Auschwitz?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until 1944. Then you were moved to a smaller camp near Cracow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
ROHL leans into MICHAEL.
</DIRECTION>
<ROHL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you OK?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROHL>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You then helped move the prisoners west in the winter of 1944 in the so-called death marches?

<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL sits down in his seat. ROHL moves to sit opposite him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROHL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what did you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROHL>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. It wasn't quite what I expecting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ROHL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wasn't it? In what way? What were you expecting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROHL>

ROHL is looking at him. MICHAEL doesn't answer.

<DIETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought it was exciting.

<ROHL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exciting?

</ROHL>
<DIETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</DIETER>
<ROHL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Why did you think it exciting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROHL>
<DIETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it's justice.

The train hurtles through the German countryside.

<DIRECTION>
INT. STUDENT DIGS. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A student party, in a candle-lit room. MARTHE is singing to a guitar. It's been going on for hours - the STUDENTS are on the floor with beer and cigarettes. The front door is open. DIETER, beer in hand, looks out to the balcony where he can see MICHAEL bent away from them, all by himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

MICHAEL, his arms on the balcony, is smoking, looking out into the night. His eye lands on a student room in which a couple are making love.

INT. LECTURE ROOM. HEIDELBERG LAW SCHOOL. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The small STUDENT GROUP is now rattling around informally in the big lecture room.
</DIRECTION>
<ROHL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to correct an impression. Dieter said yesterday this was about justice. But is it? If it were about justice you might ask why has it taken so long? The war ended twenty years ago. Remember, there've been no significant trials between Nuremburg in 1946 and the Auschwitz trials a couple of years ago. That's a long gap. What's the reason for the gap?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROHL>
<DIRECTION>
ROHL waits a moment for a STUDENT to answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd have thought it was obvious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIETER>
<ROHL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROHL>
<DIETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cowardice. It's cowardice, isn't it? It's bad conscience. It's the big cover-up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIETER>
<ROHL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROHL>
<DIETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After the war. The German people didn't want to look at what they'd done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIETER>
<ROHL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROHL>
<DIETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because they had too much to hide. All our parents are liars. All right, mine are. So it's left to us, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIETER>
<ROHL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROHL>
<DIETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because we're not implicated.

	No, but seriously, Dieter's right. My parents, I can't even talk to them. I don't love them. How could I? How could anyone love them? Because they've told themselves so many lies, they can't remember the truth, let alone admit it. Isn't that why we signed up for this seminar?

</ROHL>
<DIETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you want to know, he was in the Waffen SS.

<DIRECTION>
There are some smiles, but DIETER rides over the reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I mean, that's what I'm saying. So were a million other Germans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIETER>
<ROHL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's exactly my point. That's why it's better not to pretend this is about justice. Forgive me, nor is it about getting into an emotional state. It has no purpose if it's just the young giving their parents a bad time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROHL>
<DIRECTION>
There's a silence. That's clearly why some of them are there.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what is it about? What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTHE>
<ROHL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Societies think they operate by something called morality. But they don't. They operate by something called law. You're not guilty of anything merely by working at Auschwitz. 8,000 people worked at Auschwitz. Precisely 19 have been convicted, and only 6 for murder. To prove murder you have to prove intent. That's the law. Remember, the question is never `Was it wrong?' but `Was it legal?' And not by our laws, no, by the laws at the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROHL>
<DIRECTION>
DIETER frowns, unhappy.

<DIETER>

<DIETER>
	<DIALOGUE>

<ROHL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. The law is narrow.

ROHL looks unapologetic.

INT. COURTROOM. MANNHEIM. DAY

ROHL is leaning forward, attentive. HANNA is standing, opposite the JUDGE, who holds up a book called MOTHER & DAUGHTER : A STORY OF SURVIVAL.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Schmitz, you're familiar with this book...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Parts of it have already been read out in court. It's an American publication, which has been translated. It's by a survivor, a prisoner who survived, Ilana Mather...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I know. I know Ilana Mather.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was in the camp, wasn't she, when she was a child? She was with her mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
The judge waits. HANNA seems arrogant, defiant.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the book, she describes a selection process. At the end of the month's labour, every month, sixty inmates were selected. They were picked out to be sent from the satellite camp back to Auschwitz. That's right, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so far, each of your fellow defendants has specifically denied being part of that process. Now I'm going to ask you. Were you part of it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
There is a stir among the other DEFENDANTS and in the court. They start talking to their LAWYERS.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you helped make the selection?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You admit that? Then tell me, how did that selection happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA shrugs slightly, as though it were obvious.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There were six guards, so we decided we'd choose ten people each. That's how we did it - every month. We'd all choose ten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you saying your fellow defendants took part in the process?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We all did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even though they've denied it? But you admit it. You're saying you took part in the process.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
The other DEFENDANTS stir with animosity, but the JUDGE is intent, following his own line.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you not realise you were sending these women to their deaths?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
He waits. HANNA nods slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes but there were new arrivals, new women were arriving all the time, so of course we had to move some of the old ones on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure you understand...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We couldn't keep everyone. There wasn't room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
The JUDGE frowns, genuinely surprised that she doesn't seem to understand his point.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, but what I'm saying : let me rephrase : to make room, you were picking women out and saying `You you and you have to be sent back to be killed.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what would you have done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA is looking at the JUDGE - a perfectly straight question. MICHAEL smiles slightly, proud of her. Everyone in the court waits for the JUDGE to answer. Silence. ROHL is impassive. But HANNA follows her own thoughts. She quietly asks herself a question.

MICHAEL is alone, smoking. On a bench, side by side, are two women. One is very small, dark, in her sixties. The other is composed, formidable, elegant, in her thirties. ROSE and ILANA MATHER. They look up, catching MICHAEL's eye. Then a CLERK leans in to the younger woman.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Mather, they're ready for you now.

The two women go into the court. The door closes.

<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY & COURTROOM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL is alone in the now-deserted lobby, unwilling to go back. Then he goes to the door. He opens it a little. The sound of the trial. He opens the door fully. MICHAEL can see that it is ILANA who is testifying. The court is conspicuously packed. Large black-and-white photographs of the labour camp now dominate the room. MICHAEL comes quietly into the back of the room as the trial goes on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL has pushed past a couple of people to sit down near ROSE who is sitting in the body of the court. He looks across to the DEFENDANTS. RITA BECKHART, a large older woman, is one of a couple who isn't bothering to listen.
</DIRECTION>
<PROSECUTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In your book you describe the process of selection...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSECUTOR>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. You were made to work and then, when you were no longer any use to them, then they sent you back to Auschwitz to be killed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<PROSECUTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are there people here today who made that selection?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSECUTOR>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</ILANA>
<PROSECUTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need you to identify them. Can you please point them out?

</PROSECUTOR>

ILANA points with her finger at the DEFENDANTS.
</DIRECTION>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her. And her. And her. And her. And her. And her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<DIRECTION>
The last finger has been to HANNA. MICHAEL watches, but HANNA does not react.
</DIRECTION>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Each of the guards would choose a certain number of women. Hanna Schmitz chose differently.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In what way differently?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She had favourites. Girls, mostly young. We all remarked on it, she gave them food and places to sleep. In the evening, she asked them to join her. We all thought - well, you can imagine what we thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA stares back, impassive. MICHAEL watches.
</DIRECTION>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we found out - she was making these women read aloud to her. They were reading to her. At first we thought this guard, this guard is more sensitive, she's more human, she's kinder. Often she chose the weak, the sick, she picked them out, she seemed to be protecting them almost. But then she dispatched them. Is that kinder?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>

HANNA looks back, not apologizing.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to move on now to the march. As I understand it, you and your daughter were marched for many months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. It was the winter of 1944. Our camp was closed down, we were told we had to move on. But the plan kept changing every day. Women were dying all around us in the snow. Half of us died on the march. My daughter says in the book, less a death march, more a death gallop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL looks along the row to where ILANA is now sitting.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please tell us about the night in the church.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL watches as ROSE looks across to ILANA. ILANA stares back at her. MICHAEL watches the exchange as ROSE nods, as if accepting she must go ahead and speak.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That night we actually thought we were lucky because we had a roof over our heads. We'd arrived in a village, as always, the guards took the best quarters, they took the priest's house. But they let us sleep in a church. There was a bombing raid. In the middle of the night. At first we could only hear the fire, it was in the steeple. Then we could see burning beams, and they began to crash to the floor. Everyone rushed, rushed to the doors. But the doors had been locked on the outside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The church burned down? Nobody came to open the doors? Is that right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone was killed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you survive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I needed to get away from the other women. Because they were panicking, they were screaming. I couldn't stand it. I couldn't stand their screaming. I was more frightened of the other women than I was of the fire. So I too my daughter and led her to the upper floor. I can't defend what I did. It's impossible to defend. I took Ilana in my arms and I led her towards the fire. There was a small gallery at the side of the church on the upper level. It saved our lives. The gallery didn't burn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>

ROSE turns, in tears, to look at ILANA.

There is a flurry of paperwork among the DEFENDANTS and LAWYERS as they turn to their copies.

	If we opened the doors, then there would have been chaos. How could we have restored order? It happened so fast. It was snowing. The bombs - There were flames all over the village. Then the screaming began. It got worse and worse. And if they'd all come rushing out, we couldn't just let them escape. We couldn't. We were responsible for them.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Yes. I'm still here.

INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<MS_BRENNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no-one else to ask. If you don't take responsibility for her, then Hanna has no future at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_BRENNER>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's kind of you. Thank you for letting me know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL puts the phone down. He looks as if he has just been handed a sentence. He gets up and stares at the wall which is now stacked with all the books he has read. Then he goes to his balcony.
</DIRECTION>

EXT & INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. DAY

<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL stands looking out over Berlin from his balcony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRISON. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL walks along the road by the prison wall, then goes to the guichet to sign in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRISON YARD. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL is waiting in a small barred waiting area as MS BRENNER walks across the yard to open the gate and let MICHAEL in.
</DIRECTION>
<MS_BRENNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're Michael Berg?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_BRENNER>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<MS_BRENNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Louisa Brenner. We were expecting you earlier.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_BRENNER>
<DIRECTION>
INT & EXT. STAIRS & PASSAGE. PRISON. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MS BRENNER is walking MICHAEL up the steps towards the prison canteen. They pass GUARDS and INMATES.
</DIRECTION>
<MS_BRENNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should warn you: for a long time Hanna held herself together. She was very purposeful. In the last few years she's different. She's let herself go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_BRENNER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CANTEEN. PRISON. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MS BRENNER leads MICHAEL to the door of the canteen.
</DIRECTION>
<MS_BRENNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're in the canteen. They're just finishing lunch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_BRENNER>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL sees an OLD WOMAN who is sitting at a table. Her blue dress is stretched too tight across her heavy body. Her hair is grey. She has a book in her lap, but she's not reading it. A few PRISONERS are finishing their meal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It takes MICHAEL a moment to realise the OLD WOMAN is HANNA. Then HANNA becomes aware of being watched. She turns and looks round. At once her face lights up. MICHAEL smiles back, but as he approaches her, he fixes onto her inquiring look and sees the light go out of her eyes, as if she has looked at him and been disappointed. He sits down opposite her. She smiles, weary.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've grown up, kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
She takes his hand. There is a long silence, MICHAEL unable to think of anything to say. He withdraws his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got a friend who's a tailor, he makes my suits. He'll give you a job. And I've found you somewhere to live. It's a nice place. Quite small but nice. I think you'll like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
There's a moment's silence.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are various social programmes, cultural stuff I can sign you up for. And there's a public library very close.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA nods slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You read a lot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I prefer being read to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
There is a short silence.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's over now, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you get married?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did. Yes I did. We have a daughter. I'm not seeing as much of her as I would like. I'd like to see a great deal more of her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
After a few moments, he concedes.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The marriage didn't last.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
There is a silence.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you spent a lot of time thinking about the past?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean, with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No, I didn't mean with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before the trial I never thought about the past. I never had to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now? What do you feel now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA looks a moment, a haunting look, searching him.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't matter what I think. It doesn't matter what I feel. The dead are still dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
There's a silence.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't sure what you'd learnt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have learnt, kid. I've learnt to read.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL stares, devastated.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll pick you up next week, OK?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sounds a good plan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Quietly, or shall we make a big fuss?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quietly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK. Quietly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other. The other PRISONERS have already gone. They stand up. She scans his face again, searching for his thoughts. He takes her in his arms, a little awkward.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take care, kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
They walk side by side, back towards the door. Then by way of saying goodbye, she takes his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you next week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
She stretches her arm out before she lets go of his hand, then vanishes inside. MICHAEL walks on alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRISON. EVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL comes out of the main entrance. He stands a moment, looking round at the evening. MICHAEL walks to his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANNA'S ROOM. EVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is simple, a bedroom to one side, a bathroom to the other. It is all furnished with simple functional furniture. The end of a hard day's work. MICHAEL hangs a picture over the desk - a landscape, reminiscent of where they once went cycling. The job is done. He looks round, grimly content.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CELL. DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANNA is lying on her bed, fully dressed. She gets up and gets some books down from the shelf. She puts them, one by one, in a pile on the table. Then she takes off her shoes. She stands up and climbs onto the pile of books on the table. Her bare feet on the books. Then she reaches up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT & INT. PRISON. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL gets out of the car. He is carrying a bunch of flowers. He walks towards the prison. He leans in to the GUARD who is in a modern office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRISON. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the far end of the corridor, MICHAEL is seen sitting on a bench. MS BRENNER comes out of her office and murmurs in his ear. MICHAEL is seen nodding, ashen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR & CELL. PRISON. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two of them come together down the corridor. They stop at the open door of the cell. The body has been removed. The books are still on the floor. MICHAEL goes in. A bare table, a chair, a bed, a closet, a toilet in the corner behind the door. There are shelves with books, an alarm clock, a stuffed bear, two mugs, instant coffee, tea tins.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She didn't pack. She never intended to leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
MS BRENNER looks at him in confirmation. MICHAEL looks at the two lower shelves on which are ranged the tapes with the cassette machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above the bed are a series of cuttings, pictures torn from magazines, showing meadows, hillsides, pasture, cherry trees. One in particular : a burst of autumnal colours. MICHAEL kneels on the bed to look at them. There are quotations, articles, recipes, even sayings in HANNA'S childish handwriting : `Spring lets its blue banner flutter through the air' is one. Then he sees a newspaper photograph : the young MICHAEL BERG receiving a prize from the school principal. The headline `Michael Berg receives school literature prize.'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MS BRENNER reaches out for a tea tin from the shelf. Then she sits next to MICHAEL on the bed, and takes out a folded sheet of paper from her suit pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<MS_BRENNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She left me a message, a sort of will. I'll read out the bit that concerns you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_BRENNER>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL looks at the effortful handwriting on the page.
</DIRECTION>
<MS_BRENNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"There is money in the old tea tin. Give it to Michael Berg. He should send it, alongside the 7,000 marks in the bank, to the daughter who wrote the book. It's for her. She should decide what to do with it. And tell Michael I said hello. Tell him to get on with his life."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_BRENNER>
<DIRECTION>
MS BRENNER looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<MS_BRENNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want to see her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_BRENNER>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRIDGE. MANHATTAN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL rides in a taxi into Manhattan. A view of the familiar skyline.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIFTH AVENUE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL'S taxi comes up Fifth Avenue. It draws up outside an expensive apartment block. MICHAEL gets out and goes in, the Manhattan skyline opening up behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM. ILANA'S APARTMENT. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A superbly appointed space full of great and expensive art. MICHAEL has taken his coat off. ILANA MATHER appears, elegant, well-dressed - on the surface, the spirit of prosperous New York. She is now in her early fifties.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms Mather?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. You're Michael Berg. I was expecting you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you must tell me: what exactly brings you to the United States?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was already here. I was at a conference in Boston.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a lawyer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was intrigued by your letter but I can't say I wholly understood it. You attended the trial?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Almost twenty years ago. I was a law student. I remember you, I remember your mother very clearly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother died in Israel - a good many years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL hesitates for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps you heard. Hanna Schmitz recently died. She killed herself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
ILANA shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was a friend of yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A kind of friend. It's as simple as this. Hanna was illiterate for the greater part of her life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that an explanation of her behaviour?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or an excuse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No. She taught herself to read when she was in prison. I sent her tapes. She'd always liked being read to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
ILANA shifts slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you start by being honest with me? At least start that way. What was the nature of your friendship?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was young I had an affair with Hanna.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
ILANA looks at him for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure I can help you, Mr. Berg. Or rather, even if I could I'm not willing to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was almost sixteen when I took up with her. The affair only lasted a summer. But.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL just looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see. And did Hanna Schmitz acknowledge the effect she'd had on your life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL stares back, understood for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She'd done much worse to other people. I've never told anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People ask all the time what I learned in the camps. But the camps weren't therapy. What do you think these places were? Universities? We didn't go there to learn. One becomes very clear about these things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<DIRECTION>
ILANA looks at him, unrelenting.
</DIRECTION>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you asking for? Forgiveness for her? Or do you just want to feel better yourself? My advice, go to the theatre, if you want catharsis. Please. Go to literature. Don't go to the camps. Nothing comes out of the camps. Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<DIRECTION>
ILANA looks at him, unrelenting.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What she wanted...what she wanted was to leave you her money. I have with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To do what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you think fit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL reaches for his briefcase. He takes out the lavender tea-tin, which he sets down on the table in front of ILANA.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
ILANA lifts the tin.
</DIRECTION>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was a little girl, I had a tea-tin for my treasures. Not quite like this. It had Cyrillic lettering. I took it with me to the camp, but it got stolen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was in it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Sentimental things. A piece of hair from our dog. Some tickets to operas my father had taken me to. It wasn't stolen for its contents. It was the tin itself which was valuable, what you could do with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<DIRECTION>
She sits a moment, overcome, her hand on the tin.
</DIRECTION>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing I can do with this money. If I give it to anything associated with the extermination of the Jews, then to me it will seem like absolution and that is something I'm neither willing nor in a position to grant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL nods slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was thinking maybe an organization to encourage literacy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<DIRECTION>
There's a silence.
</DIRECTION>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know if there's a Jewish organization?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be surprised if there isn't. There's a Jewish organisation for everything. Not that illiteracy is a very Jewish problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<DIRECTION>
There is the shadow of a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you find out? Send them the money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall I do it in Hanna's name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you think fit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<DIRECTION>
ILANA smiles slightly. She puts her hand on top of the tin.
</DIRECTION>
<ILANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll keep the tin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILANA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ILANA'S HOUSE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ILANA is standing at the window watching down to the street where MICHAEL is walking away. She has the tin in her hand. When he's vanished, she turns and goes into her bedroom. There on the dressing table, there is a framed photo of ILANA with her mother in Germany before the war. She sets the tin down beside the photo.
</DIRECTION>

INT & EXT. CAR. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1995. MICHAEL is driving JULIA in the big Mercedes through the German countryside. He is tense, silent. JULIA takes a sideways look at him, but he does not respond.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are we going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIA>
<MICHAEL>

EXT. CEMETERY. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL & JULIA stand at a deserted grave-side. The whole cemetery is seen. MICHAEL stoops down and uncovers a simple stone : HANNA SCHMITZ 1923-1988. JULIA watching, says her name.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hanna Schmitz.
	</DIALOGUE>

JULIA waits a moment.

<JULIA>

</JULIA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I wanted to tell you. That's why we're here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
JULIA looks, waiting. MICHAEL looks for a moment as if he will not go on.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIA>
<DIRECTION>
There is a moment, then they turn to stroll, MICHAEL talking, starting to tell the story.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>

	I was 15, I was coming home from school, I was ill...
