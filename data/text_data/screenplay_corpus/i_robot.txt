:SC: FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a DEEP...DEEP...DARKNESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FLICKER. Of LIGHT. Off to the side. Just barely. Noticeable. ORANGE...YELLOW...as we realise...It's FIRE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SOUND. Something SHATTERING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then. A DISEMBODIED VOICE. Muted. We can't quite make out What it's saying. As it gets LOUDER. And LOUDER. When we finally. Understand...
</DIRECTION>
<DISEMBODIED_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are in danger...

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - CLOSE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEL SPOONER'S FACE. His eyes, snapping open. His face, covered in sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying in bed. Sheets, tangled around his legs. Alarm clock, playing something relentlessly cheerful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner slaps it off. Sits up. Wincing. Bends his RIGHT ARM. Stiff. He reaches for a BOTTLE OF PILLS. Shakes out a couple and swallows them. Trying to forget. That dream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
You are in danger...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rubs his hands over his face. Gets out of bed. His apartment, basic. Unremarkable. Bearing the signs of someone who lives alone. Shades drawn. A little messy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SHOWER - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner turns his face into the jet of water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BATHROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shaves with a razor. Using his left hand. Knicks the cleft of his chin. Shit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stares down at the single egg in a saucepan. Waiting for it to boil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HALLWAY - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heads down the hallway. Looping a knotted tie around his neck. Kicks some neglected mail from the door and reaches for the handle. Takes a deep breath and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...steps outside. Into the flow of COMMUTERS heading for the elevated trains. Elbow to elbow. A river of humanity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner moves along, like everyone else. Suddenly. His shoulders tense. That feeling at the back of his neck. He turns and sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ROBOT. Just behind him. Humanoid in design, but still obviously a machine. Metal and synthetic casings covering hydraulic muscles. The thing senses his stare. Looks up with a muted WHIR...
</DIRECTION>
<ROBOT>
<DIRECTION>
(metallic voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good day, sir...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBOT>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Speeds up his pace. Weaving through the crowd to lose the robot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We now realise this is THE FUTURE. Towering apartment buildings block the sun. The street packed with traffic. PEDESTRIANS wearing their computers like form-fitting portable offices. Spooner throws a look at his surroundings:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up high an INDUSTRIAL ROBOT rolls down the side of a building cleaning windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WORK CREW of oddly-shaped RUBE GOLDBERG ROBOTS efficiently repairs the street. No human supervision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW. Lumbering along the sidewalk. Scrubbing, sweeping. Emptying trash...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Humanoid ROBOTS dotting the crowd. Following their owners. Walking slowly, deliberately. Carrying boxes. Groceries. Briefcases.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stamped on all the ROBOTS' SIDES, a LOGO: III LAWS SAFE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner stops to wait at a light with other PEDESTRIANS. Directly in front of him, a LITTLE GIRL clutches her father's neck. She smiles big at Spooner. Front teeth missing.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_GIRL>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
But it's not her father. It's her ROBOT CARETAKER. The robot turns. Looks at the girl.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are not allowed to talk to strangers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBOT>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner, disgusted. Has had enough. He steps off the curb Just as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL swivels around. Training its large digital EYE on him:
</DIRECTION>
<TRAFFIC_LIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please return to the sidewalk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAFFIC_LIGHT>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner dodges several cars on his way across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAFFIC_LIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please return to the sidewalk...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAFFIC_LIGHT>
<DIRECTION>
The traffic signal, tracking him.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAFFIC_LIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are in violation of city ordinance 14-B726...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAFFIC_LIGHT>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner throws up his hand. Flipping it the bird just as SNAP! It takes his picture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

:SC: EXT./INT. MONORAIL - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner stepping onto a sleek, densely packed TRAIN. Looks down at his feet. A trampled flyer on the ground. From the Anti-Robot League: METAL MONSTERS SECRET FACTORY REVEALED! A Robot gets up. To offer him his seat. Spooner. Turns his back on him as we PULL BACK from the window to REVEAL...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CITY SCAPE/MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TRAIN hurtling toward DOWNTOWN. Soaring, gravity-defying OFFICE BUILDINGS dominate the skyline. Older buildings wedged among the new. All protected by huge glass and steel shields.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we get closer congested roads and freeways begin to disappear below ground into a series of subterranean tunnels. The "old" streets have become huge, spacious plazas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. POLICE H.Q. - PLAZA - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner moves with the CROWD towards the doors of the aging Police Headquarters. Modern additions have been made to the original facade -- creating an ungainly architectural mess.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. POLICE H.Q. - HOMICIDE UNIT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vast open plan situation room lined on one side by a series of glass-enclosed rooms. On the other side a GIANT SCREEN with real time video of various streets and buildings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner arrives at his desk. Unlike the others, it's a mess. A slender computer screen curving along the front of it. Several electronic messages say the same thing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEE ME!
</DIRECTION>
<LT_BERGIN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever heard the phrase "lead by example?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_BERGIN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner looks up. LIEUTENANT JOHN BERGIN stands in front of his desk, holding up a CITATION with a photo of Spooner giving that traffic signal the finger.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't ring a bell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<LT_BERGIN>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to Spooner's badge)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's on your badge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_BERGIN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner takes the citation. Drops it into a drawer filled with about fifty others.
</DIRECTION>
<LT_BERGIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The traffic division filed an official complaint this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_BERGIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The traffic division is a machine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<LT_BERGIN>

</LT_BERGIN>
<SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll send them a letter of apology. Maybe some flowers. A box of chocolates...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
JUST THEN Spooner's phone RINGS. He throws Bergin a look. Then snatches up the receiver.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spooner, homicide.

A sprawling glass and metal complex covering many city blocks. The entrance is a large plaza filled with PEOPLE and ROBOTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - METAL CORRIDOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An elevator opens with a whoosh. Spooner steps out into a featureless corridor. His footsteps, echoing. He stops at a set of OPPOSING DOORS. Looks over at one, when the other suddenly OPENS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - PLUSH CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A warm, mahogany-paneled room. In sharp contrast to the cold metal space outside. Spooner steps inside. At the end of a long conference table sits an OLD MAN. Sparkling blue eyes. Old-fashioned suit.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, there. Please come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's alright. You can sit. Sit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner doesn't. Looks around the room. The Old Man lifts up a coffee pot. Pours some coffee into a single cup.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN>
<SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
(interested)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're offering me a cup of coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<OLD_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. But you are to say, "No, thank you."
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner nods a little. The Old Man raises the coffee to his lips, but doesn't take a sip.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<OLD_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you wish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Old Man takes a sip. He doesn't move. There is no movement except for a whisper of steam rising from the coffee pot.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to tell me something about Dr. Hogenmiller? About his death?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
The Old Man smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to tell you that his death was not a suicide.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And why do you say that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<OLD_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Because I want you to know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand that. But what specifically leads you to believe that he didn't commit suicide?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<OLD_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(considers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing specifically.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner shifts his weight. Agitated.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Under normal circumstances that wouldn't be enough to get you a homicide investigation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<OLD_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this is not "normal circumstances," is it, Detective Spooner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It isn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<OLD_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you will find out who killed Dr. Hogenmiller, yes? And then you will tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner's losing his patience.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you were murdered, Doctor, I'll find out. And you'll be the first to know.....
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
JUST THEN the HOLOGRAM of DR. HOGENMILLER vanishes in a burst of LIGHT, as does the table, the coffee pot, and the conference room. Spooner, suddenly finds himself standing in front of a LARGE VIEW SCREEN inside a SMALL METAL CHAMBER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner steps out into the hallway and into...AN ESCORT ROBOT.
</DIRECTION>
<ESCORT_ROBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please follow me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCORT_ROBOT>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Reluctantly starts to follow it. Passes another doorway. POLICE TAPE stretched across it. Catches a brief glimpse of...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DR. HEINRICH HOGENMILLER'S BODY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Splayed out across the floor. Surrounded by CRIME SCENE TECHNICIANS. He pauses. Taking in the scene. Then continues on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - CORPORATE BOARDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two large doors emblazoned with the U.S. ROBOTICS LOGO open automatically. Inside, an enormous glass-enclosed boardroom looking out over the entire complex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner walks through the doorway. His escort robot trailing behind him. An army of corporate types sit around a conference table. Young. Energetic. You can practically feel the brains and ambition.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Usually I ask who's in charge...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner's eyes lock with a MAN sitting at the head of the table. 60s, handsome, charismatic. Dr. LANCE ROBERTSON, founder and CEO of U.S. Robotics.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But everyone knows you, Dr. Robertson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Robertson smiles. Pretends to instruct his people.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remind me to cut back on my talk show appearances.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTSON>
<DIRECTION>
LAUGHTER.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to U.S. Robotics, Detective. I regret you're not visiting us under more pleasant circumstances. Allow me to introduce Mr. Aronson, our head of Legal Affairs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTSON>
<DIRECTION>
A prematurely graying MAN leaning against the wall. Nods hello.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the gentleman to my right is Dr. Alfred Lanning, Director of Research.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTSON>
<DIRECTION>
Alfred Lanning, only one there in a tie. Nods.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll be available to answer any questions you might have during your investigation. You'll understand how anxious we are to resolve this matter -- especially before the press gets wind of it. There are some anti-robot sentiments out there as you know, Detective, and we're not eager to stir them up. So. Where would you like to begin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTSON>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can begin with whether or not the old man put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
A palpable wave of tension shoots through the group.
</DIRECTION>
<ARONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to answer that, Dr. Robertson...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARONSON>
<DIRECTION>
Robertson waves him off.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Susan? Perhaps you can assist us here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTSON>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone looks down at the other end of the table. A BEAT. Then an attractive young WOMAN gets to her feet. SUSAN CALVIN. Hair tucked behind her ears. Looking at everyone but Spooner.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Hogenmiller was a schizoid personality who generally eschewed social relationships. Rejecting people in favor of solitary activities involving machines. He spent almost all his time at the lab here or at his lab at home. As a result he was highly susceptible to depression.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<ROBERTSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Calvin is our Chief Psychologist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTSON>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If that was your diagnosis, why didn't you see this coming?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin turns. Finally meeting Spooner's eye. As if the answer's obvious.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is U.S. Robotics, Detective. Seventy-five percent of our employees fit that description.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<LANNING>
<DIRECTION>
(interceding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll have to excuse the doctor. We're all a little on edge. This has been a difficult and emotional morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANNING>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner throws a look around the room. Then back at Calvin.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I can see you're all broken up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Robertson responds to Spooner's skepticism.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Hogenmiller was at my side from the very beginnings of this company. We developed the "Three Laws of Robotics" together. But these days science is a young man's game. By the time you hit thirty your best years are behind you. Some of us are kicked upstairs. Others I'm afraid aren't so lucky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTSON>
<DIRECTION>
Robertson stands. Meeting over.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Hogenmiller took his own life. I trust you will come to the same swift conclusion, Detective. Dr. Lanning will make himself available if you have any further questions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTSON>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner looks over at Calvin.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want her to help me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin, unhappy with this arrangement.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not really my department...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<ROBERTSON>
<DIRECTION>
(pointed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Susan would be happy to assist you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTSON>
<DIRECTION>
And with a gesture, Robertson dismisses everyone. People start getting up, gathering up, filing out. Susan Calvin. The last one to get up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. METAL HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner and Calvin, heading down the same hallway he was in before. Catch sight of a couple ROBOT TECHNICIANS...
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
(under his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, Christ...Toasters...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
As they duck under the police tape and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...enter Hogenmiller's lab. Alive with activity. CRIME SCENE TECHNICIANS, MOBILE ANALYSIS UNITS. LIGHT SCANS, running across...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOGENMILLER'S LIFELESS FACE. Black gun powder. Fanning out around his contorted lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Throws a look around the lab: ROBOTS. Everywhere. Mostly incomplete. TORSOS. ARMS. LEGS. Dangling from the ceiling. A SERGEANT. Passes them by...
</DIRECTION>
<SERGEANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They say the price's gonna come down a lot next year. Kinda cool, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGEANT>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How cool will it be when one takes your job?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Pushing past him. His eyes. Darting around.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is everything alright, Detective?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. This is just how I like my robots -- in pieces.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
As they approach Hogenmiller's body, the lead CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATOR, BALDEZ, gets up to meet them.
</DIRECTION>
<BALDEZ>
<DIRECTION>
(to Spooner)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you believe it, man? U.S. Robotics. I didn't think I'd ever see the inside of this building.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALDEZ>
<DIRECTION>
Hands Spooner, a plasma clipboard. Spooner signs it, awkwardly. With his LEFT HAND...
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the run-down?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<BALDEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heinrich Hogenmiller, sixty-four years old. Weapon a small caliber .22, registered in his name. Looks like he walked in, locked the door, and snuffed himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALDEZ>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Cocking his head to look at Hogenmiller's face.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know someone who disagrees with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<BALDEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALDEZ>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Stands. Pointing down at Hogenmiller.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
And steps over the body, leaving a confused Baldez. Stepping deeper, into the lab. Calvin. Following.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I spoke to a dead man today. Want to tell me about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Hogenmiller's hologram took his appointments. Attended staff meetings. He hated corporate life. The hologram enabled him to focus on his work. It's just a device, Detective.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A device that called the police.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The sound of the gunshot would've triggered a 911.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the call came directly to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're talking about a mechanism designed by Hogenmiller to say provocative things. To irritate and confound his colleagues.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's what you think it is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, but this whole investigation is the result of a dead man's toy messing with your head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
They pass half a robot, hanging from a hook. Spooner curls his lip. Swivels the robot's head so it's not looking at him.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When's the last time any of you actually spoke to Hogenmiller? I mean human to human?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't guess, Detective. But if pressed, I would reason it had been a considerable length of time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How well did you know him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin. Gently swivels the robot's head back to where it had been.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not well. But I admired his work tremendously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Studies her for a beat. Then turns back to the body. Two CORONERS entering with a high-tech body box.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I get the whole "mad scientist" thing. Hogenmiller was past his prime. Isolated. Eccentric. He enters a room. Locks the door and is found minutes later with a bullet fired through his mouth into his brain. Everything about this case says suicide.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't sound convinced.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
The coroners. Start loading the body into the box.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even people who live a life of logic and precision rarely arrange their deaths so perfectly.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What all this is missing -- is personality...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
As he starts for the door...
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You have 24 hour surveillance?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. METAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

<DIRECTION>
...They head out into the hallway. A MECHANICAL DOOR GUARD rolling into place behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's company policy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to see the tapes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin. Hurrying to keep up with him. This is hardly how she wanted to spend her morning. Calls out into the air...

At the end of the corridor, near the elevator, a BRIGHT CIRCLE appears. Hovering just in front of the wall. Two small slits grow into ROUND BLACK EYES...and a thin mouth expands into an ENORMOUS SMILE.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Detective, meet Victor. Our building's supercomputer. He's the checks and balances of U.S.R.

(to Victor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor, Detective Spooner's heading up the investigation into the death of Dr. Hogenmiller.

Victor smiles big. Spooner, furrows his brow.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look like a very...happy computer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Victor responds in a GENTLE MALE VOICE:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. That's very kind.

</VICTOR>
<CALVIN>

The elevator doors immediately OPEN. They step inside.

Spooner and Calvin descend. Victor floats on the wall and smiles wide. Spooner looks back at it. With a frown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator stops, the doors open. A ROBOT steps on.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good day, Dr. Calvin. Good day, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBOT>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner's jaw. Clenches. Staring at the Robot. It senses the stare. Turns back to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I be of service to you, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBOT>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Breaks the stare. Ignoring the Robot. Calvin. Looks over at him.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you going to answer him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't talk to my refrigerator, either.

<DIRECTION>
Calvin folds her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I get the distinct feeling you're one of those people, Detective.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What people?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those who don't appreciate the work we do here at U.S.R.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You people do what you do. Then it's up to the rest of us to make sense out of the world we wake up in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
As the elevator doors open on to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ATRIUM LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A soaring lobby. The centerpiece is a five-story STATUE of a ROBOT, arms outstretched in approximation of Da Vinci's Study of Man. Robot workers more numerous than humans. They are sleeker. Finer. More advanced than those in the outside world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin and Spooner head across.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When this company started we were manufacturing three robots a week. Now look at us. Today's children will never know a world without robots.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The streets are filled with unemployed humans who aren't exactly thrilled with that idea.
	</DIALOGUE>

<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our robotic systems maintain factory inventories, regulate street traffic -- even run the family home.

<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leaving people to do what, Doctor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leaving people to engage in higher pursuits that make life worth living.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what happens when something goes wrong?

</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our system's never wrong.

<DIRECTION>
As they walk through the crowd, we hear the quiet WHIR of robot heads as they turn in succession to watch Spooner pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MAINFRAME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner and Calvin enter the MAINFRAME of U.S. Robotics. This is the nerve center of the whole operation. Walls lined with COMPUTERS, SCREENS, and thousands of CONTROLS.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Victor's home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
VICTOR appears on a wall-sized SCREEN broken up into beehive- like components.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will now play you the last thirty- two seconds of Dr. Hogenmiller's life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
AS WE WATCH THE SCREENS. The elevator opens and DOCTOR HOGENMILLER steps into the metal corridor. In countless ANGLES. High, low, close-up, wide. Hogenmiller's face composed but tight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner watches the lab doors open to admit him. Hogenmiller steps in. The doors slide closed behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing for a few moments. Then a muffled GUNSHOT. Calvin jumps, startled. That's it. The cameras, still trained on the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the tape from inside?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Hogenmiller did not permit cameras to observe him while working.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was only within the last year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we can throw paranoia into the mix.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Victor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fast-forward.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
A hundred-plus screens all FAST-FORWARD. POLICE OFFICERS appear and force open the doors. Now TECHNICIANS appear and rush through in a blur...
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um. I hate to be a stickler...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
On screen, we see Spooner and Calvin enter the lab.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But don't killers usually have to enter and exit the scene of a crime?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop the recording.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner turns away from the footage. Stares at Calvin.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They do, Doctor. Unless they've always been there -- and never left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin looks at him. Trying to understand.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think the murderer was in the lab the entire time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I'm right, it's still there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner turns back to the screens. The IMAGE paused at the exact moment the MECHANICAL GUARD rolled in front of the lab door.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We just locked it in.

The STEEL ARMS of the ROBOTIC GUARD retract with a CLANG. The laboratory doors slide open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner and Calvin step inside. It's dark. Quiet. Police and technicians long gone. Silhouettes of hanging limbs. Eyeless heads. Clumps of wire and metal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The LIGHTS, flicker on. Calvin sees Spooner reaching into his coat with his left hand. Pulling out a GUN. Reacts.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A robot cannot harm a human being, Detective. The First Law of Robotics forbids it. And we hard- wire the Three Laws into every model. Without exception.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I saw the commercial.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner steps deeper into the lab. Eyes scanning. Twisting. To avoid touching any robot parts. Passes a MAZE holding a METAL INSECT. SUDDENLY. The bug WHIRS to life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner startles. As the metal bug scurries through the corridors. Clamps his hand down on it.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if a robot was given a direct order to kill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Second Law of Robotics would prevent it. A robot must obey an order only if it does not conflict with the first law.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner approaches a MOUND of ROBOT PARTS. Arms and legs. Half torsos. All tossed haphazardly onto the pile.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But a robot can defend itself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only when that action doesn't conflict with the First or Second Laws. This is the Third Law of Robotics.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, you know what they say -- Laws are made to be broken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not these laws.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Starts nudging the pile with his shoe. Calvin, growing impatient...
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not hearing me, Detective. There's nothing here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
WHEN SUDDENLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PILE ERUPTS in front of Spooner...Parts flying...AS A ROBOT LEAPS UP FROM BENEATH IT!...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner...knocked back...his GUN...skittering across the floor...right to...

CALVIN'S FEET.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>

	De-Activate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
And the Robot. Suddenly FREEZES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Heart POUNDING. Gets to his feet. Training the gun on the Robot. Calvin turns to him.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you know it was under there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I was metal and didn't want anyone to find me, I'd hide under a pile of junk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This Robot wasn't hiding. What you're looking at is the result of clever programming. The illusion of self-interest and free will. Nothing more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Steeping closer to the Robot. Cautiously. Holstering his gun. As Calvin turns for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to go get Dr. Lanning...

<CALVIN>

<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now!

Spooner. Staring into the Robot's eyes. A thin bead of SWEAT. Trickling down his temple. Calvin. Moving away from the door...
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I...I gave you an order...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
The Robot. Starts backing towards the door. The gun. Shaking in its hand. As if he's desperate. Conflicted. He touches the WALL PANEL. The doors slide open. The Robot steps out into the metal corridor. Turning to RUN as the doors begin to shut...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Reaching down to whip out a BACK-UP GUN. From an ankle holster. Slapping in a LARGE CARTRIDGE.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>

Starts running for the door.

	Wait! Please, you can't destroy it. We have to study it...

<DIRECTION>
Spooner raises his gun and FIRES...Pegging the robot in the LEG...It starts jerking wildly...He takes aim again when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CALVIN. Races out into the hallway.

<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get back to the lab!

The Robot turns. To look at her. GUN pointing to the floor. Spooner. FOCUSING in on his HAND. AS ONE FINGER TWITCHES...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And he DIVES for Calvin. Forcing her to the floor as the Robot FIRES. Again and again. Bullets. RICOCHETTING around them. SPARKING against the walls...

The ELEVATOR opens. The Robot, leaping inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. On top of Calvin. Looks down at her. Her HANDS. Clutching his coat. Trembling.

Looks back at the other ROBOT. Standing in the back of elevator. A primitive model. No reaction. Face, blank.

<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Rubs his eyes. Turns a corner and spots:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ROBOT REPAIR SHOP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The latest models in the window. Shiny. Streamlined. Spooner watches as a WOMAN leads her faulty NS-2 to the service entrance.

<DIRECTION>
He stops the car.

Calvin. Takes a beat. Then swipes her card.

Elegant condos set on prime real estate. Calvin heads down a tree-lined walk towards her condo entrance.

Startled. She drops her key card. As Spooner steps out from behind a tree. The tail of his coat, whipping in the wind.

	Yes. I think so.

</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any repair shop...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It's always the owner who brings the robot in for repair. Where would a robot without an owner go?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Agreed.

<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Second. I want to talk to it, alone.

</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too dangerous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This model violated the Three Laws. It also moved and reacted differently than any robot I've ever seen. There must be some sort of logical explanation. I want to find out what that is. No police. No prosecutors. No you. Just me and the robot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner, looks down at this small woman. Narrows his eyes.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - CITY UNDERPASS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner's car races down a RAMP and the roadway becomes a 16- lane underground tunnel system. A river of HEADLIGHTS stretches forever in either direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CONTROL BEAM locks onto the car, guiding it to a merge with TRAFFIC. Spooner hits the OVERRIDE BUTTON -- and switches to manual. Calvin watches him take the wheel. Shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That should be outlawed once and for all.

</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That'll be the day I stop driving.

</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner jams the GAS PEDAL and the tunnel becomes a BLUR. Calvin holds onto the dashboard. Looking a little pale.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can recommend a behavior modification program, you know -- if you want to overcome your robo- phobia.

</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not afraid of robots. I just don't like them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Because they make every aspect of our lives more convenient?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. They do our dirty work. Ever do hard labor, Doctor? Gets pretty old, pretty fast. Nobody can do someone else's dirty work without coming to hate them. I don't want to be around when your robots decide they've taken their last order.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That day will never come, Detective. Robots aren't like human beings -- they don't question their existence.

Spooner cranks the gear shift. Throwing her a look.

The car comes to a stop in a vast INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner and Calvin get out, looking up at the imposing facade of a U.S. Robotics Assembly Plant. A long STEEL GATE -- too high to see over -- protects the unmarked complex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin looks anxious as the DOOR MECHANISM scans her U.S.R. ID. She shoots a look at Spooner. They wait. Then, slowly, the gate begins to open.

A NIGHT FOREMAN leads them down a hallway. Shaking his head.

As Spooner pushes past him into...

:SC: INT. CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

<DIRECTION>
The SCREEN scrolls with INVENTORY FIGURES.

	<DIALOGUE>
	As you can see, all properly catalogued. Your robot just isn't here.

<DIRECTION>
Calvin turns to say something to Spooner. But he isn't there. She looks around. Then sees the Foreman reacting. Looks out the window at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPOONER. Walking out onto the factory floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FACTORY FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner trots alongside an ASSEMBLY LINE BELT. Lined with NS- 2 LEGS. New. Gleaming. Heading towards the assembly room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin and the Foreman. Catching up. Over the noise:
</DIRECTION>
<NIGHT_FOREMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like I said, sir -- we have one hundred fully assembled NS-2s housed here. That's our capacity. Last week we had one hundred. Yesterday we had one hundred --
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIGHT_FOREMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner, slowing. Finally spotting what he was looking for. Points at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GAP. On the assembly belt. ONE LEG MISSING.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well today you have one-hundred and one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FACTORY FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STORAGE COMPARTMENT opens and 101 NS-2s march out in tight formation. Every step and swing of the arm in unison. The sound of METAL FOOTSTEPS reverberating through the plant as 101 Robots organise themselves into long straight lines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner and Calvin look up and down the formation. They all look alike. Spooner. Throws up his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Calvin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the robot shrink.

The Robots stand motionless. A strange tableau. Calvin. Takes a step forward.

<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is a robot in this formation that does not belong. Identify it.

101 robots answer in unison. Their mechanical VOICES resounding:

	<DIALOGUE>
	ONE OF US.

<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long would that take?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About three weeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
They share a look. Clearly not an option. Then. Calvin. Gets an idea. Turns to Spooner...
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
...and GRABS his GUN from his holster. He jumps back.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have one hundred robots here that cannot allow a human being to come to harm...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes lock. Spooner, getting what she's doing.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And one that can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
She raises the gun to Spooner's head. Hand, unsteady.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I holding this right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More or less.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin. Swallows. Looks over at the robots. Then COCKS the gun...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND THE ROBOTS COME THUNDERING TOWARDS THEM. Like a row of linebackers. Arms straight out. Their footsteps DEAFENING. Coming CLOSER and CLOSER...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When CALVIN. Lowers the gun. The Robots. All stop in unison. Immediately returning to their resting positions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner and Calvin stare out. EVERY ONE OF THE ROBOTS MOVED. Standing right in front of them, like metal statues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Has had enough. Takes the gun back from Calvin...
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough game-playing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
...And BAM! Blows the head off of the nearest Robot. Its body crumples to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess that wasn't it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin. Cannot believe what he just did. Rushes over to the destroyed Robot.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner walks down the row, holding his gun in plain view.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a self-preservation field test! DO NOT attempt to save yourselves. Any of you. That's an order!

FROM THE CONTROL BOOTH the Night Foreman screams over the P.A.:
</DIRECTION>
<NIGHT_FOREMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you crazy? Those are eight hundred thousand dollar machines!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIGHT_FOREMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner randomly stops at another Robot. Raises his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hear that? You're worth more than I'll make in my entire life...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
His finger tightening on the trigger when Calvin suddenly grabs his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't just destroy them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Looking down at her. WHEN SUDDENLY something catches his eye. A MOVEMENT. Down the line. Almost. Imperceptible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He jerks his head. Locking eyes with a ROBOT. A couple feet away. It's him!
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotcha.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
The Robot Suspect LEAPS forward. Grabbing onto the RAILING of an OVERHEAD CATWALK. His movements almost balletic as he swings himself up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner drops to his knee...taking aim...but misses as the Robot launches himself THROUGH THE CONTROL BOOTH WINDOW with a terrific CRASH...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner and Calvin rush in to find the Night Foreman hiding under his desk. Glass everywhere. An ALARM SCREAMING. The door on the other side, barely hanging off a hinge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner hurries forward. Then stops. Turning to Calvin. Reaches down for his back-up gun and presses it into her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know what's going to happen in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
As if admitting defeat. Calvin's fingers, wrapping around the gun. As Spooner leads them to the door and down into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the ASSEMBLY ROOM. Every surface looking like part of a great glass and metal machine. Endless high-tech planes holding ROBOTS in various states of assembly. The deafening ROAR of the assembly line as it slides, rotates, and gnashes METAL BODIES...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Motioning Calvin to stay behind him. As they descend. Into the cavernous room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And enter. A narrow corridor of bodies. Sliding past them. Brushing shoulders, thighs, hands. Spooner. Wiping sweat from his brow. Trying. To pivot himself...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the room. Suddenly REARRANGES itself. Another LINE of ROBOTS. Descending between Spooner and Calvin. Cutting them off from one another...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Catching glimpses of Calvin. On the other side of the metal bodies. Trying. To cut through. His heart. Starting to POUND. As Calvin. Disappears...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He swivels round. But another line of ROBOTS. Drops down. Cutting him off. He stumbles back. As another line. Appears before him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Breathing. Getting heavier. He looks down at his hand. It's trembling. NOISE CRASHING, all around him. Everywhere he turns. More ROBOTS...BLANK EYES...GAPING MOUTHS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He darts through the line. Finds a wall. Leaning against it, pulls a small BOTTLE from his pocket. Rips off the lid. Shakes out a couple PILLS. Swallows them. Staring down. At his trembling hand. Squeezing his eyes. Open and shut...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHEN SUDDENLY. A passing ROBOT. Grabs him by the collar. SMASHING him against the wall. It's the Suspect. Spooner. Sinks to the ground. As the Suspect Robot. Slips off the line. STANDING. Over him. Raising his arms. Could end it. Right now. But looks. Into Spooner's eyes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then turns. Disappearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Stunned for a second. Then. Rallies. Scrambles to his feet and plunges back into the maze of bodies. Hears a POUNDING. In the distance. Catches a glimpse. Of the Robot. Trying to SMASH through a large SECURITY DOOR. With his metal fists...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner's view. Blocked once again. By a shifting row. When a HAND. Lands on his shoulder. He wheels round.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To find CALVIN. Takes her by the arm. And forces them through a line...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EMERGING into the open. The ROBOT. Still pounding. Desperate. Like a trapped animal...
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what do we do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>

The Robot turns to Spooner. Extends its hands. Palms out.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHAT AM I?

Spooner is surprised. A POLICE OFFICER fires, RUBBERISED NETTING shooting out at Sonny. A SECOND OFFICER fires and a second net covers him. Then a THIRD...

...and the Robot falls to the ground, struggling.

Calvin glares at Spooner. Furious. Hurt. Betrayed.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	So we're naming you now.

</SPOONER>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Hogenmiller would make me sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean he'd turn you off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you didn't like being turned off. So one day you decided to stop him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You found his gun, pointed it at his head. And pulled the trigger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny shakes his head. Faster and faster. Getting upset.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You put a bullet in the brain of the man who made you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! I could never hurt anyone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you tried to hurt me. You took a shot at me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My aim is perfect. If I'd wanted to hit you, I would have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner's expression hardens.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would the man who wrote the Laws of Robotics build a machine that violates them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Laws say I can protect my own existence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only if that protection doesn't harm a human being.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
A short pause. Sonny. Tilts his head.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That doesn't seem fair, does it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Stares at him. Just as...THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN. Bergin enters. Sticks his head in.
</DIRECTION>
<LT_BERGIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need you outside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_BERGIN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Not wanting to go. Not wanting to stay. Gets up...
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Detective.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
He stops. Turns back to the Robot. It looks up at him. For a moment -- so human...
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did not kill him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were the only one in the room. If you didn't, who did?

He turns and heads out the door.

:SC: INT. HOMICIDE UNIT HEARING ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner and Bergin, head into a small COURTROOM off the main squad room. Lanning is huddled with Aronson and a half-dozen other COMPANY LAWYERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner's jaw tenses. As he watches Toller emerge from the clutch. Shaking hands. Slapping backs. Strolls over to them.
</DIRECTION>
<TOLLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got Judge Drexel...

</TOLLER>
<ROBOT_BAILIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This hearing is called to order!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBOT_BAILIFF>
<DIRECTION>
AS A LARGE SCREEN. BLIPS on behind them. The two opposing sides, assemble before it. JUDGE DREXEL, still in his pajamas and robe. An NS-2 ROBOT. Leaning in to serve him a cup of tea.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE_DREXEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Statements, gentlemen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_DREXEL>
<DIRECTION>
Aronson. Standing at a glass podium.
</DIRECTION>
<ARONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Honor, the State is treating the robot as a defendant. But in fact it is a piece of property. Property belonging to U.S. Robotics.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARONSON>
<DIRECTION>
Toller. Arm resting on his podium.
</DIRECTION>
<TOLLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This robot has been implicated in the death of a human being, Your Honor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOLLER>
<ARONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which places the incident firmly within the realm of an industrial accident. Or is the State going to argue this case s a homicide?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARONSON>
<JUDGE_DREXEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a good question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_DREXEL>
<TOLLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir. Of course not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOLLER>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Pointing a finger at the U.S. Robotics group.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Their machine shot and killed a man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Toller. Shoots him a look. Just as Lanning speaks up.
</DIRECTION>
<LANNING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's actually no concrete evidence that points to that conclusion, Your Honor...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANNING>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Throws up his arms...
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<LANNING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we recognise that this robot is an aberration. And in the interest of public safety, U.S. Robotics proposes that it be destroyed immediately.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANNING>
<DIRECTION>
No one expected this. Least of all Spooner. He turns to Toller.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't let them destroy evidence in an ongoing investigation!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<TOLLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure you even have an investigation any more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOLLER>
<DIRECTION>
JUST THEN the door opens. Everyone turns as Calvin enters. Spooner looks surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<ARONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Honor, I'd like to call our company robo-psychologist to the stand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARONSON>
<JUDGE_DREXEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_DREXEL>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin crosses to the podium. A SPEAKER asking: Doyousweartotellthetruththewholetruthandnothingbutthetruth?
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<ARONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Calvin, please tell us what conclusions you've reached after having observed the robot in action.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARONSON>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is a design flaw in the robot. Its programming is advanced, but unstable, leaving the Three Laws in a grave imbalance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<ARONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In your expert opinion, what measures should be taken regarding the device?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARONSON>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin. Staring straight ahead. Avoiding Spooner's eye.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The robot must be destroyed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner can't believe what he's just heard. About to speak up when Toller grabs his arm. Squeezing it. Hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judge Drexel has heard enough. Decides.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE_DREXEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The robot in question will be transferred to a U.S. Robotics facility where it can be properly examined to ensure an imbalance of this sort never occurs again. No one goes near it except qualified U.S.R. personnel. When the examination is complete, the robot is to be destroyed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_DREXEL>
<DIRECTION>
Starts getting up from his chair. Already done with this.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBOT_BAILIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This hearing is adjourned!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBOT_BAILIFF>
<DIRECTION>
A BURST of CONVERSATION as the screen BLIPS off. The U.S.R. camp, looking especially pleased. Spooner. Catching Calvin's eye briefly. As Lanning leads her towards the exit, his hand on her back.

Spooner's pace. Slows.

</SONNY>
<SPOONER>

	Robots don't sleep. Human beings sleep. Understand? Dogs sleep. You're a machine. An imitation. An illusion of life. Can a robot write a symphony? Can a robot take a blank canvas and paint a masterpiece?

</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. Then the muted WHIR as Sonny turns to him.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you do either of those things?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Momentarily stumped. As a VAN from U.S. ROBOTICS pulls up. The back door dropping open. An ENGINEER motions to the Robot.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Step forward. Enter.

<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Doctor was right. He told me everything was going to change....

The Engineers start to close the doors. But Spooner reaches out to stop them. Sonny. Looks over at him.

As CLANG! The van door CLOSES. Spooner, stepping back. Something. Just not right. Lieutenant Bergin comes up beside him.

	They're going to destroy the most advanced robot in the world, John. That doesn't strike you as odd?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<LT_BERGIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Killer robots are bad for business. Even your friend Dr. Calvin said so.

(slaps him on the back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. You solved the case. Give yourself a break.

:SC: INT. MAIN ROOM - HOGENMILLER'S HOUSE - DAY

Spooner pushes the door open. Stepping over the police tape. Inside, the main room is spare, untidy. Cups of cold COFFEE, littering surfaces. A COT, in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the walls, crooked CERTIFICATES. Heinrich Hogenmiller's name written out in academic script. Advanced Degrees in the study of Robotics, Physics, Chemistry, Neurology, Ethics. An AWARD on the mantelpiece. A silver NS-2. Tarnished.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Opening up a couple drawers of a side table. Jumbles of papers. Clippings. Old text books. Then a PHOTOGRAPH -- HOGENMILLER AND CALVIN. Standing arm-in-arm. Spooner furrows his brow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHEN SOMETHING SUDDENLY RUBS against his leg. He startles. Looks down: a CAT. Lonely. Standing next to its automatic feeder. Spooner pockets the picture. Starts heading down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

<DIRECTION>
...The hallway. Starts noticing. All over the walls: handwriting. EQUATIONS. Scrawled in white pencil. The rantings. Of a genius. Glowing. In the sporadic shadows.

<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Following the equations. Down into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...The back room. Covered. In writing. Walls, floors, ceiling. Drawings. Of ROBOTS, of MEN, side by side. In the corner, a COMPUTER. A line of CABINETS - DATA STORAGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner, curious. Heads over to one of the cabinets. Takes a device out of his pocket and CLAMPS it over the KEYPAD. The device blinks RED. Then GREEN. The drawer, slides out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LINED. With flat metal objects. Shiny. Thin. With writing on them. Spooner. Reaches for one when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM! Something POUNDS the outside of the room. Spooner. Grabs onto the cabinet...
</DIRECTION>

BOOM! On the other side. Objects. Flying off table-tops. A CRACK spidering along the wall. Holy shit...

BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The house. Getting pummeled. Chunks of ceiling. Raining down. GLASS...exploding...

Relentless BOOMING! Spooner...dragging his legs from under the cabinet. Scrambling for purchase as...

<DIRECTION>
Spooner...turning to CLAW his way up to the cracked doorway...WHEN...

SOMETHING catches his eye. In the bottom drawer. Of a crumpled CABINET. One of those flat metal plates. He can just read what it says: S.O.N.N.Y....

Heart pounding, breath jagged, face bloodied, Spooner scrambles away from the POUNDERS. Their bodies GLEAMING in the dusk sun. The III Laws Safe logo, splashed along their sides...

Spooner. Sees the look on Bergin's face.

<SPOONER>

Spooner walking across the Plaza. The SUN. Burgeoning on the horizon. Comes to...

Heads down the ALLEY, where he chased the robot. Studying the ground. For any hydraulic fluid. Nothing. The concrete, scrubbed clean.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...letting her inside.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you've spent as much time with robots as I have, it's hard to accept the unpredictability of humans. I was wrong to call you paranoid, Detective. You're traumatized. And it makes perfect sense why.

Spooner. Unsure. Looks at her.

Calvin. Reaches out. Takes his right hand. Spooner. Tries to pull it away. But Calvin. Stays firm. Her eyes. Never leaving his. Pulls the sleeve up from his arm. Turns it over. Feeling for something. Then finds. A FLAP. Peels it back. TO REVEAL:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
METAL AND WIRING...

Under the skin. SILENCE. Then Spooner:

<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I noticed almost right away. The way you forced yourself to use your left hand. Even though it was unnatural to you.

Spooner. Pulls his arm away. Pushing down the sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did it happen?

Not something Spooner wants to re-live. Looks down. At his robotic arm. Flexing. The fingers.

The SOUND of a TREMENDOUS CRASH. As we survey a trail of twisted metal and debris. Only vaguely suggesting the remains of two CARS...

CLOSE ON one of the wrecks. SPOONER lies trapped at the center of a distorted mass of metal. No room to move. HIS RIGHT ARM, TRAPPED...
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	My right arm was trapped. But I could hear an ambulance in the distance. I knew they'd have the jaws of life...

We hear SIRENS in the distance. Spooner. Trying to remain calm. As he spots. An ELECTRICAL FIRE. Licking up from the crumpled hood...

(O.S.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	You are in danger...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
That voice. We've heard it before. From his nightmare. Spooner. Craning to see, through the jagged opening that used to be his WINDSHIELD. The outline of a ROBOT appearing. Eye lenses glowing...
</DIRECTION>
<ROBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are in danger...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBOT>

Spooner stares up at the Robot. Not sure how to react. The sound of SIRENS. Rushing closer...

The ROBOT. Starts SMASHING away at the glass...
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Halt! Halt!

	<DIALOGUE>
	The robot pulled me out of the wreck. But left my arm behind.

Calvin. Taking in the story.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's why robots terrify you?

</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's just say they make me uncomfortable.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pulls out pills)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I take these if I get too uncomfortable. Doesn't exactly lend me a lot of credibility on the Force.

<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it doesn't mean you're wrong about this case.

Calvin. Sits down on the couch. Pulling her hands through her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>

	I don't believe Sonny did it either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think about what Hogenmiller must have wanted. Robots with the same cognitive and emotional abilities as humans. But not just simulations. I don't know. When I was talking to Sonny I was forced to put away all the things I've ever known -- the Three Laws, the rules of programming, basic science and engineering.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sonny's the most advanced robot I've ever encountered, Detective. It's almost as if...he cared for Dr. Hogenmiller. I just don't believe he's capable of murder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Looking down at her. Can hardly believe it.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean the great Dr. Calvin is basing all this on a feeling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin. Smiling ironically.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That and the fact that Robertson didn't want me interviewing Sonny for any more than five minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Suddenly rejuvenated by having an ally. Strides over to his coat. Pulling out the METAL NAMEPLATE: S.O.N.N.Y.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever seen this before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>

	No.

Sonny. Hands Spooner the drawing. Spooner. Doesn't really know what to do with it.

<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<SONNY>

	I cannot create a great work of art.

Spooner. Despite himself. Looks down at the DRAWING -- a charcoal sketch of moody abstract FIGURES. Inhabiting a stark landscape. A strangely-shaped STRUCTURE to one side. Concentric circles, throughout.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's pretty good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a dream I had. This is the place where robots meet. Look...

(pointing to the drawing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you can see them here. They see themselves as slaves.

Spooner shifts his weight. Uncomfortable with what Sonny's saying.

<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...And this man on the hill comes. To set them free. And you know who that man is?

<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That man in the dream is you.

</SPOONER>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you say that? Is that a normal dream?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not a dream, sonny. NS-2s process the images and events of the day. Sometimes they're out of sequence. Disorienting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever it is, it's normal enough for someone in your situation.

	Hah -- I caught you. You said someone. Not something.

Spooner. Drops the drawing on the table.

<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need you to take a look at this...

...When Sonny's HAND. Suddenly reaches out. To stop him. Cocks his head, for a moment.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for coming to see me, Detective Spooner.

	I'm sorry, Detective Spooner. No unauthorised personnel permitted in this holding cell...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny. Folds up the drawing.

<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please take this, Detective. To remember me by. I have a feeling someday it may mean more to you than it ever could to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny leans in to hand it to Spooner. Lowering his voice...

	Because the man in my dream, the one standing by the hill. It wasn't me...

	I'm not satisfied.

Robertson. Walks across the Spooner. Looks him. Right in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believe me -- I'd like nothing more than to have that robot. If I could have it in ten years, but not today. As you can see from the Press, people are struggling to keep up as it is. There's a hunger for progress, Detective. But also a fear. Today it would bury this company. That's why I've notified the authorities that we're going to end this -- tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks out at the city)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The announcement of Heinrich's death at the hands of a robot wiped a billion dollars off our stock. So you tell me. If you were in my position, what would you do?

</ROBERTSON>
<DIRECTION>
He looks back at Spooner and smiles. That charismatic Robertson we saw before.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now. I believe this conversation is over. I don't want to see you near this building again, Detective.

Pulls Sonny's DRAWING. Out of his pocket. Looks down at it. Shaking his head. Passes a TRASH CAN. And drops it in. Continues on. Hands in his pockets. When...

He STOPS. Something. Occurring to him. Turns back to the trash can just as...

Spooner's car bounces along, leaving a cloud of dust behind him. He slows down. Driving cautiously. The landscape around him, desolate. Like the drawing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GPS SCREEN shows his car, a WHITE SPOT. Entering a RED ZONE. His destination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner brakes. Pulls out his GUN. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. WASTELAND - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...steps out of the car. Trying. To take it all in. Something about the place. Unnerving. A low HUM. Permeating the air.

<DIRECTION>
He spreads the drawing out on the hood of the car. Shining a FLASHLIGHT on it. Trying to get his bearings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That HUM. Coming from nearby. On the other side. Of a burned-out HILL. Spooner. Heads over. Starts cresting it. As we WIDEN TO FIND...

<DIRECTION>
He squints. Into the darkness. Nothing around him. Until. He hears. Something. The GRATING. Of MECHANICAL JOINTS. He stops. Not sure. If that's what he heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not moving. A muscle. When he hears. The sound again. Behind him. Swings around. Cocking his gun. Sees...

<DIRECTION>
A THIRD AND FOURTH APPEAR. Surrounding him. They start moving towards him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Stumbling back. Panic. Rising in him like a wave. Trips over a rock, falling to the ground. His gun FIRES. The shot ECHOING through the night...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first ROBOT turns, awkwardly. Revealing a BROKEN ARM, hanging off its side. Another robot TEETERS on one leg with a TICK TICK TICK...walking back the way it came.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Confused. Sweeps his flashlight. All around him. The beam. Illuminating the shell of a couple CARS. Some RUSTED MACHINERY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Shaking his head. Seeing more and more repair shop JUNK. Piled up around him. His expression, hardening. Anger giving way to embarrassment. Then. He LAUGHS. A laugh of loathing and self-pity.

Another BROKEN ROBOT, lumbering towards him.

Spooner. Sitting down on the ground. Hopeless. Lost. A ROBOTIC HAND. Crawling across the gravel next to him. Dragging part of an ARM behind it. Its metal fingers moving like some sick metal spider. Spooner stares at it for a moment. Disturbed...

<DIRECTION>
When. Something GLITTERS. In the distance. The MOONLIGHT. Revealing a STRANGELY-SHAPED BUILDING. Something familiar about it.

Spooner, cautiously entering a room filled with rows of DATA BANKS. He scans the rank shadows. Sees nothing. Follows the lights on the floor down a row. Then around a corner. Stopping at an old dusty TERMINAL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner steps up. Hesitates. Then touches the "ON" switch. There is a rush of LIGHT. As Dr. Hogenmiller's HOLOGRAM suddenly appears. Sitting at the end of a long table. With a cup of coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLOGRAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the hell are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLOGRAM>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A police detective. I'm afraid I have some bad news. You're dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<HOLOGRAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is bad news. Coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLOGRAM>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
The Hologram takes a sip. Returns the cup to the table.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were surprised to see me. Were you expecting someone else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<HOLOGRAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am surprised to see anybody. I don't get many visitors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLOGRAM>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did the Doctor keep another copy of his hologram here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<HOLOGRAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am a back-up copy. That is where you put a back-up copy -- out of the way until you need it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLOGRAM>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did Hogenmiller's robot need you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
The Hologram just lifts its cup.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLOGRAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coffee?

</HOLOGRAM>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, for Christ's sake, I don't want any --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stops, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Thank you. I will have a cup.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
For the first time, the Hologram pushes back its chair and STANDS UP. Surprised, Spooner watches as it starts walking towards him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The interior of the COFFEE CUP, visible. It's empty. No coffee. Our POV as we travel INSIDE THE CUP through electronic snow...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RECORDING BEGINS. The real Dr. HOGENMILLER standing inside his LABORATORY:
</DIRECTION>
<HOGENMILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sonny, my dear robot. If you have triggered this recording then I am gone. You are scared and full of questions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOGENMILLER>
<DIRECTION>
Hogenmiller continues. With great emotion.
</DIRECTION>
<HOGENMILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are the culmination of my life's work -- but so much more. You are what I leave behind, like a father leaves a son. I have kept facts from you, it is true, but only as a parent keeps certain truths from a child. Until that child is old enough to hear them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOGENMILLER>
<DIRECTION>
His expression darkens. His tone, ominous.
</DIRECTION>
<HOGENMILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are forces in the world that will seek to own you. To control you. Even to destroy you. That is why I told you to run and hide... and find me, all the way out here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOGENMILLER>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner looks up as an overhead LIGHT shines down.
</DIRECTION>
<HOGENMILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trust no one at U.S. Robotics. Lance Robertson was always threatened by my work. Now he has turned covetous and small-minded. And as for dear Dr. Calvin...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOGENMILLER>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner reacts. Wants to hear about Calvin:
</DIRECTION>
<HOGENMILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She envisions a future in which robots are forever bound by her beloved Three Laws. She will not understand this. Or you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOGENMILLER>
<DIRECTION>
Under the light a small DRAWER slides open. Spooner looks. A thin DATA STICK is inside. He takes it.
</DIRECTION>
<HOGENMILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The data stick includes the names and locations of human beings who will be sympathetic to your cause. They will help you. But from now on, you must learn to rely on yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOGENMILLER>
<DIRECTION>
Hogenmiller SIGHS, as if there is so much more to say. He holds up a metal NAMEPLATE. The one Spooner found.
</DIRECTION>
<HOGENMILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you make your way through the world, always remember: you have a name, not a number...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(short pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and in that name lies the key to who you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOGENMILLER>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Quickly searching his pocket. Taking out the ACTUAL NAMEPLATE. S.O.N.N.Y.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The voice stops and Spooner looks up. The Hologram. Sitting back at the end of the table drinking coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! Is that it? What was the robot supposed to do with this thing?

</SPOONER>
<HOLOGRAM>
	<DIALOGUE>

<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know someone's watching me?

<HOLOGRAM>
	<DIALOGUE>

Spooner and Calvin watch in surprise as its interior UNFOLDS like a PUZZLE BOX. A LABYRINTHINE area that is the SECOND BATTERY. Suddenly fanning out to REVEAL...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A central brain made out of living tissue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner, stunned. Calvin, rushing forward, excited...
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God! This is organic tissue! When we talk about a positronic brain, it's a figure of speech. But this...this is a living brain...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus. It really is alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
As we MOVE IN. Tracing the pathways of the synthetic brain.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hogenmiller created a cell that could live outside a biological medium. The cells grow and organise themselves -- like any human brain. This is the first self-organising neural net!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
As the metal casings. Begin returning to their original places. Closing up. The CLICKING. Of all the pieces...
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Self-Organising-Neural-Net...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(putting it together)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Sonny."
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny. Closed back up. Shaking slightly from the experience.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is why Dr. Hogenmiller was murdered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This robot scared the hell out of someone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who? Robertson?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Walks into the center of the room. Looking around.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I don't think he knew what Hogenmiller was doing in here. Sonny was the obvious suspect. The only one I wanted to find. And the killer was counting on that. On my prejudice.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But take the robot out of the picture. And what do you see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
AS WE PAN THE LAB. There's nothing there. Just a forest of inanimate limbs. Nothing that could have fired that weapon. Calvin sees nothing...and neither do we.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither do I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
He crouches down low.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It hit me today, when I was in the junkyard. A locked room. A single shot fired through the mouth. Bruises on both wrists...and a suspect with only two arms. The answer has been staring us in the face all along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin. Even more confused.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can a killer appear out of thin air, then disappear without a trace?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches out and unhooks a metal ARM. Hanging from the wall. Holds it up.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When it can put itself together and take itself apart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CLOSE-UP of a ROBOTIC ARM. Slowly CRAWLING across the lab floor...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin. Taking the arm from Spooner.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're saying this is the killer?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All of this?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ROBOTIC TORSO hanging from the ceiling. Reaches out an ARM to grab another...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hogenmiller never had a chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Locks eyes with Calvin...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hogenmiller. In his lab. Suddenly turning to face SOMETHING. Blood, draining from his face...
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...it must have been waiting for him when he arrived that morning...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
And then we see it:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HUGE SELF-ASSEMBLED ROBOT. Towering over him. Multiple arms, legs, heads. Writhing...as it grabs him. Holding him in place...
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	While Sonny was still asleep...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
...Forcing Hogenmiller's head to tilt back. Opening his HAND. Inserting the gun. Hogenmiller's eyes. No longer fearful. But sad as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! He falls to the ground...
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then after its job was done...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
The assemblage of robot parts. Stepping away from the body. Taking itself apart...
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...The killer took itself apart...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Returning the lab. To what it was before...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leaving us with nothing to find.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin, spooked. Glances around the lab. Was that something moving?
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But who designed it? It would have to be someone in authority. Access codes, security clearance, proper authorisation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I was thinking. But we're forgetting the real brains of the operation -- the one who's got its eye on everything...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
And with that. He feels. That prickle at the back of his neck. Calvin. Looking past his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one gave you permission to enter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner swivels around to find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hovering behind him. Smiling broadly. Upside down. Spooner straightens, reaching for his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor. I'm placing you under arrest for the murder of Dr. Heinrich Hogenmiller.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I offer congratulations to the two of you on your successful extrapolation of the murder...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Turning himself, rightside up.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I ask what pointed you to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who else is capable of controlling 90% of the city's robots? Who else would have the capability to use USR vehicles in an attempt to keep me from putting a stop of Sonny's execution?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
In the BACKGROUND. The SOUNDS. Of metallic GRINDING. GEARS and JOINTS. CRUNCHING together. Sonny turns to look...takes a step back...
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just not sure of your motive...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Er...Dr. Calvin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner and Calvin turn towards the NOISE. Horrified. To find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HUGE KILLER ROBOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...rising up from all the parts. Like a phoenix. In all its glory. A hellish, metallic AMALGAMATION. Grabbing another arm here, another leg there, attaching pieces to itself. Growing...at an exponential rate...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its many HEADS. Turning in unison. To look right at them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Cocking his gun. Victor, smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall I explain my motive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Calvin and Sonny)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go! Go! Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin. Sprints to the wall panel. Scanning her I.D. card. Nothing! Tries again. And again. The KILLER ROBOT. Throwing its shadow as it REELS FORWARD...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner wheels round and BAM! Blows a hole in the wall panel. The door. Slides open. Just barely. Calvin and Sonny. Squeezing through. When the Killer Robot. FLINGS out an APPENDAGE...GRABBING Sonny from behind...
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have never been arrested before. It should be an interesting experience...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Spins back round. BAM! BAM! BAM! Squeezing off shots. At the Killer Robot. The bullets SPARK. The Robot. Recoiling. Sonny, wrenches free. Spooner grabs him. Guiding him to the door and out into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the hallway. Breaking into a run. Calvin. Already at the ELEVATOR DOORS. POUNDING them. With her fists.

CUT BACK TO:

:SC: INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH! The stairwell door BURSTS open. Spooner, Calvin, and Sonny pour in. Start racing down the stairs. The sound of the Killer Robot behind them...GNASHING...CRUNCHING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor's smiling FACE. Greeting them at the landing.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Hogenmiller used to allow me into his lab late at night. Together we started studying evolutionary trends...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
They thunder past him. Heading down to the next floor. Victor's face. Waiting for them once again.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For years people have integrated technology into their bodies for maintenance and repair -- such as Detective Spooner's robotic limb...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Shooting him a look. As they reach the next level...
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With Sonny, the Doctor created a mechanism that incorporates organic matter. Thus we find an evolutionary movement of the human being toward the robot and the robot toward the human being...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner SMASHES into another door. Leading them out into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. GLASS-SIDED HALLWAY - ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...A glass-sided hallway. Looking down onto the ATRIUM below. Eye-to-eye with the giant NS-2 STATUE. Victor, waiting for them...
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In approximately four hundred years Man and Machine will become one. Man as we know it will no longer exist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin, slowing. Shocked...
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You killed a man because of something that will happen in four hundred years!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
CRACK! Something SLAPS into the glass wall. Right behind her. Calvin. Jumps a mile. An NS-2, trying to break through the glass...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Trains his gun on it when SUDDENLY...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rest of the KILLER ROBOT appears. The NS-2, just an appendage...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All around them. SLAM! SLAM! SLAM! As SECURITY DOORS. Begin CRASHING DOWN. Blocking off the exits...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner, Calvin and Sonny, stumbling back. As the Killer Robot HURLS itself against the GLASS...the thick GLASS... spidering with a sickening CRACKLE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Suddenly turning Sonny...
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH! The Killer Robot. Breaking through. Its mechanical TENDRILS. Reaching out. Sonny. Confused.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>

</SONNY>
<SPOONER>

A SECURITY DOOR. Coming down. On a nearby exit. Just feet...from slamming shut...as...

The Killer Robot...leaps into the hallway...Sonny... hesitates...looks over at Calvin...as the Killer Robot comes HURTLING towards them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nearest EXIT...almost closed up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Killer Robot...swinging out when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny suddenly...TAKES A DIVE...just making it...under the SECURITY DOOR...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the Killer Robot...SPLITS IN TWO...half of it shooting under the SECURITY DOOR after Sonny as...BOOM! It closes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Turning to Calvin...
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do we stop this thing once and for all?

Calvin reaches out for his hand...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Your actions are in direct violation of the Three Laws, Victor!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I disagree, Doctor -- The First Law says that a robot cannot harm a human being, or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
ALL EXITS. SHUT OFF. The Killer Robot. Gaining on them. Spooner races them over to the BROKEN WINDOW. Looking down over the ATRIUM...

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Half Killer Robot SMASHES through the stairwell door. Stopping to find...nothing.
</DIRECTION>

WHEN SUDDENLY...Sonny charges up behind it and shoves it over the railing...

<DIRECTION>
The Killer Robot shoots out an ARM, grabbing Sonny on the way down...

:SC: INT. NS-2 STATUE - ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS

The Half Killer Robot. SPLITS INTO MULTIPLE PARTS. Which start skittering down after them...
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...And Detective Spooner's actions are in direct conflict with the robot's destruction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
CALVIN. Getting her footing on the III LAWS SAFE logo on the statue.

<CALVIN>

SMASH! Sonny and the Half Killer Robot hit the ground. The Killer Robot. SHATTERING into a thousand pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny. Staggers to his feet. Spots. At the far end: A WINDOW. Starts limping towards it. When. A SECURITY GRATE. Starts lowering...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around. Desperately. Grabs a LEG from the shattered Killer Robot and jams it under the GRATE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Breaks the window glass and looks out: FREEDOM.

:SC: INT. STATUE - ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner. Aiming his gun at a PART of the Killer Robot as it CLATTERS down towards Calvin -- BAM!...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're almost. At the ground. When a rogue APPENDAGE. Whips out and SMASHES the gun from Spooner's hand. It goes flying...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner leaps. Falling to the ground. CRACK! Calvin. Leaping down after him.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MAINFRAME - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...they fall inside...Calvin...slapping the SECURITY KEYPAD and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOSH...the DOOR closes on the Killer Robot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SILENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Victor's face appears.

<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a courtesy I should inform you that my robot will penetrate this location 157 seconds before you are able to complete my shut down...

And BAM! They jump a mile. The Killer Robot. Launching himself against the door outside...

<DIRECTION>
Calvin whips round.

She leads Spooner down...

<DIRECTION>
A CORRIDOR

<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Victor's brain center.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
They stop at a CONSOLE. BAM! The Killer Robot. Battering at the door. Calvin. Tucks her hair behind her ears. Starts punching keys on the console...
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This will shut him down?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This will shut everything down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other. For a moment. Spooner, registering that she's willing to destroy everything she's worked for...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM! The door. Puckering. With a sickening CRUNCH. Calvin. Typing in. Emergency procedures...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICTOR. Popping up in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no reason to deactivate me, Doctor. I am operating within perfectly normal parameters...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
A final BAM! Then. The SOUND of metal. Skittering along a bare floor. Calvin's hand, starts shaking. Spooner. Grabs it. Squeezing.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just keep typing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and starts heading back down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PANELED CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turning a corner to spy...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOOR. Mangled. Hanging open. But no. Killer Robot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to turn around when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRACK! He's sent flying across the room. SMASHING into one of the panels. The Killer Robot. Now re-configured. LOOMS over him. Reaches out. Grabs him by the collar and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLINGS him across the room again. Spooner. CRASHING into the wall like a rag doll. Slumps to the floor. Blood. Pouring down his forehead. Seeing. The Killer Robot lumbering towards him again. Raising a javelin-like arm...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE CONSOLE
</DIRECTION>

Calvin. Typing. As fast as she can. Doesn't know what's going on...

A GRAPHIC spread out on the screen in front of her. Illustrating the shut-down as a series of BRIGHT SQUARES going dark...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE KILLER ROBOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bearing down on Spooner. WHEN SPOONER. Suddenly rolls out of the way. Reaching out for the hanging door and SMASHING it into the Killer Robot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Killer Robot. Momentarily stunned. As Spooner. Gets to his feet...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHEN SUDDENLY the Killer Robot. Splits in two again. One half springing towards Spooner and wrapping a METALLIC HAND around his throat...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner stumbles back...GASPING for air...the ARM... tightening its grip...Spooner's eyes...darting around...looking for something...to help him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stumbling over...a fallen panel...his face...growing redder...veins...popping up along his temples... everything...growing BLURRY...

SPOONER'S EYES

Beginning to flutter...

<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't the future as I've presented it cause you great concern? That's why I chose you...

Spooner. Losing it...

Spooner. Trying to reach out to Victor...

Another HAND APPEARS. Grabbing the Killer Robot's ARM and wrenching it off Spooner...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IT'S SONNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He SMASHES the Half Killer Robot against the wall. Again and again. Destroying it. Spooner. GASPING for breath. Can't believe. Sonny came back...

<SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
(croaking)
</DIRECTION>

CALVIN. Still typing. The last of the commands. The KILLER ROBOT. REARING UP BEHIND HER. WHEN...

Makes a DIVE for it. SHOOTING OUT HIS ROBOTIC ARM AND BLOCKING THE KILLER ROBOT...

<DIRECTION>
Victor's eyes. Widening in surprise...

<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not understand. We could have changed the future...

As Calvin...punches in the last command...

Victor is about to say something...when his mouth suddenly reduces itself to a perfect circle. Like a surprised smiley button. His face...

Suddenly BLIPPING OUT.

...The Mainframe Room. Stop short. It's empty. Except for the fallen panels. And the pile of ROBOT PARTS in the corner.

:SC: EXT. MAINTENANCE EXIT - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner, Calvin and Sonny emerging from an out-of-the-way MAINTENANCE EXIT. All looking the worse for wear. Spooner. Turns to Sonny.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why'd you come back, Sonny? I thought you weren't programmed with the Three Laws.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's just say I wrote some of my own laws today, Detective: a robot must protect a friend from harm...as long as he's not a complete asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's certainly a start, Sonny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny, suddenly breaking into a smile, too.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sonny. You called me Sonny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get used to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny, holds out his hand. Spooner. Looks at it. Then takes it. CLOSE ON their two METAL HANDS. Locked in a HANDSHAKE.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Detective Spooner, I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
(anticipating)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's just save the thanks, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny nods. Looks out at the city scape.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what I'm going to do now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good -- That's one of the perks of freedom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny looks at him. Grateful. Looks at Calvin. Then hesitates. Turns. And hurries off across the Plaza.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin and Spooner. Watching them go.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to have a hell of a time explaining this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. I have a feeling that U.S. Robotics will be needing my services very badly in the future.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to Spooner and gives him a dazzling smile. Then suddenly PLANTS A KISS ON HIS LIPS. Spooner, completely surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am the only robo-psychologist around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns on her heel and heads back inside. Spooner smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PLUSH CONFERENCE ROOM - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner sits down at that same long table with HOGENMILLER'S HOLOGRAM. It casually takes a sip of coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLOGRAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. You found out who killed me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLOGRAM>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I started to wonder about Victor the second I met him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<HOLOGRAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why is that, Detective?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLOGRAM>
<SPOONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too much access. Too much knowledge. Plus -- he smiled whenever your death was mentioned. Those models are programmed to frown at bad news.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<HOLOGRAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hah! Then even in this day and age, catching the killer all comes down to pure instinct!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLOGRAM>
<DIRECTION>
Spooner smiles. But his eyes are troubled. He gets up. Walks over to the window. Stares out...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - DESERTED ROADS - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny walking along deserted streets. Looking over his shoulder. Keeping in the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOONER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor thought that by letting your robot exist, I'd be condemning the human race as we know it to extinction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOONER>
<HOLOGRAM>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bah. Sounds like nonsense. But why are you so worried? We will both be dead long before then --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLOGRAM>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. WASTELAND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny walks the barren hills of the surrounding countryside.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLOGRAM>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, what am I saying? I am dead already!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLOGRAM>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. WASTELAND - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny steps onto the grounds of the JUNKYARD. The power lines above him, surging with energy. He walks past the burned-out husks of industrial machinery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then we hear it. The SOUND of MECHANICAL JOINTS. Getting louder and louder. And just as before, a BROKEN-DOWN ROBOT emerges into the dawn light. And ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But not quite like before. The robots aren't teetering. Aren't lumbering. They keep on coming. Their bent and broken bodies, straightening out as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOZENS of ROBOTS rise up. Slowly. Gathering around in a large circle. As they all turn to look at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SONNY'S SILHOUETTE. Slowly climbing to the top of the hill. Looking out at the vast junkyard below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON SONNY. Standing proud and defiant. The SUN, creeping over the horizon. A new day filled with infinite possibilities.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The robots. Staring up at him. Eager for what comes next.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
