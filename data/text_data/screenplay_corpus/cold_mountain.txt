<DIRECTION>
A RAUCOUS VOICE (SWIMMER’S) CHANTING IN THE CHEROKEE LANGUAGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RANGE OF MOUNTAINS SLOWLY EMERGES: shrouded in a blue mist like a Chinese water color. Below them, close to a small town, YOUNG MEN, armed with vicious sticks and stripped to the waist, come charging in a muscular, steaming pack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their opponents, also swinging sticks, attach the pack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ball, barely round, made of leather, emerges, smacked forwards by INMAN, who hurtles after it and collides with a stick swung by SWIMMER, a young and lithe American Indian. Inman falls, clutching his nose. The ball bobbles on the ground in front of him. He grabs it and gets to his feet, the blood pouring from his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His team form a phalanx around him and he continues to charge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PRISTINE CABRIOLET pulled by an impressive horse, comes down towards the town. It has to pass across the temporary field of play, parting the teams. Some of the contestants grab their shirts to restore propriety as the Cabriolet and its two exotic passengers passes by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver is a man in his early fifties, dressed in the severe garb of a minister, MONROE. And next to him, a self- conscious girl in the spotless elaborate, architectural skirts of the period, is his daughter, ADA. Inman, using his shirt to staunch his battered nose, looks at Ada, astonished by her. An angel in this wild place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Swimmer stops chanting and begins, more hesitantly, to translate into English:
</DIRECTION>
<SWIMMER_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will be lonely. You will howl like a dog as you walk alone. You will carry dog shit cupped in your hands. You will be smeared with dog shit. Your spirit will wane and dwindle to blue, the colour of despair...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWIMMER_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
As the Cabriolet passes, SWIMMER takes the ball an with a whoop starts to run towards the opposing goal. The game resumes. Ada looks back as the men swarm into each other, sticks and fists flailing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SIDE OF BEEF turns on a huge barbecue. The battered teams eating, drinking hard liquor, rehearsing victory and defeat, illuminated by a roaring bonfire. Swimmer is sewing up a gash in Inman’s cheek as he continues to translate:
</DIRECTION>
<SWIMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...This is your path. There is no other. That's a curse you can use on the Yankee before battle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWIMMER>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that works?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<SWIMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to say it in Cherokee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWIMMER>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said it to me in Cherokee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<DIRECTION>
During this, Monroe and Ada have arrived, escorted by SALLY SWANGER, a local woman, middle-aged, kindly, and her husband, ESCO, a glorious curmudgeon. The Monroes are introduced to various locals. Inamn watches them, on the other side of the crowd. The Reverend Monroe, his daughter Ada. Up from Charleston, bringing God's word to you heathens! Is Esco's preferred introduction. Building a church. Inman watches Ada, moves his head to keep her in view as Swimmer stitches, and winces with pain.
</DIRECTION>
<SWIMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So keep your head still.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWIMMER>
<DIRECTION>
Sally collects plates for the Monroes. Hands them to Ada and her father, who wait, patiently, for silverware. Esco takes a plate, picks up a skewer of meat, bites on it. Monroe pluckily follows suit.

EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAPTION: PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA. JULY 30TH, 1864. IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF THE CIVIL WAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STAND OF TREES. The pastoral lush green Virginia. A RABBIT surfaces from its hole. Peace and beauty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A second RABBIT shakes itself from the ground, darts into open ground to confront the FORBIDDING TRENCHES OF THE CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMIES, RANGED AGAINST EACH OTHER ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF PETERSBURG. Massive wooden barricades in the shape of crosses, rows of X's, define the two lines. The Federals have been laying siege for months. So early and it's already hot. The trees are an oasis of green in a world of mud between the two stark and ugly scars of the trenches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CONFEDERATE LINES, the men are rousing, boiling water for coffee or to shave, smoking, stiff from night. There's a large gun emplacement and some men still sleep against the stub-nosed cannon. Another RABBIT is disturbed from its hole. Ears pricked up to a distant rumbling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dark hole. Some evil place. A scraping sound. Shapes burrowing forwards at a crouch. A silent purpose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young OAKLEY, freshly recruited, approaches a group of men, like him Highlanders from Company F of the 25th North Carolina Regiment. He doles out breakfast. Inman, loading his heavy LeMats pistol, its nine rounds, is not hungry. Oakley serves another, ROURKE, last seen in the scrum at Cold Mountain. Oakley keeps his head low as he serves.
</DIRECTION>
<ROURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, son. Those Yankee boys keep store hours. They ain't open yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROURKE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shadows and shapes. A BARREL rumbles along the tunnel. It reaches a kneeling figure, who rolls it forwards. A relay team. At the end of the tunnel, where it widens, a man, naked to the waist, crouches, stacking the barrels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RABBIT, scared up, darts along the trench. Rourke sees it, beckons to another Cold Mountain boy, Butcher.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's fresh breakfast. Shoot him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCHER>
<ROURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not firing, start the damn war off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROURKE>
<DIRECTION>
Butcher chases after the rabbit, Rourke in raucous support.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crouching man has wrapped FUZE WIRE around the last barrel, and now retreats, paying out the wire as he does so, as each man in the tunnel crawls backwards behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rourke weaves through the gun emplacements, laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<ROURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my rabbit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROURKE>
<DIRECTION>
Great sport. Inman, fifty yards away, looks over, amused, goes back to his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL. DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fuze wire is lit. It fizzes towards the barrels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rourke is running BUT NOW THE GROUND BUCKLES UNDER HIM AND HE'S BEING LIFTED SLOWLY INTO THE AIR, the earth swelling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN APOCALYPTIC EXPLOSION. FOUR TONS OF DYNAMITE RIP THE GROUND OPEN IN A CRATER 135 FEET LONG, 90 FEET ACROSS, 30 FEET DEEP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HORSES, GUNS, MEN ARE BLOWN TO PIECES AND THROWN UP INTO THE AIR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INMAN DISAPPEARS UNDER DIRT AND DEBRIS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pandemonium. The Confederates are in complete disarray. The Federals pour forwards across NO MANS LAND, through the peaceful oasis of trees, roaring the roar of attack. They flood towards the crater, hundreds of them, charging into a dense and impenetrable WALL OF SMOKE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEN THEY'RE INSIDE THE GREAT GASH OF CRATER AND CAN'T GET OUT AGAIN, arriving at an insurmountable wall of mud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Confederates regroup. Orders are yelled. Chaos developing into battle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Confederates begin firing into the crater. Guns and mortar wheel round and empty into what is becoming a terrible death trap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman gets to his feet. Oakley with him, and rushes through the smoke to the pit, emptying his LeMats into the crater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER: A BLACK REGIMENT from the Union join the attack. Bodies falling on bodies as the Federals charge in and pack their comrades even tighter. The Confederates make a pincer movement outside the Crater, forcing all the Federals in. It's Medieval.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CONFEDERATES jump into the pit to engage the Federals. Hand to hand fighting. Too close for rifles, just bayonets, and guns swung like clubs and Inman sliding down into that hell, tiring the nine rounds, then the shotgun charge, which does a terrible damage. Primitive. Unutterable carnage. Men killing each other in embraces, soldier crushed against soldier, desperate to survive, to kill, to live. An oozing layer cake of bodies, dead and frantically alive, drowning in slick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YOUNG OAKLEY loses his rifle and picks up a magazine case, clubbing his opponent, then slips onto him and is stuck with a bayonet, the pain of which makes him squeal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INMAN GOES AT IT. He's a warrior, punching and stabbing and firing. A coldly efficient killer. He's grabbed from behind and crushed, a hand gouging at his face, an almighty struggle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He falls and lands on top of Oakley, and he and his Federal opponent fight to the death with the wounded boy as their pillow. The slaughter continues over and around them, the sound, the sound of hell and madness. The boy has his arm around Inman, like lovers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER: The Confederates run after the retreating Union soldiers, firing, cavalry riding them down. Inman stands, the boy's blood all over him, exhausted and appalled. The crater, behind him, an abattoir of men. The victors are yelling, pumped mad with adrenaline. Butcher comes alongside Inman.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was something! That's hell and we've been there! Kicked old Nick's asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCHER>
<DIRECTION>
A WOUNDED BLACK SOLDIER sits up as Butcher celebrates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butcher runs over, but can't find a charge for his musket. He looks around in the stack of corpses, pulling out weapons,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
tries one: not loaded, throws it down, tries another: not loaded. The wounded man can't get up, tries to drag himself like a crab away from Butcher. Inman yells at him, appalled.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a charge?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCHER>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up another musket. It fires. The wounded Federal slumps back, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE AFTERMATH. The dead being piled up for burial, divided into allegiance. Wounded prisoners able to walk are led away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A great deal of casual looting. Of boots, of equipment, of personal items. Inman sees a soldier in the crater, lining up wounded Federals, putting their heads in a row. THE MAN EXTRACTS A HAMMER FROM HIS BELT AND, SATISFIED HE HAS AN ECONOMIC ARRANGEMENT, PROCEEDS DOWN THE LINE, SMASHING EACH SKULL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman turns away, sees another Rebel, extravagantly costumed, a strange FIDDLE head protruding from his knapsack. This is STOBROD THEWES. He's bent over a dead Federal, examining his mouth. He reaches behind his back and roots around in the knapsack, producing A PAIR OF PLIERS, WHICH HE INSERTS INTO THE CORPSE'S MOUTH. He's yanking away when A SWINGING BOOT connects with his head and knocks him to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Startled, he looks up to see Inman hovering over him.
</DIRECTION>
<STOBROD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's gold in his mouth he got no need for.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We take his boots.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOBROD>
<DIRECTION>
He examines his fiddle for damage. Some orderlies pass, lifting OAKLEY away on a gurney.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oakley's pale as a maiden, the life leaking from him. Inman walks a way with him. Oakley looks up, desperate to be brave.
</DIRECTION>
<OAKLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got a few. You saw?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OAKLEY>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<OAKLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you don't recognise me. I'm Mo Oakley's boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Inman finds this incredible)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. I was thirteen when you all left. Am I going to die?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OAKLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Inman flicks his eyes to the Orderly, whose look confirms the boy's wounds are certainly mortal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman sits on the ground beside Oakley's cot. Around them, the wounded are certainly dying, makeshift care, oil lights, groans.
</DIRECTION>
<OAKLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to hear some music while I go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OAKLEY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman walks around the campfires. He hears some fiddle music. It's Stobrod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stobrod sees Inman. Inman stares, his expression an instruction, the turns and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stobrod stands over Oakley. Consults with Inman.
</DIRECTION>
<STOBROD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Bonaparte's Retreat? That's one I play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOBROD>
<OAKLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Play me something sweet. Like a girl's waiting for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OAKLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Stobrod looks at Inman, confused.
</DIRECTION>
<OAKLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Play me something like there's nothing to fear from a merciful Lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OAKLEY>
<INMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Stobrod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You heard him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<STOBROD>
<DIRECTION>
(nervous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I only know a couple of tunes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOBROD>
<OAKLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like when you're thirsty up at Bishop's Creek and the water is so cool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OAKLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Inman glares at Stobrod. And Stobrod starts to play.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hesitant, then with gathering confidence, improvising, increasingly expansive, as if he's as surprised as everyone else. Oakley's lips move. A whisper. Inman leans in.
</DIRECTION>
<OAKLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm reaching Cold Mountain before you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OAKLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Stobrod plays. It's wrenching. Oakley stills. Inman abruptly puts his hand on the neck of the fiddle, stopping Stobrod. The boy is dead. Inman gets to his feet and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONFEDERATE TENT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dozen men in the tent. Inman has a BOOK, its cover gone, rolled up and tied with a leather strap. His bookmark is A FADED TINTYPE PHOTOGRAPH of a solemn young woman. He unwraps the book carefully and reads a page by the sickly light next to his bedroll. An OFFICER comes into the tent, approaches Inman, who makes a stand.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get up, soldier. You are mentioned tonight in my report. You are a credit to the Highlands, to North Carolina and to the Cause.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<INMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(tight)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have news, sir, on my application for transfer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. A bloody day. It's what our General said: Good thing war is so terrible else a man might end up liking it too much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir. It was my understanding the medical corps was desperate for volunteers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right now, soldier, it's me who is in need of volunteers. There's a dozen Yankees in that stand of trees between us. Stuck there from the retreat. Come daylight they can shoot us down for sport.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful night. Lots of stars. Inman and three others, including Butcher, slide over the top of the trench, far to one side of the stand of trees. The plan is to cast a wide arc that will bring them around back of the trees, closer to the enemy side than their own. The four men slither over the ground. They pause. Inman has arrived at a tangle of corpses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slithers over them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They work their way towards the trees. THERE ARE A HALF DOZEN FEDERALS CROUCHING IN THE COVER OF THE TREES. They are dozing. Only one of them sits with a rifle surveying the Confederate lines, the others have their backs to the enemy, sitting against the trunks, grabbing a few minute's sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the four rebels approach, still crawling, one of the Federals opens his eyes, sees the attack, shifts for his rifle. INMAN IMMEDIATELY STANDS UP, FIRING INSTANTLY, killing him and two others, while Butcher throws himself at another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The exchanges are brief and savage and one of Inman's party and all of the Federals lay dead. Then the rebels break from the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FLARE goes up, then another, both from the Confederate trenches. INMAN AND HIS ACCOMPLICES ARE PICKED OUT IN A BRILLIANT GREEN LIGHT. Shots follow, from both sides, aimed at the three returning men as they zigzag towards their own lines. As they get close, voices cry out, rippling down the trench, joining their own admonitions: Don't shoot, Hold your fire, they're our boys, Hold your fire!!! They're almost home. Butcher is laughing, whooping. Then just as suddenly he falls, wounded. Inman stops, turns back, runs to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman collects Butcher, drags him, carries him. They're fifty yards from their lines. A BULLET CATCHES INMAN IN THE NECK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes down like a tree, blood pouring from his neck. Lying on the ground, he watches the phosphorescent lights slowly fade to black, all sound fading with them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. 3 YEARS EARLIER. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WOODEN JOIST swings across the view of the Blue Ridge. Men are swarming over the roof of an unfinished CHAPEL, below which appears the small town of COLD MOUNTAIN. Among the workers, armed with nails and hammer, knees clutching a rafter, is Inman, fresh and a whole lifetime younger. Rourke and Butcher are also there hammering, building, kidding around and Oakley, barely a teenager.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below them, women are setting up a lunch for the workers, ADA amongst them. She has the circumspect air of the blue stocking, uncomfortably aware of the dirt beneath her hem, the men's radar for her every move. Inman watches her as Sally Swanger approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<SALLY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ada, how are you settling in? Are you liking the farm?

He drops down to ground level, takes the lemonade, scowls at the other guys. They're breaking for lunch and as they make their way to the trestle tables -- they enjoy jostling Inman.

And he turns and joins the other men gathering round the tables for lunch. Ada watches him, intrigued. Rourke and co. approach ESCO SWANGER, a known sympathizer with the North, to give him a bad time.

<ADA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Men? I don't know. I don't even know what a woman should be like. In Charleston I was called a thistle, twice, by two different men. Both of them -- they were hunting for a simile, what was I like -- and thistle came right to them.

EXT. BOTTOM FIELD, SWANGER FARM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman's working in the field, stripped to his undershirt, hot work, wielding a scythe. He hears something and looks up at the edge of the lane, ADA IS PLAYING THE PIANO, which is still strapped to the cart. She briefly raises a hand to Inman, then nods to the farmhand who sets them on their way again. Inman smiles, waves back, watching as the cart rumbles off down the track.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's pouting with rain. INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE, ADA IS PLAYING THE PIANO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Men and women crowd into the parlour, in best clothes, celebrating the completion of the Chapel. Inman is outside on the porch, his coat soaked, water pouring off his hat. He looks at Ada. She finishes. Monroe steps in front of the applause, smiling. His words of thanks leak through the window to Inman, who stands, watching, listening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARLOUR, BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monroe circulates, with Ada. He nods at a group of men, who congregate in one part, not mingling. Their leader, TEAGUE, might be a minister himself, favouring a black dress coat, a black crow in the corner, eyes flashing. Ada doesn't know them. Esco comes by. Monroe puts a hand on his arm.

<MONROE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Esco, our friends there --

</MONROE>
<ESCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Teague and his boys. I'd recommend you kick them out except a man don't kick a snake. One time the Teague family owned the whole of Cold Mountain. My farm, your farm, all belonged to his grand-daddy. Teague wanted this place bad. You got it. He's here sniffing out an advantage.

</ESCO>
<MONROE>

	There's no advantage here, but to celebrate a job well done. Cheers --

EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful day, the farm peaceful. Inman walks up the path to the farmhouse, its borders flowering and pretty, a slave woman weeding. He knocks on the door. Monroe answers.
</DIRECTION>
<MONROE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Inman.

Inman hovers, awkward. Ada appears, awkward.

EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monroe and Inman and Ada touring the farm. It's a biggish property, over three hundred acres. And well-tended by the dozen slave farmhands who work it, some of whom are dotted about in the landscape. Rolling mountains dominate the view.
</DIRECTION>
<MONROE>
<DIRECTION>
(expansive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to get sheep into this field. A big field doesn't look right without sheep. You're a lucky fellow, Mr. Inman, you've had this view all your life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONROE>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<MONROE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a special view. I dragged my poor daughter to Cold Mountain from Charleston because of my Doctors -- they say my heart is weak -- so the air's meant to do me good. But it's the view I think heals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONROE>
<DIRECTION>
Ada walking behind, comes alongside the two men, threading her arm into her father's but, by so doing, also arriving next to Inman.
</DIRECTION>
<MONROE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to get on my visits. Can I offer you a ride back into town?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONROE>
<DIRECTION>
Inman looks at Ada. No word.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARLOUR, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the window Ada watches the Cabriolet head towards town.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the piano, she unwraps the leather lace from the package of music. Inside the first book of music, there's a DAGUERREOTYPE OF INMAN with his LeMats, a typical Confederate pose. Some of the music has left its imprint on the picture, the notes like a melody over Inman's face. Ada picks them out on the piano.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ebullient sound of Shape Singing. A noisy choir letting rip --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN, MAY 20TH, 1861. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- THE WHOLE CHURCH IS SINGING, MEN TO ONE SIDE: WOMEN TO THE OTHER. Monroe conducts, sings. Inman is there, as is Ada. He fixes on her neck, the way the hair falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door bursts open. Young OAKLEY, apologetic nod to Monroe, sits at the back, then leans forward, as the singing continues, to say something to Rourke, who says something to Butcher, the news spreading like wildfire. Rourke gets up, leaves. Butcher gets up next, follows. Another man. Another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Depleting the male voices, until only women and some of the older men are singing and one side of the church is practically empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman, remains, fixed on Ada. Who does not look round.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Those left in the congregation now spill out into what has become a melee as the NEWS OF SECESSION goes up. Enormous excitement, particularly among the boys, who now seem curiously attractive to the girls. Inman blinks out into the sun, Ada finds him. They're awkward as they watch other sweethearts embracing.
</DIRECTION>
<ADA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you have your war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADA>
<DIRECTION>
TEAGUE AND HIS MEN COME RIDING UP THE STREET, their horses clearing a path amongst the celebrating crowd. Teague reins in his horse and rides it up against Esco Swanger.
</DIRECTION>
<TEAGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those who follow Lincoln, or preach abolition, best keep one eye open when they're sleeping, Old Bogey Man might get you!

Inman steps between Esco and Teague, holding the reins of Teague's horse, easy and dangerous.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you the law all of a sudden?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Teague produces a document, which he waves in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<TEAGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, son. Home Guard for Haywood County. I'm the law from today. You all go fight now. We'll watch your sweethearts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEAGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And he spurs on his horse, his fellow Home Guard falling in behind, riding on over the ridge. Inman walks to Ada.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You might be safer back in Charleston.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<ADA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But then who'll be waiting for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADA>
<DIRECTION>
She puts a hand on his arm for a second. They both want to get to the point of declaration but don't know how. They stand, people noisy around them, those about to leave, those about to be left.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to walk back inside the Chapel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<DIRECTION>
And he does so, making his meaning clear for her to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman walks inside. Stands with his back to the door. It opens and closes. Inman turns. It's Monroe.
</DIRECTION>
<MONROE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you want a quiet word?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONROE>
<DIRECTION>
Now the door opens again and it's Ada. She's dismayed to see her father.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just some quiet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<MONROE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course Ada.

He indicates they should both leave. Inman sits at a bench.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monroe and Ada come into town in their cabriolet. They pass under banners proclaiming the Confederate cause: Old Rip's Awake! Watch out Yankees! The trap draws up by the Cold Mountain General Store. Monroe lets Ada down.
</DIRECTION>

INT. BEDROOM. ROOMING HOUSE. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INMAN SITS ON HIS BED, wearing pants and a vest. His room is like a monk's cell. Nothing in it. Inman's trunk is packed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's polishing his boots, in his bare feet. One hand inside the boot, the other blacking it. There's a knock at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens it. It's Ada. He abruptly closes the door on her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY, ROOMING HOUSE. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ada waits outside. She's not sure what's happening. Then Inman opens the door. He's buttoning his shirt. His boots are on, one conspicuously dirty, one highly polished. Somebody walks up the stairs, carrying a jug and bowl. They separate as the man passes them. They're tender, awkward.
</DIRECTION>
<ADA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found you this book. William Bartram. They tell me it's good. I think he writes about these parts, the author, so...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADA>
<DIRECTION>
Inman takes it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She has something else. Wrapped in paper.
</DIRECTION>
<ADA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hands it to him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not smiling in it. I don't know how to do that, hold a smile, so now I'm solemn...

<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ada...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<ADA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADA>
<DIRECTION>
HE KISSES HER, pressing into her, his arm circling her waist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below them the sound of a MARCHING BAND. It's the RECRUITMENT PARADE and brings Rourke and Butcher racing down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman pulls away from Ada as the boys hurtle for the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<ROURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ROURKE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rourke, Butcher, and then Inman appear in the doorway of the Rooming House, and then fall in with the motley crew of Volunteers AS THEY MARCH BY WITH THE BAND AND THE ENLISTED SOLDIERS. The town is out to wish them well, parents, younger brothers, sweethearts walking alongside their brave men. Ada comes to the door of the Rooming House. Inman looks back and sees her, but almost immediately loses her in the crowd. THE DRUMMERS DRUM, THE CROWD CHEERS, THE RECRUITS MARCH UP THE HILL --

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEHIND CONFEDERATE LINES, VIRGINIA. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- AND THE WOUNDED AND THE WRETCHED STRAGGLE ALONG THE RAILROAD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TRAIN with the seriously injured snakes past the back of the Confederate lines -- its suburbs of supplies, arriving and departing troops -- and into peaceful country. FIDDLE PLAYS, THEN A BANJO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOX CAR. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CROWDED WAGON. It's a cauldron, and those able smash through the wooden walls to make a breathing hole. Some have their heads thrust out like crated poultry. INMAN IS IN THERE, neck bandaged, its ugly seepage making a bloody necklace. The light plays black and white through the boarded sides of the boxcar, flashing on Inman's face as he drifts in and out of consciousness. He focuses and sees the strange head of STOBROD'S FIDDLE. Stobrod is serenading him, accompanied by an angel-faced and extremely heavy child-man, PANGLE, whose grin of delight seems permanent even in this claustrophobic, grim world. Inman is panicked, puts a hand to push the fiddle away. His voice is a croak, spoiled.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not dying.

</INMAN>
<STOBROD>

(to Inman)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Truth to tell they say you are, Soldier. We'll meet again, in the better world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOBROD>
<DIRECTION>
He changes his tune, and the tempo, finding a foot-slapping rhythm, the two musicians grinning at each other. Inman lapses back into unconsciousness. The rhythm becomes a hammering sound...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- AS A MAN HAMMERS A TINTYPE OF HIS SON'S FACE into the wooden porch of the Chapel, where it joins many other portraits of those lost to the war. Monroe presides. One of the slaves from Black Cove holds the ladder for the bereaved father. Other families wait, with their own daguerreotype to mount. It's a memorial service without bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riders approach. Home Guard. Teague brings his horse up alongside Monroe at the Chapel door, tips his hat in condolence to the bereaved families. With him is a young, intensely beautiful and flamboyant rider, BOSIE, his hair long, a single fingernail bizarrely overgrown. Somehow sinister.
</DIRECTION>
<TEAGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My condolences to you all.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he considers the slave)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Cold Mountain at its loveliest. The CABRIOLET with Monroe and his daughter heads towards the farm. At a bend they meet a couple of riders, TWINS, from Teague's Home Guard, riding furiously past them. Monroe reins in the trap and lets them thunder past before continuing on their way home. Monroe is intrigued by Ada, as if he's never looked at her before.

<DIRECTION>
Monroe gets out of the cabriolet and runs into the fields after the retreating family, who are carrying bundles, chairs, personal items, all loaded up. Ada has already taken the reins and has driven up to the house. THE BARN IN WHICH THE SLAVE FAMILY HAD LIVED IS ON FIRE. Monroe catches one of the women, remonstrates with her. She's upset, distressed, one of her sons comes back, pushes Monroe to the ground. They hurry away. Monroe gets up, hurries to the fire.

INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INMAN lies; bandaged, eyes closed, in THE BALLROOM OF A COLONIAL MANSION, co-opted as one ward of a Confederate hospital. Rows of beds, the wounded and the dying, are lodged between some vestiges of the room's former glory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOME LOCAL WOMEN, conscious of their duty to the cause, are brought through by an exhausted doctor, who's lost all his grace. The windows are open, but it's still insufferably hot, the muslin curtains barely moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most of these men will be dead by the morning or, if they're stubborn, by nightfall. I have other men outside in the quadrangle waiting for the beds.

ADA PLAYS THE PIANO. Chopin's Prelude in E Minor. Outside in the garden, Monroe has adjourned to his striped campaign chair, and is hunched over his notes. The door of the parlour is open and the music floats over to him as he works.

They go to the back of the store, to a screened-off area. Mrs. Castlereagh hands her over a packet of material. There's another, more furtive, transaction to take place. Mrs Castlereagh hands over a second parcel as if it were narcotics. Ada tears at the wrapping. It's a parcel of books.

EXT. APPROACH TO BLACK COVE FARM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IT'S WINTER. A solitary RIDER jogs his horse through the frost, towards Black Cove farm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ada is working at a handpump, failing to coax water from the well. She's wrapped in blankets. The farm is somewhat unkempt and so is she. The hem of her skirt is frayed. She rips at it tearing off a strip of material, which she binds around the handle in an attempt to thaw the mechanism. Then she looks up to see the horseman approaching. It's Teague. Ada immediately heads inside the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Teague arrives at the house, takes a brace of RABBITS from his saddlebag. He heads for the gate. The gate needs oiling, the path is overgrown, he looks at the pump handle, the abandoned pitcher.

Ada opens the door, pinning her hair.

He turns and stops at the gate, runs his hands through his hair and uses the grease to ease the hinge. Then steps up onto his horse, and rides away. Ada watches him. Shudders.

INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ada comes into the kitchen. A weak oil-lamp reveals THE TWO RABBITS, partially covered on a plate, flies buzzing around them, a little liquid leaking from them. Ada takes a knife and contemplates skinning gutting them. Suddenly she gathers them up and runs out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ADA BURIES THE TWO RABBITS. The wind howls. She covers the little hole with soil and stones. Pumps out water to wash her hands. Thinks she hears a noise, listens, alert to any unfamiliar sounds, then hurries back to the house.

Ada comes inside, she closes the door. Locks it. Puts a chair against it. Goes upstairs, to her bedroom.

Ada enters her bedroom. It's a chaos of books, clothes, dishes. She closes the door, sets another chair against it.

Then drags her armchair up against that, books and papers spilling onto the floor. She props up Inman's portrait, on, the chair, as if he were guarding her. Sits on the bed and, desolate, begins to write:

THERAPY FOR WOUNDED SOLDIERS. Some of those convalescing swim or are helped to paddle in the healing sea. There are rudimentary wheelchairs. Inman, a long way from home, is amongst those sitting in one of these, very still, grey and sick -- but alive. He pulls at the dressing on his neck, exposing the still raw and livid wound to the sea air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman has his Bartram, his bookmark is the battered and foxed picture of Ada, which he considers, before continuing to read.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him A HUNDRED SLAVES AT WORK IN THE FIELDS, and behind them the Mansion which has become the hospital. A series of bells, of shouts, and the slaves stop working, prepare for the long walk home, congregating, then forming a line, herded by the foremen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman eases his position to bend over and dip his bandage in the seawater. He brings the wet bandage to his neck, considers the ocean, his fellow ragtag of wounded, the slaves, the great fields, the Mansion. The whole meaning of this war around him.

EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

-- A tintype of OAKLEY is added to the Chapel's votives, hammered in alongside Rourke and Butcher. There are fifty or more images now, the paint flaking around them. The exterior of the Chapel, three years on, has taken on the burden of recording history.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is no minister, no services, just the votives, daguerreotypes or simply the names of those missing in action, accompanied by tiny vases of wildflowers. The town shrouded in mist, and quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. SPRING. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVERYWHERE SIGNS OF PROFOUND NEGLECT, like a Grimm's fairy tale of a deserted house. The fields are overgrown with weeds, the gardens abandoned. The chickens have deserted the henhouse and are wandering around the outbuildings, scuffing at the packed dirt.

Sally and Esco come up the overgrown path, avoiding the chickens, and knock at the door.

They're seen from ground level, through a boxwood, as their feet patrol the ground, turn away from the door, and then retreat, their voices drifting away. Ada is there, crouching in her hidey-hole, a blanket on the ground, her book. She wants to reveal herself, but is too embarrassed.

During this a ROOSTER, black and gold, struts into the boxwood. As the rooster approaches, Ada shudders, tries to shoo it away without alerting her presence. Ada peers through the boxwood as Sally and Esco close the gate and recede. The rooster comes at her again. She rises up, kicking out at it, while he flares his wings, spurs flaying at her. Ada runs from the boxwood, tormented by the triumphant rooster, which continues to fly and scratch, driving her into the house.

INT. ADA'S BEDROOM BLACK COVE FARM. DAY
</DIRECTION>

Ada dabs at the scratches, her dress rolled down to the waist to reveal her arms and shoulders. Now she shucks off the dress completely and tries to find a clean replacement. There isn't one, so she hunts through the overflowing laundry basket for something less dirty.

Ada enters her father's room, wearing undergarments.

Everything as he left it and, in contrast to the rest of the house, extremely tidy. She opens a wardrobe, finds one of his coats, puts it on. It's much too big, and she rolls up the sleeves, catches her pinched face and disheveled face in a swivel mirror. She turns the mirror away and the image swings into --

EXT. GATES OF HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DAY

A BLIND MAN IS SELLING PEANUTS which he roasts over a small fire. He's always singing. Inman approaches. When Inman speaks, his voice is a croak.

TWO GREAT TRESTLE TABLES, LOADED WITH CLOTHES. Underneath the tables, boots -- laced together, origins various. The charitable womenfolk are helping match clothes to recovering soldiers, some of whom are still on crutches, or in wheelchairs. Inman finds a black dresscoat, some pants, a pair of boots. He accumulates a little pile. On his way out, AN ELDERLY AND STAUNCH CONFEDERATE GENTLEMAN shakes his hand and gives him an apple from the barrel.

EXT. TEMPORARY BARBERSHOP, CHARLESTON. DAY

Inman emerges from the Courthouse and joins the line for a shave at the makeshift barbershop set up outside the Courthouse. Two barbers, two chairs.

EXT. YARD, SWANGER FARM. LATE DAY

AN IMAGE -- DISTORTED, WATERY. IT'S HARD TO RESOLVE BUT COULD BE A CORRIDOR OF TREES. THE SUN LOW AT ONE END, THE SILHOUETTE OF A FIGURE WALKING SLOWLY FORWARDS, A SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF CROWS.

Ada is bent backwards over the well, a hand mirror glinting down into the blackness. The reflection is elusive against the bright evening sky, the sun almost set, and low.

The image is clearer. The trees sharpen, the figure walking, the steep incline of the corridor, all fiercely black and white as if it were a carpet of snow and black hieroglyphs of trees, and crows flying. The trick of the glass and the watery disc of the well surface. A buzzing in Ada's ears, something like a distant music. Then the figure seems to suddenly pitch forwards, but at that moment, Ada -- canted over, getting dizzy has to move and the image flies away, replaced with the sky, the flash of the setting sun.

Inman's walking on a track which passes through cornfields, the crop high and thick around him. He stops, hearing something. Riders. He wades into the field, seeking cover in the tall crop, lying in the dirt. Horses appear. HOME GUARD MEN ON PATROL, A CHAIN GANG OF PRISONERS: SLAVES, DESERTERS IN TOW, A COUPLE OF FEDERAL SOLDIERS. They have dogs, which sniff and growl, intrigued by the fields, called back by the Home Guard.

Inman waits until they're well out of sight. AS HE GETS TO HIS FEET IN THE GREAT FIELDS, ANOTHER BODY APPEARS, THEN ANOTHER, THEN ANOTHER, THEN ANOTHER, ALL SLAVES ON THE RUN DOTTED AROUND THE FIELD.

Inman sees A LIGHT in the distance, a torch flicking in and out of view, like a star to follow. He stops, narrows his eyes to focus on the view, listening hard. He pulls out the Lemats.

A MAN, ALL IN BLACK, A HORSE IN TOW, IS AT THE EDGE OF THE GORGE.

The horse has a burden -- a sack or wrapped bundle draped over either side of the saddle. The attempts to heave the bundle onto his shoulders. He can't, and the bundle slips to the ground, cover falling enough to glimpse an arm, a head. IT IS THE BODY OF A BLACK GIRL. The man tries again to lift her. He's clearly upset, despairing, his hat comes off to reveal long, dandy's hair, all extravagant curls. He staggers with the weight of the girl, heading for the lip of the deep gorge.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAPE FEAR RIVER. DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman comes to the bank of a HUGE RIVER. The water, as the light begins to go, is the color of mud, with bubbles, belching to the surface, full of ugly prominent. Inman is almost jogging now, an ear tracking his still distant pursuers. The river is too wide to contemplate swimming and now it begins to curve left, forcing him -- against his judgment, to circle back. He approaches A SMALL JETTY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sign: Ferry $5. Yell Loud.

On the far bank there's A CABIN ON STILTS above the highwater mark. Inman calls out, reluctantly, his voice still a kind of growl. Then again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TINY FIGURE steps out of the cabin and waves before jumping into a small canoe. The canoe heads against the current, the rower's back bent with the effort. As the canoe approaches, Inman sees that the ferryman is, in fact, A YOUNG GIRL, not eighteen. She doesn't look at him. He produces five dollars. She eyes the bill with contempt.

Shouts, more barking. Inman jumps in the canoe, and they're off. The Ferrygirl turns the boat around, rows them away from the jetty with the grace of someone doing something for the thousandth time.
</DIRECTION>
<VEASEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not looking for revenge, by the way. For what you did to me. No, I'm a Pilgrim now, like you, traveling the road, paying our dues, relying on the kindness of strangers.

	I had good curls. But I deserved it. I'm the Reverend Veasey. Have I seen you in church?

Inman sits, scouring the bank for sign of his pursuers. The sun is sinking fast.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRYGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm saving for a cowhide, and when I get it I aim to get a saddle made, and when I get me a saddle I'll save for a horse, and when I got a horse I'll throw on the saddle, and then you won't see my sorry ass round this swamp again.

She has no love for the river. Another gurgle of viscous bubbles around the canoe.

<FERRYGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Thirty more dollars, we can go to the cabin. I'll pull this dress over my head.

<VEASEY>
<DIRECTION>
(excited)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have we got thirty dollars?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VEASEY>
<DIRECTION>
A sharp sound, a tiny thwack of ball on meat. The Ferrygirl SUDDENLY SLUMPS BACK and falls into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Veasey grabs out at the oar, but it goes, too. The girl sinks quickly, A BLOODY GAP to the side of her head. Inman, on his knees and stretching, can't help her. Then a second noise as A HOLE THE SIZE OF A FIST appears in the canoe, just at waterlevel. Water pours into the canoe. Dogs bark, and now FIGURES are visible at the jetty. HOME GUARD. One of them has a sniper's rifle and is loading for a third shot. Inman can see him sighting the rifle. They lie flat in the canoe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER GREAT FIST OF WOOD is gouged out. Now the boat is almost full of water. Veasey spits out a foul mouthful. INMAN ROCKS THE CANOE AND LETS IT TURN OVER ONTO THEM, Veasey surfaces from under it, clutching the wood as a raft, but the canoe CATCHES INMAN A BLOW TO HIS HEAD and he sinks. Veasey hauls him to the surface and, surprisingly strong, holds him with one fist, the boat with the other, lets the current take them, pulling them under, then up, under, then up, but clinging on, as the rifle continues to deliver its assault, another shot into the boat, another into the water near to Veasey's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GIRL'S BODY comes by them, carried by the river, the dress billowing out almost covering her head. The sun has gone, the light fading, the canoe sliding downriver away from their aggressors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CAPE FEAR. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the moonlight, the canoe drifts into the muddy bank and Veasey drags a half-drowned Inman to land, both of them retching with the vile river water. AN ALLIGATOR eases into the river not ten feet from where they lie, lungs heaving. They get up. Veasey to his feet, Inman to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<VEASEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VEASEY>
<DIRECTION>
Inman nods, coughs. And Veasey AIMS A KICK at Inman's head, knocking him back into the mud.

Inman carefully scouts the track then, with great caution, edges towards the river bank.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Junior, Inman and Veasey come around a bend and there's A BIG CABIN LOOMING. It's in such poor repair that one end has slipped from the stones which serve as it's foundation and STANDS BADLY TILTED OVER. Junior roots up another hidden jug of liquor, which he drinks from, then hands to Veasey.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's my place. Hope you can stomach a yard chock-full of females. Brought my woman home, she showed up with her three so-called sisters and their brats. The noise in that place is something awful. It's why I go hunting.

LILA, JUNIOR'S WIFE, spoons out stew from a vast pot. The table crammed with customers -- her three sisters, the three men, the herd of dogs and filthy children. Nobody speaks. Each time Lila bends over to spoon out of the pot, her cleavage strains against the flimsy fabric of her dress. Veasey's mesmerized. Inman is also getting drunk, his eyes increasingly glazed. When Lila makes to sit down next to Junior, he slides a hand up her dress, exposing a naked buttock, which he strokes and pinches as he pulls away.

Inman gets up suddenly, sways.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll say my goodbyes, got miles and miles to go before sunset.

<DIRECTION>
(head spinning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll just quickly lie down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<DIRECTION>
And he stumbles over to the fire where he instantly curls up.
</DIRECTION>
<VEASEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm heading for that smokehouse and I'm ready to be washed clean of my dirt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VEASEY>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up, wanders out of the door. Junior's eyes glint. He jerks his head towards the girls then in the direction of the smokehouse.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You go tend to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Lila)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be seeing you.

</JUNIOR>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up his gun and leaves Dolly gathering up the children and herding them out.
</DIRECTION>
<DOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on you -- get!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Shyla stays, Mae having gone off after Veasey. Lila waits until the children have gone. They consider Inman supine by the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<LILA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's mine. You can go rub yourself off on the Preacher.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(of Inman)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gonna make him hug me till I grunt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILA>
<DIRECTION>
Lila shepherds Shyla out, shuts the door, swigs from the jug, walks over to Inman, then turns to the big table and pushes pots and plates way down to one end to make a playing field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she bends over the prostrate Inman.
</DIRECTION>
<LILA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILA>
<DIRECTION>
Inman stirs, glazed.
</DIRECTION>
<LILA>
<DIRECTION>
(kneeling down to him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to see what Mamma's got for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILA>
<DIRECTION>
SHE SLIPS A SLEEVE OF HER DRESS TO REVEAL A FULL BREAST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman is drunk, doesn't think he's awake. She takes her breast to his mouth, and Inman suckles. Then she puts his hands under the dress which rides up as his hands move between her legs. She's naked.
</DIRECTION>
<LILA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good. Ain't that sweet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILA>
<DIRECTION>
SHE PULLS INMAN TO HIS FEET, KISSES HIM, THEN TURNS HER BACK AND LIES FACE DOWN ON THE TABLE, HER BARE ASS UNDULATING IN THE AIR.
</DIRECTION>
<LILA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just get on and ride me all the way to China.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILA>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't move, except to sway, eyes glazed. She turns.
</DIRECTION>
<LILA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shy? You need a hand?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(goes to his buttons)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's have a look see what we can muster.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILA>
<DIRECTION>
She's kneeling now, her dress hunched up around her middle, working the front of Inman's pants. He's in a swoon, surrendering to her, getting aroused, his hand cupping her head. ON CUE, THE DOOR CRASHES OPEN AND HE'S STARING DOWN THE BARREL OF JUNIOR'S SHOTGUN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Lila turns, Junior KICKS HER violently in the head, knocking her over.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You little bitch! Look at you! Cover yourself up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNIOR>
<DIRECTION>
NEXT HE SWINGS THE SHOTGUN BARREL AGAINST THE SIDE OF INMAN'S HEAD. Inman falls back. Junior goes to the door and whistles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND WITH THAT THE ROOM FILLS UP WITH A GROUP OF HOME GUARD BRISTLING WITH WEAPONS AND PURPOSE. THEY SEIZE INMAN, DRAG HIM OUT AS JUNIOR SPITS AND KICKS AT HIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SMOKEHOUSE AT JUNIOR'S CABIN. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lila enters the smokehouse, hand to her bruised head. VEASEY'S ON THE FLOOR, WITH DOLLY ASTRIDE HIM, HIS ARM CRUSHING A NAKED MAE INTO AN EMBRACE. He considers Lila, beams:
</DIRECTION>
<VEASEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a special prayer you'd come visit.

THREE MEN BURST IN BEHIND HER, RIFLES RAISED.

Veasey led out, a CHAIN GANG waiting -- a bedraggled collection of prisoners, slaves, deserters -- and now INMAN. Veasey is joined to the line. It starts to rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ruby and Ada at the door of the Swanger house. They both wear Monroe's clothes by now, like two little men. THEY'RE CARRYING A SMALL SACK, A PIE UNDER A CLOTH. Ruby hammers at the door, a little impatient. Sally Swanger opens it, has to decode who it is under the clothes, the hats.

EXT. A PATH. DRIVING RAIN. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Home Guard ride, bent under their oilskins, as the rain tips down. Between the horses, unprotected and drenched, their prisoners trudge along the muddy path. Inman and Veasey among them. Veasey has grown some beard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN OLDER MAN COLLAPSES, lies where he falls, not moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a domino effect and so Inman falls on top of him. He picks himself up, then tries to pull up the older man. He doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The horses plough on. Inman shouts to BROWN, the leader.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This man's dead!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Nobody pays any attention. He has to drag the body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VEASEY TOWN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HOME GUARD ESCORT THE PRISONERS PAST VEASEY'S OLD CHURCH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More days have gone by and taken their toll on the prisoners, Veasey and Inman are haggard and filthy and reduced. The Home Guards stop for food, a wash, a break, chain the prisoners to a horse rail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Citizens go by, Veasey knows them all. Some of them spit contemptuously at the Deserters. None of them recognise Veasey.
</DIRECTION>
<VEASEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I so altered that they don't see me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VEASEY>
<DIRECTION>
Somebody walks by with a young child.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Veasey looks at Inman.
</DIRECTION>
<VEASEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I christened that child.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VEASEY>
<DIRECTION>
The child stops, looks without recognizing, is tugged away from the chain gang by his mother. One of the other prisoners, SHEFFIELD, leans in to Inman, his voice low.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEFFIELD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm looking to get out of this. They drag us back to fight -- we're just target practice for the Federal boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEFFIELD>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You run, we're all running with you, the lame and the stupid, of which we number both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<SHEFFIELD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Either way we're fucked. Run or don't run.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEFFIELD>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just give me some warning so I can tell the guard -- I'm not getting shot again for some cause I don't believe in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<DIRECTION>
A GROUP OF SLAVES ARE WALKING BY, CARRYING SACKS. One of the women is pregnant. Veasey studies the group, sees the pregnant woman, recognizes her.
</DIRECTION>
<VEASEY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Rebecca. That's Rebecca.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he hisses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rebecca!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VEASEY>
<DIRECTION>
In daylight it's apparent that Rebecca is a real beauty. She turns at the sound of her name, stops, is confused. She sees Veasey and approaches, appalled at his condition.
</DIRECTION>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mas?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<VEASEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it well with you?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been repenting for what I did. I've walked the road of atonement.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God Bless you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VEASEY>
<DIRECTION>
Rebecca, reluctant, rejoins the other slaves, walks away with them, but then turns back to look at Veasey. She clearly cares about him. And seeing her has somehow broken his heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns away from Inman, towards Sheffield.
</DIRECTION>
<VEASEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm with you. I got a baby coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VEASEY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RAILROAD TRACK. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CHAIN GANG TRUDGES DOWN THE TRACK, horses on either side of them, steep banks forming a V for the railroad. A TRAIN IS COMING. Brown rides up to the prisoners, herds them off the track. The train approaches quite slowly -- the boxcars full of wounded soldiers. Some of the Home Guard dismount, take out pipes. The prisoners wait, one of them sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheffield says something to Veasey, who casually yanks up the sitting prisoner. Inman suddenly understands what's going to happen. The train is almost on them.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<DIRECTION>
But it's too late. SHEFFIELD JERKS FORWARD IN FRONT OF THE TRAIN, PULLING ALL THE OTHERS WITH HIM, their reluctance tempered by the possibility of being crushed by the oncoming train.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOMEHOW THE CHAIN GANG GETS ACROSS THE TRACK, stumbling and chaotic, the chains yanking tight, then loose, the tight causing a collapse, the loose a recovery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They run alongside the train, blocking themselves from the fire of the Guard, Sheffield screaming tactics -- and then, as the train starts to pull past them, they run up the bank, now all as a unit scrambling to the steep summit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRAIN THE HOME GUARD HAVE REMOUNTED THEIR HORSES AND ARE RIDING HARD ALONGSIDE IT. Then they have sight of the escaping prisoners silhouetted at the top of the bank like a line of paper dolls stretched out along the ridge. Sheffield's yelling with adrenaline, Veasey joins in, elated. One of the guards raises a rifle, steadies himself on his horse, FIRES. He catches Veasey, who crumples, spinning round and falling down the bank, until Inman uses all his strength and practically lifts him in the air. The chain recovers and works back up the bank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then A SECOND BULLET catches another prisoner and this time the effect is catastrophic -- THE WHOLE GANG JUST FLIPS OVER AND PLUMMETS DOWN THE BANK. The Home Guard approach, firing randomly at the bodies as they tumble into the ditch by the side of the track. Until all movement ceases. Inman has a wound to his head which bleeds profusely, almost completely covering his face. Brown arrives, considers the carnage.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get these sacks of shit under the ground.

INT. BARN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ada's milking. It's barely daylight. She's slowly becoming a country girl. Ruby appears in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<RUBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone's been in the corncrib.

</RUBY>
<ADA>

</ADA>
<RUBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a coon or possum. Scratched out a fist hole in the side. This place! I'm telling you -- we grow, others eat. I'll go into town, take the last of the cider and trade for a trap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MONROE'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ada is in Monroe's bedroom, looks out as Ruby goes off to town, jugs of cider swung either side of the horse. Ada goes over to Monroe's closet, pulls out some clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE WINTER GARDEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ada buttons Monroe's dress coat and completes the SCARECROW she's spent the day making, save for the hat, which she now fixes on, pushing in a hat pin to secure it. She's made a stern black thing and steps back to consider it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Horsemen come riding along the lane. It's Teague and his men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't stop but raises his hat to Ada.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ada looks out at the Winter Garden. From that distance it really does look like her father out in the field, arms outstretched as if waiting for her to run to him. She finds it unbearable, her tears coming, runs out into the fields, attacks the scarecrow, pulling off the hat, the clothes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RAILROAD TRACK. MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SOUND OF TINY BELLS. A misty drizzle. A GOAT snuffles around in the freshly turned dirt: A hand, pale and wet, protrudes from the thin layer of earth covering the bodies of the murdered Chain Gang.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOMETHING SHIFTS UNDER THE DIRT, breaking the surface. Inman wedged under three or four corpses -- their limbs and chains wrapped around him, has regained consciousness. He coughs, can't breathe properly, tries to work himself some air, spitting out dirt. He makes a noise to distract the goat, rattling the chains. Inman rears up, the bodies slithering off him, but even then the animal only retreats a yard or two. VEASEY SLIDES FACE UP, A BULLET IN HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A MYSTICAL THIRD EYE. Inman feels a surprising loss and tenderness. He heaves again, groaning with the pain of new and old wounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ruby rides back from town along the river. An ugly looking trap tied over the horses and three or four bulging sacks. By an abandoned mill she sees the Home Guard under the trees.

She slows up.

Ruby rides on. She rides around the bend -- she's not far from the Swanger farm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RAILROAD TRACK. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Goats, their bells tinkling, munch around the tracks. One of them turns at a noise -- a GROTESQUE VISION -- A MOVING, SEETHING MOUND OF DIRT. It's Inman, inching along the embankment, the chain of dead bodies in tow, a macabre tug of war. He considers the goats, they consider him. He rears up and finds himself STARING DOWN THE BARREL OF A SHOTGUN.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

Sally is pinning out white sheets, they're filling out like sails in the afternoon wind. Ruby rides up. Sally seems a little vexed to see her. She walks down to the gate.

	Ruby...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARSH WHISTLES. A secret place, in the heart of a forest. There's the answering sound of SMALL BELLS, a chorus of them. Inman is dragged into view on a makeshift litter. Goats appear, they herd around the figure dragging the litter. IT'S AN OLD WOMAN, silver haired, her face a leather map, her clothes leather, everything about her like old leather. HER NAME IS MADDY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She and Inman round a bend and there's Maddy's house -- AN OLD CARAVAN, long grown into the ground and plaited with vines and creepers. Inman tries to sit up. An old whiskered BILLYGOAT butts up against Inman, knocks him down. Maddy pays no attention to the struggle, heads inside her caravan.
</DIRECTION>
<MADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mind that Billy, he's the jealous kind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADDY>
<DIRECTION>
She emerges, with a bowl of water, rags, washes his face, pushing back his hair to look at his wound, puts a finger to the gash on his neck professional in her appraisal. Inman is barely conscious, he groans, trying to defend himself.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. BOTTOM FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ruby rides up to the farm. She rides past the winter garden, admires THE SCARECROW -- WHICH NOW PARODIES ADA, the same outfit she once wore to visit Inman, the same dress, same hat. Ruby grins as Ada comes over from the field.

TEAGUE'S MEN RIDE UP TO THE FARM. Esco's out in the field, labouring away, but with his shotgun by him. Teague stops alongside the field, the rail between him and Esco. Esco stops working, picks up his shotgun and goes over. Teague has four men with him. MO and JO, the twins, huge, and with the appearance of having less than one brain between the two of them, GRAYLING, a reluctant-looking man, funereal in his bearing, and BOSIE.

Teague shows him the leather pouch, shrugs, starts to make a cigarette.

Mo dismounts. Ambles past Esco, looks behind the sheets. ESCO KICKS OUT AT HIM, the shotgun rigid and pointing.

</ESCO>

Mo examines his breeches for a dust mark, wipes it off, retreating in a turkey walk of examining and dusting.

Esco is momentarily distracted and, in that instant, Mo kicks out at him, knocking the gun from his hands, which fires into the air, a shocking sound.

Ruby and Ada digging a trench by the smokehouse, laying in the pale heads of cabbage. They hear the distant shot.

EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jo sets on Esco, knocking him-backwards into a sheet, where it gets twisted, while Jo kicks and punches, little spots of blood staining the sheet with each blow. MO PULLS OUT HIS SABRE AND RUNS ESCO THROUGH, LEAVES THE SABRE IN DEEP, PINNING ESCO TO THE SHEET, THEN SPINNING HIM ROUND IN THE SHEET SO THAT IT TIGHTENS. A stain grows out from the blade, huge and spreading. Teague walks to Esco.
</DIRECTION>
<TEAGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're harbouring deserters. I can confiscate every animal on this farm, every plate, every sheet, every little pellet of chicken shit -- I can confiscate your old lady's asshole, so don't offer me a bird.

Mo backs away. Sally is screaming. She watches, helpless, as Esco dies in front of her, the sheet growing a darker red.

<DIRECTION>
INT. BARN, SWANGER FARM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELLIS AND ACTON SWANGER emerge from their hiding places, unable to bear the sound of their mother's screams. They're carrying an axe, a pitchfork, mad for revenge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOSIE IS DOING SOME SORT OF DANCE ALONG THE FENCE RAIL. He's very graceful, his hair flying, his hands out, one finger nail extremely long, his boots stamping down on the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDER HIS STOMPING FEET, THE RAIL POST IS PRESSED ON SALLY SWANGER'S THUMBS. She can't scream any longer, because the noose has practically strangled her. The rope's tied off to Bosie's horse, which yanks on the noose with every slight movement. Sally is prostrate in the dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her two boys come running from the barn. TEAGUE CASUALLY, SHOOTS ELLIS WITH HIS RIFLE. BOSIE LETS ACTON GET ALL THE WAY TOWARDS HIM AND THEN SHOOTS HIM FROM A YARD AWAY, THE GUN SUDDENLY SPRINGING INTO HIS HAND. AS ACTON FALLS, BOSIE DOES A FLIP TO DIVE OFF THE POST AND LAND ON HIS FEET NEXT TO ACTON'S BODY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SWANGER FARM. DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ada and Ruby, riding together on the horse, arrive at the Swangers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SALLY IS STILL PINNED UNDER THE FENCE POST. The noose around her neck has been tied off to the post so that she can't move. There's a bloody sheet draped over the edge of the well. Blood on the ground. Ruby heaves at the fence.
</DIRECTION>

She bends down, listens to her. Looks up at Ada.

	She's saying don't bother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBY>
<ADA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADA>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs a thick log off the stack, staggers back and in a second they've inserted it into the fence and levered it up and away from Sally's hands. They fall back onto the dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ruby cradles Sally. Ada nods towards the well.
</DIRECTION>
<ADA>

INT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An exotic interior, many crocks and jars, bunches of herbs, wrapped papers of dried things, like a woodland apothecary store. Inman wakes up. He finds himself in a small cot, wrapped in blankets, a poultice at his neck. He doesn't know where he is or how long he's been there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maddy's sitting on a stool. There's a circle of stones where her fire lives and she sets the tinder to it. Inman emerges from the caravan. He's pale and unsteady.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long have I been sleeping?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<MADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not long enough.

</MADDY>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't stop here. I'm a deserter. They find me here things could be bad for you.

</INMAN>
<MADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What they going to do? Cut short my young life? Sit down before you fall down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADDY>
<DIRECTION>
She calls over a little goat. It ambles over affectionately and nuzzles into her hand. She strokes it and scratches under the chin. The creature gets increasingly tranquil.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long you been up here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<MADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What year are we? '63?

<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last time I checked it was '64.

</INMAN>
<MADDY>

</MADDY>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty six years!

</INMAN>
<MADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could move on anytime. I've seen most of the world anyway, Richmond in the North, south almost to Charleston. You're going somewhere or you are somewhere, what's the difference?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADDY>
<DIRECTION>
She's still stroking the goat. It looks as if it's asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<MADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've learned a person can survive off pretty much of a goat. I can't abide a chicken, but a goat gives you company and milk and cheese and then, when you need it, good meat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADDY>
<DIRECTION>
In a single motion she has a knife in her hand and has SLIT THE THROAT OF THE GOAT, putting the bowl underneath its neck to catch the blood, still stroking the goat, which blinks as if it were only surprised and not dying.
</DIRECTION>
<MADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you've been fighting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADDY>
<INMAN>
<DIRECTION>

	I could be at killing for days sometimes, in the hand to hand, my feet against the feet of my enemy and I always killed him and he never killed me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<MADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He gave it a try, to look at you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADDY>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess he did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<MADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See I think there's a plan. There's a design. For each and every one of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADDY>
<DIRECTION>
During this she's shucked the skin off the goat with the authority of someone who's done this a thousand times.
</DIRECTION>
<MADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look at nature, a bird flies somewhere, picks up a seed, shits the seed out, a plant grows. Bird's got a job, seed's got a job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADDY>
<DIRECTION>
And the goat is now thin and pink, eyes bulging, a piece of meat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A woodburning stove with a single cooking plate -- on which pieces of the goat meat, sprinkled with herbs, are sizzling in a pan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INMAN IS EATING LIKE A MAN POSSESSED, WRAPPING THE MEAT IN CORN FRITTERS AND PUSHING THEM INTO HIS MOUTH. Maddy watches him, adds another mound of meat to his plate. Inman nods in thanks, but -- doesn't look up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens a jar and takes out a handful of dried poppy heads, puts them near the stove, then dips into another jar and pulls out what look like old cheroot stubs.
</DIRECTION>
<MADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take one of these now with your food.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADDY>
<DIRECTION>
Inman is circumspect, views the stub lozenge with suspicion.
</DIRECTION>
<MADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swallow it. If you die I'll give you your money back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADDY>
<DIRECTION>
Inman puts it in his mouth, gags at the taste of it. She hands him a beaker with milk to wash it down.
</DIRECTION>
<MADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our minds aren't made to hold on to the particulars of pain, the way we do bliss.

	And is she waiting for you?

	She was. I don't know. Or if she'd know me. I'm like the boy who goes out in winter for firewood comes back in the spring with a whistle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Maddy pricks open the poppies and collects their opium, then hands Inman the liquid.
</DIRECTION>
<MADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now drink this. It visits the pain. And you'll sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADDY>
<DIRECTION>
He drinks the laudanum she's made.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've had to put myself in the way of people's kindness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<MADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you found it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADDY>
<DIRECTION>
She dips a cloth in the steaming water, unbuttons his shirt. She has a crock of what looks like treacle and vaseline. She smears this salve over the neck wound and into his scalp. Inman surrenders to the drug.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The passenger pigeons fly south, the berries ripen. Whether I see them or not, whether a man dies, or a war is won.

	That's the laudanum getting to you. That's good. Say something more.

<DIRECTION>
(she kneels to his leg)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Raise that up for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADDY>
<DIRECTION>
He obliges. She grimaces at the state of it, where the chain has chewed into the flesh. Gets to work.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She gave me a book. Ada Monroe. Man by the name of Bartram. Wrote about his travels. I carried that book through every battle. I left it someplace, got to get it back. Sometimes just reading the name of a place near home -- Sorell Cove, Fire Scale Ridge -- was enough to bring me to tears. Thing is I've been thinking -- those places belonged to people before us, to the Indian -- and he had a different name. What did he call Sorell Cove? How can a name not even the real name break your heart? It's her, she's the place I'm heading. And I hardly know her. So how can a person who's maybe not even a real person -- I don't know what I'm talking about -- I have to close my eyes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>

He slides off the stool and lays on the floor. Maddy goes over to her cot and pulls off a blanket which she drapes over him.

She turns, abruptly, mingles in with her goats. Inman nods, knows that she doesn't want a fuss, although he wants to make one, and turns himself, heads away from the caravan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOODS. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MUSIC CONTINUES. A TURKEY calls. And again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUNIOR is hunting. He creeps through this clearing, eyes peeled for the turkey, gun at the ready. His dog growls, and he puts a hand over its mouth. He listens. Another call.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Junior moves, without sound, in its direction, stops for several seconds under a tree, listening. He looks up. INMAN IS PERCHED IN THE TREE. THE PISTOL FLASHES IN HIS HAND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman drags Junior's corpse in to the yard. The dogs whine and slobber over the body. Inman goes straight into the Smoke House.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SMOKE HOUSE AT JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman reaches behind the stove and retrieves his bag. He checks for the LeMats, for the Bartram, opens it, locating the tintype of Ada, which he considers, as the dogs howl outside, joined with another wailing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman emerges with his bag, LeMats at the ready. The women are all keening over the corpse, as it a saint had passed away. Dogs, women all howling. A chicken bobs in, investigates the glob of blood on Junior's skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman walks away, doesn't look at the women, who don't look at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUBY'S ROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Ruby wakes up. Looks out of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ada, also woken, comes into Ruby's room. STOBROD IS OUTSIDE WITH PANGLE, VIOLIN AND BANJO. Ruby opens the window, scowling. Stobrod beams, stops playing, holds up the food, points at Pangle in his new coat. Pangle waves.
</DIRECTION>
<RUBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get on back where you came from!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBY>
<DIRECTION>
Stobrod and Pangle smile and hurry away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PATH IN HILL COUNTRY. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WINTER SETTING IN. Inman, increasingly a stick figure in the landscape, wasted and fragile, trudges along through fallen leaves. He still limps from the leg irons. No shelter anywhere. He unwraps a paper containing some scraps of goat meat and corn bread. He walks and eats, fishes out a lozenge, tries to swallow it, washes it down with a drink from his flask. Opens the crock of salve and rubs the treacly grease into his neck and ankle. The path splits. He doesn't know which way to go, A CROW repeatedly caws off to the left and, taking it as a sign, Inman goes in that direction.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. SMALL WOOD. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DRIVING RAIN. Inman shelters under a huge tree, whose split trunk provides a mean shelter. He inserts himself into the cleft of it, a black thing in a black tree, like a troll. He stands, shivers, sodden, desolate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LITTLE CABIN. Its lights coming through square windows like a chinese lantern. Inman considers it, the risk versus the shelter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sleet still pelts down on him and he decides to approach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Closer he can hear a sound coming from the house. IT'S A BABY'S INCESSANT CRY. HE SEES A YOUNG WOMAN WALKING ROUND AND ROUND IN THE ROOM, CLUTCHING THE BABY WRAPPED UP IN A QUILT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman knocks hard on the door. The light from the lamp goes out, although the fire still gives the room a clear glow.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm one man alone. I'm a Confederate soldier on furlough. I have no bad intention. I need shelter and food.

THE TINY SOUND OF THE DOOR BEING BOLTED.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I at least sleep in the corn crib -- just for some shelter? I'll be on my way come morning.
	</DIALOGUE>

No answer. Inman accepts this as a rebuttal, and trudges back towards the road.

<SARA>

</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fair enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The baby's crying behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>

	There's some beans and corn pone, all I got. You better come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman enters the cabin. It's a single room. A big fire. The baby on the bed, a rudimentary crib unoccupied next to it. The woman is already at the little stove. She turns to him. She's painfully beautiful. But sad and fragile. Inman, despite himself, is mesmerized.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm alone here, as you can see, with my baby. I need to believe you mean no harm.

Inman takes out his gun. She starts, terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I mean to give it to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He turns it handle forwards and offers it to her.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Is your baby sick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He cries. I don't know. He cries a lot. My man is dead. He took his wound at Fredericksburg. Never saw his boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She never once looks at him. Her eyes on the floor or the food or the baby.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's pretty much what you'll get if you knock on any door of this war. Man dead, woman left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him a plate of steaming beans. An onion perched on top.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's mean food but it's hot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She goes over to the bed and picks up her baby and starts the same business of walking him, singing the while, an odd lament. Inman eats, looks at her, at the child and the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up the onion, bites into it. Sara looks across.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(ashamed of his hunger)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no hunting on the road, just cress and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He takes another bite. Sara picks up the baby.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to feed this man, if you could look away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Inman, embarrassed, turns his back to her. He sits finishing the food while she puts the baby to her breast, slipping the shoulder from her dress. While the baby feeds.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Used to have a cow, few goats. Raiders took them. Made me kill our own dog on the porch. That poor creature watched over me. Nothing left now save a hog and couple of chickens to live off till spring. I'll have to kill that hog and make sense of the flesh and divisions which is something I never did.
	</DIALOGUE>

<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could do that for you in the morning.

	Glad to know you both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara walks ahead of Inman. She carries a pile of clothing, a pair of boots. It's still wretched outside, she hugs the house, the porch barely offering shelter. INMAN FOLLOWS, with a bowl of steaming water and a small towel over his arm. She hands him the clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look about his size. He was another man straight up and down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
There's a palpable attraction between them, so that every exchange seems to contain a promise, a sexual charge.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't even have a blanket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got a blanket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll leave you the lamp.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
By the dim light, Inman peels off his clothes, sets to work with the bar of soap and the cloth to scrub himself clean. He can be seen from the window and finds himself turning away to pull off his pants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara sits at the cot, still singing to the baby, then gets up, goes to the window, sees Inman dressing, walks to the door, lets it open a little, but not so as she can be seen.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They fit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<INMAN>
<DIRECTION>

</INMAN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman settles down into the corncrib. He's cold and everything is damp and lumpy and uncomfortable. He pulls his thin blanket around him. The wind is howling. He levers himself up, looks at the house with its warm invitation, can almost feel Sara in there. He reluctantly settles down again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE HEARS A NOISE, STEPS APPROACHING. HE REACHES FOR THE LEMATS UNDER THE BLANKETS.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you come inside?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She stands in a shift, a blanket over her shoulders. Her body under the cotton very clear to him. She turns and goes back inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman comes in. Sara is sitting on her bed. Long silence.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you do something for me? Do you think you could lie here, next to me, and not need to go further?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I'll try.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He sits on the bed as she slips under the covers, and then removes the boots, his shirt, gets under the covers. There's an electric space between them. Then Sara begins to cry, pulls his arm to open up so that she can be folded into him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHE SOBS, SHUDDERING IN THE BED.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go. I'll go, shall I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want you to.

They lie, staring up at the ceiling, her tears falling. A FIDDLE PLAYS HEAVY WITH YEARNING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. CHRISTMAS DAY. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Stobrod is playing the fiddle, his bowing hand still lightly taped and a fingerless mitten covering it. They're in the abandoned Mill, a derelict space, which has been cheered up with some rudimentary Christmas decorations. Ada, Ruby and Sally Swanger, her hair now almost completely white. Some token presents. Pangle is picking at a banjo, his grin infectious, and a third player, GEORGIA, with a harmonica. As they play:
</DIRECTION>
<PANGLE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She don't speak.

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Ruby: what about this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOBROD>
<DIRECTION>
He starts the tune of Wayfaring Stranger. Ruby groans.
</DIRECTION>
<STOBROD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't make that face -- you listen: c'mon Georgia...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOBROD>
<DIRECTION>
And he starts up again, but this time GEORGIA BEGINS TO SING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's like a pale angel and sings with a soft, true voice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ruby finds herself taken by this boy's voice and by Stobrod's extraordinary invention as he takes the tune off on a wild journey. Ruby sits next to Ada, fiddles with her bracelets, slips one from Ada's wrist and slides it over her own.

She pulls up the window in back of the cabin. Inman throws things out into the freezing morning. He has his pants on, but is otherwise naked. He swings over the window and down onto the frosty ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SARA'S CABIN. EARLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman picks up his stuff and, at a crouch, runs for cover to the wood which borders the property. He can hear horses and a commotion at the front of Sara's cabin, but doesn't look round until he's sheltered by the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FEDERAL SOLDIERS, a raiding party, have dismounted and are already wrangling with Sara. Inman watches, pulling on his shirt, shivering, then his boots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara is standing in front of the hogpen, as if to protect the animal, but one of the soldiers, PISTOL, barges her to one side, toppling her, and opens the gate, starts herding the hog out into the yard. A second soldier, NYM, emerges from the cabin, carrying Ethan. Sara starts up, struggles with him, is again knocked down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INMAN HAS TO WATCH AS THEY DRAG HER OVER TO A FENCE POST AND ROPE HER TO IT THEN SLIP THE BLANKET OFF THE BABY AND LAY IT ON THE GROUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YARD.

Then Sara starts to scream.
</DIRECTION>

Inman is dressed. Boots on. He looks back at the yard. The men sitting, smoking, prepared to wait, their breath coming out in gusts in the freezing air. Flakes of snow fall.

Pistol heads towards the cabin. As he approaches the door, Bardolph rearranges the blankets to, cover the baby. Pistol opens the door. Nym is on top of Sara. Pistol laughs, enters, and is clubbed down by Inman, who steps out onto the porch, while SARA SHRUGS OFF THE BODY OF NYM, HIS THROAT CUT.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind Inman, Sara stands with a rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SARA'S CABIN. LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THERE'S A HUGE FIRE GOING, WITH A CAULDRON HUNG OVER IT. THE HOG HANGS UPSIDE DOWN FROM A TREE, BLOOD DRIPPING INTO A BOWL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a sense of ritual and order: the chapters of transforming the hog into food.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara is inside the cabin, the door open onto the yard. She holds the baby by the fireplace, swaddled up tight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to put him to her breast, but he won't feed. She puts Ethan back in his crib, comes outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Inman is butchering the hog, chopping down either side of the spine to make two sides of meat. Now Sara is holding up a sheet of hog fat, as if it were a lace shawl. Now she's rendering the fat into lard. Now Inman's salting the two hams. Now Sara's washing the intestine. She sings all the while -- I dreamed that my bower was full of red swine and my bride bed full of blood -- they don't really converse. Inman continues to work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara goes back inside to Ethan's crib. Inman glances back, but can hardly bear to, her anxiety so palpable. THE BABY IS DEAD. She looks at it. She takes it up in her arms. Kisses its forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Makes a strange stifling noise. Inman doesn't look at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She comes out again, shovels some of the food into a plate, serves it up to Inman, gently touching him as she does so. Then serves out food for herself. Inman starts to eat.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Inman nods. She collects up the knapsacks, including Inman's, and goes back inside the house with them. Inman squats, eating, glancing back towards the cabin. There's the sudden shocking report of a revolver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman, knowing what it is, goes slowly towards the house and its two dead bodies. His own face is a rictus, the eyes thin slits. If he gave into his grief it would never cease.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SARA'S CABIN. DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the house, the silhouette of Inman working outside in the day's dying light, snow falling around him. He's digging a grave.

THE SNOW HAS STOPPED. It's left a carpet on the ground.

EXT. PATH IN THE MOUNTAINS. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman comes sliding down a crumbling slate hill and onto the path. He cornea to a place where the path suddenly drops away to reveal a view of the geography. And there, finally, in the distance, Inman can see the blue ridge. Somewhere in there is home, is Ada. He goes on.

<DIRECTION>
A mean fire burns by the creek. RUBY TURNS A KNIFE IN THE FLAMES. Stobrod's back is exposed. Just by the shoulder blade is an ugly grey and purple bulge the size of a crabapple. Ruby turns to Ada, who is helping.

EXT. TREE TUNNEL NEAR CHEROKEE VILLAGE. AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TWO WOMEN EMERGE FROM A STEEP TUNNEL OF TREES IN A CHESTNUT GROVE. There's a stream and, up on the bank, A CLUSTER OF BLACK CONICAL HUTS, made up of chestnut logs, abandoned and slightly sinister looking. They approach one of the huts, its door long lost. The snow has drifted in. A second hut has a door which they pry open. It's dark and cold, but apparently still weatherproof. They get Stobrod off the horse and carry him inside, then come out again to unload the horse of its remaining load.
</DIRECTION>
<ADA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This horse is weary. He's ready to give up the ghost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADA>

Ruby picks up the blankets and provisions and goes back inside to her father. Ada takes the horse to another hut and, despite his great reluctance, pushes him inside.

Ada wouldn't even recognize this practical, hardy woman she's become. Stringy and of few words. She sets off towards the tree tunnel, passing Stobrod's hut.

	I'm getting firewood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman approaches the Killing Ground. He studies the ground, finds Pangle's grave. Blood has left its black writing in the snow and he finds first where Stobrod has been, where the bullet had been removed, then the journey away, still tiny, telltale spatters of blood, and the hoof prints and boot prints of two walkers and one loaded horse. He puts his hand into the ashes of Ruby's fire, can't feel any warmth. It's getting dark. He takes a drink from the stream, shudders at the cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STOBROD'S HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fire burns, a pall of smoke. Stobrod lies on the ground, swathed in blankets. Coughs. Ruby sits next to him, wipes the hair from his forehead. Ada opens her eyes, looks, closes them, listens to the fire, a strange squeaking as it burns.
</DIRECTION>
<ADA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That wood -- that sound when it burns that mean more snow?

<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRACK, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
First light. The sun creeps up, a red streak of dawn. Inman walking, his head bent to the tracks. He walks quickly, even as the terrain gets more steep. As he bends to the snow -- where a spot of blood has fallen into a hoof print -- A FLAKE OF SNOW LANDS ON HIS HAND. Then a second. He looks up. The snow falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to move more quickly, racing the snow as it seeks to erase the tracks. The snow thickens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TREE TUNNEL NEAR CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the Chestnut Grovel A DOZEN WILD TURKEYS pick their way across the snow. A shotgun lines up its sight at one of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trigger is squeezed. An explosion of feathers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THREE WAY CROSSING, COLD MOUNTAIN. MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman hears the shot. Then a second, the sound ricocheting around him. He can't quite identify its source but he runs again, heading for the Chestnut trees he can see above him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TREE TUNNEL NEAR CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ada collects the two turkeys, the first creatures she's ever shot. Doesn't quite know how to hold them. She straightens up and sees, at the other end of the tree tunnel, backlit by the morning sun, THE SILHOUETTE OF A MAN. She drops the turkeys tires to reload the shotgun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman comes down the tunnel, approaching the hunter he sees through the snow at the other end of it.
</DIRECTION>
<ADA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn round and go back where you came from.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADA>
<DIRECTION>
Inman is bewildered by this woman's voice in a man's outfit, keeps walking, peering through the snow. Ada fires a warning shot. Inman, still some distance, suddenly understands.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ada? Ada Monroe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<ADA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not know you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADA>
<DIRECTION>
After all this time, all this way, Inman could give up the ghost.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I believe I made a mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He turns, walks heavily away from her. Then he turns again, completely lost, without compass.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I knew where to go I'd go there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<ADA>
<DIRECTION>
(finally recognising him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADA>
<DIRECTION>
He nods. They don't know how to speak to each other, just stand awkwardly, some distance apart, the emotion stones in their throats. Eventually --
</DIRECTION>
<ADA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd better come with me.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
And with that, she starts to sob, and sob.

VERY HIGH ANGLE: Inman walks towards Ada. They embrace.

Ada comes out of Stobrod's hut, a glimpse of Inman sleeping on the floor, heads for another hut which Ruby is sweeping out. The snow has stopped. Ada stands in the door, watches Ruby. Ruby's resistance to Inman is palpable.

	You probably don't remember it right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBY>
<ADA>

	Maybe you can't see my face, but if you could see my inside, my whatever you want to name it, my spirit, that's the fear I have deeper than any gash on my neck. I think I'm ruined. They kept trying to put me in the ground, but I wasn't ready, no ma'am, no more ready than that scoundrel in there's not ready to die on us. But if I had goodness, I lost it. If I had anything tender in me I shot it dead.

INMAN SHOOTS HIM, THEN RUSHES FROM THE TREES, FIRING, MISSING BOSIE, WHO RIDES AWAY, EVIDENTLY NOT RELISHING THE FIGHT, AND THROWS HIMSELF AT TEAGUE, WHOSE HORSE IS BUCKING WILDLY. Teague's carbine fires an involuntary shot into the air. Inman yanks the gun from his hand with his own left hand and lets go the shotgun barrel of the Lemats with the other, the big pistol almost leaping from his hand with the recoil. TEAGUE'S CHEST OPENS OUT AS HE'S THROWN OFF THE HORSE. Mo is still screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman walks over and shoots him in the head, then walks to Teague, who is saying something, the blood blotting the snow under him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman studies him, picks up the Spencer carbine, turns to look where Bosie has gone, steps up onto Teague's horse, reins the horse in, and trots it over to the prostrate Teague, LEANS OVER AND SHOOTS HIM DEAD. He turns the horse in the direction Bosie had headed. He can't see horse or rider, but in the stand of Hickory Trees ahead, THE GUSTS OF STEAMING BREATH betray them both. He rides slowly towards the stand of trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ada and Ruby walking. They hear the shots. Ada turns and starts to run through the snow, her hat flying from her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STAND OF HICKORY TREES, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inman's horse is parallel to Bosie, who is deep inside the trees but also riding, slowly. It's like a dance.
</DIRECTION>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come out of there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<BOSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir. Here's fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOSIE>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just have to shoot the horse from under you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<BOSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoot her. She's not mine. You riding Mr Teague's mare?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOSIE>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<BOSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOSIE>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope so.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(wearily, as he brings
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	his horse inside the
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
trees)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, how old are you? Give me your gun and ride home, I'm done fighting. I'm sick of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<BOSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I give you my gun you'll shoot me dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOSIE>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not shoot you, but nor am I walking down that mountain looking over my shoulder for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<BOSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what they call a conundrum. I tell you what I've got on my side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOSIE>
<INMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have you got on your side?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INMAN>
<BOSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The confidence of youth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOSIE>
<DIRECTION>
And in that second HE PRODUCES HIS GUN AND FIRES. INMAN HAS ALREADY FIRED THE LEMATS AND THE BOY, SHOT IN THE HEAD, FALLS. CAUGHT BY ONE STIRRUP THE HORSE BOLTING. INMAN WATCHES, STOCK STILL, THEN MAKES A COUGH, AS IF CLEARING HIS THROAT, AND A THIN MIST OF BLOOD SPRAYS FROM HIS MOUTH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIDGE, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ada and Ruby running. THEY REACH STOBROD, HIS HORSE STOPPED, DRINKING FROM THE CREEK. Stobrod, barely conscious, hanging halfway down its flank, held on by the ropes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ada hurries on, taking the shotgun from Ruby, who tends to her father.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A GROVE OF TREES, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ada runs past the horse dragging the cave corpses. She hardly stops to look at the bodies, just rushes on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GROUND SIMPLIFIES AND SHE'S AT THE BOTTOM OF A GROVE. A STEEP INCLINE, THE SUN LOW AND IN FRONT OF HER. SHE SEES A BRILLIANT FRAME OF BLACK TREES, AND THEN A SUDDEN FLURRY OF ANGRY CROWS FLYING TOWARDS HER. AT THE TOP OF THE HILL IS A SMALL HIEROGLYPH OF A MAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FINALLY, THE IMAGE FROM THE SWANGER WELL EXACTLY AS SHE FIRST SAW IT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FIGURE RAISES A HAND, BRIEFLY, THEN PITCHES FORWARD INTO THE SNOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs, her heart broken, towards the body of Inman. He's dead, the red flag of his life ebbed, away in the snow. Ada falls to her knees and pulls him over, the snow crusted on his face, which she wipes away with great tenderness, then sits, his head in her lap, as Ruby slowly comes up the hill towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A VIOLIN PLAYS, quite raucous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM, EASTER. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GIRL, about five or six, with Ada's curls, sits at the table cradling a tiny lamb, which won't feed from the nippled bottle she offers it. She tries again. Ada comes in suddenly, takes a knife from the kitchen, and hurries out.
</DIRECTION>
<ADA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bring that lamb outside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADA>
<DIRECTION>
The girl gets up, carries the lamb out into the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SOUND OF THE FIDDLE CONTINUING, JOINED BY A BANJO, It's a glorious spring morning, Black Cove Farm at its most luxuriant, the path edged with brilliant flowers. There are more animals in evidence. The girl emerges from the house and sees Ada in the field, surrounded by sheep. She hurries over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ADA IS EXPERTLY SKINNING A STILLBORN LAMB. The little girl is horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<ADA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He came out dead, love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADA>
<DIRECTION>
She has the skin off the lamb, which lies like a little pink cat on the ground. She approaches Grace, takes the live lamb from her arms, the girl resistant, frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't kill him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<ADA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to kill him. But we have to try something or else he's going to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADA>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the skin and wraps it round Grace's lamb. Then puts the covered lamb into the pen with the dead lamb's mother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It goes to the sheep and, after a few false starts, starts to feed, accepted as a surrogate.
</DIRECTION>
<ADA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't that a small mercy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADA>
<DIRECTION>
And A VOICE joins in with the fiddle and banjo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STOBROD is playing, on his repaired fiddle. His hair is now completely grey. GEORGIA is playing the banjo and singing, although. A SMALL CHILD with Georgia's reddish coloring keeps invading his picking hand trying to join in. RUBY HAS ANOTHER GEORGIA CHILD IN HER ARMS, but is also trying to serve food.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She passes Georgia and touches the top of his head. SALLY SWANGER is pouring water from a jug, Ada emerges from the kitchen, with a big pie, racing to the table.
</DIRECTION>
<ADA>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hot hot hot hot hot!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADA>
<DIRECTION>
From behind her, Grace appears, carrying a jug of milk, puts it on the groaning board of the table. Grace has a full plate in front of her, picks up a fork to spear some meat.
</DIRECTION>
<ADA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grace Inman, nobody said eat.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then to Stobrod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Thewes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADA>
<DIRECTION>
The music stops. And there's quiet except for the sound of animals: lowing, barking, braying, bleating.
</DIRECTION>
<ADA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For good friends, good food, good family: for all our blessings -- Oh Lord we thank thee. Amen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADA>
<ALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amen !
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALL>
<DIRECTION>
And they eat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
