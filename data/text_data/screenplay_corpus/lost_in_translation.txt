Bob gets out and rushes down the street to where he saw Charlotte. The street is crowded with JAPANESE PEOPLE, and different colored umbrellas, (it's sunny out with a light rain).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Music blasts from speakers on the street, and there is some promo going on with GIRLS handing out little cologne samples. Bob looks around for her, but only sees dark hair, umbrellas, and super tan JAPANESE KIDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance an umbrella moves to reveal Charlotte.

	CHARLOTTE!

But she can't hear him over the loudspeaker. He rushes to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C.U. she turns and we see she is crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music swells. He embraces her, holding her close to him in the crowd.

	Why are you crying?

She smiles at him, and is lost in the crowd.

<DIRECTION>
Back in the Presidential, alone, Bob leans against the little doily. They drive off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks out the window, Bob's happy he's going home, he's happy he came to Tokyo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bob's P.O.V.- Tokyo goes past his window.
