EXT. SOUTH AFRICAN FARM - DAY (1939)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A white car sits in the yard of the farmhouse. On the door, a decal: "CAPETOWN SANITORIUM." Two men dressed in the white uniforms of the sanitorium exit the farm- house; one gently guiding a rather frail, troubled woman toward the car; the other totes her suitcase.

<YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There comes a time in everyone's life when they discover that the only person you can truly depend on is yourself. That the only real power anyone has to get anything done is the power of one. With any luck you can make it through a lot of years before you ever have to face the reality of that fact.

	It was a luxury I never had. I discovered it the year my mother had her nervous breakdown.

One attendant holds the rear door of the car open for the woman. Before entering, she turns one last time toward the farmhouse.

HER POV

<DIRECTION>
A young BOY looking one part scared, one part sad, and one part lost stares back at her, his hand held by a large, amiable black woman with tears rolling down her round cheeks.

The woman enters the car. The car drives off down the road. The Boy watches it disappear behind a plume of swirling dust.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father died before I was born, and even though I was raised by my Zulu nanny, with my mother, depending on her health, in nominal attendance, it was decided, with her departure, that I, too, would depart...

The dust the Boy has been watching reverses itself. An unseen vehicle comes up the road.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But before I could be sent out into the world one very serious matter had to be dealt with.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was a chronic bedwetter. Since my nanny was the one responsible for my well-being, she did what any responsible Zulu mother would do. She called on the greatest medicine man of her tribe -- Inkosi Inkosikazi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Out of the dust a large black Buick ROADMASTER ROARS up the road and into the yard, scattering chickens and geese, stopping in front of the wide-eyed six-year-old and his tremulous nanny. A huge Zulu jumps out of the front passenger seat and opens the rear door. A moment passes, and then two splayed, cracked feet descend from the car and settle into the dust. INKOSI INKOSIKAZI, 100 years old, small, black, wizened, hair and beard whiter than cotton, a leopard skin draped over his shoulders, a beaded fly switch in one hand, a trussed chicken in the other, exits the car.

EXT. YARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fire burns bright in the black African night. The Boy sits holding the chicken, close by the fire, while Inkosi Inkosikazi shuffles around him, drawing a circle in the dust with a stick.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Legend had it that Inkosi Inkosikazi was the last son of the great Zulu king, Dingaan, who fought both the Boers and the British to a standstill nearly 100 years before, and the night Inkosi Inkosikazi was conceived stars fell from the sky until the sun rose.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The circle complete, the old man sits down opposite the Boy. From a leather pouch he produces several bones. He throws the bones on the ground and studies them for a moment. He begins to wave the fly switch back and forth in front of the Boy's eyes, chanting low, softly. The Boy's eyes grow heavy; his lids droop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DREAM - EXT. WATERFALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Boy and the old man are standing above a great waterfall. In the swirling pool far below are ten stepping stones linking one bank to the other.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The medicine man instructed me to jump off the falls and climb along the ten stepping stones, counting as I went until I reached dry land.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Boy jumps, cascading down the falls and into the pond below. He clambers up the first rock. It is slippery. He falls off and climbs back on, buffeted by the spraying water. He makes his way stone by stone toward the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even though it was only a dream, I felt as if my struggle to reach dry land was terrifyingly real. The water was like ice, bone- chilling, cold, and as I made my way from one stone to the next I could feel my strength desert me.
	</DIALOGUE>

The progress from one step to the next gets progressively harder as the Boy keeps slipping into the swirling water, coughing and sputtering.
</DIRECTION>

	I was three rocks in when I ran out of gas. I couldn't pull myself any further. No matter how hard I

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inkosi Inkosikazi said the spirit of the great Zulu warriors lived in me. He told me that whenever trouble arose I should return to the waterfall and keep stepping across the rocks until the trouble passed. He said three rocks were enough to conquer my problem with the night water; that I was very brave. He said I was a man for all Africa, bound to her by my spirit, bound by my dreams.

The six-year-old walks timorously through the halls, filled with bigger boys -- brash, noisy, hostile. They only speak the "Taal" -- Afrikaans. Over and over they jostle or verbally deride the six-year-old, knocking his books down so that when he bends to pick them up he is kicked in the butt. Or pulling his shirt out from under his jacket and making it hard to move.

A mob of boys, led by a big bully, JAAPIE BOTHA, runs the six-year-old through the bathroom and into the showers, fully clothed. He tries to run out. Jaapie Botha grabs him and throws him back in, holding him with one ham-fisted hand under the shower head and turning the shower on with the other.

In front of him on a platform Jaapie Botha stands, his shirtsleeves rolled to the shoulder,

	You hear Sutcliffe screwed Bartlett's sister when he stayed with them over holidays?

<MORRIE>

	Christ! I'm about to have a calf. This bloody Boer gets lucky, we're in the poorhouse.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the double doors. Still in CLOSEUP, Morrie turns to face PK for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<MORRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now remember. We're not here to exhibit our wares. We go in, we do the job, we get out. Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORRIE>

PK is so focused his eyes seem to bore through the doors. He does not move his head a hair.
</DIRECTION>
<PK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PK>
<DIRECTION>
Morrie and PK draw a deep breath. Together they push open the double doors. Together they stride into a floodlit, fully-packed sports arena and head down the fan-lined aisle to the raised boxing ring in the center. Schoolboys in their respective school blazers, Afrikaan and English, yell, whistle and clap. PK and Morrie, in FULL FRAME, reveal PK in a boxing robe with taped hands, and Morrie with towel and bucket.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And at the end of six matches in all weight divisions, the score is Prince of Wales three victories, Helpmakeer three victories.

The stands explode with cheers.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now for the final bout to determine which school will win the Johannesburg 1950 public school boxing team championship. In this corner, weighing 140 pounds, standing 5'8", from the Helpmakeer School with a record of 13-0 on the year, Jannie Geildenhaus.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A huge cheer goes up for JANNIE, muscular, bare-chested, as he dances and shadowboxes for the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PK enters the ring. He stands, robe on, eyes intent on Jannie. When the noise subsides the Announcer continues.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And in this corner, representing the Prince of Wales School, the current Johannesburg Public School welterweight champion, also with a record of 13-0 on the year, also 140 pounds, Kid P.K.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
Now the English schoolboys cheer for their man, but PK does not respond. He barely moves. He raises an arm in bare acknowledgment. His attention stays focused across the ring on his shadowboxing opponent. PK watches Jannie dance closely when a low CHANTING begins from outside the stadium -- African, tribal, mystical harmonies of black voices building until the white voices inside the stadium are stunned to silence. The song carries beautifully in the night. For the first time PK's focus is broken, but not like the others in the audience, who haven't a clue as to what's happening. He has heard this before. This is familiar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is for him. A distant knowing flickers in his eyes like a man who has heard the voice of fate whisper his name.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over and over, one phrase is indistinguishable -- the chorus of the song. "Ono bi shobi ingelosi." The chanting stops as suddenly as it began. A moment passes before the crowd begins to buzz with the phenomenon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Announcer attempts to bring everyone's attention back to the business at hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We thank the native population for their spirited display of enthusiasm. But now, on to the main event. Fighters to center ring, please.

PK, focused again, meets Jannie at the REFEREE.

	You both know the rules. No butts, no elbows, no low blows. First man to score three knock downs wins. Let's have a good clean fight. Good luck to you.

The fighters slap leather. PK turns back to his corner when his focus is broken dramatically by a face in the crowd.

PK

goes back to his corner and takes off his robe. Morrie stands, holding PK's mouthpiece.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He jams the mouthpiece into PK's mouth as the BELL RINGS. PK turns to an onslaught by Jannie, a real brawler. Jannie's big, overhand rights almost nail PK until he finds his footing and dances away. Jannie comes after him hard, his schoolmates bellowing encouragement. But PK's far superior boxing skills put Jannie at an immed- iate disadvantage. It is a classic battle of a boxer versus a fighter. PK's jabs keep Jannie at an arm's length, until he closes with a combination. Jannie, willing to take three punches to land one, absorbs PK's point scoring combinations and tries to land knockout punches. When he has had enough punishment he lunges into a clinch.
</DIRECTION>
<JANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blery Rooinek. I'll kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
PK pushes off as Jannie hammers at his kidneys. Backing up, PK repays the compliment with two quick jabs to the face. PK works Jannie, turning him left then right, working the angles, keeping him off balance while he racks up the points. Jannie goes left. As PK chases him that way his eyes fix on something out of the ring.

Their presence distracts PK for a split second, and in that split second Jannie seizes the opportunity. He comes across with a big right hand to PK's jaw. Jannie connects. PK goes down hard. The crowd goes wild. Morrie leaps up and down in the corner.

Jannie comes rushing in, banging PK with a series of hard rights, but dropping his left each time he throws one. PK absorbs the punishment as best he can, backing up, dancing away. Jannie is all over him just as the BELL RINGS. Jannie goes back to his corner, triumphant. PK goes back to his and sits down with a blank ex- pression. Morrie goes to work on a small cut over his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<MORRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you trying to do, bankrupt us? What happened?

PK turns and looks at the two Africans at the rear door. Morrie's eyes follow him, tensing as he sees the two men.

The BELL RINGS. PK and Morrie trade a look. Jannie comes rushing over and throws a big right. PK steps to his own right side and pops Jannie right over his dropped left hand. He looks at Morrie again.

Jannie comes after PK, paying for each big right he throws as PK finds his mark. PK plants one, then two, then three punches on Jannie's face. Finally, frus- trated, Jannie forsakes all pretense of boxing and tries to nail PK with wild, flailing blows. PK bobs and weaves and feints. Jannie's punches grow weary. PK begins to bear down, driving his man back with rapid-fire com- binations until he delivers the coup de grace, a left hook to the heart and a driving right uppercut. Jannie goes down in a heap. The crowd goes wild. The Referee counts him out. Jannie's seconds rush into the ring to lift their fallen fighter. Morrie also rushes in, followed by the Prince of Wales boxing team. They hoist PK up on their shoulders.

Indeed, "Fortress Virgin." Surrounded by a high stone wall, the school's gothic towers loom medieval in the African moonlight. A security guard mans the front gate.

<MARAIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The problems of South Africa, my boy, do not come from tribalism. They come from counter-tribalism. From people insisting that natural laws which have been in place and operating since God's creation, should be tampered with. Does the gazelle sleep with the lion? Does the rhino graze with the mouse? The separation of things is not coincidental. Do you think a Zulu wants to see his culture, his sense of identity, replaced by someone else's anymore than I do?
	</DIALOGUE>

	No, sir. But I don't think he wants being a Zulu to mean he is denied the same rights as everyone else has.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A brilliant African sun beats down on the veldt below. On the rock, a seven-year-old PK sits looking somewhat sadly over the landscape. A long shadow covers him. The CLICK of a CAMERA is heard. PK turns, shielding his eyes with his hand against the glare of the sun to a tall, white-haired figure, shirtless, in hiking boots and kneesocks, holding a box camera.

	Doc believed the brain had two functions and that the South African public school system unfortunately dealt with only one.

<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The brain, P.K., has two functions. It is the best reference library ever, which is a good thing to have. Ja? But also from it comes original thought. In school you will get all filled up with the facts. Here your brain will learn where to look, how to look, how to think. And then you will have for yourself all the brains that have ever been.

Doc an PK walk through the cactus garden.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If God would choose a plant to represent Him, I think He would choose of all plants the cactus. This one plant has all the blessings He tried but failed to give man. It is true. Look. The cactus is humble but not submissive. It grows where no other plant will grow. The sun bakes its back, the wind rips it from cliffs, or drowns it in the dry desert sand. Not a complaint. In good times or bad it will still flower. It protects itself from danger.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Doc touches a cactus needle.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it harms no other plant. It
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	has patience and solitude and modesty. In Mexico there is a cactus that blooms once in a hundred years and then only at night. That is saintliness of the highest order I think. Ja? From cactus comes medicine to heal the wounds of men and little buttons if you eat one you can touch the face of God or stare into the mouth of hell. It is the plant of patience, solitude, love, and madness. Modesty, beauty. Toughness and gentleness. Of all the plants I think it is closest to God. Ja?

Doc shows PK a small tree with an even smaller vine attached to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This tree can grow so high it can touch the face of the sky. But this little vine can choke it and keep it small. Most people are like these vines. Afraid of new ideas. Afraid to let things grow.

Doc rips the vine away from the tree.

PK leads Morrie across the gym. PK passes an African fighter. He stops training when he sees PK. He turns to another African fighter, glancing at PK.

He hits the bell. The fighters circle. PK's opponent starts punching, jabbing, probing. After two feints he comes after PK in earnest. PK steps left and peppers him with three quick blows to the face. Solly's interest is suddenly piqued. Again the fighters circle. Again the opponent sets up with jabs and again he attacks. This time PK dodges, hits him hard and spins him around, hitting him twice more. A smile appears on Solly's face. The opponent, angered now, gets more aggressive. PK keeps bobbing and weaving, sticking and slipping punches. The opponent unloads, banging away at PK with everything he has. PK backs up two steps, then shifts positions. The opponent's momentum carries him into the ropes. As he comes off the ropes PK throws him an eight-punch combination, demolishing his opponent. PK steps back. The opponent sags. Solly hits the bell, clearly excited.

Mandoma swings again with a last desperate effort, and PK buries the Solly Goldman thirteen into every part of his body. PK steps back and with his last punch, puts Mandoma down.

	When you say to me, Onoshobishobi Ingelosi means nothing, you are right. And you are wrong. The legend gives the people hope for a good tomorrow. But hope alone will not make a good tomorrow for the people. You cannot write our letters, get us clothes, food, work. These things we must do ourselves, so we can be part of this country's good tomorrow. If we are not, the hope will disappear. The people will grow tired.

PK drops to the fallen girl's side. He is frantic at the sight of her gaping bloody wound and the sight of her open blank eyes. The battle raging around him recedes before his pain and rising rage. All at once he explodes, screaming like a madman.
</DIRECTION>

He leaps at Bretyn and bangs one punch after another into the startled man. Bretyn's face is broken over and over against PK's fists. Still PK keeps pounding blow after blow into the fallen man.

Three cops descend on PK and beat him mercilessly until he drops to the floor, unconscious.

Off a play a fight breaks out. One of the men is kicked unconscious. Two of his teammates carry him off the field, dumping his body unceremoniously like a sack of potatoes on the sidelines. They run back as play resumes.

	Dear Morrie. To answer your question: yes--sports are played here, but only in the loosest sense of the words "sport" and "play". The rules are different for everything, in games as well as in the rest of our lives. The managers, the foremen, the company people. They live apart from the miners. They have families. Proper gardens. Sunday dinners. The miners--the crud, as we are called -- don't. This is a society of men, many of whom have pasts better left behind. Future does not apply. It is a society only in the loosest sense of the word. The laws of survival are simple-- you either do or you don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
PK comes down a side street. A half a dozen men at cards, hard-faced desperadoes, see him pass, eyeing him closely. PK averts his eyes. From behind his back comes the sound of LIPS PUCKERING loudly, indecently. PK swallows hard. The sound of a CHARGE turns him to the six men bolting from their card game after him, whooping with lascivious intent. PK takes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chase takes PK and his pursuers flying through the streets of the camp, past one identical cement hut after another. People watch, disinterested. No one raises a hand to help.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PK comes racing around the corner to three of the men
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
blocking the street in front of him. He whirls. The others catch up behind, yelling and hooting. The two lines advance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PK gets ready. When the first man is close enough he hits him hard, breaking his jaw. He swings at another, catching him flush in the face. But then the rest are upon him. Even though PK fights like hell, he is overwhelmed. The blows come from everywhere, beating him to the ground. His arms and legs are firmly grabbed by four men. He is banged hard face down onto a concrete table. The fifth man pulls down his pants and the sixth begins to undo his own fly. All the men scream obsceni- ties, anticipating the rape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PK struggles like hell to no avail. As he is about to be violated, a roaring giant of a man tears into the pack like a bear shredding dogs. He scatters the men, knocking some unconscious, sending the rest to flight. He stands over PK, a looming block of granite with a wild black beard and coal-black eyes. His intent only becomes clear as to whether he is claiming a prize or helping a friend when he offers PK his hand, lifting PK effortlessly.
</DIRECTION>

He examines PK's bruised face with some concern and then smiles.

PK comes down the rest of the way. He takes the cordtex rope dangling from the bomb and inserts a fuse. He nods to Elijah. Elijah lights a cheesa stick. He hands the glowing stick to PK.

He studies the hangup intently, then picks up a rock. Choosing a target he heaves the rock with all his might toward the hangup and runs like hell. The rock hits the hangup. PK springs off the grizzly, right into the Africans as the hangup thunders down. Dust and small rocks fill the safety tunnel.

When the avalanche has stopped PK raises himself off the Africans. They are all covered in dust but smiling and babbling, happy to be alive.

PK jumps out of the way at the last minute.

Men's faces begin to appear at the iron-meshed windows. People start to bang at the door.

PK, realizing there is no talking to Botha now, does his best to stay out of the charging giant's way.

Botha charges him. PK sidesteps and hits him with a left hook. The punch has no effect. Botha swings out wildly. PK easily dances away. Botha picks up another table and heaves it at PK. PK jumps to avoid it, but trips on an overturned stool. He goes down. The miners outside, crowding three deep, yell and shout. People start to make bets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Botha charges PK as PK scrambles up. Botha swings. The blow glances off PK's shoulder and sends him flying, spinning over a table. Botha leaps at PK, driving him into the wall. PK grimaces, sagging. Botha picks him up and starts to squeeze him to death in his massive arms. PK, his hands free, starts to pound on Botha's ears with his palms. Botha screams as the powder head- ache accelerates through the top of his skull. He drops PK. PK rolls away and swings a stool at Botha's midsection. Botha is driven back. PK goes to swing the stool again. Botha catches it as if it were made of balsa. He rips it out of PK's hand and flings it back at him, charging behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PK goes topping end over end. Botha gets a hand on him and lifts him from behind. He flings PK over the bar. PK hits the floor, stunned. Botha pulls at the bar trying to get at PK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rocks the bar and rocks the bar as PK is trying to regain his bearings. Finally, with one tremendous rip, the bar comes away from its bolting. Botha pulls it aside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PK rises just as Botha moves in. PK hits him three solid shots to the stomach but Botha hardly feels them. He grabs PK and starts to squeeze him again. Face to face, Botha's crazed eyes watch the life fade from PK's.

The crowd screams for him to move side to side. The betting changes fast and furious.

	I knew as I walked out of the mines, out of Africa, that I wasn't fleeing. That one day I would return. Inkosi Inkosikasi was right. I was a man for all Africa. Bound to her by my spirit. Bound by my dreams. And Africa had taught me the lesson I would take out into the world and one day bring back. Great changes can come from the power of many. But only when the many join together and create what is invincible. The Power of One.
