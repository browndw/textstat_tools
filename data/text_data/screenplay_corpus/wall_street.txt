	<DIALOGUE>
	EXT. WALL STREET - EARLY MORNING
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN. THE STREET. The most famous third of a mile in the world. Towering landmark structures nearly blot out the dreary grey flannel sky. The morning rush hour crowds swarm through the dark, narrow streets like mice in a maze, all in pursuit of one thing: MONEY... CREDITS RUN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the ROAR of the trains pulling out of the station. Blurred faces, bodies, suits, hats, attache cases float into view pressed like sardines against the sides of a door which now open, releasing an outward velocity of anger and greed, one of them BUD FOX.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUBWAY EXIT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bubbling mass charges up the stairs. Steam rises from a grating, shapes merging into the crowd. Past the HOMELESS VETS, the insane BAG LADY with 12 cats and 20 shopping bags huddled in the corner of Trinity Church...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud the Fox straggling behind, in a crumpled raincoat, tie askew, young, very young, his bleary face buried in a Wall Street Journal, folded, 'subway style', as he crosses the street against the light.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why Fox? Why didn't you buy... schmuck?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
A car honks, swerving past.

<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cavernous modern lobby. Bodies cramming into elevators. Bud, stuffing the newspaper into his coat, jams in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blank faces stare ahead, each lost in private thoughts, Bud again mouthing the thought, "stupid schmuck", his eyes catching a blond executive who quickly flicks her eyes away. Paranoia in the elevator. We quickly cut into private lives.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACK_BIKE_MESSENGER>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes on the same blonde exec who looks away, self- conscious about her legs. The elevator stops at a floor, discards only one person. The doors close a little too slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<BLONDE_EXECUTIVE>

<DIRECTION>
Catching the eyes of Bud Fox once again wandering to her. Camera moving to Bud who looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...sorry, what a fox... funny, the most beautiful girls in the world are always on the street or in elevators, never get to talk to them, shy ... my looks, never had confidence in them ... overcompensating work syndrome... prove your worth with money... 'cept I'm not making any money...

</DIRECTION>

Camera moving slowly again over the eyes. The silence of individual tension reigns over all.

	<DIALOGUE>
	...goddamn elevators!...people, too many goddamn people in this world!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WORRIED_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator finally comes to a slow stop... They wait, plead, beg, screech with the eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door at last opens. None of them acknowledging each other, they all stampede out the door with an audible gasp of release, a collective sign akin to making it to a urinal after a punishing wait...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator tension is over, but the killer grind continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACKSON, STEINEM INVESTMENT HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Credits continue to run. Bud moves past the functional reception area, past CAROLYN, a cheerful young black girl.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How you doing Buddy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
He slips off his overcoat, flicks some lint off his Paul Stuart $500 suit, and enters the main trading room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brokers mill by their desks, gulping coffee, scanning the papers, the quotrons. The digital clock by the big board counter clicks to 9:26 am -- four minutes until the market opens. You can smell the hunger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud takes a deep breath, tosses the newspaper away and struts into the office -- fuck it -- it's a new day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING past DAN STEEPLES, a flush-faced old-timer, a blue and white Yale tie, with a carnation in his lapel.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning, Dan. What's looking good today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<STEEPLES>

	If I know I wouldn't be in this business. Get out while you're young, kid. I came here one day, I sat down, and look at me now.

Past CHARLIE CUSHING, on the phone, a handsome chunk of man with rugged good looks and Ivy League mannerisms.

<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...hey Chuckie, how's the woman- slayer?

Bud reaches his trading desk, whips open his briefcase and pulls out a computer print-out of last night's homework.

</MARV>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
His associate, MARVIN, a manicky wise-guy, swivels over his chair from a nearby desk. He gives the charts a quick read.
</DIRECTION>
<MARV>
<DIRECTION>
(scowling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.

	Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.

	Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.

LOU MANNHEIM, strolls in, a dignified looking older broker in his late 60's, wearing an old brown brim hat with button down white shirt, narrow tie, very much a picture from another era... a kind humor in his eyes... but obviously ailing in the legs and breath department.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>

	You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...

</BUD>
<MANNHEIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.

The stentorian voice of OFFICE MANAGER HIERONYMUS LYNCH booms over the intercom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see him peering from behind the glass partition in hit office; tall, balding with a perpetual worried look on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<LYNCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Attention. Please. Office Production is down ten percent this week. I recommend that you all go through your clients' investments for any portfolio adjustments. And don't forget -- double commissions today on our 'A' or better bond funds.

	Especially you rookies. Also, remember, the sales contest ends tomorrow.

Bud and Marvin roll their eyes. The digital clock flashes 9:30. The CREDITS close.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And they're off and running!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
The room rises to a subtle but new energy level with the clatter of the ticker, speakers, teletype machines, newsprinters' Dow Jones and Reuters, phones ringing off the hook. Brokers are shouting orders, running for tickets, dodging each other; it's a controlled riot.
</DIRECTION>
<BROKERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's a hot lead... Have I got one for you.... sell ... dump it all!! ... 500 at an eighth, an eighth!... July fifties. April thirties...how bout those Decembers? You see where they're going? ... Morgan is selling a billion one at the close. Yeah. That's right, they're selling all over the place... we're still long on the treasuries -- $110 million. What about the Japs? ...Where am I?

He looks up at the TICKER... stock quotes whizzing by.

	Up an eighth. How many you want? It's on the floor.

THE CLOCK... It's 2.30 p.m. We hear the relentless clatter of the board ticker, and the drone of disembodied voices, blarihg market information out of squawk boxes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud's desk is now cluttered with order tickets, literature, crumpled notes, beverage cups and a half-eaten sandwich. He's on the phone and from the look on his face, the caller on the other end is breaking his balls. Marvin paces past, making a dramatic phone pitch.
</DIRECTION>
<MARV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Beltzer has to have his information this minute! It concerns his future!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARV>

Bud waves Marvin away, answers his caller, trying to keep cool, worried how as he sees Lynch, the office manager, coming over.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Howard, I thought you were a gentleman. Sure it's gone down a little bit, but you got the tip from your printer, I didn't... Yeah you did. That's what you said.

Bud whispers, tensely. Lynch listens.

	He's lying.

	Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.

Lynce hangs up and glares at Bud.

	Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.

	I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...

<LYNCH>

	Somebody has to pay for that error. And it's not me.

INT. GEKKO OFFICE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
NATALIE, a classy attractive Englishwoman is on the phone with Bud, somewhat amused by his manner. She is the personal secretary to multimillionaire, Wall Street trader and raider, Gordon Gekko. His windows look out on a panoramic view of the city and East River.
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Fox, I've told you before, I'm sure you're a good broker, but our traders talk to the brokers, Mr. Gekko only deals with investment bankers. Yes, I shall give him your message ...

As they're speaking, another SECRETARY leads two well-heeled JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN past her desk. As she opens the door to the inner office and ushers them inside, we catch a glimpse of a figure, pacing back and forth, talking animatedly on the phone by the huge corner window. HE IS GORDON GEKKO.

In the background, a 747 ascends into the night sky, climbing over the roof tops of weathered brick tract houses. Bud, coat collar pulled up against the wind, crosses the street, entering a neighborhood bar. We see an old maroon Honda behind him.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MCGREGOR'S - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dimly-lit, noisy, blue-collar airline bar. Machinists and mechanics still in their overalls at the bar, drinking, watching ESPN FIGHT NIGHT, on TV. Bud searches the crowd. A group of middle-aged men wave him over, BLUESTAR AIRLINES insignias on the pockets... CHARLIE DENT, a rugged, chain- smoking ex-Marine Sergeant, and DOMINICK AMATO, a big strong Italian greet Buddy as he comes over.

INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cramped studio facing an air shaft with bars on the window. Moving across to the sound of the radio alarm going off and the glib tones of a rock D.J. announcing the Met's latest streak ... The walls are papered with stock analyses and graphs, print out pages strewn across the floor. No other semblance of a personal life except clothes haphazardly tossed, Barron's and Fortune magazines. A GIRL's back is all we see, sleeping naked on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on Bud's IBM computer -- his appointment calendar. Bud focusing on an underlined notation: G.G.'s BIRTHDAY.

Bud stares at the clock: 4 a.m. He picks up a prospectus for a chemical company, starts reading.

Bud, somewhat nervous, is led down an impressive hallway hung with expensive modern art... past a huge Calder mobile and a pool of some 15 traders on phones, quotron terminals and keyboards... into Natalie's outer office.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>

Bud takes out an old crumpled Fortune magazine cover of Gordon Gekko, entitled "Gekko the Great!"

She takes the gift and enters Gekko's office. Bud paces nervously. Natalie re-appears, stern, but a note of compromise in her voice.

Bud on the courtesy phone, hangs up, looks nervously at his watch. Almost 12. He's lost some two hours of business. Natalie suddenly comes out, without a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five minutes...

INT. GORDON GEKKO'S OFFICE (BUD'S POV) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Furnishings in hypermodern gray and black lacquer, Modern Art ranging from black field paintings by Ad Reinhardt to the smashed dishes of Julian Schnabel. Nautilus equipment, hi-tech gadgets are in evidence, including a splendid Howard Miller World Time Clock, and a world map...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three of Gekko's people, young MBA's dressed for success, are scattered about the room, on phones, calculators, coming in and out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDON GEKKO aka Gekko the Great as the media calls him, dressed in a custom English suit, paces on the phone with the restlessness of a caged tiger, a 50-foot extension cord attached to his blinking 130 line silver-plated telephone. On his ears is a headset.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is carrying on overlapping conversations with a myriad of bankers, partners and lawyers; pausing to issue commands to his aides while keeping his eye on the stock prides spitting across a bank of quotron monitors, carrying everything from New York Exchanges to London, commodities, gold, and currency values. A second Secretary and sometimes Natalie exit and enter with various messages written on a piece of paper, indicating a waiting party on the phone. Gekko often shakes his head "no".

ALEX DE BETANCOURT, a tall handsome Frenchman, jots a note and follows Gordon over to line 3. Gekko's dark intent eyes fixing briefly on Bud who stands waiting in the corner. He motions him to sit.

Bud's eyes on the framed "tombstones" from the Wall Street Journal commemorating Gekko's successful deals; they hang like scalps from the walls. Gekko's eyes drifting to Bud, a friendly easy smile for a flick of an instant, he has genuine charm in his manner and though ultrafast verbally, projects calm and confidence at the center. A man who obviously loves what he does, to some small degree is flashing his stuff for the outsider.

Gekko notes the answer, wrapping the cuff of a state-of-the- art, automatic blood pressure monitor around his arm and starts pumping it up. His aides continue on the phones.

Bud opens his attache case and rifles out a handful of briefs. Gekko noting the blood pressure reading and taking the cuff off his arm. Ollie, the big trader, ambles back in, says something to the third aide, a young intelligent- looking woman SUSAN TURNER.

As he opens a birthday card and feeds it into the SHREDDER that sits next to his desk over the waste basket. The sound it makes is soft and menacing. Buddy knows its fourth down and long, Gekko's attention is shifting to the quotron. In frustration, Bud blurts it out.

He turns and heads out the door, still shaken by the revelation he has made passing Susan who hurries in with a dossier.

EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The upper West Side. The young, the rich and the restless parade along the avenue, jamming the neighborhood restaurants and bars. Bud glides along, feeling a part of the crowd now, past a dreadlocked DERELICT swigging Thunderbird and shouting obscenities, shaking a wooden African spear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RESTAURANT/BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside a glitzy neighborhood singles bar in which Bud stops, everybody seems to be young and drinking margueritas. Bud orders a beer, surveying the room like a veteran, overhearing the conversation of a YOUNG TRADER to two other broker types.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_TRADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you know Marty Wyndham? He netted $650,000 out of that merger...26 years old, the guy's Rambo. Got himself a Porsche Turbo Cabriolet about 75 thou, got a house in Westhampton, penthouse on Second Avenue, gets up at 2:30 in the morning, he's in the office at 4...guy never sleeps...Rambo genes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_TRADER>
<DIRECTION>
He blathers on as Bud surveys the room, noticing an ELEGANT BLONDE with a striking aloof beauty, very much the debutante dream Grace Kelly type, so refined that you wonder what she could possibly be doing out at night in public alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud summons his courage, catches his breath, makes his way over... She sees him approach, obviously doesn't wish to talk, eyes darting elsewhere like a nervous deer.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.

<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Maybe, just maybe she's his! His eyes show it as he hurries back to the bar to order. As he gets the bartender's attention, he turns and sees that she is joined by a MAN who looks as if he stepped out of the pages of GQ. Together they walk away. Stung, Bud watches as the woman of his dreams disappears out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>

EXT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT (RAIN)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud and a DATE he's obviously just picked up, are struggling to be seen in a mass of people trying to get in the hottest new club in Manhattan. Bud easing forward along the ropes to a large BOUNCER who roughly pushes one of the bridge-and- tunnel kids back across the rope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe discreetly shows him $50 but they guy says: "No room!," humiliating him in front of his date. The bouncer shoving Bud aside as Gordon Gekko and KATE, his wife, and ENTOURAGE (ALEX, others) are shown through the ropes into the door. Bud says something to Gordon but it gets lost in the confusion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. 79TH STREET & BROADWAY - EARLY DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People pouring into the subway on the way to work. Bud rifles through the Financial Times he's just bought at the newsstand and finds the article he was looking for: BLUESTAR EXONERATED IN 1984 CRASH. He thrusts his fist in the air, victoriously...bounds down the subway stairs.
</DIRECTION>

INT. 21 CLUB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark mahagony wood, plush banquettes, a long oak bar. Bud enters the main dining room in a relatively outre suit that hangs on him embarrassingly as other businessmen in well-cut suits move around him and a Maitre d' sniffs, then leads him to where Gekko is parked, finishing up his lunch. A half finished plate is removed to make way for Bud.

The check is for $500,000.

	Cover the Bluestar buy and put a couple hundred thou in one of those bow-wow stocks you mentioned. Pick the dog with the least fleas. Use a stop loss so your downside is 50,000, and buy yourself a decent suit. You can't come in here looking like that.

	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
Confused, Bud watches Gekko walk out of the room, pumping extended hands left and right. He holds the cashiers check up to his eyes, entranced by it, like a kid with his first dollar...as the raw steak tartare with an egg on top is put in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud is at his computer when the door bell rings. He's not expecting a visitor. When he opens the door he is knocked for a loop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A smashing looking LADY in a fitted Chanel suit, ropes of chains, short tight skirt, beautiful long legs, is standing there. Taking in the apartment, she hides her distaste.
</DIRECTION>

Bud in the back seat next to Lisa, gazes out the black tinted window as they drive away, then turns to her as she gives him a bottle of Champagne to open.

Bud on the phone, gazing at the ticker, concern in his eyes. CLICKING of the tape ticker comes up over the music. He looks at Marv.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIPE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later. Research reports piling up. Bud's secretary trying to get his attention. Bud's concern growing, as the green fluorescent numbers spit across the board. CLICKER growing louder. Pan to Marvin, hands cupped in prayer. To Dan Steeples who closes his eyes and shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIPE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close. Bud watching the tape -- dizzying, hypnotic blur of numbers. The roar of the clicker, drowning out the music...a runaway freight train.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIPE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud's hands clamped over his eyes. The numbers stop. Noise recedes. He opens his eyes, looks down at his desk, stacked with reports and phone messages, as the pool secretary, GINA, calls out. Marvin glumly coasts over in his chair.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
Meant paternally or sadistically, it's hard to tell. Gekko hits the ball, a big fat shot. Bud returns, Gekka moves him around the court, as if punishing him, the kid exhausted but the ball's never quite out of reach -- till Bud finally can't take it anymore and at the end of his breath, smashes into the wall and collapses. Gekko laughs. Bud lying there like a sad dog as Gekka hauls him up.
</DIRECTION>
<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The public is out there throwing darts at a board, sport. I don't throw darts at a board. I only bet sure things. Read Sun Tzu's "The Art of War." 'every battle is won before it is ever fought.' Think about it.

Buddy is slumped on a bench after taking a shower, drinking a Coke. Gekko towelling himself down, getting dressed...naked man constantly stopping by to greet him. Hi Fred, hi Barry, how's the wife...still living in Larchmont? Yeah, still commuting... y'ever do anything with that Aetna Gas deal...nah...fishing for information, for a possible drink or meeting but Gekko stonewalls them all...
</DIRECTION>
<GEKKO>

	You're not as smart as I thought you were, Buddy boy, Listen hard -- don't count on Graham and Dodd to make you a fortune, everybody in the market knows the theory, ever wonder why fund managers can't beat the S&P 500? 'Cause they're sheep -- and the sheep get slaughtered. I been in the business since '69. Most of these high paid MBAs from Harvard never make it. You need a system, discipline, good people, no deal junkies, no toreadores, the deal flow burns most people out by 35. Give me PSHs -- poor, smart and hungry. And no feelings. You don't win 'em all, you don't love 'em all, you keep on fighting, and if you need a friend, get a dog, it's trench warfare out there sport...

Cruising up Park Avenue. A panel slides open next to the bar with a portable computer on it. A television is turned on to the evening news, a low hum of voices.

</BUD>
<GEKKO>

And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing.

The Doorman rushes to open the door under the canopy as a tall strong man in his fifties emerges with a LAWYER TYPE and a FEMALE EXECUTIVE.

Company floor traders are jammed into a narrow booth, frantically takinq orders over phones and telex machines.

The FLOOR MANAGER gives the ticket to a RUNNER, a young man wearing worn sneakers, who dashes off. We follow him across the scruffy Exchange Floor, as he weaves through a crush of traders crammed around horseshoe-shaped kiosks, cathode-ray tubes slung above them, displaying the latest prices in bright, green letters and numbers. Intermittent shrieks and howls, calls to buy and sell, issue from the far reaches of the labyrinthian room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As in the final leg of a relay race, the RUNNER hands the ticket off to a COMPANY TRADER, who is buying and selling at the post where Anacott Steel is traded. The TRADER checks the ticket and turns to the SPECIALIST, executing the order.

	Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...

We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...

Exhausted from the drive back, Bud takes off his sweater and tie and collapses onto the bed, closing his eyes. The phone rings. With a start he wakes and answers it.

EXT. GEKKO'S BEACH HOUSE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sky is still dark, the first rays of light coming up over the ocean. Gekko, a lonely figure in a windbreaker, restlessly prowls the edge of the beach, waves crashing around him. He's been up all night and has an exhausted, driven look as he whispers over the wind into the cellular phone...
</DIRECTION>
<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out.

	You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien.

</DIRECTION>

A SECRETARY leads Bud into the plush, private office of a cocky young lawyer, ROGER BARNES, about tho same age as Bud, his his feet up on the desk, sleepily waving to Buddy to park his ass... The pictures an his walls and desk indicate a rich family.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ROGER BARNES' OFFICE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They walk out past the CLEANING CREWS coming in for the evening, drones of the vacuum cleaners...

Bud looks - his POV... A CLEANING WOMAN as she pulls the vacuum cleaner into one of the senior partners offices, the desk crammed with proposals, Bud is lost in thought.

EXT. BARNES' OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Bud comes out of the building and starts walking away. As he passes the freight entrance, Bud abruptly notices a van marked MARSALA MAINTENENCE COMPANY. He looks back, thinks for a moment: a look in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LONG ISLAND CITY - LIGHT INDUSTRIAL PARK - DAY

Bud walks past a row of small warehouses and enters one.

INT. MARSALA MAINTENANCE OFFICE AND GARAGE SERVICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He steps into a shabby reception area. A chain-smoking OLD LADY looks up from the switch-board.

The owner, a GREEK with bushy mustache and hardened face, sits at his desk eating lunch, eyeing Bud suspiciously.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Panos, I've charted the growth of new office space in the city, and I think you're in the right business at the right time.

<PANOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for telling me what I already know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANOS>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm impressed with your work and I could use a tax break. This is a growing business. Are you interested in some working capital and a partner?

</BUD>

Panos puts down his sandwich, measuring Bud.
</DIRECTION>
<PANOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What makes you think I need a partner?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANOS>
<DIRECTION>
Bud smiles, ready with his spiel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An elevator opens. A body steps out. A set of keys. Boom up past a clipboard and pen to a shirt pocket with MARSALA MAINTENANCE written on it, up to Bud dressed in janitorial clothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move with him to the CREW SUPERVISOR who introduces THREE CLEANING WOMEN who nervously absorb Bud, worried for their jobs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud strolls from office to office, looking official, overseeing his crew, making notations on a checklist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud slips into the Senior Partners' office, thumbs through a calendar on the desk. Sees the list of people, moves to the computer, punches the client's name in. The code number comes up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud nods to a SECURITY GUARD down the hall and enters the file room where he looks at the Cleaning Lady and points to his watch. As she exits, he scrambles nervously through the files -- finds the code number -- then anxiously flips the pages to the critical tender offer document -- with the target name -- INVESTMENT IN RORKER ELECTRONICS CORP. It's stamped "DRAFT" across the page. His face lights up. The secret to the kingdom. He puts it back, exits.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Bud and Alex, Gekko's assistant, having lunch. Alex gives him the briefcase he's carrying. Pan from Alex to Bud back to discover Darien in the next scene.

Gekko, Kate, Bud, Darien and A FIFTH PERSON roar over the dunes, each in their own dune buggy, laughing and hollering at one another...

Buddy driving right up precariously close on Darien, who screams... Buddy flips over his vehicle... comes up laughing... we sense he is getting wilder now...

EXT. POOL AND PATIO - GEKKO'S BRIDGEHAMPTON HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're finishing lunch by the pool framed by a lush flower garden where Kate and son Rudy play. HAROLD SALT, Gekko's chief lawyer, thick glasses, smart eyes and bags of worry that could only come from watching other people's money, looks very city-like in his clothing, examining his paperwork before passing it to Bud, who is the picture of relaxation.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	...this gives you limited power of attorney for Mr. Gekko's account. Every trade you make is at your discretion. Every ticket you buy must be marked "power of attorney." That means you call the shots and Mr. Gekko has no official knowledge of what stocks you're buying. Sign here and here...

EXT. BEACHFRONT - DAY

The camera glides off some FISHERMEN hauling their catch off their beached boat to Darien who comes tromping out of the surf, water glistening off her lean athletic body. Bud stands before her, cool seductive eyes, holding out a towel. She steps up to him and smiles inscrutably. Takes the towel from him, drying herself, instead.

INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The annual Teldar Paper stockholders' meeting is in session: 400 stockholders are there -- many middle aged and older, one bag lady. Cromwell sits on an elevated platform at the front of the room surrounded by an army of bulky EXECUTIVES, none of them weighing less than 200 pounds, ACCOUNTANTS and LAWYERS. Gekko in contrast seems like Robin Hood seated with Alex, Harold, Bud and the other stockholders. Cromwell is delivering his prepared attack on Gekko in a highly sarcastic, gruff manner.
</DIRECTION>
<CROMWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Your company, ladies and gentlemen, is under siege from Gordon Gekko. Teldar Paper is now leveraged to the hilt, like some piss poor South American country...instead of using our cash to build plants, build our business, all this man really wants is to get paid to withdraw his tender offer and that will cost us approximately another $200 million in greenmail which will be passed on to the consumer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROMWELL>
<DIRECTION>
Gekko seething, jumps up.
</DIRECTION>
<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where do you get off speaking about me like that, making remarks to the press, I resent these remarks, I demand the right to speak.

	Sit down, sir, you're out of order, haven't you done enough damage to Teldar as it is?...have you no sense of decency?

(to shareholders)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can your management...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROMWELL>
<DIRECTION>
Gekko is urged to sit down by his people but we hear various catcalls, "Let the man speak!" "Sit down, Gekko!"
</DIRECTION>
<CROMWELL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...concentrate on long term growth when we're busy fighting the get- rich-quick, short term profit, slot machine mentality of Wall Street when we should be fighting Japan! The original fundamental reason for Wall Street was to capitalize American business, underwrite new business, build companies, build America. The "deal" has now succeeded goods and services as America's gross national product and in the process, we are undermining our foundation. This cancer is called "greed". Greed and speculation have replaced long-term investment. Corporations are being taken apart like erector sets, without any consideration of the public good. I strongly recommend you to see through Mr. Gekko's shameless intention here to strip this company and severely penalize the stockholders. I strongly recommend you to reject his tender by voting for management's restructuring of the stock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROMWELL>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

Gekko is now at floor level with a microphone. He's calmer, makes his pitch to the stockholders, looking up at the management.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...well ladies and gentlemen, we're not here to indulge in fantasies, but in political and economic reality. America has become a second rate power. Our trade deficit and fiscal deficit are at nightmare proportions. In the days of the 'free market' when our country was a top industrial power, there was accountability to the shareholders. The Carnegies, the Mellons, the man who built this industrial empire, made sure of it because it was their money at stake. Today management has no stake in the company. Altogether these guys sitting up there own a total of less than 3% and where does Mr. Cromwell put his million dollar salary? Certainly not in Teldar stock, he owns less than 1%. You own Teldar Paper, the stockholders, and you are being royally screwed over by these bureaucrats with their steak lunches, golf and hunting trips, corporate jets, and golden parachutes! Teldar Paper has 33 different vice presidents each earning over $200,000 a year. I spent two months analyzing what these guys did and I still can't figure it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a big laugh)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cromwell is pissed.
</DIRECTION>
<CROMWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is an outrage Gekko! You're full of shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROMWELL>
<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One thing I do know is this paper company lost $110 million last year, and I'd bet half of that is in the paperwork going back and forth between all the vice presidents...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(increased laughter, he's getting them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The new law of evolution in corporate America seems to be 'survival of the unfittest'. Well in my book, you either do it right or you get eliminated. Teldar Paper is doomed to fail. Its diversification into casualty insurance has not worked. Its crown jewels are its trees, the rest is dross. Through wars, depressions, inflations and deterioration of paper money, trees have always kept their value, but Teldar is chopping them all down. Forests are perishable, forest rights are as important as human rights to this planet, and all the illusory Maginot lines, scorched earth tactics, proxy fights, poison pills, etc. that Mr. Cromwell is going to come up with to prevent people like me from buying Teldar Paper are doomed to fail because the bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, as you very well know, is the only way to stay strong is to create value, that's why you buy stock, to have it go up. If there's any other reason, I've never hear it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all I'm saying...it's you people who own this company, not them, they work for you and they've done a lousy job of it. Get rid of them fast, before you all get sick and die. I may be an opportunist, but if these clowns did a better job, I'd be out of work. In the last seven deals I've been in, there were 2.3 million stockholders that actually made a pretax profit of $12 billion. When I bought the Ixtlan Corporation it was in the exact same position Teldar is today -- I turned three of its companies private and I sold four others -- and each of these companies, liberated from the suffering conglomerate has prospered. I am not a destroyer of companies, I am a liberator of them. The point is, ladies and gentlemen, greed is good. Greed works, greed is right. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed in all its forms, greed for life, money, love, knowledge, has marked the upward surge of mankind -- and greed, mark my words -- will save not only Teldar Paper but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA...Thank you.

INTERIOR DECORATING MONTAGE

<DIRECTION>
The music is geared to speed, money, triumph and just plain material fun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY/NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In its first stage, Darien supervising. It's expanse of white walls devoid of mouldings, a blank plaster canvas. The city views are great, the apartment identical to hundreds of other cookie cutter condos. Several young artists are working on a neo-classical mural on the long side of the living room. They are colorfully dressed, listening to a TALKING HEADS tape while they work. A carpenter who looks like a member of Duran Duran is installing a pair of old columns from Urban Archaeology on either side of the entrance to the living room while another fits a brass sink into an antique sideboard which has been turned into a bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY/NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR DECORATING MONTAGE - SECOND STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Living room furniture arrives. A fantail shrimp chaise from Art Furniture's "Sushi Collection" arrives, along with an enormous sofa encased in an ecru linen slipcover made deliberately baggy and tied on with rows of self bows on each end, several faux Etruscan pots wired up as lamps, a poured concrete coffee table that looks like it came from Pompeii, and a hand-painted floor cloth instead of a rug for the bleached floor with the stencilled border... Darien sitting in a fantastical adirondack chair made from gnarled branches, amused by Bud's reactions to the furniture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THIRD STAGE. The kitchen has the latest compact computer dishwasher and compact microwave, garbage compactor, and sinks with infrared controls... A brief food montage gives us a sense of the modernist approach to food and its preparation:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1) Darien hones the knives on the electric knife sharpener as
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
2) Bud uses a stainless steel Cape Cod oyster opener to work on two dozen oysters...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
3) at the same time working on the automatic vinaigrette mixer, the phone ringing to the tune of Mozart's "Jupiter"...
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(picking it up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...no...at 37 1/2. Convert the bonds right...and check the price in Tokyo at 8:00 LA time. Thanks...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
4) As he starts his pasta sauce flame an his O'Reilly fat- free grill with a flexible neck fire starter...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
5) A freshly heated roll pops out of a hanging space-saving toaster, as Darien works the electric pasta maker while melting the frozen ice cream cartons in the microwave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
6) Bud manages to sneak a kiss an her lips humming the bars from Verdi's "Rigoletto" as he works the piece de la resistance--the automatic sushi maker...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
7) Dinner is finally served on a demolished dinner table. Red wine, pasta, sushi...it looks perfect, lit by candlelight, the view of the city below.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...isn't it perfect!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARIEN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it.

<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOURTH STAGE - INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud goes over a stack of bills with something approaching concern as the gothic oak refectory table which seats 20 is carried in, followed by a Jean Michel Basquiat featuring a skull on a rough board. Darien instructs the movers to place an important pair of satinwood Art Deco armchairs upholstered in buttery suede (last Saturday's auction purchase for $20,000) at either end of the titanic sofa. No vestige is left of the cookie cutter space we first saw. Walls have been removed, mouldings and architectural found objects added, imitation rare woods, marbles and frescos have been created from nothing by the magic hands of the tromp l'oeil crew. The point is, decorating can transform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONDO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The look of the place is evocative of ancient times, yet sumptuous. Darien and Bud sink into the bales of down in the sofa and are dwarfed. She rests her head on a hand stencilled velvet Venetian throw pillow, looking like a Pre-Raphaelite madonna. A terracotta pot with a spray of white phaleonopsis graces the coffee table. As the sun sets over the canyons of highrises, Bud walks around his new home totally in awe. This apartment, perfect in its restrained taste with all the "correct" flowers and objects, has nothing to do with him. Perhaps he can understand the state-of-the-art kitchen, the computerized telephone, stereo and light system, but he needs a set of instructions just to be able to switch on David Letterman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This apartment is Darien's fantasy, and Bud is merely the incidental client who paid for it. Most importantly to her, it is ready to be photographed by House and Garden.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(dubiously looking at

	You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DARIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARIEN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable.

</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
As he nuzzles her neck, she feels threatened, stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARIEN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.

</DARIEN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.

Bud walks out alone in his blue bathrobe on his parapet overlooking Central Park. The wind stirs his hair. The East and West sides of the park wrap the city in a diamond necklace of brilliant light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud stares down at the world. He has it all now. The money. The girl. The magic palace apartment. What more is there? Something...because Bud suddenly throws a wrenching dislocated look into himself that makes us wonder as he brushes his hand across his face and mutters to himself.

INT. GEKKO'S PRIVATE PLANE (GULFSTREAM - 4) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A salon interior. Gekko on a couch reading, with eyeglasses, a stack of financial reports. Alex is on the phone, Susan, and others accompanying the caravan on a business trip. Bud is excited.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Bluestar's an unpolished gem, Gordon, right out of the garbage. A half assed management being decimated by a price war they can't win. But the gates at LaGuardia alone can bail us out, it's worth 25 bucks a share if it's worth a dime! They're ripe to fall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Gekko, the poker player, hasn't seen enough cards.
</DIRECTION>
<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility...

<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(deadly serious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
(to Susan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.

<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(playing out his ace)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...

Bud, in high gear, all smiles, expensive Armani suit, opens the door. His father stands before him, looking like a man on his way to the dentist.

	Dad, well come on in. Everybody's here. We couldn't start the show without you.

	Listen, I hope you'll come here often, and under less formal circumstances.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARIEN>
<DIRECTION>
Halfway won over Carl enters the living room where Darien has set up a table with miniature gourmet pizza, etc. The atmosphere is strained, the camps separated. Gekko stands by the bar, conferring with his lawyer, Harold Salt. Darien walks over to the couch with drinks for the Ixtax Union Reps: DUNCAN WILMORE, ALPA Leader, a rugged silver-haired uniformed pilot; TONI CARPENTER, AFA Rep, hard looking, 40ish flight attendant.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...
	</DIALOGUE>

<BUD>

	And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
Carl stares at Gekko, sizing him up.
</DIRECTION>
<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd be proud to have a son like Bud. He's got a great future ahead of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
Carl looks to his fellow union representatives, then to Gekko.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
<DIRECTION>

</GEKKO>
<HAROLD>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course...

Salt gathers his jacket to leave, as Gekko and Carl eye one another, tentatively.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...please help yourselves to some food...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARIEN>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The food is half consumed. Gekko addresses the union leaders.
</DIRECTION>
<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I have no illusions about winning a popularity contest with any of you. I was roasted the other night, and a friend of mine asked-- why are we honoring this man--have we run out of human beings?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
His joke breaks the ice; they laugh, except for Carl.
</DIRECTION>
<GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not always the most popular guy who gets the job done. You got losses of 20 to 30 million dollars, dividends cut to zero, you're getting squeezed to death by the majors. Present management may not be the worst scum of the earth, but they're the ones who've put you on a kamikaze course, and pretty soon everybody's going to be scrambling for the parachutes. Only there aren't enough to go around. Management has them. You don't. If they throw Bluestar into Chapter 11--which I think they will--then they can use bankruptcy laws to break your unions and your contracts and throw you guys off the property.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a loud crunching sound as Bud's father bites into a roll, glaring at Gekko.
</DIRECTION>
<WILMORE>
<DIRECTION>
(pilot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILMORE>
<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
Carl drops his fork on the plate. Gekko goes on.
</DIRECTION>
<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And seven more hours a month.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
Toni Carpenter and Duncan Wilmore exchange questionable looks.
</DIRECTION>
<CARPENTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of time frame are we talking about here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARPENTER>
<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me a year. If we're still losing money, the reductions stand. If however, we move into the black, I return part of the givebacks, salaries go back to present levels, and...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	we institute an employee profit sharing program with stock. You'll own part of the airline.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
Carpenter and Wilmore react with surprise, it's obvious they weren't expecting the profit sharing part. Bud smiles at Darien and looks to his father, who examines a sushi roll before putting it back.
</DIRECTION>
<WILMORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you prepared to put that in writing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILMORE>
<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<CARPENTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your marketing strategy? How do you plan to return us to profitability?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARPENTER>
<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't I give Bud an opportunity to answer that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
Darien and Carl turn to Bud, who puts down his wine glass.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BUD Thank you Mr. Gekko. First of all I want you to know my door will always be open to you cause I know from my Dad it's you guys that keep Bluestar flying. One -- Modernize. Our computer software is weak, we update it, we squeeze every dollar out of each seat and mile flown. You don't sell a seat to a guy for $89 when he's willing to pay $389. Effective inventory management through computerization will increase our load factor by 5 to 20%, that translates to approximately 50 to 200 million dollars in revenues; the point is, we can beat the majors at a price war. Two -- Advertising -- more, more, and aggressive, attack the majors. Three -- expand our hubs to Atlanta, North Carolina and Dallas, reorganize all our feeder schedules, think Big -- guys, we're going after the majors!

The men are visibly shaken by Bud's determination.

Gekko looks to Carl Fox who, putting down knife and fork, breaks his silence.

Bud tenses, looking at his father. Gekko ignores the innuendo and replies softly.

There is frozen silence at the table.

	Congratulations. You did a great job of embarrassing me in there-- not to mention yourself! Save the "workers of the world unite" speech for next time Dad, I heard it too much growing up. You're gonna get axed Dad, no two ways about it, you and the whole airline are going down the tubes, you hear me, just like Braniff, you don't have a chance in hell, and if it isn't Gekko it's gonna be some other killer.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smoky, coffee cups and food. THREE LAWYERS, TWO INVESTMENT BANKERS, THREE COMMERCIAL BANKERS, sleeves rolled up, ties askew. A blackboard with Bluestar's assets diagrammed. A combat mood in the room. Bud walking in, feels vaguely worried, something is not quite right.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys know the new chief of Bluestar... Bud Fox.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
They nod vaguely respectful but Bud's obviously a figure head to them, takes a seat off to the side. The bull-like INVESTMENT BANKER, Vietnam vet, in shirt and suspenders, is on the attack against the stuffier Commercial Bankers.
</DIRECTION>
<INVESTMENT_BANKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look guys, what's the problem, let's for the kill...Gekko's got 12% and climbing plus the unions are in his pocket for now, everybody on the street knows the stock's in play
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping voice: up 2 1/4 since the open)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	by next week the street's gonna own Bluestar and management won't be able to do anything but poison their own pill. Why are you guys dicking around? Is the bank financing in place or are we gonna have more and more meetings? Our firm's gonna guarantee 25% of the total debt structure in long-term junk bonds, now you guys either sign this piece of paper right now or we're gonna pull and head for another bank for the 75...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INVESTMENT_BANKER>
<COMMERCIAL_BANKER>
<DIRECTION>
(older man, appeasing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...look, we have 30 banks ready to participate in a 4 year revolving credit line but we have to have your assurance to pay back most of the loan in the first 6 months, and the only way...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMMERCIAL_BANKER>
<INVESTMENT_BANKER>
<DIRECTION>
(intermittently interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... 30 banks, isn't that wonderful...you got it, no problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INVESTMENT_BANKER>
<COMMERCIAL_BANKER>
<DIRECTION>
(insistent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and the only way we can see this happening is liquidating the hangars and the planes. Can you people guarantee that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMMERCIAL_BANKER>
<DIRECTION>
Bud freezes where he sits...it all comes crashing down in a milli-second on that word "liquidate" -- shock now spreading on Bud's face...
</DIRECTION>
<INVESTMENT_BANKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guaranteed! No sweat...we already got the Bleezburg brothers lined up to build condos where the hangars are, we can lay off the planes with Mexicana, who are dumb enough to buy 'em and Texas Air is drooling at my kneecaps to get the slots and the routes. What's the problem? it's done..
	</DIALOGUE>
</INVESTMENT_BANKER>
<ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
(passing a paper to the commercial banker)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the pricetag on the 737s, the gates, the hangars, the routes, we got it all nailed right down to the typewriters...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
Bud sits there numbly, a sickening feeling taking hold of him as the camera and music track and trap him tighter and tighter. The lawyers' voices distorting in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<INVESTMENT_BANKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...'course the beauty of it is the overfunded pension fund. Gekko gets the 75 million in there. Fifty million buys him the minimum annuities for 6,000 employees and he walks away with the rest. All in, he'll net 60 to 70 million. Not bad for a month's work.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Bud)

INT. NATALIE'S DESK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie is on the phone. Bud marches past her desk.
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, he wants to change that appointment to...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(cupping the receiver)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bud--you can't go in there. He's in a meeting!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<DIRECTION>
He ignores her and throws open Gekko's door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gekko is talking with the LAWYERS and BANKERS from the Bluestar deal, as Bud barges in.
</DIRECTION>
<GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
(looks up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, this can't wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Gekko stares at him with piercing eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you gentlemen excuse us for a few minutes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
The lawyers and bankers get up and discreetly leave the room. Gekko waits for them to go, turns back to Bud.
</DIRECTION>
<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Gekko is taken by surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you need to wreck this company?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
(hard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(loosening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
	</DIALOGUE>

<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much is enough Gordon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(picking one up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(crosses to Bud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Obviously...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
As he puts his arm around Bud, leading him to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(at the door, confused, drained)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<GEKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you with me Buddy?

He walks out the door, the misery he is in washing his brow.

(to Natalie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...be another minute, Natalie.
	</DIALOGUE>

As he crosses back to the coffee table and punches up a phone number.

<GEKKO>

	This is Gordon Gekko. Now...

Bud walks out, heading up the street, absent amid the scurrying mid-day hordes tearing up the street for the loot inside.

EXT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY

Darien approaches, carrying groceries, enters the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud is slumped on the couch, a spent bottle of tequila in front of him. Outside the twilight is quickening into night, shadows, scurrying across the unlit room.... for the first time we see him sucking on a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darien opens the door and freezes, surveying the living room. A broken vase on the carpet, a curtain ripped off a window, a painting upended, a chair overturned, selected but not frenzied damage...
</DIRECTION>
<DARIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bud?...What's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARIEN>
<DIRECTION>
She puts down the grocery bags, frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been played like a grand- piano--by the master, Gekko the Great...and today was the big crash. Liquidation sale. He's gonna carve Bluestar into little pieces and sell it all off...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Darien registering this, is picking up pieces of the broken vase.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARIEN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DARIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARIEN>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(evenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
She stops, lights a cigarette, growing concern.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARIEN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
She sighs...comes over, tries to shake some sense into him!
</DIRECTION>
<DARIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARIEN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DARIEN>
<DIRECTION>
(pointed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARIEN>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(getting the drift)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell's that supposed to mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Darien moves out from his approximate circle, wrestling with what she wants to say...until she turns and says it.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That if you make an enemy of Gordon Gekko, I won't be there to stand by you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARIEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bud is stunned...and hurt.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really mean that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(lashing out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DARIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARIEN>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(glaring at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm looking...and I sure don't like what I see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
She collects her things and walks to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fair enough...but it's not that simple, Bud. When I was down and had nothing, it was Gordon who helped me. He got me all my clients -- you among them...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(snaps her fingers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and he can take it away like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may find out one day -- that when you've had money and lost it, it's worse than never having had it at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARIEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bud steps across to her in a rage.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's bullshit! Step out that door, I'm changing the locks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the door saddened.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARIEN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the hell out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
She does. Bud stares at the closed door, mute, numb, totally devastated.... the loss is not just Darien, it is total... He looks at his face in the reflection of a wall mirror...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - DAY

Waiting for the elevator. Darien also looks at herself a beat in the hall mirror. She's crying. Then she steels herself and enters the elevator.

The same realtor, SYLVIe DRIMMER, who sold him the place, is back. The phone is ringing, unanswered...

	Save the rap, just sell it -- fast!

He's in his socks, unshaven, smoking, he looks like he's been on a bender for the weekend. The phone stops ringing. He turns and walks into the bedroom, slamming the door behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud walks in, a different, more serious look in his eye, purposeful. Past CAROLYN and JANET at the outer desk. They stop what they're doing and look up at him surprised.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blinds are drawn. His Dad lies there, tubes down his nose, hooked up to an IV unit and monitors. Bud comes over. Carl, glassy-eyed, significantly frailer, nods to him. It's obvious that more damage was done than Bud expected. Mom comes into the room with him, stands there.

He is on a roll, electric. As the price mounts and surpasses the two million dollar mark, Gekko rises and walks down the side aisle to the front, never taking his eyes away from the auctioneer. He stands agressively, arms akimbo, in a nose to nose confrontation.

(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
Bud looks away. Gekko's smile fades.
</DIRECTION>
<GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well let me cue you in: the ice is melting under your feet sport...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
Without warning, he grabs Buddy roughly by the lapels and lets out his inner rage with a series of smacks and slaps across his face.
</DIRECTION>
<GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think you could've gotten this far this fast with anybody else? You think you could be out there dicking somebody like Darien? No, you'd be cold calling dentists and widows to buy twenty shares of some dog stock! I took you in! A nobody! I opened doors for you!...I showed you how the system works!...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
Gekko slapping him harder and harder, Buddy staggering with the blows, saying nothing, not defending himself.
</DIRECTION>
<GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...the value of information! How you get it! Anacott Steel, Brant Resources, Transuniversal, Fulham Oil. And this is how you pay back, you cockroach! I gave you Darien, I gave you your manhood. I gave you everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
He backhands Bud across the face. Bud lies on the ground, spent, as is Gordon breathing hard. Bud gets to his knees, blood streaming from his nose, his suit muddied. Passersby look on, wondering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gekko seems to relent, the rage going into hurt, remorse. He hands Bud a handkerchief. Bud staunches the flow of blood from his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (softly, innocently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could've been one of the great ones Bud...I look at you and see myself...Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEKKO>
<DIRECTION>
Bud looks at Gordon, torn by mixed emotions: the bonds they share and the betrayal wrought.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes his head, thoughtfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. My Dad once told me, "money is something you need in case you don't die tomortow." I guess I realized I'm just Bud Fox. And as much as I wanted to be Gordon Gekko--I'll always be Bud Fox.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at Gordon, as if wanting to say more, but doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In long shot, Gordon stands alone as Bud walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TAVERN ON THE GREEN RESTAURANT - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DOORMAN looks askance. Bud, mud-splattered suit and bloody nose, walks straight past him thru the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several well-heeled DINERS look up from their haute cuisine, at the sight of Bud making his way toward the men's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tight on Bud, staring at his reflection in the mirror, as he unbuttons his shirt, revealing adhesive tape swathed across his chest. Camera paces back as he winces when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORRISSEY and AGOSTINI, the two investigators, rip the tape off his chest, retrieving a small tape recorder. Morrissey of the S.E.C. rewinds the cassette. We hear Gekko's voice being played back on the tape, the mention of their deals.
</DIRECTION>
<MORRISSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did the right thing, Bud.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORRISSEY>
<DIRECTION>
Bud looks searchingly in the mirror. Faint CLICKING NOISE comes up over the shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICKING of the Broad Tape grows LOUDER. Shots of Lou Mannheim, Lynch, Marv; silently looking up at the green fluorescent print-out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TAPE--THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TODAY ANNOUNCED CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST CORPORATE RAIDER GORDON GEKKO AND STOCK BROKER BUD FOX, FOR CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT SECURITIES FRAUD, TAX EVASION, VIOLATIONS OF SECURITY ACTS, AND MAIL FRAUD...
</DIRECTION>

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CARL FOX'S HOUSE - QUEENS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl, dressed in a suit and tie, sits at the dining table, finished breakfast plates in front of him, refilling his coffee cup. Mom clearing off the table, anxious...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Bud walks in, wearing a suit and tie. He looks tired, beaten, the eyes lifeless, in a dark mood.
</DIRECTION>
<MOM>
<DIRECTION>
(disapproving)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...don't wear that tie Buddy, it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<DIRECTION>
She cuts off on Bud's look.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another cup of coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<CARL>
<DIRECTION>
(checks his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess it's time to hit the road.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARL FOX'S SEDAN - LOWER MANHATTAN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driving towards the Federal Courtrooms in Lower Manhattan. Busy traffic all around.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
<DIRECTION>
(supportively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you told the truth, you gave the money back. All things considered-- in this cockamamie world--you're shooting par...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you helped save the airline and the people at the airline are gonna remember you for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...if I was you, I'd think about that Bluestar job Wildman's offered you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<CARL>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head, sober)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you can do it, Bud, once you set your mind to something, I believe you can do anything in the world...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<DIRECTION>
Bud stares ahead, registering it.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
<DIRECTION>
(nods, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...got any friends gonna be there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
As he pulls the car into the curb. The Federal Building, in approaching POV, looms large before them.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(looks around, ironic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like who? Who really wants to know a convicted felon...I don't even like myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Carl knows something Bud doesn't...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darien is standing there waiting as they approach the main entrance... Bud seeing her, suddenly stunned. His POV-- easing along the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, why don't you get out here and go in with your friend, I'll park the car. Try to be cool, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
A last look with his father.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CURBSIDE - FEDERAL BUILDING - LOWER MANHATTAN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud getting out...crossing to Darien. A pause.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIEN>
<DIRECTION>
(nervous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARIEN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DARIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARIEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bud looking at her, moves closer, longing and hope and happiness have returned to his dull eyes... and forgiveness, the greatest of all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They embrace. Bud will never know about her past, nor need he. The camera leaving them on a slanting, circular crane, lifting past the Federal Building to a panorama of Wall Street in all its icy magisterial splendor...and thus ends our tale.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
