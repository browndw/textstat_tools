The high desert -- absolutely silent -- a vast, hard land- scape stretching away to distant mountains. The silence is broken by hoof-beats.

:SC: EXT. EDGAR'S PLACE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a simple cabin dwarfed by a big, ramshackle barn. EDGAR DEEMS (60s), a weathered desert rat of a hermit, is walking his donkey around in circles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, rattling toward them down an endless dirt road, comes an old, sun-bleached Buick. It stops and out leans OLD FRED (70s) wearing a sweat-stained fedora. The two friends nod.

But, suddenly, we hear the donkey restlessly stomping its hooves and braying. Edgar turns, concerned. Now we hear an odd sound. Distant thunder? The wind? The donkey gets more and more frantic.

The barn shudders violently. Frightened birds explode from the eaves. Dust puffs from every old seam. Roof shingles rain down. Edgar stares in amazement.

Dust swirls through the air. But -- the barn in empty. No donkey. Now Edgar is hit by a ghastly stench. He staggers back, and covers his nose with a handkerchief. Then he sees, splattered across the walls -- blood!

:SC: EXT. CLIFFS - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun lights up spectacular sheer cliffs which plunge 1000 feet from a ruggedly beautiful high-desert plateau. At the top of the cliffs, silhouetted against the dawn, a lone cow- boy seems to gaze in deep contemplation at the sunrise. As we MOVE IN, we realize he's actually peeing over the cliff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is VALENTINE MCKEE (25). Smart and good looking, Val has nevertheless managed to underachieve brilliantly. He coasts through life, following the path of least resistance -- which has brought him to this dubious rustic existence on the edge of civilization. But lately he's beginning to wonder why he hasn't accomplished more in his 25 years.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As a few sleepy cows gaze at him, sleepy Val shuffles over to his battered old pickup truck. A hand-painted sign on the door reads: "V & E -- All Type's of Job's." Indeed, the pick-up bed is jumbled with tools and supplies for every conceivable odd job -- and the noisily snoring form of his partner huddled in a dirty sleeping bag. Val raps on the side of the truck.

	Good morning, Mr. Bassett, this is your wake-up call. Please move your fat ass.

No response from the sleeping bag. Val stares at the cows chewing their cud -- and perks up as he gets an idea. He gently steps onto the truck's running board, then suddenly starts jumping up and down as hard as he can, rocking the truck violently.

The sleeping bag tries to get up and run for it. It tumbles out of the back of the pickup. While Val laughs uproar- iously, EARL BASSET (43) claws his way out of the bag, looks around wildly, and finds himself staring at three motionless cows.

Earl is a good-ol' boy who has lived his life just like Val, drifting from job to job. He knows why he hasn't accom- plished anything, and often tries to impart his hard-won wisdom to Val, but the last thing the younger man wants is advice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Earl stretches. The men begin a silent ritual: Earl gropes through his pockets for a cigarette, but only finds a lighter. Meanwhile, Val digs in his pockets, coming up with cigarettes, but no lighter. Typical of these two, each guy always has half of what he needs. Eventually they sort it out, trading the necessary implements.

Earl raises his fist. This is The Challenge, and it instantly triggers the partners' conflict-resolution technique. They solve all disputes using the children's game of "scissors, rock, paper." Earl raises his fist in response. The game is played swiftly and silently -- one, two, three. On three, Val mimes "paper" (open hand. Earl mimes "scissors" (two extended fingers). Scissors cuts paper. Val has lost. He shrugs and starts pumping up the stove fuel tank.

Val guides the truck down a tortuous, rocky, almost impas- sable trail. It takes full concentration as he fights the steering wheel, shifts, rides the brake and leans out trying to pick a decent route. Earl braces his feet on the dash and munches breakfast, a raw hot dog right out of the package.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON a stencilled sign: PHAM VAN'S U-RENT -- CESSPOOL, SEPTIC TANKS. PULL OUT to see Val and Earl have rented a portable septic pump (perhaps trailer mounted). The aged machine reeks of and drips with its ignoble cargo. The intake hose has been repaired so often it looks to be more tape than hose. Grimacing Val threads the slimy hose down through the open top of Viola's cesspool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beside them is Viola's well-kept mobile home on a low hill not far from Pham Van's store. Well-kept flower gardens surround the place. VIOLA, a sweet little old lady, watches the men work while straining to hold the leash of her tiny but ferocious dog. The dog yaps continuously, lunging at Val and Earl.

Carmine goes back to work, pounding the asphalt with the jackhammer. Suddenly the blade strikes something beneath the road, something soft. We hear a strange, unearthly shriek from underground. A weird orange goo gushes up around the blade. Then the jackhammer takes off by itself like a harpoon stuck in a whale! Carmine gets tangled in the jack- hammer's air-hose and is dragged along, shouting for help.

But now there is only silence. Howard crashes through the brush. All he finds is the torn end of the air-hose -- which suddenly sucks down into the ground. He's momentarily staggered by an awful smell, but forces himself to keep looking. He lets the pry-bar drag on the ground. Then something -- it looks like a mouth or a horrid beak -- shoots out of the ground and grips the pry-bar with uncanny strength! Howard drops his weapon and scrambles madly away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He clambers back onto the road. But almost immediately cracks form in the pavement around him. More beak-things break through the asphalt between him and his truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He dashes across the road, scrambling up the embankment. He clings precariously to a tree root, looking down -- where'd they go? Suddenly the dirt around him begins to "bubble." Several hungry beaks break through and grab him, yanking him head first into the embankment. Then the embankment gives way, crashing down onto the road, taking with it a nearby telephone pole and snapping the lines.

As we MOVE CLOSER, we see the floodlight is powered by a small, softly purring generator set maybe fifty feet away.

Suddenly, about ten feet away -- WHOOMP!! The generator shoots up out of the ground! Jim and Megan dive for cover as it sails through the air, and crashes to earth. They stare, transfixed. The generator is dented and bent almost beyond recognition -- and covered with oozing slime.

He struggles wildly, but just sinks further down! Megan slides a 2X4 over to Jim. He grabs it like a drowning man, trying to keep himself from being pulled down. But he's pulled with suck power the 2X4 snaps!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His head is going under. Megan desperately tries to dig the smothering earth away, but she's losing. Now only his arms are above ground. She pulls with all her might, but he sinks inexorably down, down. She's pulled flat on the ground. He's gone.

The next instant, a vicious hook-tentacle erupts through the earth, missing Megan's face by inches. She scrambles back frantically.

LOW CAMERA pursues Megan toward the car, just missing her as she dives in through the open tailgate. She slams it after her. The talons rake across the car, scratching the glass.

Megan tumbles into the front seat. Thank God the keys are in the ignition. She starts the engine. But outside the "snake things" attack the car in a frenzy, slashing blindly. A rear tire is totally shredded just as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Megan floors it. The car lurches forward but the mutilated tire falls apart. The wheel rim digs into the loose earth and the car is stuck. With no other recourse, Megan locks the door, rolls up the windows and cowers in the middle of the car, panting, sobbing. The radio is still playing a happy cowboy tune. She peeks out. They gave up? She's safe? Nothing happens for a moment, then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car starts to shake and shudder! Dust wells up around the windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside we see a bizarre sight. The earth around the rear of the car is "boiling," dirt flying in all directions -- and the car starts to sink into the ground!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Megan wildly honks the horn! The car looks just like a ship going down by the stern, hood tilting up gracefully. The back windows shatter, dirt pouring in! Megan smashes the windshield with a small fire extinguisher and scrambles out on the hood. But there's no hope. The car keeps sinking, titling now almost ninety degrees, forcing her onto a precarious perch on the grille -- sinking, sinking.

Out of her mind with terror, she keeps softly murmuring the same hopeless phrases:

Val and Earl are riding at full gallop. They race alongside a concrete-lined flood-control ditch and veer off to follow a barbed wire fence which crosses the ditch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DESERT - BARBED WIRE FENCE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They ride along the fence during:
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's the plan...We don't even stop. Ride like hell. Tonight we keep right on going. We'll walk the horses.
	</DIALOGUE>

<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is the plan...I mean, goddamn it! What the hell are those things? How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?

</VAL>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would they do it?

<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the horses stop short. In a frenzy they wheel around, rear up, refusing to go on. The cowboys fight to control them.
</DIRECTION>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew it! Pham Van wouldn't know a decent horse if...!

</VAL>
<DIRECTION>
But Earl's already drawing his rifle.

<VAL>

He draws his rifle. They look wildly in all directions at once -- but there's nothing, only empty desert.
</DIRECTION>
<VAL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I don't see anything!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<DIRECTION>
They keep staring. The horses keep pacing nervously. Then -- Earl's horse rears wildly and falls! Earl goes flying. Val wheels around wildly, dismounts and runs to Earl, who's bruised and winded but basically unhurt. They think Earl's horse just tripped.
</DIRECTION>
<VAL>

<DIRECTION>
(turning to the horse)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the hor...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>

Their eyes bulge. Several "snake things" have engulfed the horse's head, sucking, crushing, slurping. Val's horse goes berserk and gallops for the horizon.

<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's how they get you! They're under the goddamn ground!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly they realize what that means -- the thing could come up under them!! The cowboys scramble frantically away. But nothing pursues them. They pause, glancing back nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sons of bitches!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<DIRECTION>
Val raises his rifle and takes a well-aimed shot, hitting one of them. Orange goo spurts out. We hear a deafening shriek as all the "snake things" instantly zip back underground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then -- A HUGE MOUND OF EARTH RISES UP UNDER VAL AND EARL!! The cowboys tumble down its side, Val losing his rifle. They roll over and stare dumbfounded at the mound.
</DIRECTION>
<VAL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (gasps)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There must be a million of them!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<DIRECTION>
The mound of earth turns toward them. The ground splits open and out rises -- a huge head!
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
<DIRECTION>
(awestruck)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope...just one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
The monster is a horrendous thirty-foot long eating machine! Its head is eyeless, utterly alien, covered with tough boney plates which close together to form a cork-screw point.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cowboys stumble back toward the fence in speechless terror. The creature slides toward them, pushing through the earth like a whale through water. Now it opens its mouth -- but it's like a grotesque flower, boney plates spreading open like petals, revealing a huge, slimy, fleshy, oozing orifice! And inside the mouth, a ghastly multi-tentacled tongue! These are the "snake things," not snakes at all but actually the horrid hook-tentacles that can shoot out six feet to snag their prey!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The monster snorts and snuffs, throwing up plumes of dust, sounding like a horrendous pig. It sinks into the earth and charges! We see the hump of earth move toward them faster and faster but then it disappears as the creature goes deeper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Val and Earl leap sideways and run along the fence. The creature goes straight and slams into a fencepost from below. All we see is the fencepost knocked at a crazy angle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cowboys keep running. The creature regroups and charges after them, hitting each fencepost in turn, sending weird sinuous shock waves along the barbed wire, making almost musical twanging sounds. Val looks back.
</DIRECTION>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gaining on us!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<DIRECTION>
And as if that weren't enough, Earl points to more trouble ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CONCRETE DITCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fence runs straight to the edge of the ditch, an eight foot wide gap yawning dead ahead. The creature churns like a locomotive from behind. They'll have to try to jump! They strain desperately for every last fraction of speed.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can do it, we can do it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
They leap and -- they don't do it!! They smack into the opposite side of the ditch, clawing frantically at the lip, only to tumble to its sloping bottom. A split second later the charging creature slams like a wrecking ball into the foot-thick concrete wall! The wall CRACKS AND BULGES OUT! A hook-tentacle flops out through one of the cracks! Terrified Val and Earl scramble away. But the wall holds together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the, strangely, all is quiet. The tentacle lays dead still. Eventually, the cowering cowboys dare to creep back a little closer, still panting, exhausted, jumpy.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stupid son of a bitch...knocked itself cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
And now orange slime begins to ooze through the cracks in the concrete.
</DIRECTION>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cold, my ass! It's dead! We killed the bastard!

	<DIALOGUE>
	You FUCKER!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<DIRECTION>
They allow themselves a small wheeze of nervous laughter, only to jump like rabbits as some pebbles rattle loudly down the concrete wall behind them. They whirl to see Rhonda, up on the opposite side of the ditch, staring down at them. She's lugging a bunch of her equipment, including a small folding shovel.
</DIRECTION>
<RHONDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, guys, how're you doing? Look, can I ask you something? Did you just notice something weird? Vibrations? You know, some kind of earth tremor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHONDA>
<DIRECTION>
Val and Earl look at each other, then burst out laughing. Rhonda spots the cracked wall.

</RHONDA>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CONCRETE DITCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shattered concrete has been pulled away to fully reveal the creature's horrendous head. Start CLOSE on it: oozing blood, slavering mouth plates hanging open, hook-tentacles lolling out. WIDEN to see Earl and Rhonda, sweating, dusty and tired, staring in awe and cringing at the stench.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(overwhelmed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is important, you know. This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century. The century? Forget it. History.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHONDA>
<DIRECTION>
We can hear a shovel digging up above, and now Val shouts:
</DIRECTION>
<VAL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got it! Here's the other end! Just look at what we caught here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<DIRECTION>
Earl and Rhonda climb up. CRANE UP with them to REVEAL the whole animal! Val, digging excitedly with Rhonda's shovel, is just scraping away the last loose dirt from the creature's tail. The whole length of the immense thirty foot beast is partially uncovered, in king-sized bas-relief.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
<DIRECTION>
(hushed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is one big mother!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<DIRECTION>
She nods, stepping down to study the creature. The body is stream-lined, cigar-shaped, maybe eight feet in diameter at its thickest. It's covered with hundreds of short, rear- pointing, retractable spikes. Rhonda gingerly jiggles one. It can be pushed in and out of its socket like a plunger.
</DIRECTION>
<RHONDA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It must push itself along with these. Hundreds of them pushing at once. That's how it can move so fast. I mean this thing was tripping sensors all over the valley. No wonder I couldn't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHONDA>
<DIRECTION>
A chilling thought stops her in mid-sentence. She springs down into the drainage ditch to get her backpack, pulling out her seismograph printouts. She studies them frantically during:
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of anything like this before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<VAL>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them. We just didn't tell you. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these! We're really in on something here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<DIRECTION>
The guys looks at each other. One thought immediately springs to their minds.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pham Van don't get his mitts on this for no measly fifteen bucks!

</EARL>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<DIRECTION>
While they bask in their fame-to-be, Rhonda continues to study the print-outs, coming to a terrifying conclusion.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naw, don't want to winch it. That'd tear it all up. Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<DIRECTION>
But Rhonda interrupts -- now really scared.
</DIRECTION>
<RHONDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, hey, shut up! The way I figure it. There are five more of these things!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHONDA>
<DIRECTION>
Val and Earl shut right up. Earl edges up a fencepost. Val sidles up onto a rock during:
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five more?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
Rhonda paws through her unwieldy printouts, pointing out jagged ink lines on the graphs, comparing different ones.
</DIRECTION>
<RHONDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, darn it, look. I've got seismographs all over the valley. If you compare the different readings, there have to be five. Here's one at two o'clock yesterday, but here's another one three miles away at the same time. So that's two. Now, here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHONDA>

The men leap from their perches and hustle her in the direction she came from.
</DIRECTION>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll take your word for it.

<RHONDA>

	The other side of that dome.

<DIRECTION>
She indicates what to most of us would be a hill, dotted with huge boulders thrusting out of the sandy desert soil like big mushrooms. The trio jogs toward the hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DESERT - SEISMOGRAPH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
En route to the truck, they pass near one of Rhonda's seismographs. Suddenly Earl stumbles as one leg drops knee- deep into the ground! He screams. Val wheels and bodily yanks him up. They back away from the small hole in the ground, calming a little as they realize:
</DIRECTION>

	Prairie dog burrow...

<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little sons of bitches.

Rhonda tenses as she hears a sound she knows well -- the soft scratching of the seismograph needle across its paper cylinder. She whacks Val on the shoulder and points speechlessly at it.

She doesn't have to explain. All three of them dash dash for:

:SC: EXT. BOULDER FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The remains of an old rail fence lay beside one of the boulders. Val, Earl, and Rhonda scramble over the wood, up onto the rock and stand there tensely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a moment, the creature gently rustles the earth at the base of the rock. The monster's slimy hook-tentacles slither out, searching the rock base. Shuddering, the humans move as high as they can, well out of reach. The tentacles slip back beneath the earth. Everyone breathes a sigh of relief.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, at least the bastard can't climb. Pardon my French.

Rhonda points. They can see the roof of her truck, maybe a hundred yards away through the boulders. Val and Earl think about it.

Val gets an idea. He grabs a post from the dilapidated fence and cautiously slips down near the boulder's edge.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch yourself! It's got a good six foot reach.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
Val nods. Dead silence as he reaches way out with the post and scrapes it on the ground. Almost instantly the creature roars up, grabbing the post in a flurry of flying dirt and lashing tentacles, nearly hooking Val's hand. Val practically falls over himself scrambling back to safety.

Rhonda stares at Val, impressed.

Val and Earl freeze in their tracks and glance at each other, realizing instantly what's up. Without a word they leap desperately in opposite directions.

The storage shed where Melvin is hiding. It sits in a vacant, weed-choked lot. Crashing through the weeds, Rhonda has almost reached the shed when she is suddenly brought up short and slams face down in a cloud of dust!

She can't get up!! Something's got her! She's caught in an old rusted barbed wire fence, lying almost flat, hidden in the weeds. Some strands have come loose and are curled up like vicious concertina wire.

Barely has she taken this in when -- the ground caves in under her! She rolls wildly to one side as hook-tentacles snake up, missing her by inches! She keeps rolling-crawling- scrambling -- anything to get away from the awful maw -- but gets her legs hopelessly tangled in the barbed wire. She freezes. The creature feels around where she was.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She calms herself, pulling gingerly at the wire, working tensely to free herself but --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature's mouth slams shut on the fence. Like a spider sensing something caught in its web, the monster knows it's on to something. Its hook-tentacles shoot forward to snare three feet of fence, then the creature lunges up and out, swallowing that three feet in a big "gulp" and yanking Rhonda violently toward it! She screams, pants ripped, legs slashed and bleeding! GULP! She's dragged even closer.

Rhonda is in a dead panic, thrashing helplessly in the barbed wire. The beast takes another gulp of fence, wrenching her within inches of a probing hook-tentacle! Suddenly we hear a nasty ROAR as Val's chain saw swings in, slicing the squirm- ing tentacle in half, spraying gore everywhere! The creature unleashes an unearthly shriek, and the other tentacles recoil. The severed one writhes like a beheaded snake.

Tentacles snake out to regain their grip on the fence. Val grabs the saw and starts slashing wildly, but this time the hook-tentacles snag it and wrench it from his grasp. It slams to the ground, motor dying. The monster readies itself for the lunge that will suck Rhonda in. Val grabs her under the arms and pulls. Rhonda wriggles wildly to get out of her wire enmeshed pants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature lunges! Rhonda pulls free! She and Val tumble backward. The creature gets only a mouthful of Rhonda's jeans.

Pham runs to the freezer. Its on/off switch is buried behind stacks of soft-drink cases. He tears at them like a madman, toppling them this way and that. Earl and Val join him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But right behind Pham, the floor BUCKLES UP, a monster's snout BURSTING THROUGH and engulfing one of his legs! The creature starts to back down into the jagged hole, dragging screaming Pham with it. Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Miguel grab Pham's arms but are no match for the monster. It shakes and spins him like some gigantic dog, effortlessly throwing them off, relentlessly pulling Pham down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hole in the floor is too small for Pham to fit through! As one leg goes down, the other is bent hideously backward. Pham screams and screams as jagged wood tears into him, bones snap, ribs crack. The others grab him again but are utterly helpless. With vicious, powerful jerks the creature yanks his man mangled body down. The last thing we see is his foot, now folded back past his head, and he's gone.

Val is wild with helpless anger.

The whole building shakes and shudders, dust powdering down from the ceiling. Flailing tentacles are everywhere, slashing open food packages; clouds of flour fill the air!

Earl leaps from the bar to the rear shelves. Val and Miguel slide sideways till they're beneath the hatch, then use the shelves as a ladder, climbing up to the hatch. Val pounds on it frantically.

In the middle of the store, Rhonda leaps from shelf to shelf, trying to get closer to where Val is. Soon she reaches the last one, balancing precariously. But a creature tips over the first one! The shelves topple like dominoes, crashing toward Rhonda. She is half catapulted, half jumps right through an open window, ripping through the screen.

Val sees what's happened. With maniacal strength he smashes open the hatch and climbs out onto --

Burt and Heather exchange looks. Has Val gone nuts? Then they hear a low RUMBLE, growing louder and louder. Tools hanging over the work bench start to shake; the decorative cow skulls on the wall rattle; the overhead lights sway -- and then -- everything stops. Dead silence, except for the humming of the case cleaner.

THEN THE WALL MOVES!! The wood paneling bulges slightly. Nails pop out. The wall is pushed again; the paneling cracks. A cow skull falls. Burt and Heather level their rifles and --

The gunfire is DEAFENING as Burt and Heather blast away. Globby blood spurts from a dozen wounds, and the creature pulls back a little. The couple keeps firing until magazines are empty. The creature lunges forward again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN with Burt and Heather to REVEAL a wall of the basement we haven't seen until now -- a wall covered with guns -- hand guns, long guns, riot guns, flare guns, antique guns, military guns, elephant guns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather grabs an HK-91 assault rifle, slams in two magazines, bottoms taped end to end, and opens fire! A hook-tentacle snags her boot, yanking her right off her feet. Burt pumps out eight devastating blasts from a twelve-gauge riot gun, severing the tentacle. Heather is on her feet in an instant. She expertly flops her double magazine over, loading the full one taped upside-down to it, and opens fire again. Burt grabs an AR-15 semi-auto and joins her. They lay down massive fire, virtually disappearing in muzzle flash and smoke. Ejected shell cases clatter and clang all around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guns are empty. THE CREATURE IS STILL COMING! They back down the wall, desperately grabbing weapons one after another: a lever-action, a magnum handgun, even a flare gun which Heather fires right into the creature's mouth. Shrieking in pain, the horrid thing thing KEEPS WRIGGLING TOWARD THEM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burt and Heather scramble up over a desk to keep something between them and it. Burt smashes open a fancy glass case holding a huge four-gauge elephant gun. He slams in two gigantic cartridges nearly an inch in diameter. He fires. The concussion literally shakes the building. The recoil slams Burt back against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The monster bullets tear monster holes in the monster. Great gouts of curdles blood spew from it -- Burt hit an artery or something. The beast convulses grotesquely, then collapses, deflating like a beached whale. Burt and Heather stagger together and hug each other fervently. They stare dumbfounded at the massive dead horror. Burt suddenly shouts vehemently:

Val has used heavy chains on the back of the bulldozer to jerry-rig a hitch to the semi trailer. Now he scrambles back into the driver's seat. He guns the engine, wrenching the old semi trailer from years of dried mud and tumbleweeds. Ancient tires disintegrate. Rusted wheels screech and complain -- but it moves. Val lets out a whoop and heads full-tilt for town. He's suddenly shocked as he sees:

Rhonda's in big trouble. She scrambles to the high side of the tower platform. The tower's going to tip over at any moment! It's roof slides off and crashes into the street!

On Pham Van's, Miguel and Earl are tearing apart the swamp cooler, throwing pieces of it off the roof, trying to distract the creatures, but they can't compete with the noise from the water.

In BG the bulldozer rumbles toward the tower at top speed -- an excruciatingly slow eight miles per hour.
</DIRECTION>

The tremendously heavy water tank suddenly tears loose, sliding off its platform, nearly carrying Rhonda with it. She ends up hanging from a cross beam as the water tank splatters like an enormous egg below, sending a small tidal wave down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The remains of the tower tilt crazily nearly forty-five degrees. The bulldozer grinds closer and closer. Rhonda tries to climb up, but the jostling and shuddering of the tower keeps her dangling precariously. Suddenly she falls!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And lands in the dirt. The creatures zero in on her! She turns wildly and leaps for the blade of the approaching bulldozer. The blade is only inches off the ground but Val swiftly raises it, lifting Rhonda high into the air just above the grasping tentacles!

As Rhonda climbs down into the cab, Val heads the bulldozer over to Pham Van's and stops.

Val and Rhonda watch this nervously as Earl and Miguel quickly clamber from the roof down into the protective steel belly of the semi trailer.

Val mentally crosses his fingers and sends the bulldozer roaring forward. It effortlessly tears loose from the tentacles, grinding one to pulp in its treads. The creature shrieks in pain. The humans cheer! At last they've got the upper hand!

Val is yanked off the bulldozer and lands with Nelvin on the roof!

The creature slams into the roof repeatedly, but the corrugated metal is both light and resilient. It bends, but the frustrated monster can't get enough "bite" to tear through it. Val and Melvin straddle the peak of the roof, trying desperately to hang on as it heaves up, buckling like a bronco.

Earl scrambles into the bulldozer driver's seat and heads after them at full throttle, the big diesel roaring.

:SC: EXT. JEEP TRAIL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bulldozer easily lumbers along the really rough road we saw Val and Earl's truck struggle over the other morning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they come closer we see Burt and Heather riding "shotgun," he sitting out in the bulldozer's scoop, she on the rear of the semi trailer, elephant guns at the ready. Val, Earl and Rhonda are in the cab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CLIFFS - DAY

<DIRECTION>
It's late afternoon, sun casting dramatic shadows across the beautiful desert. We are WIDE on the bizarre vehicle, resolutely grinding along not far from the cliffs, nearing the mountains ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DESERT - BULLDOZER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they scan the desert, the people are feeling like they may get out of this after all. Earl calls back to the people in the semi trailer.

As they top a gentle rise, Burt excitedly points ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<BURT>

Everyone cheers. But then Heather points up ahead to one side.

<DIRECTION>
Earl shoves the throttle all the way. The engine screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DESERT - DUSTCLOUD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We MOVE IN through the cloud of dust. Dirt is flying by the ton out of en eight foot diameter hole in the ground. A huge mound of the tunneled-out dirt is already piled high. The creatures are digging a tunnel -- but why?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DESERT - BULLDOZER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We watch the bulldozer rumbling along. It seems unstop- able. The mountains and safety are barely a mile away --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
when the EARTH CAVES IN!! THE BULLDOZER PLUNGES NOSE FIRST INTO AN UNSEEN PIT DUG JUST BENEATH THE SURFACE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The machine ends up half-buried at a steep angle. The semi trailer is right on the edge of the pit. Everyone is shaken, bruised, bloodied. Val, Earl and Rhonda look frantically for Burt, who was riding out front in the scoop. They're relieved to see him clawing his way out of pit. Val hauls him up and all four of them now leap into the semi trailer. As they come to rest, Val slowly realizes what's happened.
</DIRECTION>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They...they dug a trap! I can't believe this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<DIRECTION>
The idling bulldozer engine coughs and dies. There is a moment's crushing silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the dreaded digging begins. Dust boils up around the semi trailer -- creatures digging from below! The semi trailer shakes and shudders, slowly sinking. The people huddle together in sheer panic. Val and Earl grab the nearest of Burt and Heather's guns and fire wildly, hope- lessly, down at the dirt. Ricochets whine into the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burt grimly digs an overloaded knapsack for one of his pipe bombs. He leaps up between Val and Earl and lights the fuse, looking for a target.
</DIRECTION>
<BURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hungry?! Eat this!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT>

He tosses the bomb at some churning earth and dives back into the semi trailer.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep your heads down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT>
<DIRECTION>
KABOOM! The explosion throws up a big plume of dust and rocks. We hear a new, very strange sound of pain from the creatures. The semi trailer instantly stops shaking. The creatures have stopped digging. All is quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The people peer up over the edge of the semi trailer, looking all around. Then:

Heather unexpectedly fire two deafening blasts from her elephant gun at the approaching creatures, then shakes her head, frustrated. They're still coming.

As Burt readies another bomb, he pauses to hand bug-eyed Melvin a huge Ruger Super Redhawk 44 magnum handgun.
</DIRECTION>
<BURT>

</BURT>
<DIRECTION>
He hurls the bomb. Wait. Wait. WHOOOM! Again we hear the creatures' unearthly shriek of pain. Rhonda's on her feet before the rocks stop falling. She spots the creatures.

<RHONDA>

Earl lets out a war wild WHOOP. It's infectious. CRANE UP with them as everyone piles out of the semi trailer like soldiers out of a trench -- they charge across no-man's-land.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melvin runs like a demon. He tries to shoot at the first thing he sees but the gun just clicks over and over -- empty.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Burt, you bastard!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>

Enraged, he doubles his speed, trying to overtake Burt.

Mindy can't keep up. Nancy tries to pull her along. Val and Earl swoop in, grab Mindy under either arm, and carry her between them.

The ground heaves violently as the retreating monsters angrily wheel about and charge back after the humans.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DESERT - ROCK OUTCROP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Big slabs jutting this way and that -- a rock iceberg in a sand ocean. The people scramble onto it amid whoops of joy and relief. Melvin charges up to Burt:
</DIRECTION>
<MELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You asshole! There's no bullets in this gun!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVIN>
<BURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got you moving, didn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT>
<DIRECTION>
Burt's line gets a laugh from people, but then tentacles burst up on all sides of the rock, probing, feeling. The effect is instantly sobering. Burt swiftly grabs out his remaining bombs -- six of them -- and holds one ready. But they're in no immediate danger.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So...now what?
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

The hopelessness of the situation suddenly hits Val, Earl, and Rhonda. After a moment:
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...that's it. We're not getting off this rock...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>

As this sinks in, Burt loses his cool, igniting an argument.
</DIRECTION>
<BURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place! We had food, water...

There's a long, grim silence. Everyone sits glumly. Finally, Burt picks up a bomb and contemplates it:
</DIRECTION>
<BURT>
<DIRECTION>
(losing it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it comes to starvation, I know what I'm doing. Take one of these. Walk right out there with the fuse lit. Stuff it down my pants and let 'em take me down. BOOOOM!

Heather puts a soothing hand on his shoulder.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DESERT - ROCK OUTCROP - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the open desert, a rock lands. Then another. Val and Rhonda are throwing them from the rock outcrop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Burt have moved away from the main group to another section of the rock outcrop where intervening boulders will protect everyone from an explosion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Earl has tied a bomb to some nylon rope form one of Burt's knapsacks. Burt places the other bombs safely out of the way behind a ledge. Meanwhile, Val and Rhonda keep throwing rocks. Soon, the ground shifts.
</DIRECTION>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There! Right straight out in front of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<DIRECTION>
Burt has his coil of fuse.
</DIRECTION>
<BURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much you think?

</BURT>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know... They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
Burt nods, expertly eyeballing a fifteen second length and snipping it off. As he stuffs it into the bomb:
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is that, anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<BURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cannon fuse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>

</EARL>
<BURT>
<DIRECTION>
(matter of fact)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My cannon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT>
<DIRECTION>
The bomb is ready -- it's moment of truth. Earl digs in his pocket for the lighter -- but Val has it. Val nervously leans over to light the fuse, but then frowns as he sees how Earl is holding the rope.
</DIRECTION>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
Val shakes his head and lights the fuse. Earl whirls the bomb on the end of its rope like a lasso, and lets it fly out as far as he can. Then he starts pulling it back in along the ground like a fishing lure. Rhonda stares at her watch as they all sink down behind the protective boulder.
</DIRECTION>
<RHONDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on...come on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHONDA>
<BURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it...take the bait...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a snout subtly surfaces and gulps down the bomb. A tense two seconds later -- KABOOOM! Bullseye! It's a volcano of gory creature parts. They splatter all over! The remaining creatures shriek and race away again. The people cheer wildly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DESERT - ROCK OUTCROP - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Burt prepare to try again. This time Val has the rope and a new bomb. Rhonda stands by him, ready with the lighter. Earl lobs rocks out into the desert.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>

<RHONDA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope, there! That's one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHONDA>
<DIRECTION>
Rhonda shakily lights the fuse. Val heaves the bomb out and starts trolling. The creature swallows it. Everyone drops down behind the boulder, Val impulsively grabbing a second bomb. They tense with anticipatory glee -- but the creature suddenly spits its bomb back out! It sails back right over their heads. It strikes the rocks above them, skittering down a crevice and landing in -- BURT'S PILE OF BOMBS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Val, Earl, and Rhonda scatter. Burt dives backward over a rock ledge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BABABAMMM!! All the bombs explode, throwing rocks every- where. The creatures streak away. Val, Earl and Rhonda sprawl into the dirt, half stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the panic is over, Val and Earl realize where they are -- fifty yards out in open desert! So is Rhonda, off at an angle from them! Only Burt is safe on the rock outcrop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the creatures are coming back fast!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stranded trio starts back for the outcrop, but the creatures burst up ahead of them -- one blocking Rhonda's path, the other two cutting Val and Earl off! The creatures roar toward their easy prey!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Val and Earl freeze. The ground bulges as the creatures "skid" to a halt not ten feet from them. Rhonda stands stock still some fifty feet away, eyeing her own creature.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over on the outcrop with the main group of people Heather sizes up the situation.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make noise. Everybody! COME ON!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone starts hopping up and down, yelling, screaming, and clapping. Burt even runs a few feet out from the rocks, firing a pistol into the dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<BURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	COME ON, YOU SLIMEBAGS! OVER HERE! FRESH MEAT...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd keeps up the ruckus. The creatures are distracted by the noise, but this time they don't automatically go after it. Their big snouts turn uncertainly this way and that. But they just stay where they are. Their hook-tentacles slide out, feeling all around. Earl whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're not falling for it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
Heather takes careful aim with her elephant gun.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll make'em pay attention goddamnit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
But before she can fire, the creatures mysteriously sink from view. Val, Rhonda, and Earl remain frozen. What the hell is going on? Nothing happens -- then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HUGE HUMP OF EARTH suddenly wells up near Rhonda. It sinks back down as fast as it appeared. It's like the creature suddenly lifted its whole body almost to the surface then submerged again. Another hump rises and falls right near Val and Earl. There's a pause as the men whisper:
</DIRECTION>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're...they're trying to make us move!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or just knock us over. Look, use the bomb!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's out last one. We can't kill them all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<DIRECTION>
The creatures try another random "barrage" of humps, some coming perilously close. They know they'll eventually topple their prey. One comes so close to Val and Earl that pebbles roll down its sides into their boots!
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Use the fucking bomb!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.

<EARL>

(slowly; terrified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to live for the three days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
More humps rise and fall. Val gives in. He signals Rhonda, gesturing with the bomb. She understands. He'll set it off, driving away the creatures, and they'll all run back to the outcrop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Val digs for the lighter. Doesn't have it. Earl digs for it, too. But he doesn't have it either! They go dead pale. How can that be? They look across fifty feet of deadly open ground -- trembling Rhonda holds up the lighter!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over on the outcrop, Burt shouts:
</DIRECTION>
<BURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong? Use the bomb, for Godsake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT>
<DIRECTION>
Val signals to Rhonda to throw the lighter. She nods. But just before she does, A HUMP STARTS RISING DIRECTLY UNDER HER! She fights to keep her balance -- struggling to keep from taking that single step which will instantly tell the creatures where she is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But there's no hope. The hump jerks higher. Her boots slip down the gravelly side! Instantly the creature twists toward her, its hungry mouth erupting out of the dirt. She screams and dashes for Val and Earl. They run to meet her. The other creatures surface. The trio is cut off from the rock outcrop!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Val and Earl link up with Rhonda and they all run madly while Rhonda tries to light Val's bomb fuse. But suddenly Val yanks the bomb away.
</DIRECTION>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No wait! This way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>

He veers off in a new direction. Startled Earl and Rhonda have no choice but to follow. As they desperately try to catch up to Val:

Earl looks up ahead. They're headed right for --

The massive cliffs. Earl's eyes bug out. In seconds they'll be right at the brink with nowhere to run.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>

As they skid to a stop at the very brink, Val breaks off the bomb fuse, leaving only one inch of it. He whirls to check the progress of the advancing creatures.

He holds the bomb out to Rhonda. She instantly tries to light it. He grabs her wrist so hard it hurts.

The charging creatures are almost underfoot. Finally Val pulls Rhonda's hand over to light the fuse. Instantly he hurls the bomb as far as he can, behind the creatures.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too far! You threw it behind them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
The ground opens under their feet! Tentacles snake toward Val and Earl. A horrid mouth clamps onto Rhonda's boot. She screams as it starts to pull her down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOOM!! The bomb explodes! The creatures shriek in pain, instantly releasing their prey and racing away from the painful shock wave in the only direction they can --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CLIFFS - WIDE LOW ANGLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Right out through the face of the cliffs!! The huge, shrieking creatures seem to hang in mid-air for a moment, their grotesque bodies undulating in pain. And then they fall! And fall and fall -- a thousand feet!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BOTTOM OF CLIFFS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creatures land on massive jagged rocks, exploding like immense, horrid watermelons. Multi-colored gore festoons the whole cliff face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TILT UP to see three tiny figures standing at the top of the cliff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CLIFFS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Val peers down at the distant creatures for a long time. Then he notices Earl and Rhonda are staring at him. Where the hell did he get an idea like that? After a moment:
</DIRECTION>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it just suddenly hit me, you know? Stampede?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<DIRECTION>
They turn and head back toward the others. They laugh as they realize how stealthily they are walking. Val starts taking big, exaggerated stomping steps. Rhonda and Earl follow suit. The trio goes off arm in arm, stomping merrily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PERFECTION - MAIN STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Val and Earl roll two scavenged truck wheels down the street toward their own truck; which is up on jacks, two wheels missing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mindy races past excitedly.
</DIRECTION>
<MINDY>

	Look!

<DIRECTION>
A highway maintenance truck is rolling into town followed by a police car. The townsfolk happily swarm around the MAINTENANCE MEN and POLICE OFFICER who gape at the destroyed town.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Val and Earl eagerly start bolting on one of their new wheels.
</DIRECTION>

	Road's in!

<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Road's in! Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in People magazine...

	People? Hell, National Geographic.

Rhonda pulls up in her truck, leans out and snaps their picture with a top-of-the-line Nikon.
</DIRECTION>
<RHONDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, guys. Burt loaned me his camera.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHONDA>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Howdy, Rhonda.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<RHONDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're really leaving, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHONDA>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bet. You gonna be staying up here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<RHONDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, yeah! There's going to be major research up here. First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHONDA>
<DIRECTION>
An awkward pause. Finally she extends her hand to them. Val just gives it a quick shake.
</DIRECTION>
<RHONDA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh...well, maybe I'll see you two sometime...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Val)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And thanks for everything, you know, saving my life and stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHONDA>
<VAL>
<DIRECTION>
(awkwardly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...you're welcome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<DIRECTION>
She gazes at him, just a hint of something in her eyes. Earl springs to attention. Is the boy blind? Then Rhonda snaps out of it.
</DIRECTION>
<RHONDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...see ya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHONDA>
<DIRECTION>
They nod. She drives off. Earl stares at Val who starts putting the second wheel on the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Civil? I'm civil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not civil, you're glum. We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
	</DIALOGUE>

Earl freezes as a bell goes off in his head.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God. She got to you. You do like her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody paying you to do this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She just practically asked you for a date. What the hell is wrong?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
Val glares at Earl for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Earl, get real. What does she need with a guy like me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<DIRECTION>
Earl is dumbfounded.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that? All this time she's not good enough for you. Now, suddenly, you're not good enough for her? God, my work is never done. You don't decide is you're worthless, she does. But you gotta give her a chance!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
Val lowers the jack letting the truck down.
</DIRECTION>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Earl, I'm not gonna make a fool of myself! You got that covered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<DIRECTION>
Earl stands there fuming, mind racing. A last ditch idea hits home -- we see a devilish glint in his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She likes both of us. We both helped her out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<VAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are so full of shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAL>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah? Think about this: She ain't as narrow-minded as you. I'll lay odds she's looking for character in a man. For my part, I'd be proud to have her. I'd goddamn worship her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
Earl hops into the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going out there right now, help her take those pictures...set up her seismo-jiggers. Whatever she wants. Who the hell knows what'll happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
Earl starts to drive off. Val springs into the passenger seat. Through the truck's rear window we see Val raise his hand in The Challenge. They do a round of scissors-rock- paper -- but it's a tie. They go again. Another tie. They keep playing and tying as they drive off into the distance and we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
