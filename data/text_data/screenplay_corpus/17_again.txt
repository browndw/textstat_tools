An empty gymnasium except for a shirtless MIKE O'DONNELL, 17. Mike stands feet BEYOND the 3 point line, grabs balls from a hopper and rapidly shoots, shoots, shoots. SWISH...SWISH...SWISH. This kid's automatic.

The Jocks, Stan, Jazz and Kevin strut in. Mike's eyes narrow. Stan stops before Mike, looks him up and down-

Stan signals his friends, takes out a LIGHTER, flicks it, leans forward and places the flame BETWEEN Mike's legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flame GLOWS RED against Mike's jeans. The Jocks and Bras pull out their cells and begin VIDEOING.

Adams rips the paper off, holds it out towards Mike. Mike sniffs at the air-

<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is someone barbecuing?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YYYYEEEEOOOOOWWWWWWW!!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Mike LEAPS out of his shoes. A FLAME runs up his crotch. LAUGHTER. Mike, SCREAMING, runs around the room fanning his package.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out, Mr. Freedman!
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
A packed lunchroom. The CLIQUES sit amongst themselves. WE notice all the KIDS hunched over STARING AT THEIR PHONES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike enters carrying a bag lunch. A BLACK BURN MARK on the crotch of his pants. A GAYSIAN spots him, yells-
</DIRECTION>
<GAYSIAN>

	</DIALOGUE>
</GAYSIAN>
<DIRECTION>
The entire cafeteria turns to Mike and erupts in laughter.

<DIRECTION>
As Mike passes each table, WE see the kids are watching his `fire dance' on their phones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike approaches a table of the 3 BIGGEST LOSERS in school, unkempt hair, fat, acne. Mike begins to sit when-

	Look, we feel your pain. We really do. But life's hard enough, Brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIGGEST_LOSER>

	Get your hands off her, you little punk!

INT. RESTAURANT/BAR - NIGHT

<ED>

	Yeah, I caught it on youtube. Funny stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going back there.

</MIKE>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I'm a supportive dad.

</ED>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MIKE>
<ED>

</ED>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's not your type. She's smart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As far as I can tell that's her only flaw. I need a reason to see her again. You could flunk your classes, start a fight, vandalise the place. You'll figure it out. Then I can rush in, a teary eyed, helpless, single dad who can't handle his angry, kitten killing son. What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>

The Older Lady, having listened to it all, turns to Ed-

The Lady turns away in disgust.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do it. I don't have it in me.

</MIKE>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, no sweat off my sack. Tell Alex to stop wearing underwear all together. He'll be fine. That's what I did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
Mike eyes Ed, considers just how "well adjusted" Ed is. A determined look comes over Mike. He pounds the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right! My kids need me.

</MIKE>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>

Bogus About Me and Interests. Photoshopped pictures of Mike in exotic locations. All the `now' movies, music and books. They fill his Friends section with only hot girls.

	There must be a very hot girl downstairs.
	</DIALOGUE>

	There is. What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I forwarded my calls to my new phone, sent some work emails and just lobbed one to Scarlet, told her I was in Peru finding myself. Think she'll buy it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably not because when she called earlier I told her you were being detained at Guantanamo. Ready for tomorrow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am so ready.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Ed flips Mike a set of keys. Mike's eyes light up.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That ought'a put you over the top. And don't forget to hook me up son.

</ED>
<DIRECTION>
Ed plods off. Off Mike's huge smile.

<DIRECTION>
INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/CAFETERIA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike steps from the kitchen area carrying a TRAY, scans the crowded room, finds Alex seated at a table ALONE. It's a heartbreaking image. Mike approaches-

	But, People, Stan's a bully. Why? It would be way too easy to say Stan preys on the weak because he's simply a dick. No, Stan's more complex than that. According to leading psychiatrists Stan is a bully for 1 of 3 reasons. 1, under all that male bravado there's an insecure little girl banging on the closet door trying to get out. 2, like a caveman, Stan's brain is underdeveloped. Therefore Stan is unable to use self-control so he acts out aggressively. And the third reason-

	<DIALOGUE>
	September 7th, 1988 was the first time I saw you. You were reading `The Great Gatsby' and wearing a Guns N Roses T-shirt. I'd never seen anything so perfect. I remember thinking I had to have you or I'd die...not in a psycho kinda way but in that beautiful, innocent, unaffected way that way only a 17 year-old kid can have. You whispered you loved me at the homecoming dance and I felt so peaceful and safe because I knew no matter what happened from that night on nothing could ever be that bad because I had you. And then I grew up, lost my way and blamed you for my failures. But I was never lost. I'd just forgotten the way life makes you forget as you grow older. And I never failed at anything because on that September day you said `yes' to me. And at that dance you said you loved me. And as I stand here...as I write this, I want you to know if I don't have you I'll die...not in a psycho way but in that beautiful, innocent, unaffected way only a 17 year old kid can have....oh and...P.S...I'm `Hungry Like the Wolf'.
