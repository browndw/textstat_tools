INT. SHOP. NR CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The HUM of a large refrigerator just audible over the sound of Indian music - MARGARET, briefly glimpsed pondering cartons of milk. The electronic PEEP of the cash til. A man on a mobile phone pushes past MARGARET, who takes her place second in the queue. The female shopkeeper piles newspapers on the counter in front of MARGARET. Distracted by images of the bombed hotel on the TV, she hesitates for beat.

MARGARET heads down the busy street, shopping bag in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY. MARGARET sits at breakfast with her husband DENIS, sipping tea. DENIS butters his toast. MARGARET shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too much. Much too much butter.

</MARGARET>
<DENIS>

<DIRECTION>
(chuckles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or take in paying guests!

He scoops up the newspaper and glances towards the door -
</DIRECTION>
<DENIS>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch out. She's on the prowl.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET looks beyond DENIS to a a sense of growing commotion. A concerned POLICE GUARD coming up the stairs meeting JUNE (early 60's) MARGARET's carer, along a distant corridor, steady on the approach.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
(to DENIS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eat your egg.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
JUNE smiles with visible relief on seeing MARGARET, now sitting tapping open her egg.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodness! There you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
JUNE's look of quiet concern.

WHISPERING-

<JUNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand how it happened, how could she possibly have got out? It's very very important -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNE>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET looks out of the kitchen. Her POV down the corridor of JUNE and the POLICEMAN and a CLEANER.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

MARGARET hurries through the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wide cupboard-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET's eyes move back along the rail in front of her, her fingers touch hanger after hanger of brown tweed and grey twill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUNE goes over to the curtains, pulling them back, letting in the sunlight-
</DIRECTION>
<JUNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beautiful day. Oh, you've made a start. Carol's coming soon, I'll get some bags. Anything you want to go to Mark, I'll bring up a suitcase for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNE>
<DIRECTION>
The smell of smoke lingering. Suddenly DENIS' hand reaches across, wavering between jackets of brown tweed and grey twill-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches for a suit.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No no no no. The grey.

</MARGARET>
<DENIS>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENIS>

The swipe of a clothes brush, briefly seen, drawn across one sleeve-
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
Distant footsteps-
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>

</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
JUNE returns, oblivious-

<DENIS>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Righty ho. Boss knows best.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENIS>
<DIRECTION>
JUNE spies the newspaper, sees the photos of twisted carnage on the front page.
</DIRECTION>
<DENIS>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't let her take my paper away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENIS>
<DIRECTION>
JUNE reaches one hand out to scoop it up in passing-
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I haven't had a chance to look at that yet, dear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<JUNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNE>
<DIRECTION>
JUNE hesitates, leaves the newspaper resting on the bed as she heads off with the suit on a hanger.
</DIRECTION>
<DENIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Atta-girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENIS>
<DIRECTION>
DENIS smiles as he stands in the bathroom doorway, soaping his face with shaving cream-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hums to himself as he resumes shaving until-
</DIRECTION>
<DENIS>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn.

MARGARET looks up, DENIS has nicked his chin-
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blot it...Blot it..
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
She turns, sees JUNE, through the ajar door, standing in the corridor, looking back at her
</DIRECTION>
<JUNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry ?

<DIRECTION>
INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A comfortable drawing room, filled with the photographs and memorabilia of a former political life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET stands by the window, half a dozen of DENIS' ties in her hand. Pulling back the net curtain, MARGARET peers out-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two POLICEMAN stand down below next to a Police BMW car. They are lost in conversation, pointing to the door, clearly concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One POLICE MAN nods to the other, a sense of the changing of the guard as he drives off in the BMW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY from behind-
</DIRECTION>
<DENIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now look what you've done. Are they to keep the loonies out or you in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENIS>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET eyes DENIS, looking at her with wry smile -
</DIRECTION>
<DENIS>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be off then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENIS>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wear your scarf. There's a chill out there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly looming over her and grinning down as if at the top of a tunnel SUSIE, MARGARET's personal secretary carrying a cardboard box.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning Lady Thatcher. Are you alright ?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(concerned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you feeling ?

</SUSIE>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine, thank you Susie.

</MARGARET>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've just been reading about the bombings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Frightful.

SUSIE's mobile goes off. She fumbles in her bag to switch it off.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MARGARET>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The invitation has come from Downing Street for the unveiling of your portrait. I'll put it on the mantelpiece, and there's an invitation from Lord Armstrong for lunch on the first Friday of next month.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
The murmur of SUSIE's voice, a kind of white noise-
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said no because you've got a concert that afternoon but if you'd like to..?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
SILENCE-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUSIE(O.S) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	....It looks like a very interesting programme.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET's listens, oddly distracted-
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are they playing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
SUSIE looks at her momentarily at a loss then scrabbles back through the diary-
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think they said Rogers and Hammerstein.

</SUSIE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SADLER'S WELLS. LONDON. 1950. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An orchestra in full flight-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A programme for THE KING & I on a woman's lap. A man's hand reaches in and her hands slips into his.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whilst SUSIE shuffles through the arrangements at the desk in the background, MARGARET stands at the window.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Silly man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET's gaze, seeing DENIS just visible in the street below. He looks up, smiles,
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He hasn't got his scarf on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET throws DENIS a half wave. In return, he twirls his umbrella and does a couple of steps of a Chaplin walk for her benefit before passing the Postman who is shuffling through his letters as he approaches the front step, below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUSIE looks on with quiet concern.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET' is at her desk signing a stack of her memoirs, The Downing Street Years.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET opens one, reaching for a pen. The curve of inky handwriting as she begins to sign them, Margaret Thatcher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on the swoop of the pen. Without missing a beat, she writes the name Margaret Roberts...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The insistent blare of an air raid siren from another time cuts through -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACK PARLOUR. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rumble of an approaching air raid overhead-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STEADY SHAKE of the table legs all around pulls out to reveal-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEATRICE ROBERTS (early 50's) austere, crouched next to MARGARET under a wide kitchen table along with ALFRED ROBERTS (early/mid 50's) a cumbersome man and MURIEL ROBERTS (21 yrs). The sound of an air-raid siren.
</DIRECTION>
<ALFRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did someone cover the butter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALFRED>
<DIRECTION>
All look at one another in a panic.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly MARGARET scrabbles out from under the table, all look on with horror-
</DIRECTION>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<ALFRED>

INT. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET scooping up the butter cover slamming it quickly over the thin slice of butter left in the butter dish before sliding it into the cold cupboard underneath the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY the shop illuminates- A DISTANT EXPLOSION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET momentarily paralyzed before, running back towards the back parlour to resume her place under the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACK PARLOUR. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET scrabbles underneath.

The SOFT press of MEN all around, MARGARET, a lone woman amongst them, peering over shoulders.

MARGARET sinks a little, taking the tray, and glances back at ALFRED just visible on a stage.
</DIRECTION>
<ALFRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We on this island are strong. We're self-reliant. Sometimes we're plain bloody minded.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALFRED>
<DIRECTION>
NOW AT THE BACK OF THE HALL, holding a tray loaded with dirty cups, MARGARET watches her father, back turned to the kitchen filled with WOMEN and YOUNG GIRLS making tea and washing up cups.
</DIRECTION>
<ALFRED>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we also believe in helping each other. And I don't mean by state hand-outs...

EXT. STREET. GRANTHAM. 1943. DAY.

MARGARET sweeps outside the shop, glancing across the street at-

THREE PRETTY GIRLS dolled up for the evening and arms linked, crossing on the other side of the pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<PRETTY_YOUNG_WOMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Margaret, do you want to come to the pictures?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRETTY_YOUNG_WOMAN_1>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET's eyes catch on the glitter of a broach in passing. They turn to look at her WHISPERING and GIGGLING.

<PRETTY_YOUNG_WOMAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She can't come, she's got to study.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Never run with the crowd, Margaret. Go your own way.

MARGARET looks down the corridor in expectation at BEATRICE standing at the sink working the SQUEAK of the cloth against a stubborn tea stain.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
(calling out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother?

MARGARET napping in bed.

<DIRECTION>
The still of the bedroom, caught in the half light of a late afternoon-

A hand slides a teacup onto the bedside table -

<DIRECTION>
The flicker of MARGARET's eyelids-

MARGARET stirs again, blinking awake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DENIS sits by the window. He is bent over a pair of spectacles, wrapping wire around one of the arms with a pair of pliers. Other items of clothing of his are on Margaret's couch.
</DIRECTION>
<DENIS>
<DIRECTION>
(without taking his eyes of the job)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're talking about you again.

The murmur of JUNE on the phone-

<DENIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sun's not quite over the yard arm. Time for tea.

</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have you got on your head?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
DENIS smiles, throwing back his head, the swathe of pink fabric from his turban hanging down ridiculously-
</DIRECTION>
<DENIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Found it in the cupboard and thought bugger it, it's Friday, why not fancy dress?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENIS>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET sits drinking her tea, JUNE's hushed tones almost audible.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>

</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET strains to hear-
</DIRECTION>
<DENIS>

	Bosslady no like?

</DENIS>
<DIRECTION>
She makes a shushing motion.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Denis, Bosslady no like.

MARGARET resumes listening. The door ajar, the sounds of life just audible outside-
</DIRECTION>
<JUNE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's taken Carol so long to get her to agree to this. She's been so reluctant to let his things go.

She considers the pills, pops them in her mouth, drinks.

<DIRECTION>
MARGARET'S POV of Denis turning to her in the theatre. He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET's FINGERS absently grazing over the programme, in time with the music-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY a closed fist reaches out, then opens to reveal a sugar mouse. Margaret's fingers reach for it, but it's teasingly withdrawn. Finally, she takes its.

She turns to smile at DENIS, her face is glowing with happiness-

INT. TOWN HALL 1950. NIGHT.

MARGARET sits on the edge of a trestle table, scrunching a rosette in her hand. The Town Hall is empty save for a couple of Volunteers stacking chairs and sweeping the floor. The litter of election night is everywhere.

	Twenty-four-year-old Miss Margaret Roberts lost her bid to win a seat in Parliament today, but she has put new life into the Dartford Conservative Association. Winning candidate Mr Dodds had better watch out, this bright young woman is on his tail.

She is fuming but he regroups with a big breath.

	Yes. Yes!

He leans over and kisses her, long and passionately until-

	<DIALOGUE>
	What ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENIS>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you so much but...I will never be one of those women Denis - who stays silent and pretty on the arm of her husband. Or remote and alone in the kitchen doing the washing up for that matter.

(trying to retain the moment)

</DENIS>
<DIRECTION>
He leans forward to kiss her again but she pulls away a little.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No - one's life must matter, Denis. Beyond the cooking and the cleaning and the children, one's life must mean more than that - I cannot die washing up a tea cup.

He sits up and stares as if seeing her for the first time.

A CHINK of a TEACUP-

They pull apart. FLUSHED and GIGGLING on seeing-

<DIRECTION>
A LONE WOMAN enters the hall, cleaning up the last of the tea cups, and generally tidying.

MARGARET now on all fours, struggling with her glasses. A pile of DVD's on the floor, The KING and I amongst them momentarily catching her eye until-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DVD with hand-written scrawl that we can't quite read.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET flicks open the box, struggling to get the DVD out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fiddling with the DVD player, MARGARET puts in the disc and considers, squinting at the remote, trying to make the DVD player work until, suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Super 8 footage - 1959
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Children on a beach in wind-swept, grainy super 8. Denis with a golf club and ping pong balls practicing his drive from a tee, sending ball after ball skying into the sea. Mark and Carol charge into the water to retrieve them.

<MARGARET>

He turns and rushes towards the camera, whooshing past it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without breaking step, suddenly, he's in the room, running past Margaret, still cheering and whooping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET's hand, just skimming MARK's golden curls. As he moves on, MARGARET's curiosity caught following him out and down the corridor of Chester Square, seeing the Mark and Carol disappear round a corner.

MARGARET fingers brush dark panelled walls, making her way along endless corridors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gothic arches, venerable busts, wood panelling and stone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET's pov as she stays to the side of the impressive corridor. She passes men in suits and groups. Others come towards her and notice her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her POV as she pushes open a first door 'TEA ROOM' - a circle of men turn round in chorus as if something with three heads has appeared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV of a second opening door marked MEMBERS. A row of urinals. Two headless bodies come towards the camera, scrambling to zip up their flies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV of the promise of sanctuary. LADY MEMBERS. The door opens onto a cupboard sized space. An ironing board.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sea of men's Oxford shoes from ground level. A pair of woman's shoes appear amongst them. They go on tip toe.

From above we see Margaret's hat amongst the sea of mens heads and shoulders. Margaret is carried along in the sea of MALE MP's OXFORD SHOES.

INT. HOUSE OF COMMONS CHAMBER. 1974. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET, now SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION, on the front bench, wearing a neat blue suit and a hat, a phalanx of MINISTERS sitting beside and around her, BLUE and GREY SUITED MEN, almost at first glance indistinguishable, with PRIME MINISTER EDWARD HEATH (late 50's), neat, effete, slumped rather forlornly on the bench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET, her speech and papers in her hand is fighting hard but the OPPOSITION LABOUR BENCHES scent blood - and they literally bray, getting to their feet and shaking their order papers in her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SPEAKER tries to control the chamber but his VOICE is almost lost in the bedlam.
</DIRECTION>
<SPEAKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Right Honourable Lady the Secretary of State for Education.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPEAKER>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The right honourable gentleman knows that we have no choice but to shut down the schools!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
Cries of 'Shame!' From the opposition. The chamber reduced to a bear-pit. HEATH glum and offering no help to MARGARET whose voice becomes increasingly shrill.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because his union paymasters have called a strike deliberately to cripple our economy. Teachers cannot teach when there is no heating, no lighting in their classrooms. And I ask the honourable gentleman, whose fault is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<SHADOW_MINISTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Methinks the Right Honourable lady doth screech to much. If she wants us to take her seriously she must learn to calm down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHADOW_MINISTER>
<DIRECTION>
The OPPOSITION BENCHES love that, rocking in their seats, laughing... falsely of course.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But MARGARET is aware that there are many MEN behind her, on the government benches, who are also sniggering in agreement.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If the right honorable gentleman could perhaps attend more closely to WHAT I am saying, rather than HOW I am saying it, he may receive a valuable education in spite of himself!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
Her opposite number Shadow Minister looks almost smug: smiling, pointing a finger at her.
</DIRECTION>
<SHADOW_MINISTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why has this Conservative government failed? Why has it forced so many in the public sector into taking strike action to save their own jobs?
	</DIALOGUE>

It brings the OPPOSITION benches to their feet, shouting, applauding, stamping...

EXT. WESTMINSTER STREET. 1974. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET walking with AIREY NEAVE towards Downing Street for a Cabinet Meeting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All around, heaped high on either side as far as the eye can see are bags of rubbish. But not neatly stacked, just thrown there, many of them rotting down, spilling their filthy, putrid contents onto the street.
</DIRECTION>
<SHADOW_MINISTER_VO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Minister, the breakdown of essential public services - transport, electricity, sanitation is not the fault of the trades unions but of this Conservative government in which you so shamefully serve!

The stench is awful - and MARGARET'S expression reflects that as she picks her way through.

The MINISTERS nod. MARGARET determinedly edges a little forward so that she is in equal line with the other MALE MINISTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATH>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure we are all in agreement that we must do nothing for the moment that will further inflame the current situation.

<MINISTER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hear hear, Prime Minister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINISTER_1>

MARGARET leans forward for a better view, trying to catch his eye. HEATH wavers, mid-speech. All turn to look at MARGARET - who sits unwavering. HEATH resumes.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- the fact of the matter is, it's absolutely crucial that we are seen by the public to be acting as conciliators and not aggressors.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prime Minister, with the Miners' leader calling today for the army to mutiny in support of the strikes, this seems the wrong time for conciliation.

SUDDENLY ALL THE LIGHTS GO OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lot of 'bloody hell' 'oh for god's sake'.

<HEATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be patient. They'll come back on in a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATH>
<DIRECTION>
A beam of light cuts through, just for an instant picking out HEATH'S moon-like face surrounded by darkness. MARGARET holds the small torch.

<ALFRED>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We Conservatives believe in giving people the freedom and opportunity to fulfil their own potential, especially the young. There's no good in pretending we're all equal, we're not all the same, never have been, never will be. We should encourage our children to aspire to achieve more than we have, for our children today will be the leaders of tomorrow.

INT. REECE'S OFFICE. LONDON. 1975. DAY MARGARET is watching the same interview on a TV monitor. She is watching herself intently, as are REECE and AIREY NEAVE. They are polar opposites, REECE flamboyant to NEAVE's bluff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sounds very plummy, like a Conservative party wife from the shires. And she wears a hat.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET_ON_TELEVISION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We in Great Britain and in Europe are formed mainly by our history. They on the other hand are formed by their philosophy. Not by what has been, but by what can be. Oh, we have a great deal that we can learn from them, yes. Oh yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET_ON_TELEVISION>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET is trapped in the moment - but the two men exchange a glance. NEAVE freezes the picture. MARGARET smiles uneasily, like someone expecting a compliment. REECE considers her, long and hard. It is a little unsettling until-
</DIRECTION>
<REECE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well er...For a start, that hat has got to go. And the pearls. In fact I think all hats may have to go. You look and sound like a privileged Conservative wife and we've already got her vote. You've got lovely hair but we need to do something with it - to make it more-
	</DIALOGUE>
<AIREY_NEAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Important.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIREY_NEAVE>
<REECE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Give it more impact. But the main thing is your voice. Its too high. It has no authority.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REECE>
<AIREY_NEAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Methinks the Lady doth screech too much
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIREY_NEAVE>
<REECE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People don't want to be harangued by a woman or hectored. Persuaded yes. That 'oh yes' at the end of the interview, that's authoritative, that's the voice of a leader.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all very well to talk about changing my voice, Mr Reece, but for some of my colleagues to imagine me as their leader would be like imagining, I don't know, being led into battle by their chambermaid. It's my background, and my sex. No matter how I've tried, and I have tried, to fit in, I will never be truly one of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Both REECE and NEAVE are aware that she has spoken very nakedly - and is thus extremely vulnerable.
</DIRECTION>
<REECE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I may say so - I think that's your trump card. You're flying in the face of everything the Tories have been thus far. It's really very exciting. One simply has to maximise your appeal, bring out all your qualities and make you look, and sound, like the leader that you could be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<NEAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got it in you to go the whole distance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEAVE>
<REECE>

	Absolutely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REECE>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prime Minister?! Oh no. Oh no no no. In Britain? There will be no female Prime Minister here, not in my lifetime. No. And I told Airey, I don't expect to win the leadership, but I am going to run. Just to shake up the party.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
NEAVE moves in intently-
</DIRECTION>
<NEAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Respectfully, Margaret, I disagree. If you want to change this party, lead it. If you want to change the country, lead it. What we're talking about here today is surface. What's crucial is that you hold your course, and stay true to who you are. Never be anything other than yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>

MARGARET, though flattered, looks sceptical.
</DIRECTION>
<REECE>

	Gentlemen, I am in your hands. I may be persuaded to surrender the hat. But the pearls were a gift from my husband on the birth of our twins and they are absolutely non-negotiable.

<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Trade Union Movement was founded to protect workers. Now it persecutes them. It stops them from working. It is killing jobs and it is bringing this country to its knees. I say enough. It's time to get up. It's time to go to work. It's time to put the Great back into Great Britain!

INT. MAIN HALL. CONFERENCE HALL. BRIGHTON. 1979. DAY BRITAIN NEEDS THE CONSERVATIVES bannered overhead and hung with Union Jacks. MARGARET a swathe of blue, as she passes through her GREY SUITED CABINET. From behind she stands, arms outstretched, accepting the applause, a shock of bright blonde hair as she stands before a sea of CONSERVATIVE DELEGATES holding up letter cards WE LOVE YOU MAGGIE!

Wedges of fanatical party faithful on their feet in a kind of rapture. The blessed Margaret ! DENIS just visible with REECE, HOWE, PYM, HESELTINE and several other GREY SUITED MINISTERS of her cabinet, seated close behind now jumping to their feet, with obvious relief and delight - RAPTUROUS APPLAUSE, FLASH BULBS POPPING MARGARET smiles, glorious, catching DENIS' eye.

MARGARET, seated at the wide cabinet table surrounded by a subdued CABINET. Most of the familiar old faces - PYM, HESELTINE, etc. All now gone.

<DIRECTION>
HOWE the last enduring minister.

She casts a gimlet-eye over the GREY-SUITED MEN around her.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There it is again! Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<MINISTER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINISTER_1>
<MINISTER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because people... on the whole... think that the tax is manifestly unfair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINISTER_2>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nonsense. Arrant nonsense. This is a simple proposition. In order to live in this country, you must pay for the privilege- something, anything! If you pay nothing, you care nothing. What do you care where you throw your rubbish? Your council estate is a mess, your town, graffiti, what do you care? It's not your problem , it's somebody else's problem- it's the government's problem! YOUR problem is, some of you, is that you haven't got the courage for this fight. You haven't had to fight hard for anything. It's all been given to you- and you feel guilty about it! Well, may I say, on behalf of all those who HAVE had to fight their way up,

(and who don't feel guilty about it)

SILENCE.

<MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

	And I see the same thing, the same cowardice in our fight within the European Union, to retain British sovereignty of Britain, the integrity of the pound! Some of you want to make concessions. I hear some of you agree with the latest French proposals.

	Here it is, Prime Minister. Of course.

HOWE pushes the papers over to her. She picks up a pencil, starts to read.

The MINISTERS watch as, quickly, she starts to score through the words.

<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is ridiculous. There are two "T's" in "committee"!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
She presses so hard that her pencil breaks, so she shoves the paper back towards him, stabbing a finger at the offending word.

<MARGARET>

MARGARET snaps her fingers at HOWE, gesturing for his pencil, scratching away, ringing the offending word again and again. The MINISTERS stare at the scene appalled, utterly and wretchedly embarrassed.

His youthful face, smiling at her at the opera.

Laughing on the beach in Cornwall.

At the door of Number 10, smiling at her.

Sharing her bed.

MARGARET looks up. Denis's suitcase is on the bed. His coat and hat lying beside it. She folds his dressing gown - the one from the bathroom hook - tenderly and puts it on the top of the case.
