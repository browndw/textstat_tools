INT. TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
START ON THE FACE of A GOLDEN CAT STATUE. This is the cat- god BAST, lithe, noble, beautiful. CAMERA MOVES to reveal the statue is 50 feet tall, dominating this space. Other images of CATS -- hieroglyphics, ceramics -- abound, as do -- REAL CATS, hundreds of them, slinking in the shadows on ramps cut into the sandstone walls of this Egyptian temple. At Bast's feet, EIGHT ACOLYTES in GOWNS kneel in a semi- circle around a flaming BRAZIER. Some of the women WEEP, others PRAY or stare stoically ahead. From outside, we now hear DISTANT SCREAMS, the sounds of MARAUDERS. There's a RHYTHMIC BANGING at the massive BRONZE TEMPLE DOORS.

THE TEMPLE is an impressive place of worship -- tapered columns and an ornate Egyptian facade -- at the apex of a hilltop VILLAGE, in FLAMES, under ATTACK by a PERSIAN ARMY.

SUPERIMPOSE: "496 B.C."

WHAM! THE STEEL PRONG of a mounted BATTERING RAM swings into the ornate DOORS of the temple. PERSIAN SOLDIERS operate the brutal siege engine, SLAM the doors again and again.

INT. TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The HIGH PRIESTESS wears a special HOODED WHITE GOWN that mostly conceals her face. She moves from one ACOLYTE to the next, pours a DARK LIQUID from a bejeweled decanter into golden goblets, then pours one for herself. She raises her goblet toward BAST, as do the others -- they drink in unison.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH ANGLE as the GOBLETS CLATTER to the floor and the WOMEN SLUMP to the ground... dead. PULL BACK -- we're watching this from the PERSPECTIVE of an EGYPTIAN MAU CAT -- slim, elegant, dark-spotted gray and black fur, a SCARAB MARK on its head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MAU lets out a CRY... which prompts an eerie, growing CHORUS of MEOWS and HOWLS from the other CATS. THE CATS emerge from the hiding places en masse, leaping from niches, converging on the bodies. The MAU leads the way, moves to the high priestess and puts its mouth to hers... ON THE TEMPLE DOORS - at last they BUCKLE and swing open. THE SOLDIERS, bearing TORCHES and SWORDS, storm inside. They grab anything of value, SMASH and DEFACE everything else. At the foot of BAST lie nine ROBES... but there's no sign of the women who wore them. SOLDIERS slash the robes with their swords anyway, then snatch up the goblets for booty. An unearthly CRY -- half-human, half-feline -- from somewhere high above the rampaging soldiers. They freeze, looking around frantically. More EERIE CRIES echo off the walls, from all directions. The SOLDIERS raise their weapons, clustering defensively. From out of the shadows above them, DARK HUMAN FORMS suddenly leap down with impossible agility. STAY ON THE FACE OF BAST, peering down impassively. The torch-cast SHADOWS of the violence below play upon the statue's golden surface... FLAILING SWORDS, the swift SILHOUETTES of NAKED WOMEN. We hear the GUTTURAL CRIES of the soldiers, clearly outmatched in this mortal combat. MOVE TO THE CATS, perched above the fray, looking downward as they pace the temple's ledges and ramps excitedly. THE MAU takes a final look at its handiwork, then leaps up, slinks through a crevice at the roof, and emerges on --

THE MAU settles by a SATELLITE DISH, looking down on a present-day suburban street, a busy main drag. MARSHLAND and WATER are visible not far away, light RAIN FALLS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSE: "2500 YEARS LATER."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MAU watches as, ACROSS THE STREET, a BUS pulls away from the curb to reveal a WOMAN in a HOODED WHITE PONCHO -- the outfit recalls the high priestess of Bast. The HOOD is thrown back, revealing PATIENCE PRICE, 25-35, attractive but inclined to conceal her looks -- hair over her face, baggy clothes under her poncho. She's cautious, eager to please, to do what's expected of her -- a bit of a doormat. Patience looks up from an address scribbled on a scrap of paper, and straight toward the cat on the roof -- almost as if she'd sensed its presence. She smiles. THE MAU holds her gaze for a beat, then slinks out of sight.

EXT. EDNA'S HOME - DAY

An eccentric, ramshackle home amongst neat, well-kept houses. PATIENCE moves to the front door, RINGS. As she waits, she notes the lawn GRASS grown high, CLIMBING CAT SCULPTURES on the shingles. A SIGN by the door: "FELINE RESCUE SOCIETY." EDNA POWERS opens the door on a chain. She's 50-70, a former academic, intelligent, charming, but quite intimidating.

EDNA is putting out DRY CAT FOOD in numerous BOWLS.

<EDNA>

	You may call me Edna.

<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Edna. Some of these questions are... kind of personal. Do you really need to know how many, um, partners I've had in the past year?
	</DIALOGUE>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not interested in your love life. But I do want to know what sort of home environment you're offering, your degree of commitment...

<PATIENCE>

	Guess I wouldn't need the cat if...

Patience forces a laugh, fills in a ZERO and passes the clipboard to EDNA. The woman puts down the cat food, slips on the reading glasses she wears on a chain around her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The application is mostly a formality. I have a sense about people.

EDNA seems satisfied, returns to reading Patience's answers. THE MAU, meanwhile, comes around a corner into the room, peering curiously at Patience -- who dangles her hand invitingly. He rubs his face against her hand. PATIENCE smiles, coos at the cat -- which grabs her hand hard in his CLAWS. PATIENCE stifles a yelp, yanks her hand back.

EDNA reaches a hand toward MIDNIGHT -- the cat's fur stands up, she HISSES and SWIPES at Edna.

EDNA sucks her breath in at this insulting name.

<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was very round -- not from overfeeding or anything, just -- really, he didn't mind. Anyway, he was with me a long time, till early this year. He didn't come at the sound of the can-opener, which kind of freaked me out... I found him just, curled up there in his little bed...
	</DIALOGUE>

PATIENCE is getting a bit emotional. EDNA reaches across and squeezes her hand, with genuine sympathy. MIDNIGHT snuggles into Patience's lap, PURRING as she strokes the cat.

	It's very hard, dear, I know... you must be in so much pain.

Midnight digs her long NAILS into Patience's thigh, kneading. PATIENCE winces, tries to dislodge cat's claws from her leg -- Midnight "playfully" attacks her hand. Stifling a gasp:
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm-hmm.
	</DIALOGUE>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Funny how cats get under our skin. They do exactly as they please, they don't care what anyone thinks about them... they're the ultimate predators. So self-contained, so independent, so wild... sometimes I wonder, why do they even put up with us?

	<DIALOGUE>
	So you think you might have a kitten for me...?

<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kitten? No, that wouldn't be appropriate. Midnight has chosen you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
PATIENCE looks a little unnerved at this. MIDNIGHT, rolling on her back, seems to be baring her fangs at Patience.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a great honor. Maus are a very rare breed, descended from the sacred cats of ancient Egypt. They were believed to have magical gifts.

MIDNIGHT has wrapped herself around Patience's arm, kicking and biting "playfully."

	Nonsense, she perceives something very special in you.

	There's nothing special about me.

CAMERA MOVES THROUGH this modest, neat studio apartment, PAST a BULLETIN BOARD with numerous PHOTOS. One or two show a YOUNG PATIENCE, there's a picture of a LITTLE GIRL between TWO SMILING PARENTS on a ROLLER COASTER. Mostly, though, they're snapshots of a chubby TABBY CAT, from kitten hood to old age. Suddenly, MIDNIGHT LUNGES INTO FRAME, attacking a picture of FATSO, ripping it from the bulletin board.

CLOSE ON LAUREL as she tosses her hair back, Gilda-style, with a seductive pout. She purses her lips in a kiss. REVERSE ANGLE -- PATIENCE watches with a curled lip, on the couch in a T-shirt and shorts, EATING CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM directly from a pint carton, a dark smear around her mouth. Suddenly, MIDNIGHT POUNCES at the SPOON OF ICE CREAM. Patience jerks back, startled, raises the spoon out of reach.
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE>

	No -- this is mine!

MIDNIGHT doesn't back off, jumping repeatedly at the spoon, climbing over Patience, getting a rear PAW in the open pint.

Patience offers the cat the half-empty pint. As MIDNIGHT digs in happily, burying his head in the container --

LIGHTS COME ON in the apartment across the way. PATIENCE hesitates only an instant, sticks the spoon in her mouth, CLICKS OFF the TV and flips off a LAMP by the sofa. THROUGH THE WINDOW, A HANDSOME MAN -- his name is TOM LONE -- crosses past. PATIENCE sighs in the dark, moving for a better view. This voyeurism is a guilty habit.

LONE checks his mail, loosens his tie, unbuttons his shirt.

LONE is distracted, reading his mail, shirt still on. MIDNIGHT, meanwhile, pulls her head out of the ice cream and leaps onto the windowsill -- she looks first at Lone, then at Patience, who looks around her.

Prominent is a DISPLAY for BEAUNIQUE. HIP MUSIC in BG. AVENAL GIRLS, perfectly coiffed and made-up Barbie dolls, busily paint the faces of CLIENTS, women of all ages and backgrounds, in high-tech MAKE-UP CHAIRS that resemble torture devices. PATIENCE crosses through, pausing to take off her sneakers and pull on a pair of high heels. SALLY -- an Avenal girl in a prim outfit, working on a matronly CUSTOMER -- looks up to greet PATIENCE.

She double- checks DATA in the print-outs. Something doesn't tally. ON SCREEN -- among a long list of figures, we see "YP-3" highlighted, followed by a series of numbers. PATIENCE gets up quickly with the printouts, she spills a few drops of COFFEE on her white blouse. She dabs at these distractedly as she moves through the bullpen toward a glassed-in office.

The company's CEO, Georges is charismatic, handsome, immaculately tailored -- an exacting asshole to the core. Getting out of the helicopter behind him, his menacing, silent bodyguard ANGEL carries a leather suitcase or two. LAUREL AVENAL trots toward her husband with open arms. Laurel is 30-something, a still-gorgeous super-model but, in person, a tad past her prime. She comes across as sweet and well-meaning, but a bit dim and victimized.

LAUREL is fixing her make-up meticulously in a COMPACT MIRROR, looking for signs of the dreaded zit. GEORGES is flipping through AD LAYOUT BOARDS. WESLEY, a weasely ASSISTANT, is seated between them, going over an electronic appointment book. A CHAUFFEUR, ANGEL in the passenger seat.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you telling me this? It's routine to have a surplus --

	We've stockpiled over a thousand gallons, enough to last us well into the 29th Century.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GEORGES>

	Perhaps that is a trifle optimistic --

	And very expensive. Funding seems to have been siphoned out of the employee pension plan --

	Well, actually Patience Price brought the matter to my attention --

PATIENCE moves to her apartment door, arms loaded with GROCERIES. She struggles to unlock the door while keeping these upright -- we see a "HELLO KITTY" emblem on her key chain. As soon as the door is open -- -- MIDNIGHT BOLTS out into the hall, a black streak moving toward the stairs and darting upward.
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Midnight! You little monster --

<DIRECTION>
Patience tosses her groceries in the door, leaving it ajar, and runs after the cat. A few moments after she's vanished up the stairs, we hear FOOTSTEPS from below and... ANGEL, Georges Avenal's menacing bodyguard, appears in the hallway. He moves purposefully for Patience's door, pushes it open and steps inside. Midnight just saved her neck.

	Freeze!

It's TOM LONE. But Patience loses her balance, FALLS -- -- and LANDS in an open DUMPSTER. LONE darts from the window, alarmed, realizing his error.

ANGEL emerges, shaking his head and shrugging toward the unseen driver of the BLACK MERCEDES, then he climbs in the passenger door. As the car pulls away -- -- LONE hurries from the building next-door toward the alley.

He clambers onto the dumpster's edge to help her out, she slips and slides, almost pulls him in after her.

<LONE>

	I'm really sorry -- I'm a police officer, I heard the noise and just assumed... here, grab my arm.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He manages to hoist Patience to the lip, she's able to climb to the ground. She's drenched in GOOEY GARBAGE, just stares at Lone, a bit dazed from the fall. She can't believe she's face to face with the man of her dreams. Lone thinks a beat.

He looks over her shoulder, winces.

She tosses it in the dumpster, finally registering that she's drenched in WET GARBAGE.

PATIENCE walks toward her building, the bus kiosk behind her, the BUS MOVING AWAY. The street is deserted at this hour. Patience feels very alone, until she looks up to see -- -- MIDNIGHT, perched in her window, awaiting her arrival. A smile appears on Patience's face. She quickens her step, crossing the empty street, almost to the sidewalk when -- -- AN ENGINE ROARS behind her. Patience spins just as -- -- THE MERCEDES, LIGHTS OFF, barrels out of the darkness and

WHAM! Hits her full-on. MIDNIGHT at the WINDOW -- the cat lets out a HOWL. ANGLE DOWN, the MERCEDES has stopped, Patience lies a short distance behind... in bad shape. The PASSENGER DOOR OPENS.

ON THE ROADWAY, CAR DOORS CLOSE and the MERCEDES SEDAN SCREECHES away. CLOSER ON THE SKYLINE. A HOWL rises -- FIND MIDNIGHT, CRYING from a rooftop. Unseen CATS join in, a feline TELEGRAPH.

EXT. MARSHLAND - NIGHT

ON MURKY MOONLIT WATER -- CAMERA MOVES past floating TRASH, a CAR TIRE, BOTTLES and CANS. We hear the CRIES of the CATS from nearby, approaching. LIGHTS of the CITY further away, the BRIDGE visible. CAMERA FINDS a nylon-encased FOOT... PAN OVER a woman's CORPSE, her clothes TORN, SOAKED and MUDDY, strewn with RIVER WEEDS. The body bobs amidst REEDS by this soggy shoreline. We reach the woman's FACE -- unnaturally pale, eyes fixed... it's PATIENCE PRICE. Dead. THE HOWLING is CLOSE now... THE CATS have gathered here, parting for MIDNIGHT, a feline VIP. The Mau steps tentatively out onto Patience's corpse, careful not to get too wet. She crouches on her chest, and -- CLOSE, BREATHES audibly into her parted lips. A brief, barely visible GLOW flickers at Patience's mouth. THE CAT shudders, then moves aside, BLINKS as if drugged. ANOTHER CAT climbs out onto Patience to take Midnight's place and perform the same ritual.

<DIRECTION>
-- PATIENCE sits up INTO FRAME with a SCREAM. She thrashes in the shallows of the marsh, gasping for air, disoriented... reborn. There's no sign of the cats. PATIENCE crawls onto shore amidst the reeds, slightly clumsy at first, almost like a newborn kitten. Her ragged, wet clothes cling to her body. TIGHT on her terrified expression. She has no idea what she's doing here -- or who, or what she is. She opens her mouth to speak -- all that comes out is a strangled CAT CRY. She works her jaw, but can't produce human speech. She darts her head, seems disoriented and overwhelmed. HER POV -- SOUNDS AMPLIFIED, IMAGE perhaps SOLARIZED, the darkness BRIGHTENED, objects of interest HIGHLIGHTED as she takes in the marshland. The EYES of any creature in sight GLOW. We'll call this CATVISION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP PAN TO a nearby CRICKET perched on a blade of grass -- then UP TO an OWL in the distance, soaring over the park. WHIP DOWN TO its prey, a SCURRYING MOUSE. THE OWL swoops with a SCREECH, nailing the MOUSE, we hear its SQUEAL. PATIENCE, frightened at first, becomes increasingly delighted by her heightened senses. She spots -- MIDNIGHT in the tall grass. The cat turns, looks over her shoulder once -- her EYES catch moonlight and GLOW. Patience is clearly meant to follow. PATIENCE follows MIDNIGHT on all fours, tenuously at first. But as she proceeds, her shoulders and hips roll in distinctly feline fashion. Her body seems slimmer, more muscular. She rises on two legs, moving in a slinky crouch. MIDNIGHT pauses to sharpen her claws on the bark of a gnarled old TREE. PATIENCE follows Midnight's lead, leans forward against the trunk, arms straight out, head arched back. She stretches her neck, her back -- her every movement is graceful, sensual, the awkwardness gone. She tries to pull her hands from the tree -- but can't for a moment, finding her FINGER-NAILS stuck into the bark (like a cat at a scratching post). A DOG BARKS -- without thinking about it, PATIENCE scrambles up the side of the tree like a streak. HER POV FROM TREE -- A LARGE DOG tugs on its OWNER'S leash, some distance away. The dog walker yanks the dog onward. PATIENCE takes this in, hears a MEOW -- MIDNIGHT is perched above her, very Cheshire Cat-like. PATIENCE looks around, self-conscious for a moment -- what is she doing up a tree? Bad idea to think. She loses her balance, clutching at branches, tumbles out of the tree -- IN MIDAIR for an instant, she flails spastically, letting out a SHRIEK -- then her body instinctively TWISTS and -- PATIENCE LANDS on all fours, one leg kicked out, haunches low. MIDNIGHT lands beside her, nods approvingly at her landing. Then the cat darts away again, Patience pursues.

EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIDNIGHT leaps to the top of a FENCE, staring down at Patience -- "come on." Patience hesitates, then crouches and SPRINGS UP (with more than human ability), lands triumphantly on the fence -- then teeters and TUMBLES to the other side. MIDNIGHT looks disappointed. Patience jumps up again quickly, as if pretending this never happened, this time managing to hold her balance. MIDNIGHT gives her a look and leads onward. At first she's like a tightrope walker, careful of falling, but her steps become more confident. Soon she's moving as quickly and smoothly as the cat. MIDNIGHT leaps off the fence and darts across a road, PATIENCE follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PUBLIC GARDEN/ZOO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tall wrought-iron FENCE surrounds greenery and distant cages in an urban area. A SIGN: "ARBORETUM - ZOO." MIDNIGHT squeezes through a gap between the uprights. PATIENCE hesitates -- this is too narrow for a normal human. MIDNIGHT waits impatiently on the other side, tail twitching. PATIENCE makes a dubious SOUND, but manages to slip a foot -- then a leg -- into the opening, twisting and contorting. Amazingly, she's succeeding, her torso ripples and contracts as she insinuates herself between the bars. Finally only her head is on the wrong side. With a final TUG, she's through. MIDNIGHT crouches low, stalking. PATIENCE copies the behavior. MIDNIGHT slowly approaches -- A MOTH, fluttering near a FLOWER in this botanical garden. MIDNIGHT sneaks up close, then POUNCES, but the MOTH flies out of the cat's grasp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PATIENCE GIGGLES, MIDNIGHT turns on her and HISSES. The woman and the cat roll together in this neat BOTANICAL GARDEN, playing and batting at each other. CAMERA MOVES TO a small sign nearby, which labels this planting as "CATNIP." MIDNIGHT HURTLES a CONCRETE MOAT, PATIENCE follows, still high, giggly. She suddenly finds herself face to face with: A BENGAL TIGER. He lets out a small ROAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PATIENCE blinks, crouches -- and ROARS back, unafraid. The tiger springs forward... and LICKS HER. She wrestles with him playfully, he's just a bigger version of Midnight.

EDNA POWERS sleeps in bed. MIDNIGHT climbs atop her, starts kneading. She makes a NOISE, rolls over, opens her eyes.
</DIRECTION>

	Midnight? What are you doing here?

She squints, sees morning light through a window. She climbs out of bed in her nightdress.

EXT. EDNA'S HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDNA emerges in a bathrobe, crossing her overgrown lawn, MIDNIGHT bounding ahead of her. A Martha Stewarty NEIGHBOR, weeding an immaculate garden, throws Edna a sour look.
</DIRECTION>
<NEIGHBOR>

	Edna, your cats have been using my garden as a litter box again.

	You can't change their nature.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The neighbor scowls and returns to her weeding. As EDNA bends down for her newspaper, she hears a MEOW and sees -- -- Midnight licking a HAND, which protrudes from under a bush. Edna GASPS, moves closer, crouching to get a better look. It's PATIENCE, sound asleep, body twisted sideways in an unnatural position. Quietly:
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Patience starts awake, looking around, confused.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing in my hedge?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Patience rolls out from under the bushes, crouches on her haunches now, a panicky look in her eyes. Leaves and dirt cling to her clothes. She has no idea how she got here.

INT. EDNA'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

PATIENCE is wrapped in a BLANKET, sitting on the couch, MIDNIGHT nuzzling her, as EDNA brings her a cup of TEA. Edna picks up a CLIPBOARD from a coffee table.

Patience takes a few steps from the couch and lets the blanket slip from her shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God...

Edna stares at PATIENCE'S BACK. The fabric of her dress is torn, the skin discolored beneath with a hint of dried blood -- and we make out the marks left by a TIRE TREAD.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're in no condition to --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EDNA moves beside Patience and GRABS HER by the wrist -- ON PATIENCE'S HAND, the fingers CURL and FIVE SHARP CAT CLAWS (SPFX) emerge from her fingertips -- only for an instant. EDNA blinks at this, PATIENCE whirls on her with an abrupt and frightening HISS -- CLOSE, Patience's pupils become ELLIPTICAL for a blink, flecked with GOLD, then -- She yanks her hand away quickly, immediately looks contrite, and a bit dazed from the momentary transformation.
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, you -- you startled me... look, Edna, thanks for everything, but -- I just want to get home and take a bath.

Edna nods, unnerved. PATIENCE picks MIDNIGHT up in her arms and hurries out the door. Edna stares after her, a disturbing thought forming.

INT. EDNA'S HOME - OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDNA moves purposefully to a FILE CABINET in this cluttered, book-lined room and opens a drawer. She thumbs past many years' worth of scholarly research, finally pulling a thick, dog-eared MANILA FILE from near the back. She moves to her desk, slips on reading glasses and opens the folder -- ANGLE ON FILE -- an old, thick type-written SCHOLARLY PAPER entitled "MYTHS OF FELIGYNY, by E. POWERS Ph.D." She puts this aside, revealing a WOODCUT of an AFRICAN Catwoman in leopard skin, surrounded by cats. Next, an ASIAN CATWOMAN, a print of a 19th Century watercolor. She wears a Chinese- style MASK, close-fitting robes, a long tail. Both illustrations show the women with CLAWS and ELLIPTICAL

Behind her, THE BATHTUB RUNS, almost filled. She moves to the edge of the tub, starting to undo her ragged clothes, stares down at -- THE RIPPLING WATER. She blinks, her expression far away --

A vertiginous PLUNGE from the bridge toward DARK WATER --

PATIENCE starts, shaking off this momentary vision. She dips a finger in the water, jerks back -- much as a cat might. She shakes drops off her hand, repelled by the water.

MIDNIGHT lets out a menacing GROWL. THE KNOB TURNS, the door swings open -- a MAN starts to enter
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLANG! PATIENCE whacks him over the head with a FRYING PAN. THE MAN is knocked hard into the door and slumps to the ground, stunned... it's TOM LONE. PATIENCE recognizes him with horror, looks at the door -- PATIENCE'S KEYS with the "HELLO KITTY" emblem dangle from the lock, her PURSE is on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am so, so sorry --

TOM LONE groans, painfully coming to and sitting up. PATIENCE crouches at his side.

	Well, it's part of my job... I'm a detective, burglary-robbery division. So what did happen to you?

He applies the ice-pack to his head while eying her clothes. She suddenly becomes aware of her disheveled appearance.

LONE is now looking around the apartment, taking it all in with a careful detective's eye. He sees the shredded PHOTOGRAPHS, the BROKEN WINDOW, points --

	You should get that fixed.

She shudders. The sexy expression turns to one of shock and anxiety -- what has she done? Then, vamping:

CLOSE ON PATIENCE'S EYES -- they FLY OPEN, GOLD-FLECKED and (for a moment) ELLIPTICAL. PATIENCE -- now pure CATWOMAN -- springs down gracefully and scans the dark apartment. She stretches her limbs languorously, licks her lips. She flexes her fingers, watching appreciatively as her CLAWS EMERGE. She reaches out and SPEARS LONE'S CARD on a fingernail, regards it as she picks up the receiver. With another CLAW she unhesitatingly punches in the number. When she speaks, after a beat, her voice is throaty, sexier -- whenever she's Catwoman, she'll talk this way. During the following, she toys with the long PHONE CORD like a cat.

	Mmm, too bad you're not there... guess I'll have to go out and play by myself.

She tosses the receiver aside and prowls the room, moving casually atop the back of the couch, from there to other pieces of furniture and the counter, hops down to the floor. She studies the place as if seeing it for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE_CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a dump.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
PATIENCE plucks at the clothing she wears, frowning. She opens a DRESSER DRAWER and PAWS through the contents, like a cat digging in a litterbox, SHREDDING the clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE_CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ugh -- please -- frowsy --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She moves to a closet, throws open the door, rifling through the outfits, RIPPING them to bits, hurling them aside.
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE_CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn, I haven't got a thing to wear!

True -- she's emptied and trashed the closet, SLAMS the door.

EXT. TRENDY CLUB - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
THRONGS out front behind the velvet ropes. All eyes turn toward an approaching FIGURE whom we don't see at first... LOW ANGLE -- a sleek pair of black patent leather BOOTS appears. A purring rendition of a familiar children's tune:
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the cat came back, the very next day...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE UP SLOWLY to reveal the rest of the ensemble -- long legs in BLACK TIGHTS, the short SKIRT and bodice TOP of the dress. A WHIP is wrapped around her waist, the tip dangles almost like a tail. Her stride is confident, sexy.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The cat came back, they thought she was a goner...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Her arms are encased in long, satiny BLACK GLOVES. A half MASK with eyeholes and subtle cat's ears covers the top half of her face, her hair falls free like a mane behind.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the cat came back, she just wouldn't stay awa- a-ay...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CATWOMAN -- the former PATIENCE PRICE -- comes to a stop in front of the slack-jawed BOUNCER.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the word I'm looking for? Oh yes... Meow.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
So saying, she strokes a finger under the bouncer's chin -- CLOSE, the CLAW emerges from a SLIT in the glove's fingertip, but doesn't draw blood. THE BOUNCER recovers himself, unhooking the rope and stepping aside. Catwoman strides past him into the club.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRENDY CLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dramatic DECOR, throbbing MUSIC, DANCING TRENDIES. CATWOMAN moves confidently through the club. PATRONS can't help but stare, getting out of her path as she crosses the room. RANDY and SANDY, the rude couple, are bellied up to the bar. CATWOMAN slithers between them, almost unnoticed at first. RANDY starts as something FLICKS against his back -- CATWOMAN holds the end of her WHIP/TAIL, smacking it lightly against his rear end. He looks up at her.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buy me a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
SANDY stares daggers at Catwoman with her drooling boyfriend, but Catwoman ignores her, leaning close to the attentive BARTENDER and almost whispering:
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	White Russian, no ice, hold the vodka and Kahlua.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The man blinks, retreats to fill the order. SANDY taps Catwoman on the shoulder as she makes eyes at Randy.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. Excuse me, earth to slut -- he's taken.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Without looking at her, Catwoman COUGHS discreetly into her hand, then drops something in SANDY'S martini glass
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- SPLASH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE -- a FURBALL in the woman's drink. SANDY backs away, making a horrified noise.

<SANDY>

	Euw!

The bartender produces a SHOT-GLASS full of cream.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>

	Cream, straight up.

<DIRECTION>
Catwoman knocks this back, licks white residue from her lips.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's dance.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs RANDY by the lapel and drags him toward the dance floor -- not that he needs a lot of encouragement. CATWOMAN shoves the man onto the dance floor ahead of her. She begins to writhe sensuously to the music, instantly the center of attention. Catwoman's distinctive movements combine catlike grace with acrobatics and martial arts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RANDY does his best to keep up. He moves near, puts his hands on her ass. She hisses:
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't touch my tail.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CATWOMAN pulls her WHIP from around her waist, FLICKS it in the air -- Randy backs off. But Catwoman swings the whip so that the braided leather wraps repeatedly around his torso.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls him against her, clutches his butt -- then PUSHES HIM AWAY, spinning him out on the whip like a top -- his TROUSERS have been SHREDDED, the belt SLICED. His pants drop to his ankles, he stumbles back in his loud bikini underwear, losing his balance and falling. THE CROWD reacts, laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's enough for one night, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
HE LUNGES at her from behind, but she drops down and slithers out of his grasp -- it's like she's vanished into thin air -- then CATWOMAN rises behind him, plants a foot in his ass -- -- and boots him into the DJ'S STATION -- CRASH! MUSIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STOPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORE CLUB GOONS appear from the back, approach angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess the party's over.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CATWOMAN springs upward, atop a BANK OF SPEAKERS. She moves with incredible agility, near the roof of the club, from the speakers to a LIGHT RIG -- she leaps and grabs a MIRROR BALL, which SWINGS and deposits her close to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRENDY CLUB - NIGHT

CATWOMAN hurls open the front doors, kicks aside the velvet rope. She addresses the impatient CROWD:

<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon in, wanna-bes! Free drinks!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
THE CROWD stampedes the door. Catwoman struts away down the sidewalk, recoiling the whip around her waist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A couple of CLUB GOONS make it past the throng. CATWOMAN, moving onto a highway OVERPASS, notes she's being pursued. She puts a hand on the railing, and casually VAULTS OVER -- THE GOONS rush to the side, look out to see --

CATWOMAN strutting confidently down the narrow GUARDRAIL between the two directions of SPEEDING TRAFFIC.

She could be out for an evening stroll, ignoring the SCREECHING BRAKES, HORNS, and STARTLED DRIVERS. She gives them a wave without bothering to look over her shoulder.

EXT. TENEMENT ROOFTOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CHICKEN-WIRE DOOR explodes open and a FLOCK OF PIGEONS ROCKETS OUT of a COOP AT CAMERA. CATWOMAN emerges in a CLOUD OF FEATHERS, brushing a few stray ones off her outfit, with a cat-that-ate-the-canary smile. She cocks her head, listening in different directions for a new source of amusement -- snippets of VOICES, MUSIC, PLUMBING SFX, passing VEHICLES... it's like tuning a radio. Then she picks up a distant TINKLE of breaking GLASS --

INT. JEWELRY STORE - NIGHT

Dimly lit, an older, discount place. THIEF #1 methodically breaks DISPLAY CASES with a wrapped hammer, snatches up the contents -- necklaces, rings, etc. -- stuffing them into a
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he moves, a SHADOWY FIGURE -- CATWOMAN -- moves with him, looking over his shoulder, close enough to touch but unseen. Each time he turns his head, she has just slinked out of his view -- her timing is impeccable. THIEF #2, with a SHOTGUN, stands guard over a blindfolded, bound-and-gagged NIGHT WATCHMAN. CATWOMAN appears on the periphery of his vision, but when he turns his head she's disappeared behind a case -- she emerges on the other side just before he turns back. THIEF #3 is at work on a LOCKED STEEL CASE of DRAWERS with a BLOWTORCH and TOOLS. CATWOMAN STEPS LIGHTLY across the CASE above him, he looks up -- but there's nobody there. He returns to his work, gets the CASE open and pulls out a DRAWER revealing a RACK full of glittering DIAMONDS.

<THIEF_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up there!

THIEF #2 aims his SHOTGUN at -- CATWOMAN, perched on a narrow LEDGE at the ceiling moulding. She VAULTS down just as he FIRES, a SPRAY OF PLASTER. THIEF #2 pumps his shotgun, looking around frantically.
</DIRECTION>
<THIEF_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell was that?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CATWOMAN springs out from behind a DISPLAY CASE, gives Thief #2 a roundhouse KICK in the head that sends the man into a wall, knocking him cold. THIEF #1 pulls a HANDGUN, but the END OF THE WHIP wraps around it in a flash, yanks it from his hand. CATWOMAN SNAPS HER WHIP at Thief #1 and Thief #3, backing them into a corner. As she passes the tied-up GUARD, she uses her claws to SLASH his ropes. In time with WHIP CRACKS

	You boys -- thought you could just barge -- in here and take -- all these beautiful things -- that don't belong to you...

The guard quickly tears off his GAG and BLINDFOLD, untying his own feet, then picks up the fallen handgun and trains it on the thieves. We hear POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING. CATWOMAN meanwhile swiftly gathers up fallen jewels, sweeping them into the swag bag. She pauses for a moment, thoughtful.

	What a lovely idea.

With lightning speed, she vanishes out the back with the bag. THE GUARD, totally focused on the thieves, doesn't even register she's gone. THIEF #3 points --

CATWOMAN bounds out the exit, leaps atop BOXES, onto a window A/C UNIT, which totters with her weight, just as --

AN UNMARKED SEDAN screeches to a halt, and TOM LONE leaps out, GUN ready. He trains it on CATWOMAN --
</DIRECTION>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freeze!

<DIRECTION>
CATWOMAN freezes. She blinks down at LONE, he's got a clean shot at her. She cocks her head, licks her lips.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are cute.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
LONE blinks at this uncommon response to a pointed weapon, continues to play it by the book.
</DIRECTION>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a police officer!

	Obviously you don't know much about cats. I come when I want, not when I'm told.

With that, she SPRINGS to the rooftop -- the force of her leap knocks the A/C free of the window, LONE has to dive out of the way as it CRASHES to the ground.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She blinks and frowns at the SUNLIGHT. Where am I? She sits up and realizes -- she was sleeping against the belly of the BENGAL TIGER, lying on his side in his sunken ENCLOSURE. CATWOMAN SHRIEKS and leaps to her feet, terrified, yanks OFF HER MASK. With the daylight, she's back to being plain old PATIENCE. She looks down in shock at her revealing outfit; the swag bag is looped into the whip around her waist. She's awakened the TIGER. Patience lets out another frightened CRY as he eyes her, no longer recognizing her as a friend. The tiger GROWLS, gets to his feet menacingly, starts moving in for the kill. PATIENCE scrambles for a heavily LATCHED DOOR, which she frantically wrestles to open, getting through and SLAMMING IT just as the TIGER LUNGES --

A GLOVED HAND grips the edge of the DUMPSTER -- then CATWOMAN vaults over the side, lands on her haunches, ready to rumble. Her outfit has a banana peel stuck to it. She wrinkles her nose, plucks this off, CLUCKING her tongue. She turns to MIDNIGHT, prowling nearby.

She moves through the dimly lit, Spartan environment, able to see easily in the dark. She runs a CLAW over the strings of a GUITAR, finds a discarded button-down SHIRT, slips it on. She narrows her eyes when she finds a FRAMED PHOTO -- CLOSE -- TOM LONE with his arm around a pretty GIRL. Letting out a GROWL, CATWOMAN slashes out the girl's face. IN THE BATHROOM, she opens the medicine chest, picks up men's toiletries. Finding a bottle of COLOGNE, she sprays it in the air and sniffs, then makes a face, looking at the bottle

WIDER, CATWOMAN, now out of the camera's view, LEAPS up the side of the wall and lands on all fours atop it.

AT THE SIDE OF THE MANSION -- CATWOMAN scrambles up a trellis toward a second-story window. She leaps to the ledge, crouches, peering in. CLOSE as a razor-sharp CLAW emerges and CUTS a CIRCLE into a

HER POV - CATVISION

<DIRECTION>
The dark hallway GLOWS. An amplified NOISE from a distance... SNORING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON CATWOMAN'S HANDS

Her NAILS emerge from her gloved fingertips, ready to rumble. CATWOMAN rounds a corner toward a large formal staircase that wraps around a huge chandelier. She nears a door which is slightly ajar, pushes it open silently and enters --

INT. AVENAL MANSION - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV -- CATVISION, nearing a huge, curtained CANOPY BED. CATWOMAN slashes the curtain aside, to reveal -- TIPPY THE LAP DOG, curled up in the center of the otherwise unoccupied bed, SNORING away. The dog awakens, raises its head, and starts BARKING FURIOUSLY. CATWOMAN hisses at the creature. It cringes and shivers, seeking cover beneath a pillow.

INT. AVENAL MANSION - HALLWAY & FOYER - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
As CATWOMAN comes out of the bedroom, a FIGURE emerges from the darkness swinging a GOLF CLUB -- WHAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's struck hard in the back and the head -- she topples forward, ROLLS DOWN THE STAIRS. She hits a LANDING, curled up, dazed, clutching her skull. LIGHTS COME ON -- LAUREL looks down at her from the top of the stairs, wearing silk pajamas, golf club in hand. She descends cautiously, club raised. LAUREL tentatively pokes at the prone, black-clad Catwoman with her foot. CATWOMAN instantly SPRINGS UP. As Laurel starts to bring the club down, Catwoman grabs it and yanks it away, hurling it into the foyer below, then grabs LAUREL and slams her against the wall. Laurel seems utterly terrified -

CATWOMAN studies the frightened woman, easing her grip. Laurel drops the act, and with a martial arts SHRIEK drives a KNEE and a FIST into Catwoman in rapid succession -- CATWOMAN flies over the banister, grabbing a hold of the chandelier. It swings in the open foyer -- THE CHAIN creaks ominously, starts to rip from the ceiling -- CATWOMAN snaps the whip around an upper BALUSTRADE, just as -
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CHANDELIER rips loose from the ceiling. As it CRASHES to the ground, CATWOMAN swings back at LAUREL and -- KICKS HER in the chest. LAUREL goes down hard on the stairs. CATWOMAN stands over her. LAUREL looks up at her, outraged. The two women are of similar size and shape, well-matched.
</DIRECTION>
<LAUREL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was Venetian crystal, you bitch --

LAUREL launches a karate KICK at her, CATWOMAN deflects it, lands a blow of her own.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A bitch is a dog.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The two engage in martial arts combat, moving down the stairs into the marble foyer. They exchange lines between BLOWS:

<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're tougher than you look.

	Took classes when I was modeling in Hong Kong.

(lands a good one, then:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it, I broke a nail.
	</DIALOGUE>

She's a skilled fighter, but CATWOMAN is faster, more nimble, able to avoid her attacks. Laurel suddenly pauses, looking winded, ready to give up the fight.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had enough?

(nods, eying her outfit)

	Is that a Gaultier?

Catwoman looks down at her clothes, giving Laurel the chance to grab a VASE OF FLOWERS, which she hurls at her -- IT SHATTERS, soaking Catwoman. She shakes off water.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate water.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly enraged, she lunges toward LAUREL, who hits the ground -- but CATWOMAN springs over her head, up to the landing where the LAPDOG yaps. She snatches it up by its collar, bares her CLAWS near its face. THE DOG shuts up, petrified.
</DIRECTION>
<LAUREL>

	No, please -- not Tippy!

CATWOMAN slowly puts the dog down, it scampers upstairs.

CATWOMAN springs back down, shoves Laurel against a wall, flexing her CLAWS.

	Georges doesn't love me! I don't know if he ever did --

<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How sad. I'd cry if I cared.

	He never took me seriously, I was just a, a trophy. And now he's bored, he found himself a new toy --

	I can't wait that long. I want him now.

	I swear I don't know where he is, he's left me! Oh God, my career is in the toilet, my whole life is over -- go ahead, tear me to pieces --

LAUREL is beginning to get hysterical. Catwoman lets out a frustrated GROWL and lets go of her, this is useless. She starts for the door, Laurel sniffs back tears then follows.

	Wait... try the factory. I think that's where he meets Drano, his new mistress.

A small crew of NIGHT WORKERS wearing JUMPERS and PAPER MASKS tend the elaborate industrial MACHINERY, it's DEAFENING here.

OVERHEAD, amidst DUCTING and PIPES, CATWOMAN is on the move. HER CLAWS rake across a row of RUBBER TUBES, which spray multi-colored FLUIDS.

HER GLOVED HANDS spin hydraulic VALVES. HER BOOT kicks a CONVEYOR BELT WHEEL, twisting it sideways -- the BELT JAMS, SMOKE rises from the clogged gears. A PANEL slides open over a bank of SWITCHES and WHACK-IT buttons. Her gloved fingers start HITTING THEM at random.

WITH A WORKER DRONE, CLICKING a hand counter by rote as CASES of neatly-packed jars of NAIL POLISH pass by his station. The man is half-asleep. A CASE COMES BY, a bit crooked on the belt, which is beginning to VIBRATE... The next CASE is missing half its bottles. An ALARM BLEEPS, RED LIGHTS FLASHING in b.g. The next CASE is filled with BROKEN GLASS, DRENCHED in NAIL POLISH -- it gets his attention. He THROWS LEVERS to stop the belt. WIDER, THE FACTORY is in CHAOS. STEAM shoots out of PRESSURE TUBES, COLORED LIQUIDS bubble out of overflowing TANKS, FACE POWDER sprays into the air from a disconnected HOSE. WORKERS dash about frantically, SHOUTING and PANICKED.

As the guards near, she drops the walkie-talkie, LEAPS and WRAPS the WHIP around a PIPE above the WINDOW, SWINGING right past George, CLAWS EXTENDED -- -- LEAVING FIVE SCRATCH MARKS in the glass right in front of his face. He jumps backwards instinctively. She lands on a catwalk, near more GUARDS. They move in brandishing NIGHTSTICKS. HIGH-ANGLE as the guards surround CATWOMAN -- no easy escape.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, kitty kitty...

CATWOMAN bares her teeth, lets out a menacing HISS. A NIGHTSTICK swings at her, she easily dodges the blow, bending backwards in a way impossible for a mere mortal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another guard SWINGS at her, she grabs the end of the nightstick and pulls him toward her, snatching a can of MACE off his belt and BLASTING him in the face with it. He's blinded, lets out a cry as she tosses him aside. THE OTHERS come at her at once. CATWOMAN plays them against each other, LEAPING and DODGING, landing KICKS in their CHESTS, leaving Zorro-like SCRATCH MARKS across their uniforms whenever she gets the chance. WITH GEORGES and DRINA, awed by the martial arts display.

	Ow! You fight like a girl!

So saying, she shoves another GUARD into the path of a swinging STICK, which knocks him unconscious. She SOMERSAULTS over the heads of the remaining attackers, she's about to get away when GEORGES' VOICE erupts over a PA.

BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! ANGEL has appeared on the catwalk, brandishing a HANDGUN, FIRING wildly. CATWOMAN dodges and dives from the catwalk, landing --

<DIRECTION>
-- on her feet on a narrow PIPE below, one amongst several. She moves quickly, leaping easily from pipe to pipe -- ANGEL'S BULLETS barely miss her, RICOCHETING, causing GUARDS and WORKERS below to dive for cover. One BULLET STRIKES the rumbling DISTILLATION VAT --

HUNDREDS OF GLEAMING EYES.

CATWOMAN flips on a WALL-SWITCH -- -- revealing GLASS-WALLED CAGES containing SQUEAKING BLACK RATS. CATWOMAN instinctively HISSES and SWIPES A CLAW in their direction -- they shrink back from the glass. MANY HUGE DRUMS stenciled "YP-3" are stored against a far wall, near HOODED CLEAN SUITS and BIOHAZARD SIGNS. CATWOMAN spots a LIST of names and numbers on a bulletin board.

They speak in rapid SPANISH, examining the guns, sighting them, etc. XAVIER excuses himself to answer a ringing CELL PHONE. He speaks with a vague European ACCENT.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Impossible -- there are issues of transport, available funds --

<WESLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're willing to adjust the price. But if you can't pick up the goods tomorrow, we'll have to take our business elsewhere.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	This costumed criminal has now added murder to her resume of mischief and mayhem...

REVERSE ANGLE -- PATIENCE, sprawled on the couch in baggy sweat-clothes, reacts to this with a stunned expression. ON TV, "NEWS VIDEO" of SANDY from the club.

<SANDY>

	-- she attacked us for no reason! And her outfit, I mean, that whole S & M thing is so 90s --

THE DOORBELL RINGS, PATIENCE moves to answer, attention still on the TV. She throws the door open quickly --

TOM LONE takes a step backward, hands up defensively.

Patience looks from Lone to the TV behind her --
</DIRECTION>
<NEWSCASTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Catwoman. Who is she?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
PATIENCE quickly grabs a remote and FLIPS OFF the TV. She then looks back at Lone, remembering.
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I -- I'll only be a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She quickly grabs some clothing, darts toward the bathroom. At the last moment she spots the CAT MASK on the floor and -- -- KICKS it UNDER THE COUCH as she moves into the bathroom. LONE steps inside, can see his apartment across the way. He calls through the half-open door as she changes:
</DIRECTION>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the way, last night -- you didn't happen to see or hear anything -- my apartment was broken into.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sorry -- I never look out the window.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Weird, they didn't take anything, just broke a bottle of after-shave and slashed a picture of my sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
WITH PATIENCE, getting dressed. She smiles, delighted.
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your sister, that's --

<DIRECTION>
(catching herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- really a shame.
	</DIALOGUE>

LONE has moved to the kitchen table, where the numerous RESEARCH BOOKS and HANDWRITTEN NOTES are spread out. ANGLE ON BOOK -- A diagram of a BACTERIA, a drawing of a RAT, the entry "YERSINIA PESTIS."

<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's Yersinia Pestis?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Bubonic plague.

	Bubonic plague? Why are you -- ?

<DIRECTION>
ON PATIENCE as she exits the bathroom, looking good.
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's sort of a hobby of mine...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She trails off, stopping in her tracks as she sees LONE, who's holding up her WHIP with a dubious expression.
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE>
<DIRECTION>
(off-handedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I had kind of a kinky boyfriend once.

PATIENCE takes the whip and casually tosses it aside, but Lone's suspicions are fully aroused.

INT. SUSHI BAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WAITER comes through a BEADED CURTAIN, passing LONE and PATIENCE seated nearby, drinks before them. The curtain RATTLES after him, distracting PATIENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what've you been up to lately?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me? Oh. Not much. You know, sitting around my apartment, watching television.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As she speaks, she involuntarily BATS like a kitten at the swinging CURTAIN.
</DIRECTION>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that so hard to believe? What about you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Catwoman.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Patience starts, folds her hands in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the case I've been working on.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah. I guess I heard about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not surprised. Talk about your media circus.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, she is interesting, isn't she? Kind of a... colorful character?
	</DIALOGUE>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a thief and a killer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>

(heatedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(covering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean -- whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
LONE seems a little taken aback at her vehemence. Just then, a JAPANESE WAITER places a HUGE TRAY OF SUSHI between them.
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess I went a little crazy ordering.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's refreshing. A lot of women won't let a man see them eat.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, then we go home and binge on Haagan-Dazs.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
During the following, Lone meticulously mixes soy sauce and wasabi, uses chopsticks, etc. Patience simply peels the fish off the rice and pops it in her mouth, as if eating potato chips, then licking her fingers like a cat licking its paw.
</DIRECTION>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do hide things, don't you. You may seem all sweet and shy, but you've got a secret wild side.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Women in general, you mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Women in general...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(watching her reaction)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I actually saw Catwoman the other night. From a distance. Goofy costume.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? I heard it was... sexy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it could be sexier... with what, maybe a wide belt?
	</DIALOGUE>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why so interested?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You brought it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
LONE studies her for a few seconds. He seems on the verge of saying something important. But instead:
</DIRECTION>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want that toro?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
LONE is already reaching for another piece of sushi -- with lightning reflexes, PATIENCE grabs his hand to stop him -- he looks up at her, surprised. She backs off with a smile:
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No no, it's yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She eyes the fish hungrily as he eats it.

LONE and PATIENCE walk close together, near the water.

<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Catwoman again?

<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Afraid so. But I have a feeling she'll be in custody within the week.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>
<DIRECTION>
(alarmed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you say that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Individuals who feel compelled to act out through an animal alter-ego -- bats, birds, bugs, there have been a number of cases in other cities -- they catch themselves. Take too many risks, think they can play with the cops. See, they like to be watched...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He's staring right at her now. Patience looks away. HER POV -- THE SUN GETTING LOW, vanishing behind a cloud. CLOSE, PATIENCE'S PUPILS become ELLIPTICAL for a blink. LONE pauses, standing close.
</DIRECTION>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. Seems like all I can do is talk about work.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
PATIENCE spins on him, a glint in her eye.
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So stop talking.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
So saying, she throws her arm around his neck, the other around his back, pulls him close for a KISS. Lone takes only a moment to respond -- it's a good one -- until -- CLOSE ON LONE'S BACK as her CLAWS involuntarily emerge, tearing right through his shirt and an inch down his back --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONE jerks away, looking back over his shoulder --
</DIRECTION>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ow!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
PATIENCE clutches her hands to her face, horrified at what she's done, starts backing away --
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm really sorry, I don't know what got into me, I -- I've got to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She's on the run. A moment later, the surprised Lone pursues, rounding a corner...
</DIRECTION>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patience, wait --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
But she's already vanished.

PATIENCE is breathing hard, blinking rapidly, as she paces Edna's floor. Edna follows nervously, trying to calm her.
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's happening, it's happening again. It's not even dark yet -- you said she could only come out at night!
	</DIALOGUE>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say that! Patience, you made these rules up yourself -- a cat is a cat 24 hours a day, they just go hunting at night --
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she's after Georges Avenal -- if she finds him, she's going to kill him, I know it --

	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop talking about her like she's someone else! She's you!

A beat -- Patience is in denial about this.

<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Edna, you've gotta... tie me up or something, lock me in the attic --
	</DIALOGUE>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have an attic --

EXT./INT. EDNA'S HOME - STORM CELLAR - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
EDNA stands in the opening of the angled storm cellar doorway, looking down the stairs sadly.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure you don't need a blanket, dear?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ON PATIENCE, at the foot of the stairs in this cold, dank space, hugging herself, rocking back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just... lock... the door.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Edna quickly CLOSES the door, throws a BOLT. It's extremely DARK down below. Patience starts to pace. We see her features contort with pain as she fights this interior battle. During this monologue, her voice becomes huskier, more Catwoman-like.
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not a bad person... I'm not a killer... I'm not evil... not like Georges Aaavenal...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
His name becomes a harsh GROWL. She fights to get a grip.
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a murderer... he did this to me... it's all his fault.

Her eyes FLICKER, elliptical for a moment --

INT. EDNA'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

AN UNEARTHLY HOWL ECHOES throughout the place from heater vents in the floor. In response, THE CATS go nuts -- prowling, pacing, bouncing off the walls, picking up the CRY.

INT. EDNA'S HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

EDNA sits at her table over a simple meal, attempts to read a CAT FANCY MAGAZINE, but it's pretty hopeless. She shuts her eyes, covers her ears.

The sour NEIGHBOR pokes her head out an OPEN WINDOW.

	Edna, I've had it with your damn cats! I'm calling the cops!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She SLAMS the window SHUT. CAMERA MOVES to find -- -- THE STORM DOORS, bolted shut. MIDNIGHT ENTERS FRAME, begins to CLAW at the metal, slowly working the BOLT free. EDNA emerges, sees what's happening, dashes over. She carries a PADLOCK.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Midnight! Shoo!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Midnight HISSES, but retreats sulkily. Edna reaches the nearly free bolt, is about to replace it and lock it when she hears a small, timid VOICE from below, through the door:
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Edna? Edna, is that you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, dear, I'm here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Edna, it worked. I think... I think I've beaten her. I'm Patience again. I've won.
	</DIALOGUE>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm so glad...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Edna looks terribly relieved as she throws aside the bolt and begins to open the cellar door. But before she can -- -- THE DOOR FLIES OPEN, knocking her off her feet. A FIGURE STREAKS PAST. We hear her voice as she retreats:

INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
A BALLET in progress -- "Giselle." Lithe DANCERS spin gracefully across the stage, a rustic village setting. FIND a HIGH BOX to one side. GEORGES and DRINA, in formal clothes. GEORGES is absorbed in the performance, DRINA looks bored, wrinkles her nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DRINA>

DRINA makes a SNORING NOISE, puts on a WALKMAN, and is soon bobbing her head to faint ROCK MUSIC.

EXT. CITY STREET - CONCERT HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BALLET MUSIC CONTINUES OVER. A CITY BUS passes, an AD FOR AVENAL on the side -- it's been VANDALIZED, CLAW MARKS across the length of it. CRANE UP to find CATWOMAN crouched on the roof of the bus. She leaps off from the still-moving bus -- -- onto the ROOF of a TAXI passing the other way -- -- and finally landing at the curb near -- A classical-looking CONCERT HALL, FOUNTAINS in front. CATWOMAN creeps amongst bushes, approaching the building. Numerous COPS patrol the entrance -- no way to get past them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CATWOMAN creeps around the perimeter, looking for another way in. By the curb she spots -- ANGEL, alone, near a parked LIMOUSINE, lighting a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those things'll kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She SMACKS the cigarette out of his hand, BOOTS him into the BUSHES and leaps on top of him.

IN THE BUSHES, CATWOMAN straddles ANGEL, bangs his head against a cement curb.

She BANGS his head hard again, ANGEL loses consciousness.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for your help.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CATWOMAN moves around the side of the building, keeping low, ducking behind parked cars. Fewer COPS here, but the place looks impregnable, no way to scale the walls. She tries an EMERGENCY DOOR -- locked, no good. She hisses in frustration, starts to move on when -- THE DOOR OPENS behind her. CATWOMAN spins to see -- LAUREL, her face hidden with dark glasses and a wide-brimmed hat. She gestures frantically. Catwoman darts inside.

Laurel leads Catwoman through this basement boiler room.

	He's with his bimbo in a box to the right of the stage. But there's all kinds of security -- he's pretty scared of you.

<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He should be. How much do you know about your husband's operation?
	</DIALOGUE>
<LAUREL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know he's built an empire out of women's inadequacy and self-hatred --
	</DIALOGUE>
<CATWOMAN>

	Yeah, yeah, but the secret ingredient in his face cream -- it's black plague bacteria. He's selling it to an arms dealer.

	And he's committed murder to protect his secret.

	Nothing he does would surprise me anymore. He's a monster. You should've seen the pre-nup, I don't get a dime --

CATWOMAN has reached an emergency STAIRCASE, cuts her off, bolting upward.

CATWOMAN slinks along a hallway, past a couple of bored young USHERS. They give her a sidelong look.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cats is next month...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
UNIFORM COPS are clustered near a FORMAL STAIRCASE, blocking her access to the right-hand side of the hall. CATWOMAN bares her teeth in frustration. She hurries toward a VELVET ROPE, the sign, "BOXES - PRIVATE." She slips past the rope, moves to a far door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN OLD COUPLE SNORE through the ballet. CATWOMAN appears behind them in the box, snatches OPERA GLASSES from the woman's lap and scans the hall -- HER POV, ZOOMING from box to box -- finding GEORGES in a box on the opposite side of the hall. DRINA is rising, heading out the door. CATWOMAN climbs up the CURTAINS around the box, levering herself upward to the elaborate FRIEZE that wraps around the top of the hall -- GREEK GODS in various dramatic poses. WIDER, FROM BELOW, as CATWOMAN climbs and creeps near the ceiling, moving over the PROSCENIUM ARCH above the stage, heading toward GEORGES. A POLICEMAN at ground level spots her -- he lifts a radio to his lips, calling for backup.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BALLET below is reaching a crescendo. COPS are filing in from the back of the theatre, trying to be discreet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH GEORGES, still absorbed in the ballet. Suddenly CATWOMAN lands in the empty seat beside him, staring at the stage herself. A whisper:
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love this part.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
GEORGES spins, startled -- and she SLASHES HIM across his cheek. The MUSIC is so loud, no one hears his CRY OF PAIN. GEORGES rushes for the exit -- but CATWOMAN gets there first, shoves a CHAIR under the doors.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's not be interrupted.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She advances on him, BLOOD drips from the SLASHES on his cheek, staining his tuxedo shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Red's a good color on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
At that, she grabs Georges and slams him against the wall of the box, behind a curtain, partly concealed from view. The DOOR RATTLES, increasingly hard. CLOSE as CATWOMAN wraps a hand around Georges' throat, the CLAW TIPS digging into his skin. He gasps:

	Why -- why kill me?

	Because you deserve it. And because I can.

THROUGH BINOCULARS -- CATWOMAN holding Georges, but still not delivering the deathblow. LAUREL spies from the back of the theatre. Under her breath:
</DIRECTION>
<LAUREL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon honey... just do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CATWOMAN'S HAND trembles on Georges' throat. His eyes well up with tears, his expression pleading, desperate. Suddenly
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CATWOMAN releases him, throws him GASPING to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it. I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
THE CHAIR SPLINTERS and the DOOR flies open, ARMED POLICE with DRINA behind them. CATWOMAN leaps to the lip of the box, turns and HISSES, then
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- jumps down to the middle of the stage, amidst the DANCERS. AUDIENCE UPROAR, MUSIC STOPS, COPS charge up the aisles -- CATWOMAN does a pirouette, bows and bolts into the wings. After a puzzled BEAT, the CONDUCTOR waves his baton and gets the show going again. LAUREL looks agonized -- Catwoman was so close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONCERT HALL - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC CONTINUES as CATWOMAN darts between stored PROPS and FLATS from a GRAVEYARD SCENE, bowling over costumed DANCERS. Seeing POLICEMEN blocking an exit, she dodges between DROPS, scrambles up a FLY-LINE -- POLICE track her from below -- she leaps between sandbagged ROPES as the BAGS drop, scrambling higher onto the GRID --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT

ON STAGE, inappropriate SCRIMS and PROPS descend and rise again. DANCERS dodge and weave as a GIANT GARBAGE CAN (think Cats) descends in the midst of the VILLAGE SQUARE.

INT. CONCERT HALL - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CATWOMAN darts effortlessly across the overhead grid, when --
</DIRECTION>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freeze!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
TOM LONE, anticipating her move, has climbed a ladder to the grid. He trains a gun on her -- CATWOMAN freezes. She stares at him, breathing hard, taking a moment to come to grips with this adversary. LONE advances on her, stepping gingerly.
</DIRECTION>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're under arrest --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He steps on a flimsy support, which starts to give way. Catwoman is alarmed.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch out!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
LONE sways, losing his balance, she springs and grabs his gun arm, saving him. A beat as they look at each other, then -- -- she SNATCHES the gun out of his hand, tosses it aside, then grabs his tie and pulls his face to her to LICK his cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tag, you're it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She bounds away, comfortable on the narrow railings. Lone pursues, moving more carefully now. Accompanied by the ballet music, the two perform their private dance, high above the TOMBSTONES and GRAVES. CATWOMAN winds up in a corner on a MESH PLATFORM, no way out from here, but for a 25-foot drop to -- THE FLOOR, where POLICE await, pointing upward. LONE advances, he has her trapped. He pulls HANDCUFFS.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Handcuffs. Yummy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He lunges at her -- she dodges, kicks a leg out from under him. No slouch at fighting, Lone recovers, plants a kick in her mid-section. She gasps, surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You play rough.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't a game.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He charges at her, but she parries a blow, lands a SLASH across his shoulder. As he comes at her again, she jumps and grabs an overhead ELECTRICAL cable, swinging away --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lone has too much momentum, he loses balance, about to go over the edge -- CATWOMAN swings back like a pendulum, wrapping her legs around his neck, saving him from falling. She swings him back over the platform, tries to kick him off, but he grabs her legs, pulling her and SNAPPING THE CABLE -- STAGE LIGHTS go out, ELECTRICAL SPARKS fly as they hit the platform together, she lands straddling him, catching the SPARKING CABLE just before it strikes the mesh.
</DIRECTION>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be careful! That thing hits the metal, we're both fried!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CATWOMAN leans close, whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew there was a spark between us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and flings the cable away, it dangles free of the mesh floor, still spitting SPARKS. A second later, CLICK -- LONE has slapped a handcuff on her wrist, CLICKS the other cuff over his own. CATWOMAN spins back on him, looking hurt. He reaches to pull off her mask. She slaps his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, it's our first date. I wouldn't want the mystery to go out of our relationship.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
LONE struggles to push her off, but she keeps her thighs locked around him. He finally rolls on top of her.
</DIRECTION>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't have a relationship.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CATWOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(mock sadness)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You men love the chase, but once you catch us, you always lose interest.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As she speaks, CLOSE on her cuffed hand -- her fingers squeeze together, her hand slithers out of the cuff like a cat's paw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONE rises, tries to pull Catwoman to her feet -- but he comes up with an empty, dangling HANDCUFF. From the ground, CATWOMAN plants a kick in his back from behind, he falls forward and SLAMS his FACE HARD into a LIGHT RIG. Catwoman winces, sounding a lot like Patience:
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She's on her feet, ready to scamper off, but -- MORE COPS have made it to the grid, blocking every way down -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE DOWN, COPS have covered every exit below. LONE glares up at her.
</DIRECTION>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's over.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And here I thought we were hitting it off...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
With that, she leaps and grabs the dangling POWER LINE which TEARS LOOSE from the ceiling -- She DROPS to the floor, still holding the CABLE. COPS surround her, moving in quickly, guns drawn -- She backs toward the wall, near a CIRCUIT BREAKER PANEL.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show of hands -- who can see in the dark?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She lifts her own hand daintily, then violently SWINGS THE POWER CABLE into the CIRCUIT BREAKERS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FLASH, a BANG, a SHOWER OF SPARKS -- then -- PITCH DARKNESS. We hear SHOUTS from the theatre, people PANICKING, and a series of GRUNTS and OOFS as Catwoman takes out the nearest adversaries -- CATWOMAN POV -- CATVISION, FIGURES have a pale outline, their EYES GLOW, as CATWOMAN dispatches her unseeing opponents.

EXT. CONCERT HALL - STAGE DOOR & SIDE STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

A SIDE DOOR swings open and CATWOMAN darts out. She's almost home free when SHOTS RING OUT behind her -- ANGEL, staggering out from the bushes where she clocked him, FIRES his handgun after her. CATWOMAN stumbles and rolls, but keeps moving.

INT. EDNA'S HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDNA holds a few CATS in her arms, WEEPING quietly, tissue close at hand. There's a sound of SCRATCHING at the window, she moves to open it, revealing -- CATWOMAN, exhausted and bruised from her battle. She crawls in the window, as Edna stares in astonishment.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patience?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not exactly.
	</DIALOGUE>

She throws herself on the end of the bed, curling up with the other cats, examining her injuries. She finds a bloody GASH where Angel's bullet grazed her skin. EDNA moves closer.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh dear. You've been shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Edna hurries into the bathroom and emerges with a small FIRST-AID KIT, begins tending to Catwoman's wound, still sniffling.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's nothing to cry about.

<EDNA>

	No, it's my cats. Last night, all that noise -- the neighbors complained. Animal Control says they're a health hazard...

EDNA studies Catwoman, speaks softly, worried.

	Did you do it? Did you kill him?

CATWOMAN shakes her head, disgusted with herself.

<CATWOMAN>

	I wanted to -- but I couldn't. I actually... felt sorry for him.

He takes a few steps back as -- -- a PAIR OF PATROL CARS SCREECH to a halt, coming up on the sidewalk in front of Patience's building. COPS armed with SHOTGUNS leap out, train their weapons on her.
</DIRECTION>
<PATROL_COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hands in the air!

TWO MORE COPS throw open the entrance door behind her, HANDGUNS ready. PATIENCE, cornered, looks shocked and betrayed. She raises her hands timidly. LONE removes his shades -- we now see he has a nasty BLACK EYE, his face swollen. Still, a hint of regret in his voice:

LONE is unbuttoning his shirt. He pulls down one side to reveal his shoulder.

	These scratches were inflicted last night by Catwoman. Forensics also tested this scratch --

He turns around to show the claw-mark she left when they kissed. He turns to face her, rebuttoning his shirt.

	They were made by the same implement.

	So this whole time, you've been flirting, buying me dinner, acting like you were interested -- I was a suspect? It was just some cat and mouse thing?

LONE's a little offended, his tone becomes more aggrieved:

	No, not at first -- I really bought the act, vulnerable girl all alone in the big city --

PATIENCE/CATWOMAN enters in her JAIL JUMPSUIT -- she can't fight her way through, so she tries a different approach. She moves stealthily through the room, using her heightened reflexes to avoid being seen. It's an intricate choreography of split-second timing, turned heads and diverted glances. She ducks down to crouch as a CART PASSES... A PLAINCLOTHES COP spins idly in his swivel chair, PATIENCE/CATWOMAN circles behind him.... PATIENCE/ CATWOMAN rolls a signed BASEBALL across a desktop, knocking over a PENCIL CUP.

THE REAL CATWOMAN. She paces, breathing hard, steeling herself for something, looking toward the Avenal building. A WINDOW WASHER RIG hangs halfway down the building, but it's quite a distance from this roof edge.
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can do this... right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She's addressing MIDNIGHT, who non-commitally licks a paw. CATWOMAN moves to the far end of the roof and sprints toward the edge, leaps for all she's worth -- CATWOMAN sails through the air in a perfect arc, toward the window-washer rig... but she's going to fall short and plunge twenty stories. At the last second, she pulls out her whip and snaps it out around -- -- the cables of the rig. CATWOMAN SLAMS HARD against the side of the building, dangling from the whip.

She struggles to pull herself upward.

An ALUMINUM SUITCASE opens -- STACKS of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. WIDER, WESLEY handles the suitcase. He starts to count the stacks of money, testing random bills with a COUNTERFEIT PEN. Meanwhile, Xavier's MERCS are moving aside the LADDERS and PAINT CANS. One yanks down the frilly DRAPERIES to reveal -- CANISTERS OF YP-3, dozens of them in a cutout portion of wall, more than we've seen before. Laurel's been hiding them here all along. Xavier opens his briefcase -- there's a TESTING KIT inside.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
So saying, XAVIER plucks a WHITE ROSE from an arrangement. He seals it into a clear PLASTIC CONTAINER, moves to a random canister, and attaches a NOZZLE tightly to the VALVE. Cautiously, he releases a small amount of PRESSURIZED LIQUID into the container. CLOSE -- as the MIST makes contact with the ROSE, the PETALS turn PINK, then RED BLOTCHES appear. Abruptly, the petals BLACKEN, WITHER and ULCERATE. The flower is a shriveled mess in seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
XAVIER carefully removes the nozzle, nodding appreciatively at the canisters.

THE MERCS, with slightly nervous looks, begin carefully moving the canisters out of the penthouse, up the stairs to the helicopter. THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN -- it's ANGEL.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look what I found.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He lifts the semi-conscious LONE from the floor -- the man's been bound, gagged and blindfolded with DUCT TAPE, there's a bruise on his head. ANGEL flashes LONE'S BADGE.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a cop. Found him sniffing around the basement.

THE MERCS methodically move canisters from the penthouse, up the stairs, to the CHOPPER on the helipad, where a PILOT waits at the controls -- the ROTOR BLADES spin lazily. MERCENARY #1, winded, calls to the PILOT, who's absorbed in a copy of SOLDIER OF FORTUNE:

MERCENARY #1 exchanges a look with MERCENARY #2, shakes his head, deposits his canister in the chopper. As he moves back for the stairs he hears moving HYDRAULICS. He heads toward the far edge of the helipad, WEAPON ready. He sees the MOVING CABLES of the window washing rig come to a STOP, he looks cautiously over the edge... HIS POV -- the PLATFORM has come to a stop just a few feet below the rooftop. But it's empty. ANOTHER ANGLE -- CATWOMAN is clawing her way around the corner of the building, just below a narrow CORNICE. She's dangling precipitously over a forty story fall. She approaches a WINDOW into the PENTHOUSE below the helipad. CATWOMAN POV -- on LAUREL in the CATWOMAN suit, chatting with XAVIER while the MERCS ferry YP-3. ON CATWOMAN, her eyes widen with the realization -- Laurel?!

MERCENARIES #3 and #4 are in the back of the chopper, securing the canisters. #1 and #2 head toward the stairs, for another load. MERCENARY #1, in the rear, passes a low A.C. DUCT. THE WHIP LASHES out from behind him, wraps around his throat -- he can't cry out as it YANKS him back behind the duct. We hear a nasty THUNK. One down. ON THE STAIRS, MERCENARY #2 turns around.

XAVIER and LAUREL have their backs to the stairs, SMOKING their CIGARS, as the unconscious MERCENARY hits the ground a short distance behind them. They don't notice. Laurel stretches her arms luxuriously, enjoying the feel of the wind. Xavier studies Laurel, a bit lasciviously.

All spin to see -- CATWOMAN standing at the edge of the helipad, above the sheer drop, holding THE TWO SUITCASES out to either side of her. She has a lit CIGAR clenched between her teeth. Behind her, the SKY is LIGHTENING with approaching dawn. ALL GUNS are trained on Catwoman, except Laurel's.
</DIRECTION>
<LAUREL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't shoot, you idiots! She'll drop the money--

</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Henchmen, Laurel? How tacky.

<DIRECTION>
She jerks one of the cases -- the latch has been loosened, it POPS OPEN and CASH GOES FLYING into the wind -- DRIFTING from the rooftop to the city streets below. LAUREL reacts in agony.
</DIRECTION>
<LAUREL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, please-- don't do that again!

CATWOMAN drops the emptied case and pulls the cigar from her mouth with a distasteful expression. Eying Laurel:

<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you hate it when somebody shows up at a party wearing the same dress?

LAUREL advances on Catwoman.

<LAUREL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's face it -- we're alike, you and me.

Catwoman ignores her, shouts to XAVIER and his men:
</DIRECTION>
<CATWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys gotta be careful with this YP-3 stuff. It's a living thing, you know, a bacteria. If it gets too hot -- it dies.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
XAVIER looks from Catwoman to the FUEL pooling on the helipad, putting two and two together. He jerks his head at his mercs -- they start backing away toward the stairs. LAUREL is still focused on the money.
</DIRECTION>
<LAUREL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's split the rest of the money -- and there's more where that came from --

So saying, she flicks the LIT CIGAR to the helipad -- IGNITING the spreading pool of gasoline -- XAVIER ET AL. sprint to LEAP OFF THE HELIPAD or CHARGE DOWN THE STAIRS as -- THE HELICOPTER EXPLODES in a glorious FIREBALL. LAUREL is thrown across the helipad by the BLAST, showered with CHOPPER DEBRIS. The men are hightailing it out of there, but Laurel gets slowly to her feet, machine gun ready, bent on revenge. Spotting CATWOMAN darting through the SMOKE and FLAMES toward the stairs, LAUREL FIRES a volley with a SCREAM of rage and charges after her in pursuit.

WHAM! LAUREL gets in a devastating BLOW that sends CATWOMAN reeling. At the same moment, LONE KICKS OPEN the CLOSET DOOR. He's still gagged and blindfolded, hands and feet bound, but he's struggling, GRUNTING now. CATWOMAN takes this in, shocked. She moves to Lone's side.

PATIENCE/CATWOMAN runs to Lone's side, pulling him away from the spreading flames toward the ELEVATOR. She SLASHES the tape that binds his wrists. LAUREL, meanwhile, opens a hidden COMPARTMENT by her mirror, revealing numerous LATEX MASKS.

Filled with CARDBOARD BOXES. MOVING MEN carry a few out. SALLY is ostensibly lending a hand, but is mostly interested in the men's muscles. As she picks up a tiny box --
</DIRECTION>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look awfully hot. Sure you don't wanna take that shirt off?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
SALLY winks at PATIENCE as she follows the man out the door. Patience looks good, no trace of the old awkwardness -- she's integrated her cat side. The PHONE RINGS, she snatches it up in a swift, feline fashion.
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
<LONE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(filter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Patience.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Patience turns -- LONE stares from his window across the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT WITH:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LONE'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He and Patience maintain eye contact while they speak.
</DIRECTION>
<LONE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(on phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Moving out?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(on phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are a good detective. It just feels like time for a change.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where you heading?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? You still keeping tabs on me? Said on TV the Catwoman case was closed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm. No hard feelings...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah. In a way, it was flattering.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Funny thing, no one at the station remembers letting you out of jail.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's bureaucracy for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(changing the subject)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hard to believe, Catwoman was Laurel Avenal all along.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh. It is pretty hard to believe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
There's a significant pause, they eye each other across the alley. Lone knows, and Patience knows he knows. In unison:
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATIENCE>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They laugh at this, take a moment to recover. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dinner the other night. How about you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For... teaching me some things. Listen, Patience - - if you're still interested -- I'd like to get to know you better.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
MIDNIGHT LEAPS UP onto Patience's shoulder, nuzzles her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you never really know anybody. Not completely.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I had that coming... Look, I know it's not simple, I'm a cop and you're...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A dull accountant.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I'm saying is -- whatever you are, however... complicated -- I can deal with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<LONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to try. I just don't want this to be good-bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATIENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... I have a feeling we'll see each other again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She HANGS UP, rolls her shoulders and lets out a little PURR. WITH LONE, he smiles, putting the phone down himself as Patience moves away from the window. WITH PATIENCE, MOVE to find the CAT MASK as she places it on top of stacks of slightly FIRE-DAMAGED $100 DOLLAR BILLS and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSES THE SUITCASE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
