<DIRECTION>
FULL SCREEN PHOTOGRAPH Grainy but unmistakably a man and woman making love. Photograph shakes. SOUND of a man MOANING in anguish. The photograph is dropped, REVEALING ANOTHER, MORE compromising one. Then another, and another. More moans.

INT. GITTES' OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CURLY drops the photos on Gittes' desk. Curly towers over GITTES and sweats heavily through his workman's clothes, his breathing progressively more labored. A drop plunks on Gittes' shiny desk top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes notes it. A fan whiffs overhead. Gittes glances up at it. He looks cool and brisk in a white linen suit despite the heat. Never taking his eyes off Curly, he lights a cigarette using a lighter with a "nail" on his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Curly, with another anguished sob, turns and rams his fist into the wall, kicking the wastebasket as he does. He starts to sob again, slides along the wall where his fist has left a noticeable dent and its impact has sent the signed photos of several movie stars askew.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Curly slides on into the blinds and sinks to his knees. He is weeping heavily now, and is in such pain that he actually bites into the blinds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes doesn't move from his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, enough is enough. You can't eat the Venetian blinds, Curly. I just had 'em installed on Wednesday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Curly responds slowly, rising to his feet, crying. Gittes reaches into his desk and pulls out a shot glass, quickly selects a cheaper bottle of bourbon from several fifths of more expensive whiskeys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes pours a large shot. He shoves the glass across his desk toward Curly.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Down the hatch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Curly stares dumbly at it. Then picks it up, and drains it. He sinks back into the chair opposite Gittes, begins to cry quietly.

<DIRECTION>
INT. GITTES' OFFICE – GITTES & CURLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes and Curly stand in front of the desk, Gittes staring contemptuously at the heavy breathing hulk towering over him. Gittes takes a handkerchief and wipes away the plunk of perspiration on his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<CURLY>

Gittes pounds the photos on the desk, shouting;
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you the unwritten law, you dumb son of a bitch, you gotta be rich to kill somebody, anybody and get away with it. You think you got that kind of dough, you think you got that kind of class?

This seems to upset Curly even more.
</DIRECTION>
<CURLY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Gittes walks over to her and again flashes a warm, sympathetic smile.

<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?

</GITTES>
<MRS_MULWRAY>

	Mr. Gittes...

</MRS_MULWRAY>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to be the problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
She holds her breath. The revelation isn't easy for her.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MULWRAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My husband, I believe, is seeing another woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MULWRAY>

Gittes looks mildly shocked. He turns for confirmation to his two partners.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>

(gravely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, really?

</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes pulls up a chair sitting next to Mrs. Mulwray between Duffy and Walsh. Duffy cracks his gum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes gives him an irritated glance. Duffy stops chewing.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MULWRAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MULWRAY>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.

</GITTES>
<MRS_MULWRAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MULWRAY>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Mulwray hesitates. She seems uncommonly nervous at the question.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MULWRAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A wife can tell.

Gittes sighs.

<DIRECTION>
(with some real anxiety)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I have to know.

Her intensity is genuine. Gittes looks to his two partners.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, what's your husband's first name?

Mrs. Mulwray nods, almost shyly. Gittes is now casually but carefully checking out the detailing of Mrs. Mulwray's dress – her handbag, shoes, etc.

	This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.

Former Mayor SAM BAGBY is speaking. Behind him is a huge map, with overleafs and bold lettering:

"PROPOSED ALTO VALLEJO DAM AND RESERVOIR"

Some of the councilmen are reading funny papers and gossip columns while Bagby is speaking.
</DIRECTION>
<BAGBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, today you can walk out that door, turn right, hop on a streetcar and in twenty-five minutes end up smack in the Pacific Ocean. Now you can swim in it, you can fish in it, you can sail in it but you can't drink it, you can't water your lawns with it, you can't irrigate an orange grove with it. Remember we live next door to the ocean but we also live on the edge of the desert. Los Angeles is a desert community. Beneath this building, beneath every street there's a desert. Without water the dust will rise up and cover us as though we'd never existed!

<DIRECTION>
Looking up with interest from his racing form.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MULWRAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walks to the huge map with overleafs. He is a slender man in his sixties, who wears glasses and moves with surprising fluidity. He turns to a smaller, younger man, and nods. The man turns the overleaf on the map.
</DIRECTION>
<MULWRAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In case you've forgotten, gentlemen, over five hundred lives were lost when the Van der Lip Dam gave way core samples have shown that beneath this bedrock is shale similar to the permeable shale in the Van der Lip disaster. It couldn't withstand that kind of pressure there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to a new overleaf)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you propose yet another dirt banked terminus dam with slopes of two and one half to one, one hundred twelve feet high and a twelve thousand acre water surface. Well, it won't hold. I won't build it. It's that simple. I am not making that kind of mistake twice. Thank you, gentlemen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULWRAY>
<DIRECTION>
Mulwray leaves the overleaf board and sits down. Suddenly there are some whoops and hollers from the rear of the chambers and a redfaced FARMER drives in several scrawny, bleating sheep. Naturally, they cause a commotion.
</DIRECTION>

Bailiffs and sergeants-at-arms respond to the imprecations of the Council and attempt to capture the sheep and the farmers, having to restrain one who looks like he's going to bodily attack Mulwray.
</DIRECTION>
<FARMER>
<DIRECTION>
(through above, to Mulwray)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You steal the water from the valley, ruin the grazing, starve my livestock who's paying you to do that, Mr. Mulwray, that's what I want to know!

L.A. RIVERBED – LONG SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's virtually empty. Sun blazes off it's ugly concrete banks. Where the banks are earthen, they are parched and choked with weeds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, Mulwray's car pulls INTO VIEW on a flood control road about fifteen feet above the riverbed. Mulwray gets out of the car. Me looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding a pair of binoculars, downstream and just above the flood control road using some dried mustard weeds for cover. He watches while Mulwray makes his way down to the center of the riverbed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There Mulwray stops, tuns slowly, appears to be looking at the bottom of the riverbed, or at nothing at all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trains the binoculars on him. Sun glints off Mulwray's glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELOW GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's the SOUND of something like champagne corks popping. Then a small Mexican boy atop a swayback horse rides it into the riverbed, and into Gitte's view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MULWRAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Himself stops, stands still when he hears the sound. Power lines and the sun are overhead, the trickle of brackish water at his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves swiftly downstream in the direction of the sound, toward Gittes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moves a little further back as Mulwray rounds the bend in the river and comes face to face with the Mexican boy on the muddy banks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulwray says something to the boy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy doesn't answer at first. Mulwray points to the ground. The boy gestures. Mulwray frowns. He kneels down in the mud and stares at it. He seems to be concentrating on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, he rises, thanks the boy and heads swiftly back upstream – scrambling up the bank to his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There he reaches through the window and pulls out a roll of blueprints or something like them. He spreads them on the hood of his car and begins to scribble some notes, looking downstream from time to time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The power lines overhead HUM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops, listens to them then rolls up the plans and gets back in the car. He drives off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hurries to get back to his car. He gets in and gets right back out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The steamy leather burns him. He takes a towel from the back seat and carefully places it on the front one. He gets in and takes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POINT FERMIN PARK – DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Street lights go on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MULWRAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulls up, parks. Hurries out of the car, across the park lawn and into the shade of some trees and buildings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulls up, moves across the park at a different angle, but in the direction Mulwray had gone. He makes it through the trees in time to see Mulwray scramble adroitly down the side of the cliff to the beach below. Be seems in a hurry. Gittes moves after him, having a little more difficulty negotiating the climb than Mulwray did.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWN ON THE BEACH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes looks to his right where the bay is a long, clear crescent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks to his left. There's a promontory of sorts. It's apparent Mulwray has gone that way. Gittes hesitates, then moves in that direction but climbs along the promontory in order to be above Mulwray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE OUTFALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes spots Mulwray just below him, kicking at the sand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulwray picks up a starfish. Brushes the sand off it. Looks absently up toward Gittes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Backs away, sits near the outfall, yawns.

BEACON LIGHT AT POINT FERMIN

Sitting, suddenly starts. He swears softly. He's in a puddle of water and the seat of his trousers is wet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MULWRAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below him in watching the water trickling down from the outfall near Gittes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulwray stands and stares at the water, apparently fascinated. Even as Gittes watches Mulwray watching, the volume and velocity seem to increase until it gushes in spurts, cascading into the sea, whipping it into a foam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE STREET – GITTES' CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a slip of paper stuck under the windshield wiper. Gittes pulls it off, gets in the car and turns on the dash light. It says:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"SAVE OUR CITY! LOS ANGELES IS DYING OF THIRST! PROTECT YOUR PROPERTY! LOS ANGELES IS YOUR INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE!!! VOTE YES NOVEMBER 6... CITIZENS COMMITTEE TO SAVE OUR CITY, HON. SAM BAGBY, FORMER MAYOR – CHAIRMAN." Gittes grumbles, crumples it up and tosses it out the window. He notices other flyers parked on a couple of cars down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes reaches down and opens his glove compartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GLOVE COMPARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Consists of a small mountain of Ingersoll pocket watches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cheap price tags are still on them. Gittes pulls out one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He absently winds it, checks the time with his own watch. It's 9:37 as he walks to Mulwray's car and places it behind the front wheel of Mulwray's car. He yawns again and heads back to his own car.

Gittes drops it, sits down. Walsh comes in carrying a series of wet photos stuck with clothes pins onto a small blackboard.

<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; eagerly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what you got?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Walsh shows him the photos. He looks at them. They are a series outside a restaurant showing Mulwray with another man whose appearance is striking. In two of the photos a gnarled cane is visible.

	Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALSH>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
The PHONE has been RINGING. Sophie buzzes him.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, Sophie?

<DIRECTION>
(he picks up the phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Duffy, where are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Duffy's VOICE can be HEARD, excitedly. "I got it. I got it. He's found himself some cute little twist in a rowboat, in Echo Park."
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, slow down – Echo Park.

<DIRECTION>
WESTLAKE PARK (MCARTHUR PARK)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duffy is rowing, Gittes seated in the stern.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass Mulwray and a slender blonde girl in a summer print dress, drifting in their rowboat, Mulwray fondly doting on the girl.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(to Duffy, as they pass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's have a big smile, pal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
He shoots past Duffy, expertly running off a couple of fast shots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulwray and the girl seem blissfully unaware of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUFFY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turns again and they row past Mulwray and the girl, Gittes again clicking off several fast shots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT – SIGN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"EL MACANDO APARTMENTS".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE ALONG the red tiled roof and down to a lower level of the roof where Gittes' feet are hooked over the apex of the roof and Gittes himself is stretched face downward on the tiles, pointing himself and his camera to a veranda below him where the girl and Mulwray are eating. Gittes is clicking off more shots when the tiles his feet are hooked over come loose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes begins a slow slide down the tile to the edge of the roof and possibly over it to a three-story drop. He tries to slow himself down. The loose tile also begins to slide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes stops himself at the roof's edge by the storm drain and begins a very precarious turn, this time hooking his feet in the drain itself. The loose tile falls and hits the veranda below. He stops as it's about to slide over the edge. He carefully lays it in the drain. But a fragment off the cracked edge of the tile falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH MULWRAY AND THE GIRL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulwray staring at the fragment at his feet. He looks to the girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's clearly concerned. He rises, looks up to the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM HIS POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The roof and the sign topping it betray nothing. He slowly sits back down, staring at the tile fragment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT – NEWSPAPER "DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER BLOWS FUSE OVER CHIEF'S USE OF FUNDS FOR EL MACANDO LOVE NEST."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the style of the Hearst yellow press, there is a heart- shaped drawing around one of the photos that Gittes had taken. Next to it is a smaller column, "J.J. Gittes hired by suspicious spouse."
</DIRECTION>

(to Gittes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you get so much publicity, after a while you must get blasé about it.

<DIRECTION>
A self-satisfied smile comes to Gittes' face.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Face it. You're practically a movie star.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNEY>
<DIRECTION>
In b.g., customers can be OVERHEARD talking about the drought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Interspersed with above, someone is saying, "They're gonna start rationing water unless it rains." Someone else says, "Only for washing your cars." Third says, "You're not going to be able to water your lawn either, or take a bath more than once a week." First says, "If you don't have a lawn or a car, do you get an extra bath?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes has been staring outside the barbershop. A car is stalled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hood is up. A man watches his radiator boiling over.

Gittes gets out of the chair. Barney, a little concerned, tries to restrain him, holding onto the barber sheet around Gittes' neck.

Gittes allows himself to be tugged back to his chair.

</GITTES>

A stunning YOUNG WOMAN appears behind Gittes in his doorway. She's shortly joined by a small, GRAY-HAIRED MAN. They listen, unseen by Gittes.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and then they stop and they read a little Confucius and they screw some more and they stop and they smoke some opium and then they go back and screw some more and they stop again and they contemplate the moon or something and it makes it more exciting. So this other guy goes home to screw his wife and after a while he stops and gets up and goes into the other room only he reads Life Magazine and he goes back and he screws some more and suddenly says excuse me a second and he gets up and smokes a cigarette and he goes back and by this time his wife is getting sore as hell. So he screws some more and then he gets up to look at the moon and his wife says, 'What the hell do you think you're doing?

	<DIALOGUE>
	...you're screwing like a Chinaman.'

Gittes hangs onto Sophie's desk laughing his ass off. The little Gray-Haired Man winces. When Gittes looks up he sees the Young Woman, apparently in her late twenties. She's so stunning that Gittes nearly gasps.

</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.

	I don't get tough with anybody, Mr. Gittes. My lawyer does.

Evelyn starts out the door and Gittes starts after her. This time he's stopped by the Gray-Haired Man who has also come out of his office and up behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAY_HAIRED_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's something for you, Mr. Gittes.

On Gittes' desk. There are empty coffee cups, the summons and complaint, and the newspaper Gittes had brought with him from the barber shop.
</DIRECTION>

The three men are sitting, worn and silent. Walsh chewing gum is the loudest noise in the room.

Gittes looks to Walsh with obvious irritation. Walsh stops chewing.

<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go in and wait?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Without waiting for a response, he does. The Secretary half rises in protest but Gittes is through the inner door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MULWRAY'S INNER OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The walls are covered with commendation, photos of Mulwray at various construction sites, large maps of watershed areas and reservoirs in the city. On the desk is a framed, tinted photo of Evelyn in riding clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes moves to the desk, watching the translucent pane in the upper half of the door leading to the outer office as he does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to open and close the desk drawers after quickly examining the top. He tries one of the drawers and it doesn't open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reopens the top drawer, and the bottom one opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks in it, pulls out a checkbook. He opens it, riffles through the stubs like he was shuffling cards. Drops it, finds a set of keys, an old phone book, and a menu from a Water Department lunch at the Biltmore Hotel in 1913. Then,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He flips through them, reads one notation in Mulwray's neat hand:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Tues. night. Oak Pass Res. 7 channels used."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes spots a shadow looming in front of the translucent pane. He quickly tosses item after item back, kneeing the drawer, nearly knocking a spare pair of Mulwray's glasses off the desk top when he does. He catches them, puts them on the desk and is pacing the room as the door opens.
</DIRECTION>

This is more a request than an invitation. Gittes nods, follows Yelburton out, through the outer office to his offices down the hall.

There's also a small burgee of a fish with the initials A.C. below it, tacked onto the wall.

</YELBURTON>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes fishes a couple off the tray, puts them in his handkerchief pocket. He goes out the door, nearly running into a man who is standing by the Secretary's desk, about GITTES' age only a head taller and a foot wider, dressed in a plain suit that fits him about as well as a brown paper bag.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>

	Mulvihlll, what are you doing here?

OUTER OFFICE – YELBURTON, MULVIHILL AND GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulvihill stares at Gittes with unblinking eyes, remains by the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<MULVIHILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They shut my water off, what's it to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVIHILL>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you find out? You don't drink it, you don't take a bath in it, maybe they sent you a letter. Ah, but then you'd have to be able to read.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Mulvihill moves toward Gittes, shaking with fury. Yelburton steps between them.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?

EXT. MULWRAY HOUSE – GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rings the bell. He waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A powerful CHINESE BUTLER with heavy hair and a half-jacket of gold on one front tooth, answers the door.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Mulwray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
He hands the Chinese Butler a card from his wallet. The Butler takes it and disappears, leaving Gittes standing in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes stands, and sweats, watching a Japanese GARDENER trim a hedge. There's a SQUEAKING SOUND. Gittes moves a few feet off the porch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV – GARAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A chauffeur is washing down a cream-colored Packard with a chamois.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steam rises off the hood. The squeaking has obviously come from the chamois.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHINESE BUTLER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<CHINESE_BUTLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHINESE_BUTLER>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes looks behind him. The Chinese Butler is gesturing for him to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE HOUSE – GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Follows him, trying to check out the rooms as he goes. A maid is cleaning in the den. They pass through it out some French doors along a trellised walkway to a large pond with running water.
</DIRECTION>
<CHINESE_BUTLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wait, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHINESE_BUTLER>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes is left standing by the pond. It's suddenly very quiet except for the runnning water. The pond is over-flowing. After a moment, the Gardener comes running back. He smiles at Gittes, probes into the pond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's something gleaming in the bottom of it. Gittes notes it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, the Gardener drops the long probe, the waters recede.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POND – GITTES AND JAPANESE GARDENER – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<GARDENER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Gittes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bad for glass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARDENER>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(not understanding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah sure. Bad for glass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
The Gardener nods, and is off, leaving Gittes staring at the object in the bottom of the pond that is gleaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at the tool the Gardener was using, hesitates, picks it up and starts to probe into the pond himself, toward the gleaming object.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He then spots Evelyn rounding a turn, coming down the trellised pathway. He casually belts the probe, holds onto it for poise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn is wearing jeans that are lathered white on the inside of the thighs and laced with brown horsehair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's wearing riding boots, is perspiring a little, but looks younger than she did in the office.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Mr. Gittes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes is a little taken aback at seeing Evelyn. He is annoyed as well. Nevertheless, he is elaborately polite.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I'm here to see your husband, Mrs. Mulwray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs. a little nervously. He waits for a reply. There is none.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chinese Butler appears on the veranda.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like something to drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you having?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Iced tea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>

Chinese Butler nods, disappears

EXT. POND AND GARDEN – MULWRAY HOUSE – DAY

Evelyn sits at a glass-topped table. Gittes Joins her.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My husband's at the office.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(sharply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not his apartment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray. I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
He waits for a response. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; uneasily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said I'll drop it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
The iced tea comes on a tray which Ramon sets down between them.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; pleasantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar? Lemon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Mulwray?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>

(as she's mixing one of the drinks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Mr. Gittes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to drop it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn looks up. Gittes smiles a little sheepishly.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should talk this over with your husband.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(a little concerned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?... What on earth for? Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Again he laughs a little nervously. Again no reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(with a slight edge)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(determined to be polite)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course. She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(with rising anger)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at it this way. Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him, I can help him. Did you talk this morning?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn brushes lightly at the horsehair on her Jeans.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I went riding rather early.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like you went quite a distance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll stop by.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please call first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OAK PASS RESERVOIR – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes drives up a winding road, following a flood channel up into the parched hills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO FIRE TRUCKS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One a rescue truck, are at the entrance to the reservoir.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chain link fence with its KEEP OUT sign is open and there are people milling around. The reservoir is below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes' car is stopped by a couple of UNIFORMED POLICE.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, this is closed to the public, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes hesitates only a moment, then:
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Guard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right. Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
He fishes out one of Yelburton's cards from his handkerchief pocket, hands it to the Guard.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, Mr. Yelburton. Go on down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes drives past the Guards, through the gate, along the reservoir. He spots a police car and an unmarked one as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes stops and gets out of the car. Several men with their backs turned, one talking quietly, staring down into the reservoir where other men in small skiffs are apparently dredging for something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the men turns and sees Gittes. He recognizes Gittes and is visibly shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<LOACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gittes, for Chrissakes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOACH>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Loach.

</GITTES>
<LOACH>
<DIRECTION>
(moving to Gittes,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	taking him by the

	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, get out of here before --

</LOACH>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RESERVOIR – DAY

<DIRECTION>
Loach tries to ease him down the path.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before what? What the hell's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
At the sound of his raised voice, a man standing at the edge of the channel, talking to two boys in swimming trunks, turns around. He's a tall, sleek Mexican in his early thirties, LUIS ESCOBAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both Gittes and Escobar register considerable surprise at seeing one another. The men around them are extremely uneasy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loach is actually sweating. Finally, Escobar smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Jake.

<GITTES>

	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes reaches into his pocket, pulls out his cigarette case.
</DIRECTION>
<A_FIREMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No smoking, sir. It's a fire hazard this time of year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_FIREMAN>
<ESCOBAR>

	I think we can make an exception. I'll see he's careful with the matches.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Lou.

<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you get past the guards?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Escobar nods. They walk a couple of steps. The other police, two plainclothesmen and a uniformed officer, watch them.
</DIRECTION>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've done well by yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I get by.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and I guess you have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<LOACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poking around in other people's dirty linen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOACH>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Tell me, you still throw Chinamen into jail for spitting on the laundry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm out of Chinatown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since when?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since I made Lieutenant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<DIRECTION>
It's apparent Gittes is impressed despite himself.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looking for someone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to talk to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're welcome to try. There he is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<DIRECTION>
Escobar points down to the reservoir. A couple of men using poles with hooks are fishing about in the water. It can be SEEN that one of them has hooked something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shouts. The other man hooks it, too. They pull, revealing the soaking back of a man's coat. They start to pull the body into the skiff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORONER'S OFFICE – EVELYN AND ESCOBAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Are standing over the body of Mulwray. Escobar has the sheet drawn back. Evelyn nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Escobar drops the sheet. Escobar and Evelyn move a few feet to one side and whisper, almost as though they were trying to keep the corpse from hearing them.
</DIRECTION>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Obviously the fall must have knocked him out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn nods slightly Escobar coughs. A coroner's assistant wheels the body out of the office.
</DIRECTION>
<ESCOBAR>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This alleged affair he was having. The publicity didn't make him morose or unhappy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE CORONER'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes has been sitting on a wooden bench, smoking and listening. At this question, he rises and looks through the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Escobar sees him, ignores him. Evelyn doesn't see him.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Well, it didn't make him happy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(sharply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<ESCOBAR>
<DIRECTION>
(a little uncomfortably now)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn shows a flash of annoyance.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know where she might be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly not!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Escobar and Evelyn move slowly toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You and your husband never discussed her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(stopping, faltering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name. We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A complete surprise?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A private investigator?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<ESCOBAR>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing vaguely toward the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Gittes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn looks up to see Gittes standing in the doorway only a foot or two from her. She stops cold. They look at one another for a long moment.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(her eyes on Gittes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I... I... did that because I thought it was a nasty rumor I'd put an end to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
She finishes, looks plaintively at Gittes. Escobar is right at her back. Gittes says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And when did Mr. Gittes inform you that these rumors had some foundation in fact?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn looks at Escobar but doesn't know how to answer him.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(smoothly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just before the story broke in the papers, Lou.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Escobar nods. They begin to walk slowly, again have to move out of the way as some other corpse is being wheeled out of one of the Coroner cubicles.
</DIRECTION>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or her name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
They have walked a few steps further down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll walk her to her car, be right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
ESCOBAR'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn glances at Gittes. They go through a couple of outer doors and pass several reporters who have been in the outer hall, laughing, kidding, the tag end of lines like "only in L.A." and "Southern Cafeteria."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes hurries her past the reporters who flank them, asking questions. Gittes brushes them aside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVELYN AND GITTES – AT HER CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a small parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn fumbles in her bag, looking feverishly for something in her purse.

<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.

</GITTES>
<EVELYN>

</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(touching her gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You left your keys in the ignition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
She glances down, leans against the side of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</GITTES>

Escobar stops.
</DIRECTION>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.

Gittes nods, turns, and walks down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE MORGUE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes stops by a body on the table, the toe tagged with Mulwray's name. MORTY is standing near it in a doorway to an adjoining room. A RADIO is on, and with it the announcement that they're about to hear another chapter in the life of Lorenzo Jones and his devoted wife, Belle. Another Coroner's assistant sits at the table, listening to the radio and eating a sandwich.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes ambles into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTY>
<DIRECTION>
(a cigarette dangling out of his mouth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jake, what're you doin' here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTY>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes picks up the sheet and pulls it back. CAMERA GETS ITS FIRST GLIMPSE of Mulwray's body. Eyes open, the face badly cut and bruised.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. Only in L.A.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTY>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at. Mulwray)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<MORTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a long fall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTY>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how are you, Morty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Morty is wheeling in another body with the help of an assistant.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never better. You know me, Jake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTY>
<DIRECTION>
As he begins to move the body into the refrigerator, he breaks into a wrenching spasm of coughing. Gittes spots the other body, lowers the sheet on Mulwray.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(picking up on cough)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, so who you got there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Morty pulls back the sheet.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leroy Shuhardt, local drunk used to hang around Ferguson's Alley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTY>
<DIRECTION>
Morty brushes some sand from the man's face, laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quite a character. Lately he'd been living in one of the downtown storm drains. Had a bureau dresser down there and everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTY>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes has already lost interest. He starts away.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<MORTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drowned, too.

This stops Gittes.

<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>

<MORTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.

(a little puzzled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTY>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes has moved back to the body, looks at it more closely.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's bone dry, Morty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<MORTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not completely dry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTY>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, I don't care how soused he was. That's like drowning in a teaspoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Morty shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got water out of him, Jake. He drowned.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD – GITTES – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's parked on an overpass. The sign HOLLENBECK BRIDGE on one of its concrete columns. Gittes looks down into the riverbed below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM THE BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes can see the muddy remains of a collapsed shack, its contents strewn down river from the bridge. Below him, lying half over the storm drain and one wall that was on the bank of the river is a sign that proclaims "OWN YOUR OWN OFFICE IN THIS BUILDING $5000 to $6000" which was used as a roof of sorts. Downstream, there's the dresser, an oil drum, a Ford seat cushion, an Armour lard can, etc. The trashy remains of Shuhardt's home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes scrambles down the embankment and as he lands near the storm drain one shoe sinks, ankle deep into mud. Gittes pulls it out, swearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to walk a little further downstream when he hears the vaguely familiar SQUISHY CLOP of something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clearing the bridge on the opposite side is the little Mexican Boy, again on his swayback horse, riding along the muddy bank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look at one another a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(calling out to him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were riding here the other day, weren't you...?

The Boy doesn't answer.

The Boy nods.

(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</GITTES>

The shadows of the two are very long now.

<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When it comes? What'd you tell him?

</GITTES>
<THE_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Comes in different parts of the river. Every night a different part.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes nods. The horse snorts. The Boy rides slowly on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVERBED – DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes scrambles up the embankment to note the direction the storm drain by Hollenbeck Bridge takes. It is headed above toward the Hollywood Hills, where the sun is setting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GITTES IN CAR – NIGHTFALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Winding his way up a section of the Hollywood Hills. He picks up on an open flood channel with the spotlight by the driver's windwing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GITTES IN CAR – MOVING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Along the flood channel. It is dark now and Gittes follows the channel with the car spotlight. He turns at a fork in the road which allows him to continue following the flood channel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FURTHER UP – MOVING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The road is narrower. Gittes drives more slowly. Foliage is overgrown in the channel so its bottom cannot be glimpsed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STILL FURTHER – NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The road is dirt. Heavy clusters of oak trees and eucalyptus are everywhere. It is very still. Another turn and a pie- shaped view of a lake of lights in the city below can be GLIMPSED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV – CHAIN-LINK FENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over the road, bolted. It says "OAK PASS RESERVOIR. KEEP OUT. NO TRESPASSING."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chain-link itself actually extends over the flood channel and down into it, making access along the channel itself impossible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes backs up, turns off the motor, the car lights, the spotlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lone light overhead on tension wires is the sole illumination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is only the eerie SOUND of the tension WIRES HUMMING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes gets out of the car, clubs the fence near the Flood channel itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE OTHER SIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes carefully works his way up through the thick Foliage toward a second and large chain-link fence. Lights from the reservoir still higher above can be SEEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there is a GUNSHOT. Then ANOTHER. Gittes dives into the flood control channel, which is at this point about four feet deep and six feet wide. There is the SOUND of men scurrying through the brush, coming near him, then retreating. Gittes loses himself among the ivy in the channel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He waits. The men seem to have passed him by. But there is another SOUND now. An echoing growing sound. It puzzles Gittes. He starts to lift his head to catch the direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GITTES IN FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL – NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he's inundated with a rush of water which pours over him, knocks off his hat, carries him down the channel, banging into its banks, as he desperately tries to grab some of the overgrowth to hang on and pull himself out. But the force of the stream batters him and carries him with it until he's brought rudely to the chainlink fence. It stops him cold. He's nearly strained through it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swearing and choking, he pulls himself out of the rushing water by means of the fence itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drenched, battered, he slowly climbs back over the fence and makes his way toward his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT GITTES' CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He fishes for his car keys, looks down. One shoe is missing.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(grumbling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddam Florsheim shoe, goddammit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to get into his car but Mulvihill and a SMALLER MAN stop him. Mulvihill pulling his coat down and pinning his arms, holding him tightly. The smaller man thrusts a switchblade knife about an inch and a half up Gittes' left nostril.
</DIRECTION>
<SMALLER_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking with emotion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it there, kitty cat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMALLER_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE – GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frozen, the knife in his nostril, the street lamp overhead gleaming on the silvery blade.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_SMALLER_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are a very nosey fellow, kitty cat... you know what happens to nosey fellows?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_SMALLER_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Smaller Man actually seems to be trembling with rage when he says this. Gittes doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<SMALLER_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wanna guess? No? Okay, lose their noses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMALLER_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
With a quick flick the Smaller Man pulls back on the blade, laying Gittes' left nostril open about an inch further. Gittes screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood gushes down onto his shirt and coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes bends over, instinctively trying to keep the blood from getting on his clothes. Mulvihill and the Smaller Man stare at him.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_SMALLER_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Next time you lose the whole thing, kitty cat. I'll cut it off and feed it to my goldfish, understand?

Gittes on the ground can see only his tormentor's two-tone brown and white wing-tipped shoes, lightly freckled with his blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHOE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Comes up and lightly shoves Gittes into the ground. The SOUND of FOOTSTEPS RETREATING, Gittes gasping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Walsh has finished off the punch line and both men are laughing raucously. Gittes drops the mail he's been loafing through and puts his hand over the receiver.

INT. BROWN DERBY – CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes is seated, flips through the paper until he finds the OBITUARY COLUMN, scans it, looks up, abruptly tears the column from the paper and puts it in his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he closes the paper we can SEE headlines in the left hand column: "WATER BOND ISSUE PASSES COUNCIL". Ten million dollar referendum to go before the public.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn Mulwray is standing at the table as he does so. He rises, allows her to sit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON EVELYN

<DIRECTION>
Gittes watches her as she removes her gloves slowly... She's wearing dove gray gabardine, subdued, tailored.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you find out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My husband.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He told you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn nods.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was grateful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn for the first time appears a little embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(a flash of annoyance)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my metiay. When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes looks significantly to Evelyn.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unless what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(looking directly at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's cheating on him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn doesn't reply.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn is clearly angry but she is controlling it.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like the word 'cheat.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you have affairs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(flashing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Gittes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(almost an outburst)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
This subdues Gittes a little. Evelyn is still a little heated.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; more calmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there anything else you want to know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where you were when your husband died.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't tell you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean you don't know where you were?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean I can't tell you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were seeing someone, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn looks squarely at him. She doesn't deny it.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For very long?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes. It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes nods.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, by the way. What's the 'C' stand for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
He's been fingering the envelope...
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(she stammers slightly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	K... Cross.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That your maiden name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn turns into Gittes.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must've had a reason to ask me that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'm just a snoop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not for that one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes suddenly turns sharply in to Evelyn.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(moving in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do me a favor. Sit still and act like I'm charming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn involuntarily draws back.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's somebody here. Say something. Anything. Something like we're being intimate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn reluctantly allows Gittes to move closer and dangle his hand in front of their faces. She stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(meaning his nose)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did it happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Been meaning to talk to you about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More like other people putting their business in my nose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn actually smiles a little.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You son of a bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes looks up and flashes his smile.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Match. How're you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. MATCH is swaying over the table, a plump woman with a glass of whiskey in one hand, a large purse in the other, and a menacing look in her eye.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MATCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't give me that, you son of a bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATCH>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes turns back to Evelyn.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another satisfied client?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another satisfied client's wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<MRS_MATCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at me, you son of a bitch. You... you bastard. Are you happy, are you happy now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATCH>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to take a swipe at Gittes with her purse. Gittes covers himself. Waiters rush over.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MATCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You smug son of a bitch. My husband's so upset he sweats all night! How do you think that makes me feel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATCH>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweaty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Match swings at Gittes again and again. She catches him on the nose. It hurts. He covers it, then swings his leg out from under the table and deftly kicks her in the shin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Match drops her purse and spills her drink. She grabs her shin, hopping around a little. The waiters who had tried to restrain her now try to keep her from falling over.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get out of here before she picks up her purse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
They rise and move toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tough guy, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes looks, sees she's kidding, and nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE IN THE PARKING LOT – DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes' car has been brought by the parking attendant. The attendant opens the passenger side for Evelyn.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(to attendant who
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	dutifully starts for
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
her car)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute, sonny.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Evelyn)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you better come with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What for? There's nothing more to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to attendant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get my car, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
The attendant starts after it again. Gittes leans on the open door of his car and in to Evelyn. He talks quietly but spits it out.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, go home. But in case you're interested your husband was murdered. Somebody's dumping tons of water out of the city reservoirs when we're supposedly in the middle of a drought, he found out, and he was killed. There's a waterlogged drunk in the morgue. Involuntary manslaughter if anybody wants to take the trouble which they don't. It looks like half the city is trying to cover it all up, which is fine with me. But, Mrs. Mulwray.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(now inches from her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I goddam near lost my nose! And I like it. I like breathing through it. And I still think you're hiding something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn steadies herself on the open car door. She stares at Gittes for a long moment. Then he gently tugs the car door closed.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Gittes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
He drives off into the Wilshire traffic, leaving Evelyn looking after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DWP – MULWRAY'S OFFICE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH ITS LETTERING:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"HOLLIS I. MULWRAY CHIEF ENGINEER".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes goes through the door to the Secretary. She looks up. She recognizes Gittes again and is not happy to see him.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Yelburton.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
The Secretary immediately gets up and goes into the inner office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes turns and strolls around the office a moment. He sees a photographic display of "THE HISTORY OF THE DWP. THE EARLY YEARS", along the wall. He stops as he spots a photo of the man with the cane Gittes had seen photos of earlier. He is standing high in the mountains, near a pass. The caption reads "JULIAN CROSS. 1905".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cross is strikingly handsome.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes immediately pulls out the envelope containing Evelyn's check. He looks at the corner of it, his thumb pressing down under the middle initial C, then he looks back to the photos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Secretary returns.
</DIRECTION>
<SECRETARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRETARY>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<SECRETARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRETARY>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes pulls out a cigarette case, offers the Secretary one. She refuses. He lights up and begins to hum 'The Way You Look Tonight,' strolling along the wall looking at more photographs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MULWRAY'S OFFICES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Here he spots several photos of a much younger Mulwray, along with Julian Cross. One of the captions: "HOLLIS MULWRAY AND JULIAN CROSS AS THE AQUEDUCT CLEARS THE SANTA SUSANNAH PASS. 1912".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes, still humming, turns to the Secretary.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Julian Cross worked for the water department?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<SECRETARY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRETARY>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(humming, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He did or he didn't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<SECRETARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He owned it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRETARY>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes is genuinely surprised at this.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He owned the water department?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<SECRETARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRETARY>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He owned the entire water supply for the city?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<SECRETARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRETARY>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(really surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did they get it away from him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<SECRETARY>
<DIRECTION>
(a sigh, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRETARY>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(glances back, hums, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<SECRETARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Along with Mr. Mulwray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRETARY>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were partners.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<SECRETARY>
<DIRECTION>
(testily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Yes, they were partners.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRETARY>
<DIRECTION>
She gets up, annoyed, and goes into Yelburton's inner office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes goes back to the photographs. He hears a SCRATCHING SOUND, apparently coming from just outside the outer door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves quickly to it, hesitates, swiftly opens the door. Workmen are behind it, scraping away Mulwray's name on the outer door, looking up at Gittes in some surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Secretary returns, sees the workman on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<SECRETARY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Gittes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Yelburton will see you now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRETARY>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes nods graciously, heads on into Yelburton's office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DWP – YELBURTON & GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a subtle but perceptible difference in Yelburton's attitude. He's now head of the department.
</DIRECTION>
<YELBURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YELBURTON>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<YELBURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YELBURTON>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cut myself shaving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<YELBURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YELBURTON>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only when I breathe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<YELBURTON>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YELBURTON>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<YELBURTON>
<DIRECTION>
(stops smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YELBURTON>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<YELBURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YELBURTON>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton. Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<YELBURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation. I don't know what you're talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YELBURTON>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought. That's news.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes heads toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<YELBURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally. But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YELBURTON>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<YELBURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said, the northwest valley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YELBURTON>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's like saying they're in Arizona.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<YELBURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Gittes, my field men are out and I can't give you an exact location...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YELBURTON>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes nods.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a married man, am I right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<YELBURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YELBURTON>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hard working, have a wife and kids...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<YELBURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YELBURTON>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to nail you. I just want to know who put you up to it. I'll give you a few days to think it over.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hands him a card)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call me. I can help. Who knows? Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes smiles, leaves an unsmiling Yelburton.

INT. GITTES OFFICE

Gittes enters, drops his hat on Sophie's desk. Sophie tries to tell him something but Gittes goes on into his office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVELYN MULWRAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is sitting, smoking. She looks up when he enters.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your usual salary?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes moves to his desk, barely breaking stride at the sight of her.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirty-five bucks daily for me, twenty for each of my operators, plus expenses, plus my fee if I show results.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
He's sitting now. Evelyn is very pale now, obviously very shaken.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved.

Gittes buzzes Sophie.

	Sophie, draw up one of our standard forms for Mrs. Mulwray.

<DIRECTION>
(he leans back; to Evelyn)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me, did you get married before or after Mulwray and your father sold the water department?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn nearly jumps at the question.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you married your father's business partner?
	</DIALOGUE>

Evelyn nods. She lights another cigarette.

(continuing; staring
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	at her, points to

<DIRECTION>
the ashtray)

	You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.

	Oh.

</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
She quickly stubs one out.

<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over the water department, or over you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>

(quickly)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?

	Then it was over the water department.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no. Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way. Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. He never forgave him for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never forgave him for what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(starts a little)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure shout that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I'm sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about you? Do you and your father get along?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Sophie comes in with the form, cutting off Evelyn's reply. Gittes places two copies on a coffee table in front of Evelyn.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sign here... The other copy's for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
She signs it. When she looks back up, Gittes is staring intently at her.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you thinking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(picking up one of
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	copies, folding it, putting it in his
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
pocket)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SEAPLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The engines make the small cabin vibrate. Gittes threads his way down the tiny aisle of the eight passenger cabin, which is full of middle-aged men in old clothes and their fishing gear. Gittes is poked by a pole, has to move along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the old men says something to him.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(above the engines)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<OLD_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll have to sit with the pilot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes moves forward into the cockpit, the PILOT looks up – nods for Gittes to sit down, first moving a half eaten cheese sandwich out of Gittes' seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HARBOR - SEAPLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taxiing down the ramp into the sea. In a moment, it kicks up a spray of foam and takes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COCKPIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The island gradually looming larger before the Pilot and Gittes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Pilot glances over at Gittes who, as usual, is impeccably dressed. A contrast to the others on the plane.
</DIRECTION>
<PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
(above the engines)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you're not going fishing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not exactly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
(winks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that's what you told your wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
The Pilot laughs raucously. Gittes laughs politely.
</DIRECTION>
<PILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILOT>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(abruptly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<PILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILOT>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm working for his daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That right?... She used to be some looker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILOT>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<PILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILOT>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must be thinking of a different daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<PILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILOT>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She ran away?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<PILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
He gives a sidelong glance to Gittes, a little concerned he's said too much.
</DIRECTION>
<PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Course, she settled down nicely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILOT>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling a little)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you never know, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
(loosening up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's for sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILOT>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why'd she run away?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<PILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILOT>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(nudging him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Both men laugh a little lewdly.
</DIRECTION>
<PILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILOT>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<PILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
ALBACORE CLUB – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pleasant but unobtrusive clapboard blue and white building on the bay overlooking the harbor. The seaplane lands. A motor launch with a burgee of a fish flying from it turns and heads in the direction of the plane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WINDING ROAD – RANCHO DEL CRUCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes, driven in a station wagon, passes under the sign with a cross painted below the name.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ranch itself is only partially in a valley on the island. As the wagon continues one can SEE that it is actually a miniature California, encompassing desert, mountains and canyon that tumble down palisades to the windward side of the sea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wagon comes to a halt where a group of hands are clustered around a corral. The circle of men drift apart, leaving JULIAN CROSS standing, using a cane for support, reedy but handsome in a rough linen shirt and jeans. When he talks his strong face is lively, in repose it looks ravaged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRIDLE PATH – GITTES & CROSS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walking toward the main house. A classic Monterey. A horse led on a halter by another ranch hand slows down and defecates in the center of the path they are taking. Gittes doesn't notice.
</DIRECTION>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Horseshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes pauses, not certain he has heard correctly.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said horseshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Horseshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir, that's what it looks like. I'll give you that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Cross pauses when they reach the dung pile. He removes his hat and waves it, inhales deeply.
</DIRECTION>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love the smell of it. A lot of people do but of course they won't admit it. Look at the shape.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes glances down out of politeness.
</DIRECTION>
<CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; smiling, almost enthusiastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Always the same.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
Cross walks on. Gittes follows.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(not one to let it go)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Always?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stops and glances. back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
They move on.
</DIRECTION>
<CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps this preoccupation with horseshit may seem a little perverse, but I ask you to remember this. One way or another, it's what I've dealt in all my life. Let's have breakfast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COURTYARD VERANDA – GITTES & CROSS AT BREAKFAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below them is a corral where hands take Arabians, one by one, and work them out, letting them run and literally kick up their heels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cross' attention is diverted by the animals from time to time. An impeccable Mexican butler serves them their main course, broiled fish.
</DIRECTION>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(dubious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Cross is visibly surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did she get that idea?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I gave it to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Cross nods.
</DIRECTION>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh. Oh I hope you don't mind. I believe they should be served with the head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes glances down at the fish whose isinglass eye is glazed over with the heat of cooking.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>

(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me. What do the police say?

<CROSS>

</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?

</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's too bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(carefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Gittes! You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
This stops Gittes. He seems faintly mused by it.
</DIRECTION>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why is that funny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was he right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
(grunts, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His girlfriend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, his girlfriend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't that strike you as odd?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. She's probably scared to death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When was the last time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Cross starts to reply, then there's the SOUND of a MARIACHI BAND and some men in formation clear a bluff about a hundred yards off. They are dressed like Spanish dons on horseback. For the most part they are fat in the saddle and pass along in disordered review to the music.
</DIRECTION>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.

Cross looks to Gittes in some real surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>

<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other.

Cross looks hatefully at Gittes.

(painfully)

<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you find out?

	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just find the girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. HALL OF RECORDS – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark and quiet except for the whirring of fans. Gittes approaches one of the CLERKS at a desk.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a little lost. Where can I find the plat books for the northwest valley?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
The Clerk's droopy eyes widen a little.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Part of it's in Ventura County. We don't have Ventura County in our Hall of Records.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
Which is a snotty remark. Gittes smiles.

The Clerk turns away abruptly. Gittes regards his back a moment, then goes to the stacks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE STACKS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes sees the Clerk turn to another, say something. The second clerk gets on the phone. Gittes watches a moment, then swiftly turns his attention to the stacks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hauls down the northwest valley volume, opens it. It's huge and there's a lot to go through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The print itself makes him squint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT PAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Showing TRACT, LOT, PARCEL, even a METES AND BOUNDS designation where the description of the land parcel is long and hopelessly involved e.g. '6000 paces to Rio Seco, thence 7000 paces to Loma Linda, etc.' These descriptions are old and faded. In the owners' column, however there are numerous freshly typed names pasted over the prior owners.

<GITTES>

<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, then, how about a ruler?

<GITTES>

	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
The exasperated Clerk reaches around, rummages, slaps a ruler on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes goes back to the stacks with the ruler. He opens the book, places the ruler not horizontally but vertically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT PLAT BOOK NORTHWEST VALLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beside the OWNER column he places the ruler, looks toward the clerks, then swiftly rips down the page, tearing out a strip about two inches wide containing the owner's name and property description. As he tears, he either sniffles or coughs to cover the SOUND of the PAPER being ripped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD – GITTES DRIVING – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amidst a hall of shimmering dust and heat, parched and drying groves, narrower roads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He passes a ramshackle home, next to a rotting orchard. There is a "SOLD" sign on the collapsing barn. Gittes stops, checks it against the names he had taken from the Hall of Records.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OLD STUCCO BUILDINGS FURTHER ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And a few withered pepper trees. Gittes has paused at this dried-up intersection. There is a "SOLD" sign on a drug store. Gittes looks OFF SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coming INTO VIEW above the arid fields is a spiraling cloud of purple smoke. Gittes heads in that direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes parks at the edge of the field. About twenty yards away is a man mounted on a strange machine, holding a lid off it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Billowing lavender clouds are belching forth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several CHILDREN are watching the man at work.
</DIRECTION>

<CHILD>

	Making some rain.

<DIRECTION>
Gittes nods, walks over to the man who is elaborately busying himself with the intricacies of his machine. He's aware of Gittes watching him.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you're just the man I'm looking for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
The Rainmaker now glances down at Gittes, who as usual is immaculately dressed.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some associates and I are thinking of buying property out here. Of course, we're worried about the rainfall.

<DIRECTION>
GITTES DRIVING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is now covered with a film of dust:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches a fork in the dirt road. There are a couple of mailboxes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes takes this fork and begins a slow ascent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he does, the tops of a line of bright green trees can be SEEN, coming more and more INTO VIEW, row upon row of avocado and walnut groves, their foliage heavy. The few structures in the distance are white-washed, and well kept, right down to the white-washed stones that mark the pathway to the home. Towering above it all is a huge wooden water tank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes drives through a gate that has "NO TRESPASSING" and "KEEP OUT PRIVATE PROPERTY" signs neatly printed on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drives down the road into the grove.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulls to a halt in the road flanking the orchard lanes. He puts the car in neutral, stares at the trees. By contrast with what he has seen they are lush and beautiful, their heavy branches barely swaying in a light breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then a SHOTGUN BLAST abruptly strips bare the branches of the tree he'd been staring at.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AVOCADO GROVES – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes is shocked. He looks behind him. Riding on horseback down the field in the direction he had just driven is a Red- Faced Man in overalls. His hat blows off his head. He does not, however, lose the shotgun he has just used. Gittes' lane of retreat is denied him. He guns the car, and takes off down one of the orchard lanes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING WITH GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dirt lane is rough. As Gittes nears the end of it, a Younger Man on a mule blocks the exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes veers a sharp left, knocking a branch off one of the trees, heading down one of the cross-lanes. Here he's pursued by a scraggly dog that nips at the tires. Gittes yells at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON GROVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two farmers on foot, one using a crutch, run down the lanes toward a dust trail rising above the trees. They've spotted it. Clearly it's from Gittes' car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This hide-and-seek chase between one man on horseback, one on a mule and a couple on foot continues up and down and across the orchard lanes until Gittes' front tire and radiator are ruptured by another SHOTGUN BLAST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes' car veers off, scattering a stray gaggle of geese and smacks into an avocado tree, shaking loose a barrage of the heavy fruit onto Gittes and the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes immediately tries to get out through the branches over the back of his car, but he's pulled off it by one of the younger farmers, a huge brute who he begins to tussle with. The Crippled Farmer begins to bang Gittes on the back with his crutch. The two of them manage to pound Gittes to the ground within moments, where the Crippled Farmer continues to whack away at Gittes with the crutch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The older Red Faced Farmer with the shotgun and the Man on a mule ride up.
</DIRECTION>
<RED_FACED_FARMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, quit it! Quit now! Search the man, see if he's armed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_FACED_FARMER>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes is hefted half off the ground and the two younger Farmers spin him around, going through his clothes. Gittes is badly banged up and half out on his feet. They toss his wallet, his silver cigarette case, etc. on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<RED_FACED_FARMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said see if he's armed, not empty his pockets.

<BIG_FARMER>
	<DIALOGUE>

Gittes leans against the back of his car, breathing heavily.

<RED_FACED_FARMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, mister. Who you with? Water department or the real estate office?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_FACED_FARMER>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes' back is to the Red Faced Farmer. He has trouble catching his breath. The Crippled Farmer pokes him rudely in the back with his crutch. Gittes turns sharply.

</RED_FACED_FARMER>

Gittes reaches into his pocket. The paper's on the ground. He picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.

	Mulwray? That's the son of a bitch who's done it to us.

	Mulwray's dead. You don't know what you're talking about, you dumb Oakie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
The Big Farmer takes a swing at Gittes. Gittes kicks him squarely in the nuts, knees him in the jaw after he's doubled up, and hits him solidly. The Crippled Farmer takes careful aim and brings his crutch down on the back of Gittes' head. Gittes is knocked to the ground and lies still beside the Big Farmer who is writhing in agony in the dirt.

Gittes nods. He checks his watch. He looks out. It's almost evening.

Gittes says nothing. The wife of the Red Faced Farmer (DUBOIS) looks reproachfully at Dubois. Gittes feels the back of his head, It obviously hurts him.

Evelyn and Gittes go out to her car, the cream colored Packard.

Looking. Either by accident or design, the primarily octogenarian guests have segregated themselves. In one wing, the men are playing pinochle, some are playing dominoes, one elderly gentleman sits by himself carefully peeling an orange.

In an adjacent parlor several white-headed ladies work on a quilt.

	I've been wanting to meet you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
(stitching, smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well you own a lot of land.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in Long Beach, but we lost it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes looks at the quilt. In it is the head of a fish among the rest of the crazy quilt pattern. Gittes spots it.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's just lovely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
He looks through the quilt for other pieces of the fish, comes across the tail and by it the initials A.C.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating tail)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did you get this material?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
(what it sounds like)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The apple core club.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The apple core?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do they do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but –-
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(kneeling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<PALMER_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're a sort of unofficial charity of theirs, Mr. Gittes. Would you care to come this way? Someone wants to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PALMER_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes looks up, sees Palmer standing in the doorway, looking taut and a little drawn. Evelyn is beside him. She gestures as if there's someone behind Palmer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes rises.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you later, Emma.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
He walks toward Palmer who waits for him to walk in front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE ENTRANCE HALL – MULVIHILL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is waiting. He's got his hand in his pocket. Evelyn looks to Gittes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The four of them stand there, Mulvihill towering over everyone.
</DIRECTION>
<MULVIHILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on I want you to meet somebody, Gittes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVIHILL>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing from Palmer to Mulvihill)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we leave the lady out of this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<MULVIHILL>
<DIRECTION>
(a little uncertain)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVIHILL>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I'd like to walk her to her car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(taking her by the arm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in the car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<MULVIHILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see she makes it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVIHILL>
<DIRECTION>
Mulvihill has walked up beside Gittes. He makes the mistake of opening the glass door in the entryway, putting his back to Gittes for a moment. Gittes swiftly pulls Mulvihill's jacket up over his head. He spins him around. With his jacket covering his face, Gittes hammers away at Mulvihlll, beating him against the glass door, along the wall, mercilessly pounding his fists into the cloth until the cloth turns red and Mulvihill begins to sink to the red tile floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Palmer screams. Evelyn stands there astonished. Mulvihill's gun has clattered to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(as Mulvihill hits the floor, to Evelyn)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you waiting for? Get in the car!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulvihill tries to get up again. Palmer starts to go for the gun, nearly picking it up. Gittes slaps it out of his hand and kicks it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It goes flying down the hall, at least thirty feet; hits the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Palmer goes screaming off into the night. Gittes turns back to Mulvihill who starts to get up, then collapses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes goes out the front door, ignoring the excited audience of ancients behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Gittes walks down the pathway, he stops. Two men are coming toward him. One of them is shorter, and has the nervous, jerky moves of the man who slit his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes stops. The two men fan out and continue to move toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes spots the two-tone shoes. He begins to back up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there is a pair of headlights flashing brilliantly behind the two men. In a moment Evelyn's car is headed across the lawn directly toward the two men, accelerating as it gets near them. They look in disbelief, then dive for safety. The car skids to a stop, fishtailing a little on the grass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn opens the passenger door.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes jumps in and she takes off across the lawn, tilting the elegant little neon sign on the lawn as she goes. Two SHOTS ARE FIRED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR – EVELYN & GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn looking straight ahead, driving. After a moment she takes one hand off the wheel and rubs her left eye a little. Gittes watches her. He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VERANDA – MULWRAY HOME – NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes stands on the veranda, smoking a cigarette, staring off into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn comes out to the veranda, carrying a tray with whiskey and an ice bucket on it. She sets it down. Gittes turns.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(watching her pour)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maid's night off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(a little surprised, he laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(handing Gittes his drink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gave everybody the night off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy, it's an innocent question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess not to you, Mrs. Mulwray. Frankly you really saved my a... my neck tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
They drink.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(pouring himself another drink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When was the last time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes touches his nose, winces a little.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was in Chinatown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What were you doing there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(taking a long drink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Working for the District Attorney.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doing what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes looks sharply at her. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As little as possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They do in Chinatown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him. Gittes stares off into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn has poured herself another drink.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bothers you to talk about it, doesn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I wonder... could I. Do you have any peroxide or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
He touches his nose lightly.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh sure. C'mon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
She takes his hand and leads him back into the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM – MIRROR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes pulls the plaster off his nose, stares at it in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn takes some hydrogen peroxide and some cotton out of a medicine cabinet. Evelyn turns Gittes' head toward her. She has him sit on the pullman tile adjacent to the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor did a nice job...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
She begins to work on his nose with the peroxide. Then she sees his cheek, checks back in his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(working on him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold still. Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't always tell what's going on there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...No. Why was it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you do anything about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
They're very close now as she's going over a mouse very near his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Make sure I don't find myself in Chinatown anymore. Wait a second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
He takes hold of her and pulls her even closer,
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(momentarily freezing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your eye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(staring intently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's something black in the green part of your eye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(not moving)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...A flaw...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(she almost shivers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Yes, sort of a birthmark...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes kisses her lightly, gradually rises until he's standing holding her. She hesitates, then wraps her arms around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MULWRAY BEDROOM – TELEPHONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a nightstand, city lights visible through the open window behind it. It is RINGING. Evelyn's arm reaches INTO SHOT. SOUND of something hitting the headboard. Gittes moans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEW SHIFTS TO INCLUDE Gittes in bed, holding his head, which he's just hit. Evelyn pauses in her reach to the phone. She turns to him, whispers, "I'm sorry," kisses him on the head and lips. PHONE CONTINUES TO RING. She picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(in Spanish now)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, I'll come and help, just keep watching her and don't do anything until I get there... 'bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
VIEW SHIFTS AGAIN TO INCLUDE Gittes in bed, watching Evelyn next to him as she's talking on the phone. She hangs up. She touches Gittes' cheek lightly.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes stares at her silently.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just... I have to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I want to know where.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(she starts out of bed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(stopping her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(near tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please!... Trust me this much...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she kisses him lightly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Albacore Club.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It has to do with my father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He owns it. You know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(sitting up straight)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You saw my fa... father? When?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(panicked)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There hasn't been a lot of time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
She leaps out of bed, throwing on a robe.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did he say?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(insistent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did he say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do? To who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn starts quickly for the bathroom, then comes back and kneels by the side of the bed, takes Gittes' hand.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me an example.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Including the death of your husband?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's possible. Please don't ask me any more questions now. Just wait, wait for me. I'll be back. I need you here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him, rushes to the bathroom, shuts the door. Gittes stares at it a moment. Then leaps out of bed, rummages around, tosses on his trousers. He grabs his shoes, throws them on. Then hurries out of the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MULWRAY HOME – GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Running across the driveway to the garage. There are two cars there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulwray's Buick and Evelyn's Packard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes moves over to the Buick, opens the passenger's door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUICK - GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Checks the ignition. No key is in it. He pulls a couple of wires from under the dash, starts to mess with them, seems satisfied.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slides out across the seat, slams the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MULWRAY DRIVEWAY – NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes hurries over to the Packard. He gets down on the driveway, lying on his back, bracing himself. With the heel of his shoe, he kicks at the right rear taillight of the car. He shatters the red lens, gets up. He carefully pulls the red lens off the taillight, exposing the white light beneath it. He tosses the red lens into the shrubbery and hurries back toward the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE RED AND ONE WHITE TAILLIGHT – MOVING – NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn's car speeds along the curves on Sunset Boulevard, the red and white lights coming IN AND OUT OF VIEW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GITTES DRIVING – NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the wheel of Mulwray's car, keeping a healthy distance from Evelyn in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVELYN'S PACKARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulls up before a small little bungalow house. She gets out, looks up and down the street. There is nothing. She hurries on up the walkway to the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWN THE STREET – GITTES IN BUICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Idles the engine with the lights off. He brings the car a few yards further down the street, parking it near Evelyn's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes gets out of the car and goes up the walkway. The curtains are drawn except for one of the small windows on the side of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to it and looks, balancing on the edge of the porch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes sees Evelyn's Oriental servant rush through the living room of the small house. In a moment he re-emerges back through the living room carrying a tray with a glass and pitcher on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Around to the side of the house. He runs into shrubbery and a short picket fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs over it, follows along the stucco wall to a series of windows at the corner of the house. These all have shades on them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can hear someone crying in the house. Someone else talking alternately firmly and plaintively in Spanish. Here the windows have blinds. He moves to one where the blind is not completely drawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's an inch or so of space at the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes can see the servant again. Evelyn is pacing back and forth in and out of his line of vision. After a moment someone rises INTO SHOT, obviously from lying on a bed. The figure is just a few feet from Evelyn. Her tear-stained face comes INTO VIEW. It is unmistakably the girl Gittes had last seen with Hollis Mulwray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulwray's girlfriend. She's looking up to Evelyn, speaking in Spanish. Her words are not discernible but the tone is bitter, anguished. A newspaper is strewn about the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn kneels. She insists that the girl swallow down some pills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girl reluctantly does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Continues to watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET – EVELYN – NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emerges from the house, goes to her car and gets in.

	The police?

</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's not tied up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.

</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then let's go talk to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes starts to get out of the car. Evelyn grabs his arm, nearly screaming:
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!

</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Her intensity actually rips Gittes' already partially torn jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at it and her. It seems to have a momentary calming effect on both of them.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's too upset.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean she just found out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does it look like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're insane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes explodes.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't go to the police if I tell you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will if you don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
A long pause. Evelyn's head sinks onto the steering wheel, her hair covering her face.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's my sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn is breathing very deeply now. Not crying, but the kind of deep breathing that comes from real hysteria. Gittes puts an arm on her shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it easy... If it's your sister it's your sister... why all the secrecy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
She lifts her head and looks up at him. He's genuinely puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(really upset)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
She nods. Gittes sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would never ever have harmed Hollis. I loved him more than my own family. He was the most gentle, decent man imaginable... and he put up with more from me than you'll ever know... I just wanted him to be happy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
She begins to cry softly.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(after a moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I took your husband's Buick...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he opens the car door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll return it tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you coming back with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...That's not what I meant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
There is a long moment of silence. Gittes looks over to Evelyn. Her hair covers most of her face from him.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well... I'm very tired, Mrs. Mulwray. Good night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
He gets out and slams the car door. She drives off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHOWER – GITTES' APARTMENT – GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The spray is hitting him full on the top of the head. Gittes is so exhausted he's literally holding onto the nozzle as the water pours down. He shuts the shower off, reaches weakly for a towel, dabs his nose lightly with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GITTES' BEDROOM – GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pads around in elegant silk pajamas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over to the window where morning light is streaming in. He closes the curtains, collapses on the bed, on top of the covers, inert. Almost immediately the PHONE RINGS. Gittes lets it go on for a moment, then picks it up without saying anything.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_ON_PHONE>

<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up, falls back down. PHONE RINGS AGAIN. AND AGAIN. Gittes swears, picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_ON_PHONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	684 1/2 East Tensington. Echo Park. She begged me to call. She's waiting for you.

Before Gittes can say anything, the phone clicks dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CERRITOS TOWER ROAD – HOLLYWOOD HILLS – EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes pulls up. It is a bungalow courtyard with a very narrow walkway and sickly green stucco.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. IDA SESSIONS' APARTMENT – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes at the front door. It's slightly ajar. He knocks. Nothing. He opens it and enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Morning light filters through the half-open blinds. Dust particles in the shafts of light. It's still and empty. Gittes sees something down the hall, under the legs of a telephone table. Gittes moves toward it. It is grotesque. When he gets closer he can see it's a wilted head of lettuce. Just inside the kitchen some radishes and onions lie on the linoleum. Gittes walks on into the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clearing the kitchen counter, Gittes sees IDA SESSIONS lying on her back on the floor, surrounded by the groceries from a broken bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ice cream has melted around her. Her eyes are open, a stream of ants is moving across the ice cream and into her mouth. She's recognizable as the woman who posed as Evelyn Mulwray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes kneels over her. He gingerly opens her handbag, fishes for its contents, takes them and looks at them on the kitchen counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wallet with a few bills in it, driver's license with her name. A Screen Actors Guild card. Gittes nods, turns, carefully replaces the items in the purse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He idly opens the broom closet, pantry, and even Frigidaire, which is all but empty. Then he steps over her body and moves across the hall to a door that is slightly ajar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes enters and turns on the light.
</DIRECTION>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Find anything interesting, Gittes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<DIRECTION>
Escobar and another PLAINCLOTHED MAN stand in the bathroom by the entrance to the bedroom door. Gittes turns around. A THIRD MAN is now coming down the hall from the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes looks at the two, doesn't reply.
</DIRECTION>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing here?

	<DIALOGUE>

INT. KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Escobar points to the number "MU 7279" on the side of one of the kitchen cabinets.
</DIRECTION>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't that your number?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just to be on the safe side, we had Loach here give you a ring.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<DIRECTION>
He indicates one of his assistants.
</DIRECTION>
<ESCOBAR_S_ASSISTANT>
<DIRECTION>
(a slight sneer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to your nose, Gittes? Somebody slam a bedroom window on it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR_S_ASSISTANT>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(right back, smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope, your wife got excited, crossed her legs a little too quick. You understand, pal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
The Assistant starts to move for Gittes who is ready for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Escobar steps between the two.
</DIRECTION>
<ESCOBAR>
<DIRECTION>
(to other Assistant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Loach.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Escobar pulls out a drawer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about these? Look familiar?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<DIRECTION>
In the open drawer are the photos of Mulwray and the girl in the park, boat, and at the El Macando on the veranda.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(no point in denying it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did she...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(meaning the corpse)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...happen to have them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes takes a deep breath.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Either you tell me or I guess 'cause I don't have the answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Escobar nods.
</DIRECTION>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want the rest of the pictures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What pictures?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<ESCOBAR>
<DIRECTION>
(meaning the corpse)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard it was an accident.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! Now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes is surprised at this piece of information, but remains nonplussed.
</DIRECTION>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You accusing me of extortion?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Escobar manages a thin smile.
</DIRECTION>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
This is a little telling.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And why's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
This stops Escobar. He's dumbfounded by it.
</DIRECTION>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon I'll show you.

<DIRECTION>
Escobar hesitates.

<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon make a decision, Lou. You're in charge.

The men around Escobar look to him. Escobar grudgingly nods.

CLOSE SHOT – STORM DRAIN

It yawns AT CAMERA, only a trickle of water dropping into the ocean.

Escobar turns to Gittes. Stares at him for a long moment.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ONE_OF_ASSISTANTS>

Escobar stares hatefully at Gittes.

EXT. MULWRAY HOME – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes in Mulwray's Buick whips into the driveway. He looks in the garage. Evelyn's car is gone. Only the Gardener's truck is there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes hurries along the pathway and up to the house. He rings the doorbell. Scarcely waiting for an answer he tries it. It's locked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into his pocket pulls out his cigarette case, takes a pick out of the side and starts to fool with the lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Maid opens the door abruptly, stares in some surprise at Gittes.

Gittes looks past the Maid to the center of the living room where luggage is packed and neatly piled.

The Maid is actually in the process of throwing covers over the furniture.

It has one leg missing. The fifth point on the star is just beginning to grow back.

The Gardener peers into the pond.

<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
The Gardener spots it. He rolls up his trousers, gets in the pond, and reaches into the bottom, his chin actually touching the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He misses the object, which seems to scoot away like an animal. Then he grasps it. He lifts it out of the water and holds a pair of eye glasses, rimless, bent, his finger poking through the frame where one lens is shattered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Gardener seems surprised. Gittes looks at the glasses. They are heavily bifocal and reflect the sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Gittes pushes past him. Evelyn, looking a little worn but glad to see him hurries to the door. She takes Gittes' arm.

<EVELYN>

Gittes continues to look around. He sees clothes laid out for packing in a bedroom off the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>

</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?

</GITTES>
<EVELYN>

(evenly but with great anger)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes looks at her, then takes the handkerchief out of his breast pocket. Unfolds it on a coffee table, revealing the bifocal glasses, one lens still intact. Evelyn stares dumbly at them.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?

	What are you saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>

</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes has been in a state of near frenzy himself. gets up, shakes her.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it! I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister.

</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn is trembling.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>

Gittes smiles.
</DIRECTION>

<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>

</GITTES>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's my daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes stares at her. He's been charged with anger and when Evelyn says this it explodes. He hits her full in the face. Evelyn stares back at him. The blow has forced tears from her eyes, but she makes no move, not even to defend herself.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said the truth!

<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
He belts her finally, knocking her into a cheap Chinese vase which shatters and she collapses on the sofa, sobbing.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For God's sake, Kyo, keep her upstairs, go back!
	</DIALOGUE>

Kyo turns after staring at Gittes for a moment then goes back upstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father and I, understand, or is it too tough for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...

	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...so that's why you hate him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn looks slowly up at Gittes.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>

<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...with her mother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes pulls something out of his pocket and unfolds it.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
(taking it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An obituary column... can you read in this light?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... I think I can manage...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
Cross dips into his coat pocket and pulls out a pair of rimless glasses.. He puts them on, reads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stares at the bifocal lenses as Cross continues to look through the obituary column. He looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does this mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes is holding the bifocals with the broken lens now.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right here, in this pond. You drowned him... and you left these.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Cross looks at the glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
(finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haven't the faintest idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them... you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POND – CROSS AND GITTES
</DIRECTION>
<CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
(after a long moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes nods.
</DIRECTION>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much are you worth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no idea. How much do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
(a long moment, then:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
(with sarcasm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who do you blame for that? Her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<DIRECTION>
Cross makes a funny little cock of his head.
</DIRECTION>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't blame myself. You see, Mr. Gittes, most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and right place, they're capable of anything. Take those glasses from him, will you, Claude?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
Mulvihill moves INTO VIEW. Extends his hand for the glasses. Gittes doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not worth it, Mr. Gittes. It's really not worth it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROSS>
<DIRECTION>
Gittes hands over the glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take us to the girl. Either Evelyn allows me to see her, or I'm not averse to seeing Evelyn in jail. If I have to buy the jail. Hollis and Evelyn kept her from me for fifteen years. It's been too long, I'm too old.
	</DIALOGUE>

Mulvihill doesn't move. Cross rises on his own. Evelyn holds the revolver on him.

	Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GITTES>
<ESCOBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCOBAR>
<GITTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
