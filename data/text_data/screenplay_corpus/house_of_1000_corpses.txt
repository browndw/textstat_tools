EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
An old Gothic FARMHOUSE stands atop a hill at the end of a long sloping dirt road. SCARECROWS with pumpkin heads hang CRUCIFIED on crosses lining the drive. Everything is severely overgrown.
</DIRECTION>

Bill and Baby enter the gates of the FARM, they walk up the main drive.

Baby runs forward and begins jumping around in the huge mud puddles, then runs up onto the front porch of the old house.

The front of the house is covered with strange junk art. Hundreds of dolls faces are nailed to the walls.

TINY ENTERS and removes his coat.

Everyone is speechless.

Tiny is over SEVEN FEET TALL and weighs THREE HUNDRED POUNDS. He is wearing a black sweater with a big red skull stitched into it. A red knit ski mask covers his face. Black gloves cover his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tiny sits at the table, looks down at his plate and says nothing.

<DIRECTION>
Mother comes to fetch Tiny. She relays a message to him with strange hand gestures.

INT. FARMHOUSE - GRAMPA'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a cramped, darkened room we see the huge shape of Tiny hovering over a BED containing the hunched, fragile old body of GRAMPA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grampa struggles to sit, then slowly slides his legs over the edge of the bed. Tiny helps him to stand.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAMPA>

<DIRECTION>
As they move into the light of the hallway, it is clear that Grampa is in his late 80's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grampa quickly grows tired. Tiny picks him up in his arms and carries him down the stairs to the dining room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they move past, the camera comes to rest on a STRANGE OBJECT sitting on a shelf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LARGE GLASS JAR containing a DEFORMED BABY. The pickled punk looks to have a small second head growing from its temple. The label on the jar reads STUFFY 1973.

He stands six foot, but is deathly slim. His skin is translucent, glowing in the dark. Long thin white hair covers his head. His eyes are grey. He is an ALBINO.

The rain pounds down. A heavy fog hovers over the dense growth of the field. In the distance, silhouetted by moonlight, a gruesome caravan slowly moves through the night.
</DIRECTION>

Otis, lantern in hand, leads the way. Followed by Baby and Mother together under a large black umbrella. Next Rufus holds the leash connected to Jerry, Denise and Mary.

Bringing up the rear, Tiny, shotgun focused on the prisoners, and Grampa. Grampa is strapped to Tiny's back like a child. He waves a flashlight back and forth like a search beam.

<DIRECTION>
Denise cautiously makes her way to the bend at the end of the tunnel. As she approaches, the moaning sound gets louder. She turns the corner to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO PALE FIGURES in filthy hospital gowns hunched over a shadowy object. Denise gasps. They turn towards Denise, revealing the partially devoured dead body of Jerry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two bone-white ghouls are dripping with Jerry's blood, they stare at Denise, then return to their prey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Denise screams in horror and runs, turning down another twist in the underground maze. She turns the corner and runs straight into SEVERAL SLOW MOVING GHOULS. The ghouls are of the same deathly white complexion, hair-less with flaked, cracking skin. Their yellow eyes shine in the darkness.
</DIRECTION>

A GHOUL rises up from the sludge behind Denise. It stands silent. It reaches out a BONEY HAND with long curled fingernails and grabs her hair. Denise screams and tries to pull away. The ghoul grabs her with his other hand and pulls her closer, CLAWING at her face.

INT. PIT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beaten Denise struggles down a long tunnel. She gets to the end to find that it is a dead-end. Behind her, FIVE GHOULS move silently towards her, blocking her only exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ghouls slosh through the muck, moving in closer. Denise frantically looks for an escape, nailed into the wall next to her are planks of wood forming a ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ghouls are only a few yards away. Denise climbs up the ladder. They move in, clawing at her legs and feet, trying to pull her down. Denise digs at the wood and mud ceiling above her, trying to break free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Denise is bleeding severely from the chunks of flesh being torn from her legs. She digs wildly at the ceiling, suddenly a board falls free and mud rains down to reveal:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STARS, the sky above shines through the hole. Denise smashes her fists at the rotted wood planks, pulling free another piece.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With all her might Denise grabs hold and pulls herself up through the opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PIT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Denise fights her way through the earth and pulls her body up into the night air. The cool air rushes to her lungs. She crawls free of the hole, gasping for air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is safe. Suddenly... SMASH! A ghoul has broken through the surface. He grabs Denise by the leg and begins to pull her back into the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Denise screams and begins kicking violently at the ghoul. She breaks and crawls from the ghoul's reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Rufus and Baby have pulled the police cruiser up by the stake. Rufus and Baby stand on the hood.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Denise makes her way out onto the road. No cars are in sight. In the distance headlights break through the darkness. Denise stands in the middle of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TRUCK comes into view, it is a small cube truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Denise stands in the headlights, waving her arms for it to stop. The truck comes to a halt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs toward the passenger's side door and climbs in.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
