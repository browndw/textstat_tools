This is no traditional trading house. Each broker's desk touches another on either side as well as directly ahead.

	Your side? You're doing wrong. I'm not your best friend, here to nod my head and sympathize. That's my your mother's racket. I'm your father. I let you know when you screw up. Did you think I was going to pat you on the back for this casino idea? Tell you what an entrepreneur you are?

	So, what do you want from me? Meeting me in a coffee shop is not going to change the life you have. God, if I ever asked my father to meet me for a cup of coffee to talk about my screw-up he probably he probably would have laughed. We didn't have nice little chats about why I was a bad boy.

	Your first six months at the firm are as a trainee... you make one hundred and fifty dollars a week. After you're done training, you take the Series Seven test.

Now a word about being a trainee. The other brokers, your parents, whoever: they're gonna give you shit about it. And it's true, a hundred and fifty a week is not a lot of money, but pay no mind. You need to learn the business and this is the time to do it. Once you pass the Series Seven none of it will matter.

	</DIALOGUE>
</GREG>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<GREG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't sell stock to women. I don't care who it is, we don't do it. I'm serious. Nancy Sinatra calls, you tell her you're sorry. They're a constant pain in the ass and never worth the trouble. They will call you every fucking day asking you why the stock is dropping. And God forbid the stock should go up you'll hear from them every fifteen minutes.

</GREG>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, don't pitch the bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<GREG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Second rule. Don't write wood. A lot of trainee are so anxious to get off the phone they just steamroll the guy into getting the press pack so they can hang up. Then I call in a month and say, Hi, you spoke to a junior associate of mine last month. The guy's like, Yeah, I'm not interested. Bye. That's a shitty lead. It's fucking wood. The info we send is bullshit. The important part of the call is telling them you have that one great idea, and that a broker is going to call them back in a month. This shows that we don't just fire a million recos a day. We tell them we have six or seven great ideas a year! They don't want to think you're pitching them something you read in the journal this morning. Get it? No wood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREG>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I got it. Chill.

That's all the shit you're gonna have to learn later. For now you only have to remember one thing. You can be whoever you want on the phone. So say what you have to. Use a different name if you want.

Show him a three percent return and he'll trust you to watch his kids for the weekend.

	I want to talk to you about appearance. Most of you dress like shit. I don't know what your financial situation is like right now but you need to buy at least one decent suit. There is a minimum level of aesthetic professionalism that we have here. In a couple of months you'll be able to outfit your whole closet, but for now just get something to hold you over. There's an important phrase that we use here and I think it's time you all learned it. "Act as if". Do you understand what that means? Act as if you are the fucking president of this firm. Act as if you have a nine inch cock. Act as if. To do this properly you need to at least look the part. So go get dressed. Secondly, it's time to get your Series Seven books. No need to get nervous. If you study you'll pass. Then you begin trading as an SEC licensed broker. Then you're a fucking millionaire. It's that simple. I need three hundred from each of you for the books which will be returned if and when you pass the exam. And I'll need that tomorrow.

	It's true. It don't matter if it's the Avon lady or Merryl Lynch. The good secretaries can smell a sales call.

	I remember when I was cold calling, the shit I'd do. I'd get on the phone and say, Can I speak to Jim? Secretary's like, I'm sorry, but Jim isn't in the office. I'd be like, that's funny because I just saw his car in the lot about five minutes ago. Next thing you know, Jimbo's on the phone because you showed the lady you weren't fuckin' around.

</HARRY>

	Different? How? It's your money, you earned it. Besides, all you're doing is investing it. I'm not selling crack here, Harry. I mean she's only going to be happy when she sees you've made a wise investment for the family. Just think of the flip side. When your wife does the shopping does she call you from Pathmark to ask you if she can use the coupons for Captain Crunch?

	Come on, that's not fair.

They've just designed the world's first retractable syringe. This means that doctors and nurses will never again have to worry about infection from dirty needles. This is not going to be an alternative in the medical world, it's going to be the standard. We all know we're here to make money, but if we can do something good like this, then all the better. So I want you all to go out and buy yourselves a new car, or a house. Whatever you want. Go into debt. You will make a million inside of six months.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It really is, huh? Well we knew it was shady. So how's he doing it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's called bridge financing. It's so simple. A group of investors make a loan to a private company. Let's say for three million. After the company gets taken public they pay back a million in cash and the other two they pay back in common stock, but at the IPO price. So the investors basically get two million worth of IPO stock. Then they can sell it on the open market at triple what they bought it for. Now that's actually all legal as long as the investors are not tied to the brokerage house. But Michael's friends are the investors on every IPO we do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why all the names were the same on the contracts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Then he has us push it all on the open market. We're selling Michael's shares. That's where the two dollar rips come in. He can afford to pay us that much. He's still in an obscene profit margin. It's to his advantage to give us those rips. He has to motivate us to push these stocks. He depends on us to literally create the market. It's all artificial demand. There's no other firm selling this shit. That's why he's always telling us to go into debt. He wants us hungry. Then as soon as we sell off Michael's position there's no need to maintain the inflated price anymore. We stop pushing it and it crashes. And get this. The last IPO, Med Patent, it's cardboard. No research and development, no employees, not even a fucking building. Annual reports are all bullshit. Michael manufactures them. Med Patent doesn't exist.

(uncovering his coffee)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember this guy once called me to sell me some stock. I let him pitch me. I got every fucking rebuttal out of this guy. Kept him on the phone for an hour and a half. Toward the end I started asking him buying questions. Like, what's the firm minimum? That's a buying question. I ask a question like that, he should take me down. It's not like I asked him what his 800 number was. That's a fuck off question. I was giving him a run but he blew it. To a question like, What's the firm minimum the answer is zero! You don't like the idea, don't pick up a single share. This putz is telling me...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(mocking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...ummm, a hundred shares? Wrong answer! You have to learn how to close. Always be closing! You have to push. Keep asking questions. Ask rhetorical ones just to get a yes out of them. If you were drowning and I threw you a life jacket would you grab it? Yes? Good. Pick up two hundred shares, I won't let you down. Ask a guy if he'll let you down. Ask a guy if he'll be happy to see thirty to forty percent return. What's he gonna say? Fuck you, I don't want to see those returns?

<DIRECTION>
Everybody laughs.

(CONT'D)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop laughing, it's not funny. If you can't close then start thinking about another career. I'm serious. I am dead serious about that. Have your rebuttals ready. Anybody says call me tomorrow, that's bullshit! Anybody says they got money problems about two hundred shares is lying. You know what I say to that? Tell me you don't like my idea, tell me you don't like my firm, tell me you don't like my fucking tie, but don't tell me you can't pull twenty five hundred together. You hear me, boys? There is no such thing as a "no sale" call. A sale is made on every call you make. You either sell the client some stock or he sells you a reason he can't. Either way it's a sale. The question is, who's gonna close, you or him? Be relentless! Alright, I'm done.

</DIRECTOR>
<TRUE>

	What do we have on him? Manipulative trading tactics? What can we threaten him with, license revocation? He'll never go for it. We need more. I know he's up to something. I can feel it.

<DIRECTOR>

	I can't afford to leave him out there any longer. This girlfriend of his may have already tipped him off. He could run at any time.

	She hasn't, sir.

Seth goes into the private chamber and puts his bag down on the leather sofa. Huge bookcases, mahogany desk. Judge stuff.

Seth looks at a photo resting on the desk. It's a picture of Seth on the Mongoose. His father is standing next to him smiling broadly. It's the day his father bought him the bike.

Seth looks as emotional as we have ever seen him. Marty comes in through another door, startled to see Seth there.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Seth, listen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTY>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I play you off as a whale by having you go in on a couple of big trades that JT Marlin tells you to invest in. You know, prove your loyalty. Figure you'll drop $50,000.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<MARTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you fucking nuts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTY>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just listen to me. After you drop the fifty they'll have faith in you as a customer. When the next IPO comes out you'll get a huge chunk for being so loyal. Then instead of holding onto it until Michael can sell off all of the common stock, you dump it the same day. We'll make a fortune and the stock will immediately collapse. That should raise enough red flags for the SEC to come in and close shop within a week. We walk rich and JT goes down.

<MARTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe we're having this conversation.

	Alright, here's the deal. I told you things would happen within sixty days, it's only twenty so far, but the situation here is explosive and I wanted to get you involved. That's why I haven't returned any calls. I've been gathering information all morning. So here it is: The stock's down for tech reasons. It's been on the restricted list all week. But it's the same company. As a matter of fact, while it was on the restricted list, Farrow was doing nothing but signing more contracts. I'm telling you it's looking like our next big one here.
