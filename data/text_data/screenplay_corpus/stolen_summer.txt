INT. PETE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

PETE, 7 years old, who looks like a poster boy for Ireland, lays on his stomach in front of the board game "All Star Baseball". He spins the dial. The dial lands on nine, which is the number that coincides with a strikeout. SEAMUS, nine years old, blondish brown hair, white skin, crystal blue eyes, angelic smile, jumps to the air in celebration.

Pete never breaks stride. He jumps into the back of the station wagon. Margaret turns and walks to the car with the kind of steam that only eight kids in 18 years can produce. She opens the car door, sits down, calmly puts the car in reverse, and turns her head for the reverse shoulder check. And then all hell breaks loose. Margaret screams at the top of her lungs.

Margaret, with no hesitation, stops the car and smacks Eddie across the face. Eddie winces while TOMMY, 17, also dark haired and dark eyed, laughs. Margaret puts the car in drive and cruises down the street like one big, happy family. WE FOLLOW the camera through the front of the car to the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PATRICK, 18, blondish brown curly hair and green eyes, holds MOLLY, six months old, in the front seat. Car seats have yet to be invented.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARY, 17, auburn haired like her mother and Tommy's twin, sits behind the driver seat because she has learned the long hand of Margaret's wrath cannot reach her in that seat. Tommy reads Eddie the Bazooka Joe joke from his gum wrapper and the two laugh. In the back seat facing out, Pete and Seamus sit. Seamus holds electronic football in his hand and the electronic sound of electronic football players running reverberates throughout the car. WE GO TIGHT on PETE.

At forty miles an hour in front of the firehouse Margaret lunges her open fist into the backseat and starts swinging like a tornado.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kids scurry, hoping to avoid the path of the tornado. The wagon swerves into the other lane. Joe and his buddies watch from their lounge chairs outside the firehouse. He takes a swig from a plastic cup.

	Dying in a fire sometimes doesn't sound so bad.

The station wagon pulls up to church and the children jump out like clowns from a small car. Margaret drives off as the children exit the station wagon. Patrick lifts Katie up to the basin of holy water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katie splashes water on her forehead and makes a sign of the cross.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick, annoyed, puts her down and points his finger at her. He gently touches the water with his index and middle finger and slowly makes the sign of the cross. Katie shakes her head in agreement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seamus dips his hand in the water and fake sneezes on Pete. Pete punches him in the shoulder. Margaret walks in and proceeds to lead her ducklings down the aisle as the heads in church turn to watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each kid genuflects, some better than others, and sit. Pete sits between Seamus and Patrick. He looks at Margaret. She smiles and winks at him. Pete looks up to the life-size Jesus hanging high behind the altar. WE SLOWLY go TIGHT on JESUS hanging on the cross.

	<DIALOGUE>
	My cousins' families are similar to mine. Except some of the dads are cops. In my world, there's Irish Catholics, and then there's everybody else. The only part of this picture that doesn't fit for me is Jesus. From what I've learned, and according to my brother Seamus I've learned shit, that's why I'm in second grade, but from what I've learned, Jesus is not Irish Catholic. My dad says that's only a technicality, like Knute Rockne, but, still, Jesus is not Irish Catholic. He is Jewish. I don't know any Jewish people, they don't go to Holy Cross, but if I ever meet a Jewish person, my mom says my job would be to convert them to Catholicism. So they could go to heaven. I have decided this summer, the summer of 1976, I will help a Jewish person get to heaven. It will be my holy quest.

Katie feeds the cocker spaniel her mashed potatoes under the table while Molly drinks from the bottle in Nancy's arms. Joe watches Patrick walk out of the room. He looks at Margaret for some answer.

Pete and Seamus walk down the tree lined city block in their neighborhood. The two sip milkshakes.

<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing better than a bubble gum milk shake. How come that girl looks at us so funny when we order it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
Seamus shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, it's a two for one. Ice cream shake, and then the bubble gum sinks to the bottom, and when the shake's done, you got a whole pack of bubble gum to chew. All for the price of one shake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
Seamus takes the lid off the cup and tries to finish the shake in one big gulp. He succeeds. Seamus now chews on a wad of gum. Pete and Seamus pass a lemonade stand.

Ten cents a cup. Pete motions to the lemonade entrepreneurs that his shake has bankrupt him for the day.

	Mr. O'Malley. How are you today?

</RABBI>
<PETE>

	I'm good thanks. Ready to start my quest. But I thought I might ask you for your permission first.

</RABBI>
<PETE>

The rabbi chuckles. He stops.

<RABBI>

	Enterprising.

Pete shrugs off that word.

<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep. Jewish people gotta like lemonade?

</PETE>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very much so. I believe Moses set one up at Mount Sinai.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABBI>
<DIRECTION>
Again Pete shrugs off that statement.

<PETE>

	I figured I might set up the stand right at the door. And I'm not going to charge.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You and I seem to be the only two on this block that care about free stuff.

Pete sits at his stand. The rabbi parks his car on the street 100 feet from Pete's stand. The rabbi doesn't want to block Pete's storefront billboard. The rabbi steps out of his car. His secretary, Julie, a pretty, voluptuous, middle aged woman who obviously was waiting for the rabbi, walks out the door and greets the rabbi. Pete watches her.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>

	Rabbi Jacobsen, you've received six messages.

Julie hands the rabbi his telephone messages. The rabbi reads them and laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Members of the congregation don't seem to think this stand is a laughing matter. It's against Judaism.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most of the members don't seem to notice this temple, except during the high holidays or when they need something. Pete's giving us free advertising.

</RABBI>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he's advertising Christianity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, he's advertising thought. He's asking people to have a cup of free lemonade with him and maybe get some insight into how to get to heaven. Doesn't seem like this neighborhood cares about that. I wish a thousand Pete's opened up stands on this street.

Seamus looks around. As if there was a public stampede for Pete's lemonade. Seamus waves to Rabbi Jacobsen. The rabbi walks toward the stand.

	Rabbi, your house is on fire. Big fire!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
The Rabbi doesn't hear the last line. He takes off in a full sprint back the way Steven came. Another fire engine races past. WE FOLLOW the fire engine. WE PASS OVER THE TOP of the FIRE ENGINE to the other side where JOE O'MALLEY hangs on. WE FOLLOW THE FIRE ENGINE up the block where people stand outside watching a house burn. The rabbi reaches the house at the same time the fire engine does.
</DIRECTION>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My boys! Where are my boys? David? Danny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABBI>
<DIRECTION>
The rabbi furiously searches the crowd. Joe O'Malley reaches the rabbi. A quick exchange between the two. The rabbi takes off toward the stairs of his house. Two other firemen catch him and hold him back. Joe motions to the firemen to pull him back and the rest of the crowd to the other side of the street. He grabs a couple of other firemen who aim the hoses at the front door. Joe runs into the house and disappears into the smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CLOSE SHOT on Pete and Seamus, who have been watching from the corner. Mrs. Jacobsen arrives. The rabbi grabs her. Mrs. Jacobsen starts to cry. Everyone watches for Joe to reappear with two boys in hands. The firemen hose the flames. The rabbi makes another run for the house, but this time policemen hold him back. The rabbi goes limp as the two policemen hold him up. The rabbi's eyes are fixated on the front door. Where there is just smoke, the outline of Joe O'Malley appears. He has a child, Danny, wrapped in a blanket in his arms. He runs down the stairs and across the street. He hands the boy off to the paramedics. Danny is suffering from smoke inhalation but is OK. His parents surround him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rabbi screams at Joe. Joe can only read his lips. David! David! My other boy! David!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe looks back at the house. The flames rage uncontrollably and the other houses are now in danger of catching fire. The rabbi grabs Joe by the shoulders and screams. This time Joe's eyes are only on the fire. Joe takes off toward the house. A firemen tries to stop him but Joe bounces off him like a running back. As he reaches the front steps, an explosion knocks him back ten feet and flames roar out the front door. Firemen trample Joe as his coat catches on fire. They stamp out the fire while they hold him down. Joe rolls over and stares at the Jacobsens. Mrs. Jacobsen is hysterically crying as the rabbi stares aimlessly. The rabbi turns slowly and buries his wife's head in his chest. Danny, his youngest son, stares over his oxygen mask and up at his parents. Joe stands up and is escorted toward the ambulance as other firemen storm the house with more hoses. A CLOSE SHOT of PETE. His face is void of any emotion other than a look that says he thought his dad was dead. A CLOSE SHOT of SEAMUS. Tears stream down his face. As his dad clears the crowd and reaches the ambulance on his own two feet, Seamus takes off in a full sprint and covers the fifty yards in seconds. Pete stands still.

<DIRECTION>
Joe slaps Seamus across the face.

Seamus turns around and walks toward Pete. Seamus reaches Pete, who is still frozen. Seamus never looks up from the pavement.

	Come on.

Pete looks at his dad, who now sits on the back of the ambulance as paramedics care for him. Pete looks further at Rabbi Jacobsen. Danny Jacobsen, six years old and bald, catches Pete's eye. They look at each other. Pete turns and walks away.

<DIRECTION>
WE GO UP THE STAIRS AND DOWN THE HALLWAY to Pete and Seamus's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They both sit on their beds staring quietly at the ceiling. Seamus throws a tennis ball to himself. The front door opens and screams of DAD fill the house. Pete turns and looks at Seamus. Seamus fixates on the rotation of the ball as it leaves his hand. He repeats this over and over. Joe enters the bedroom and closes the door behind him.
</DIRECTION>

Pete and Seamus sit up. Joe grabs a chair and flips it around so he's leaning forward on the back of the chair.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I like their lineup. It's explosive.

</JOE>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but when your heart and mind are in together, it's a sure bet.

Jack adds the score.

The men laugh. Danny smiles. Joe nudges Roger and points to his head. Roger nods knowingly and walks into the firehouse.
</DIRECTION>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>

	My guys love a good meal, but I wish your wife wouldn't have. We were just doing our job.

<RABBI>

	A heroic job you do. My wife wanted to thank you personally. My synagogue will want to thank you formally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABBI>
<DIRECTION>
Joe looks down. Not heroic enough to save your other son, Joe thinks.
</DIRECTION>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if you're allowed to drink red wine on the job, but lasagna just isn't as good without a fine wine.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>

	Why? Isn't there a stronger dosage or more intensive treatment?

<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, the medicine Danny's taking...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABBI>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chemotherapy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep. Chemotherapy. It zaps him of his strength. And weakens his ability to fight off disease.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABBI>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds like bad medicine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<RABBI>

	Yes it does. But that's how doctors fight cancer.

	My oldest brother wants to become a doctor. My mom always tells me to do my homework so I can be smart and become a doctor.

</RABBI>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. He can't afford college.

</PETE>
<RABBI>

	Higher education is expensive. But worth it if you work hard.

	Rabbi, when do you think Danny will be better?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did not study medicine in college, but even if I did, I don't think I could answer that. It's in God's hands now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABBI>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you're close with God. Hopefully that rubs off a little on Danny. I hope he gets better, we've got some unfinished business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope so too. Praying for Danny is all we can do now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABBI>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK. I'll pray to Jesus, you pray to God, and hopefully somebody listens.

<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the best way to get to heaven?

<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do we know if we're doing that? Is there some test?

Patrick's jaw drops. Margaret sits shocked and Joe stands up.

<JOE>

	Rabbi Jacobsen, that is an extremely kind offer, but one that we cannot accept.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick looks at Joe and tears form in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would mean a lot to our congregation and personally to my family if you would accept it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABBI>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Other men risked their lives that day and every other day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We understand that. But, to be frank, it's more personal than say giving the fire department a sculpture in gratitude. Your fire chief approved it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABBI>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You spoke to my boss?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. We wanted to make sure it was within the rules. The scholarship board can only grant one scholarship, and when Pete told me of Patrick's desire, I recommended Patrick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABBI>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I imagine they want to give it to him in a big ceremony?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I would imagine so. I think it would be a good public gesture.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Free publicity for the temple.

<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have done nothing to deserve it. It's a publicity stunt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MARGARET>

<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never said that. We talk a lot.

	The right thing? You're not even eight. You don't know what the right thing is. You know what I tell you, and what your mother tells you. Jewish people believe in their own thing. They do not go to heaven. And neither do Christians who disobey their fathers. Now get upstairs. Now!

<JOE>

	Over my dead body. Do you understand it's not about you? It's not about kindness. It's about good publicity. The Jews help out a poor Irish Catholic family and they get on the news and the people think, how nice is it that the Jews share their money.

</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We agreed on a partnership. And our partnership has been for you to provide for the family while I raise the family. But somewhere along the line, this partnership has gotten out of whack. You come home, the house is clean, your food is hot, and your kids are behaved. You then bark orders at these children like a drill sergeant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cause they need discipline.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not finished. Trust me, these kids are disciplined. You think I run this house without discipline? Joseph, the older ones, they need more guidance than sterness. We've done our work with them, they now need to feel they can bounce things off us.

	That's a bunch of crap. You think I bounced things off my dad? Hell no.

	Yeah, he was an asshole, but I respected him. And looking back, he did a great job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But looking back is too late. It would be nice for Patrick to feel close enough to you so that he could tell you his dreams, tell you that even though he doesn't want to grow up to be you, that you are still his hero.

</MARGARET>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's bullshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything is not bullshit. I will not allow you to take away the chance for Patrick to pursue his dream. The rabbi is being generous and you think it reflects poorly on you.

</MARGARET>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes it is. You can't afford to put your children through college, so you've decided that college is bad. You know what, I agree college is a waste of time for most kids. But not Patrick. He wasted his first few years of high school, but the last two years he has worked his butt off and he generally loves to learn. That's what college is all about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know what college is about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just because I didn't go doesn't mean I didn't think about it. But I fell in love, had babies, and haven't regretted one thing about the last nineteen years. Until now! You will not squash your children's dreams because they aren't your dreams.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not about dreams, it's about what's right. If Patrick really wanted college, he could have gotten better grades and earned a scholarship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't take school seriously. Why? Cause he thought it was a waste of time because he would work for the city whether he got A's or C's. But one day he woke up and decided that not doing his best was not the O'Malley way. And he learned that from his father. And he's got nothing but A's that day forward. And he will do the same in college. From a scholarship that he accepts from Rabbi Jacobsen, or so help me God, Joe, the only thing colder than your food when you get home will be your bed.

Pete rides his bike down the street toward the park. Holy Cross Church is attached to Holy Cross Elementary which is attached to Holy Cross Field, where the baseball field is located. Pete rides by the church and looks up at the big cross at the top of church. He rides toward the field and sees some of the boys playing catch while others sit on the bench and eat sandwiches. Seamus screams to Pete.

Pete ears perk up at the sound of communion. He looks up at the cross hanging high above the church. He takes off in a full sprint for his bike. He jumps on it and heads toward the church.

Pete doesn't look back. He rides to the church, jumps off his bike, and runs into the church. The church is empty. Pete runs to the altar and grabs the communion chalice. He takes one, looks at it, and puts it in his pocket. He then takes another one just in case something happens to the first. He puts the second communion host in his other pocket. Father Kelly enters the altar from the hallway attached to the altar.

<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not Catholic and he's only six.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that poses a problem. Communion is for Christians who have earned the right to receive Jesus and are of age.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's earned the right. He passed the tests.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What tests?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tests we made up to see if he's worthy of Jesus. And he is Father Kelly, he's as worthy as any Catholic I know. And just because he's not old enough, well that's not fair, because he may not live long enough to be old enough, and if Jesus didn't want him to have a piece of him only because he wasn't old enough, well, that doesn't seem like anything that sounds like the Jesus I know.

Ball four! The batter walks to first base as the other base runners advance one base. Bases loaded. Down three runs. Two outs. Last inning. Pete pops the weight off of his bat and heads toward the plate. He looks into the stands and sees the Jacobsens sitting with his parents. He smiles. Before he steps to the plate, Pete closes his eyes. He opens his eyes and steps to the plate. The pitcher winds up and throws the ball. Pete swings with all of his might and connects. The runners are off with the crack of the bat. The ball sails in the air and toward center field. Deep center field. The crowd stands as Pete puts his head down and runs toward first base.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The center fielder speeds after the sailing ball. Pete rounds first base and looks up. The center fielder dives as the ball looks like it is out of his reach. The ball hits the outer web of his glove and stays there miraculously like a snowcone. Out! The center fielder caught the ball and the visiting crowd erupts. Pete falls between first and second base and the home crowd lets out an audible groan.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sister Leonora Mary says there is only one way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well then, you and I will have to keep a secret from Sister Leonora Mary.
	</DIALOGUE>

Pete laughs. The dogs brings back the ball and drops it at Pete's feet.

EXT. SYNAGOGUE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe and Pete enter the synagogue. Rabbi Jacobsen stands at the pulpit and he is speaking to a quarter full audience. Pete grabs a yarmukle and puts it on his head. He looks at his dad to do the same thing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His dad, reluctantly, puts on a yarmukle. The two take a seat in the back row. The rabbi finishes speaking and the people disperse. Pete waits for them all to pass the last row when he stands up. Rabbi Jacobsen has his back to Pete as he gives instructions to his assistant. Pete heads toward the altar as Joe stays in the pew.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rabbi Jacobsen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
The rabbi turns. He smiles at Pete. He notices Joe in the back and waves to him. Joe gestures back.
</DIRECTION>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You cleaned up well from your game. What can I do for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABBI>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have a moment to talk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABBI>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know how I had my quest to get a Jewish person to heaven?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
The rabbi nods.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you realize that my quest is just like your quest as a rabbi, it's just that I called mine a quest and you call yours a job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't realize that but it seems to be true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABBI>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, my quest ended with Danny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
The rabbi nods.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But your quest never ends cause it's your job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABBI>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I learned something on my quest that might help you on your quest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you learn?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABBI>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I learned that just saying you believe or just praying to Jesus isn't how you get to heaven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABBI>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope. Jesus is only a symbol, like a letter or a number. You could really use anyone's name just so long that the person's name symbolized being good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is interesting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABBI>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I thought you might think so. My dad says I better stick to praying and acting like Jesus because the nuns wouldn't understand as well as you and him do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
The rabbi looks up and smiles at Joe. Joe waves back.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, my dad and I think if the Jewish people don't want to copy the Christians by praying to Jesus, you guys can make up your own name to pray to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have a suggestion for a name that I can bring to my congregation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABBI>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
The rabbi's eyes fill with tears and he puts his arms out for Pete.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete hugs him. And the rabbi squeezes tight. Pete lets go.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought that might help you in your job. On your quest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. It will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABBI>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see you later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
Pete turns and walks toward his dad, who stands at the back of the temple. Pete turns back to the rabbi.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I almost forgot to tell you the most important thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABBI>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That Danny is in heaven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<RABBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABBI>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
Pete smiles and turns around. He walks to his dad and Pete and his dad walk out of the temple together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
