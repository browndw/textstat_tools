INT. "THE DRAGON" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Chinese GONG SOUNDS and the glittering doors of an art Deco pa- poda slide open to reveal a mammoth silver stairway down which rows of beautiful women start descending (BEGIN MAIN TITLES)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lovely ladies are a mix of races and they sing a strange, haunting melody -- one might think them a heavenly choir, if it weren't for their sexy, clinging lame gowns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLUB ENTRANCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the ethereal beauties, we cut to a street urchin's dirty face: SHORT ROUND is a ten-year-old Chinese kis wearing a beat- up American baseball cap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sneaking into the club, Short Round weaves past the fancy gowns and silk suits, heading toward the music in the main ballroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BALLROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round enters and stares across the smoky nightclub. On the stage, he sees a giant paper-mache dragon laying curled around the pagoda.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, the dragon's eyes light up, its nostrils exhale smoke and its enormous jaws open. Out of the dragon's mouth walks the star of the stage show:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILLIE SCOTT, a dreamy beauty singing a sultry solo white the or- chestra wails the accompaniment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Short Round's not here to ogle crooning dames. He surveys the rich Chinese, American and European revelers. Jewels flash and champagne flows. Short Round finally spots a table of somber-looking Chinese men in suits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round chews gum and stares at the men. Then he turns to go. WU HAN, a waiter with a scar across his cheek, watches Short Round leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLUB ENTRANCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Short Round hurries toward the exit, he bumps into a man in a tuxedo entering the club. Short Round looks up at the man, but we don't see his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Short Round is grabbed by the scruff of his neck and a door- man hustles him out the door, Short Round yelling insults all the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A maitre d' apologizes to the man in the tuxedo and two hat-check girls smile at him familiarly as he continues into the ballroom. We notice something incongruous: the man in the tuxedo is wear- ing work boots caked with mud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BALLROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man in the tuxedo stops to watch Willie Scott singing sexily on the stage. Then he looks around and sees the table of somber Chinese men that Short Round spotted earlier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the man in the tuxedo walks toward the table, he removes a cigarette from a silver case. He arrives at the table just as the chorus and orchestra reach a crescendo --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And on the stage, a glistening, muscular slave swings a huge ham- mer toward an enormous brass gong --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man in the tuxedo leans to receive a light from a cigarette- girl and, as the GONG BOOMS, the match flares to reveal his face for the first time:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's INDIANA JONES. Elegant in a tuxedo -- dressed to kill. The TITLES END and over this a legend appears on the screen:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHANGHAI - 1935
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the table, the four Chinese man in suits stare coldly at Indi- ana.
</DIRECTION>

Lao's men laugh and assume that Indy doesn't understand his joke.

LAO SHE looks angry and his men's smiles fade.

<LAO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.

<INDIANA>

<DIRECTION>
Indiana takes a seat across the table from Shanghai's notorious crime-lord. Lao is fifty, wealthy enough to now display some fat, but still muscular from his fight to the top of the garbage heap.
</DIRECTION>
<LAO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For this special occasion, I ordered champagne and caviar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAO>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana looks at the pile of caviar on the plate in front of him -- and stubs his cigarette out in it. The cigarette sizzles and Lao's smiles dies with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's applause as Wille Scott finishes her song. At the table, Lao stares at Indiana with a strange intensity.
</DIRECTION>
<LAO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, it is true, Dr. Jones? you found Nurhachi?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAO>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana looks across the table at Lao's son, CHEN, who resembles a bulldog and snarls like one now.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was dark, but I think one of your sons tried to get Nurhachi without paying for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Indy stares pointedly at Chen's recently bandaged hand. Chen mutters and stands angrily -- Lao barks a command in Chinese and Chen sits down again.
</DIRECTION>
<LAO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have insulted my son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAO>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<LAO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAO>
<DIRECTION>
Lao pulls a wad of cash out of his pocket and puts it on the table. Indiana glances at it.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As I recall the deal was consid- erably more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Now a pretty hand slips onto Lao's shoulder and he looks up to see Willie Scott. Lao kisses her hand. Willie is unaware of the explosive mood at the table and she smiles flirtaciously at Indi- ana.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Lao)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you going to introduce us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<LAO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Willie Scott.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(watching Indy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this is Indiana Jones, the famous archaeologist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAO>
<DIRECTION>
Willie sits down between Lao and Indy. She takes out a small mirror to check her make-up.
</DIRECTION>
<LAO>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Jones found Nurhachi for me and is about to deliver him -- now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAO>
<DIRECTION>
Lao nods across the table and Indy sees KAO KAN, Lao's second son, open his coat and remove a silver-plated pistol. Indiana looks worried. Willie doesn't notice as she fixes her make-up and coyly teases Indiana.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- I thought archaeologists were always funny little men searching for their mummies --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(yelping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaahhh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks down terrified at the knife Indy is poking against her ribs.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lao, he's got a knife!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLE>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put the gun away, sonny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Kao Kan glances at his father. Lao finally nods to his son and he slips the pistol back into his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I suggest you pay me what you promised -- or your girlfriend here is going to be squealing a new tune.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
The ritzy patrons at the tables nearby are unaware of the tawdry drama quietly unfolding at this table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie eyes the blade and whimpers. She looks imploringly at Lao and he slowly reaches into his pocket. He puts ten gold coins next to the cash on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy leans forward to look at the gold coins -- so intently that he fails to notice Kao Kan spilling some powder into Indy's cham- pagne glass!
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try again Lao -- the deal was more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
The knife pokes Willie and she whimpers again. Lao reaches into another pocket and brings out a folded piece of rice paper -- he opens it and a large diamond and ruby spill out onto the table.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bingo...you see, Lao, with a but of persuasion, even you can be an honest fellow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Indy smiles and jabs the knife into the middle of the table. Then he lifts his champagne glass in a toast to Lao -- who watches expectantly as Indiana moves the glass toward his lips --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Willie stands angrily, jostling Indy's arm so that he doesn't drink his champagne.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at this! He put a hole in my dress from Paris!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Lao sees Indy put his champagne glass down and he snarls at Wil- lie --
</DIRECTION>
<LAO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAO>
<DIRECTION>
Willie quickly obeys. Lao forces a smile at Indy and lifts his glass to seal the deal --
</DIRECTION>
<LAO>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To your health, Dr. Jones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAO>
<DIRECTION>
Lao sips hs champagne and watches hopefully as Indy picks up his glass and this time Indy does drink the champagne. Then he reaches for the cash --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Chen grins and puts a silver snuff bottle next to the cash, gold and jewels -- he tips the little bottle over and some white powder spills out of it --
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<LAO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAO>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana examines his champagne glass and sees a residue at the bottom of it. He swallows and feels sick, wondering it it's fear or the poison already taking effect.
</DIRECTION>
<LAO>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is an antidote for this poison. You give me Nurhachi -- I give you the antidote.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAO>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana is sweating. Willie looks at him and sees Indy's hand shaking.
</DIRECTION>
<LAO>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The poison works fast, Dr. Jones. Where is Nurhachi?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAO>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana finally reaches into his pocket. Next to the cash, gold, jewels and poison, Indiana sets down a beautiful small box. Lao and his men stare hypnotically at the exquisite gold and enamel box.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(nervously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This Nurhachi's a very small guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Nobody pays any attention to her as Lao reaches for the box.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inside are the remains of Nur- hachi -- the first Emperor of the Manchu Dynasty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Lao opens the box carefully and stares reverently at the grey powder inside.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what about the antidote, Lao.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<LAO>
<DIRECTION>
(holding the box)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAO>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what's the big deal? Let me see it --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Qillie grabs Lao's arm and some of the precious ashes spill out of the gold box. Stunned by this desecration of his ancestor, Lao grabs Willie by the wrist and twists her arm --
</DIRECTION>
<LAO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fool!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAO>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ow, you're hurting me, you miser- able little hood!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let go of her, Lao. And give me the antidote.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Lao just laughs evilly -- until a waiter moves up behind Lao and the crimelord suddenly stiffens. He lets go of Willie's wrist and raises his hands off the table. Chen stops collecting the money and jewels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kao Kan tenses and Indy smiles at Wu Han, the Chinese waiter with the scar, who is standing behind Lao. Wu Han has a towel over his hand -- under it, he has a pistol pressed against Lao's spine.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont'd) (smiling at Wu Han)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like the service here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(puzzled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, he's not a waiter...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Wu Han's an old friend I brought along.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Lao)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, the game's not over. Put the antidote on the table, Lao.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Lao carefully reaches into his pocket and puts a small glass vial of liquid next to the cash, gold, jewels, poison and sacred box. Indy looks relieved as he reaches for the vial of antidote -- then he hears a muffled report! And another!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wu Han groans and sways. Indy starts to stand but Chen immedi- ately turns the smoking pistol with the silencer that he used to kill Wu Han -- Indy sees it pointed at him now and he remains in his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kao Kan stands and grabs Wu Han, easing the phoney waiter into the chair he just vacated. The muffled shooting hasn't attracted any attention. The nightclub activity continues an Indy speaks emotionally to his dying friend.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wu Han -- listen to me -- I'm going to get you out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
In pain, Wu Han looks at Indy and struggles to speak --
</DIRECTION>
<WU_HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not this time, my friend...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling bravely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I followed you on many adventures -- but into the great Unknown Mystery, I go first, Indy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WU_HAN>
<DIRECTION>
Wu Han dies and slumps forward. Indiana is shattered by the death of his old friend.
</DIRECTION>
<LAO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be sad, Dr. Jones -- you will soon join him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAO>
<DIRECTION>
Indy's gaze shifts from his dead friend to Lao's sneering face. Then Indy sees the murderous Chen giggling perversely. Indy's anger is compounded by the poison burning in his gut and his vis- ion of Chen's ugly face blurs into a double image --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy stands up unsteadily. Chen assumes he's about to keel over from the poison -- but Indy suddenly turns and grabs a real wai- ter at another table. The waiter holds a long skewer of roasted pigeons that he's just set afire --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy grabs the skewer of pigeons flambee and hurls is across the table! Chen fires and misses -- and screams as the skewer stabs into his chest and the burning pigeons flame in front of his hor- rified face!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This the other tables definitely notice. There are screams and all hell breaks loose. Indiana shoves past Willie and reaches for the vial on the table --
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The antidote -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
But he's grabbed from behind by Kao Kan. Indy elbows the punk, reaches back and grabs his head -- and somersaults Kao Kan onto the table!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As nubmer two son crashes into the table, the impact sends the Emperor Nurhachi's ashes billowing into Lao's stricken face!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana yells as he sees the vial of antidote rolling across the table -- and falling!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana dives and catches the antidote just before it hits the floor -- then Indy's hand is brutally stomped on by one of Lao's henchmen and the vial rolls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana angrily raises his head, smashing it up into the hench- man's groin -- the man howls like a banshee and hobbles away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Willie watches Lao grabbing for cash from the table. Willie lunges past the pigeon-skewered Chen to snatch the jewels, but unfortunately Kao Kan knocks them off the table as he leaps to attack Indy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana scrambles on his hands and knees after the rolling vial. People keep kicking it -- he almost has it when Willie runs into him, trips and lands on her back.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who cares? Where's that diamond!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Gunfire explodes and they both scramble in different directions. Indy dives through the fleeing nightclub patrons and slides be- hind a water-spewing fountain. Water kicks up as Indy is shot at by Lao and his henchmen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy sees the vial of antidote kicked again and it spins across the marble floor -- feeling the poison, Indy shakes his head groddily and splashes water on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Willie is chasing her diamond, shoving through the panicked crowd. She spots the diamond! Another elegantly dresses soman is bending to pick it up --
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(acidly polite)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, but I believe that's my diamond!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Willie smiles and suddenly kicks the woman in the butt! Willie reaches to get the diamond but not before the other woman tackles her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the fountain, Indiana makes a break -- he runs and dives on top of a serving cart. The wheeled cart hurtles toward an un- suspecting gunman, crashes into him from behind and sends him flying head first into a row of ice buckets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nearby, Willie slugs the other lady in the jaw and grabs for the elusive diamond just as the ice buckets showers ice across the floor -- which camouflages the diamond!
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw nuts!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Searching desperately for the jewel, Willie sees the vial of antidote spinning across the floor --as it slides by, she grabs it.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey,doll! Don't move!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
She sees Indy speeding by atop the serving cart. Lao and his gunmen rush out to block the way. Indy rolls off the cart and slides behind a potted palm as Lao's men open fire again.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont'd) (shouting to Willie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, don't go away! I need that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Willie smiles meanly as she slips the vial down the front of her dress, thumbs her nose at Indiana and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I wasn't dying, I'd kill her...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Hiding behind the palm tree, Indiana looks around and spots a gi- ant statue at the side of the stage. Indy makes a break for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the gunmen open fire, Indy springs onto a chair -- jumps onto a table -- and leaps onto the stage. He grabs the golden broad- sword from the Chinese warrior statue!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As bullets smash into the statue, Indiana hides behind it. Then he jumps out and swings the large sword toward the enormous brass gong.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crimson cord holding the gong is SLASHED! Indy slings the sword at his assailants and gives the three-meter-high gong a helpful shove --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The giant gong rolls and echoes as it crashes down the marble steps. Indiana ducks behind it as it gains momentum and rolls across the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using the gong as an enormous shield, Indy evades the gunfire ex- ploding -- bullets ricochet off the rolling brass gong as Indy runs behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead, Willie hurries toward an exit -- she hears something and turns -- her eyes go wide as she sees the mammoth gong bearing down on her!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie yells as Indiana grabs her arm and pulls her behind the gong with him --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lao watches amazed as he and his gunmen dodge tables trying to get better firing positions -- and more henchmen come into the club now and start firing machine guns!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As bullets clang against the gong, Indiana and Willie run behind it. Willie hollers as they head directly for a towering, floor- to-ceiling window!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana grabs Willie around the waist and, after the huge gong crashes through the stained-glass window, they both fly after it!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. "THE DRAGON" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a shower of sparkling glass, the enormous gong sails out and crashes down a sloping green-tiled roof. Indiana Jones and Wil- lie Scott hurtle into the night air after it!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gong rolls down the roof and they hit the tiles behind it, Indiana holding onto Willie as they roll one-over-the-other toward the edge -- Willie screams as they fall into thin air!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their entwined bodies plummet three stories: ripping through a third-floor awning, crashing through an old man's mattress on a second-floor balcony --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally they smash through the convertible top of a parked Duesen- berg and fall into the back seat!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE DUESENBERG

Willie sits up wide-eyed, speechless and amazed to be alive. Then she sees an equally astonished Short Round looking at them from the front seat.

The twelve-year-old Chinese kid turns his baseball cap bill- backwards and steps on the gas! The tires squeal as the car roars off --

The Duesenberg races past the entrace to the nightclub as Lao and his man rush out and jump into two black sedans. The sedans screech off in pursuit of the Duesenberg.

INT. THE DUESENBERG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Short Round eagerly swerves around a corner, Willie holds on for dear life. Indiana suddenly puts his hand down the front of Willie's dress --
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of gril!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana withdraws his hand, having finally found the vial. He opens is quickly, tips the vial to his lips and grimaces as he swallows the stuff.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't look very good.

As the car accelerates, Indy peers out the back window at their pursuers. Willie notices her reflection in the side window --
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at what you've done to me! I'm a mess! My lipstick's smeared, I broke two nails, I've got an aw- ful run in my stocking -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Gunfire suddenly explodes, bullets whizz through the canvas top and the rear window shatters and sprays glass! Willie ducks and cringes terrified in the corner --
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somehow I think you've got bigger problems.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Indy grabs his shoulder bag and pulls a pistol out of it. He pokes the gun through the broken window and starts firing back at their pursuers -- then he turns and looks ahead.

The Duesenberg tears around the square, followed by Lao's two se- dans. People on the street dive for cover -- coolies pulling rickshaws go into hyper-jov --lanterns spanning the street crash down and are dragged behind the Duesenberg. Bullets exlode and amazed prostitutes watch the cars zoom past.

Leaving behind the squalid port, the Duesenberg flies along the highway through the trees. In a moment, Lao's two sedans race by.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. NANG TAO AIRFIELD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Duesenberg swings around a curve and skids through gravel to- ward the airfield. In the distance there is a small terminal but Short Round wheels the car toward the cargo area --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A two-engine passenger plane is revving its motors and the last passengers are boarding. The Duesenberg squeals to a stop and Indy jumps out with Willie and Short Round right on his heels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A contingent of airport Military Police move to bar their way until WEBER, a heavy-set Englishman, runs up pufffing and shout- ing.

While Short Round grabs a small bag out of the car, Weber and a stewardess take their tickets and rush them all toward the air- plane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, the two sedans skid to a stop and Lao and his son Kao Kan jumpsout with their henchmen. The puzzled military police advance on them usspiciously --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Realizing he's outnumbered, Lao instructs his men to stay back and to put away their weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE AIRPLANE
</DIRECTION>

Willie and Short Round charge up the ladder and onto the plane. Indy pauses at the top of the steps to give Lao a cocky farewell salute. Indy boards the plane and the co-pilot slams the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE AIRFIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The plane starts taxiing. By the cars, Lao is buffeted by the prop wash as he angrily watches the plane roll away. Behind Lao, his son, Kao Kan, stares at the plane taking off -- a look on Kao Kan's face indicates that he hasn't given up yet...

INT. THE PLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A door opens at the rear of the plane and Indiana Jones exits wearing more familiar attire: a beat-up leather jacket over a khaki shirt and a snap-brim hat. He passes a dozen passengers as he moves up the aisle carrying his rolled-up tuzedo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the first row, Willie is busy fixing her make-up. Shorty sits in the seat across the aisle from her. Indy comes up and drops his tuxedo onto the floor.

Short Round tries to wake Indy again. Finally, Shorty grabs Indy's bag, pulls his holster out of it and runs toward the back.

Indy continues to sleep -- until bullets smash the window by his head and a fire extinguisher is hit and starts spraying into Indy's face.

He finally awakens and jumps up. He looks around is disbelief at the battle-torn, nearly-empty airplane.

As the first fighter appears off their side, Short Round blasts out the open door! The machine gun explodes to life, chewing bullets, smoking and spitting shells at Willie --
</DIRECTION>

Willie hollers terrified by manages to feed the ammo belt as Short Round sights the blazing machine gun -- suddenly he shoops!

<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE SKY - DAY
</DIRECTION>

The DC-3 lifts at the last second and smashes some snow off the uppermost pinnacle as it clears the mountain by inches!

Indy rushes out of the smoking cockpit to find Willie and Short Round crawling out from under the debris that's fallen on them. Then Indy spots something in the wreckage --

He pulls at some yellow canvas and Willie sees as sign: EMERGENCY LIFE RAFT. Indy drags the folded canvas over to the open door.

She throws her arms around Indy's neck so that she and Shorty are both hugging him from behind. Indy clutches the folded lift raft in front of him and surveys the mountainside rushing close be- neath the skinking airplane --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, an instant before the plane will hit, Indy dives and pulls the inflation cord!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE SKY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the smoking DC-3 screams out of control toward the mountain, skimming the rocky snow-covered slopes, we see the lift raft spilling out the open door --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The raft pops into its full shape, acting now as a spoiler, soar- ing against the rushing wind and finally crashing and bouncing against the snowy mountainside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, we see the DC-3 finally kiss the earth and ex- plode in a cloud of flame against a rocky escarpment -- metal and earth mushrooming in a million directions!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE MOUNTAINSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the raft rockets down the snow, Indiana clutches the front and Willie and Short Round hold on for dear life on either side of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The raft plummets down the mountain, crossing the timber-line and entering a forest. Bouncing over a snow-hidden log, the raft shoots directly for a tree --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana pulls on the perimeter rope, rolls on his side and man- ages to swerve the raft so it caroms offthe snow-drifted side of the tree trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Continuing its downhill run, the raft smashes across a small steam, sending silvery water spraying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the raft skids below the snow-level, it starts bouncing over rocky ground and its three passengers' teeth start chattering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A BLUFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The yellow raft crashes through a tangle of bushes and then plum- mets toward a bluff! The raft goes airborne over a small bluff and lands with a splash in a slow-moving river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE RIVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The life raft drifts down the river and Indy looks around and smiles cockily at Willie and Short Round --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their faces don't show gratitude, but horror -- Indy hears some- thing and turns to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHITE WATER RAPIDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The raft is heading directly toward a surging stretch of treach- erous rapids. Indiana looks less cocky as he and Willie and Short Round hold on again for dear life!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The raft plunges into the roaring torrent, bouncing over rock- swollen waves, twisting and spinning through narrow gaps. The three helpless passengers are drenched in the thundering cascades of white water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie is hallering, Short Round hangs on wide-eyed and even Indy looks terrified as the raft crashes down the rapids. Finally, after one heart-stopping bounce, the raft seems to slow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVER CLEARING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The raft drifts out of the main part of the river and glides to- ward a clearing. Its three soaked and bedraggled passengers lie motionless in the bottom.
</DIRECTION>

Indy's hand drags alongside the raft, his fingers leaving a trail in the almost still water. Battered and exhausted, but always Indy's "bodyguard", Shorty looks over at him worriedly --

She rolls over and yelps as she looks up at the bizarre, painted face of a SHAMAN. Silhoutted against the blazing sun, the skin- ny little old man in a loincoloth stares down at them in the raft.
</DIRECTION>

An eerie wind rises and howls. The old man places his palms to- gether and moves his hands up to touch his forehead. Willie and Short Round watch mystified as Indiana returns the old shaman's silent greeting.

EXT. MAYAPORE - DAY

At the base of the hills, Mayapore village does nothing to re- lieve the awful sense of devastation. A desolate road runs through the village, along which groups of ptiifully poor vil- lagers stare at the strangers being brought in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hopeless women lift buckets from a dry well -- finding only sand. Skinny miserable dogs skulk between the decrepit village huts, eyed by the patient vultures lurling in scraggly trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana notices the wretched peasants staring at Short Round, some of them pointing at him, a few haggard women shedding tears down their wrinkled faces as the little Chinese boy passes.
</DIRECTION>

There is no sign of children in the village and Short Round grows frightened by the odd attention. He moves closer to Indy as they pass the devastated population.

Black clouds clot across the blood-red sky as darkness falls. Indiana, Willie and Short Round sit tensely on a shabby rug. Above their heads, there is a thatched roof, but there are no walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dying sunset silhouettes them and the half-dozen elders seat- ed in the dirt around them. A grey-haired man, the village CHIEFTAIN, gives quiet commands to the women who scuttle in and set wooden plates in front of the three visitors. No plates are places in front of the elders.

Indiana sees the painted shaman, who sits next to the chieftain, watching Willie. The women bring in a bowl from which they scoop tiny portions of grey gruel onto three plates.

Short Round looks plenty scared as they all stop walking. The shaman motions and the men with torches circle around a pile of rocks to illuminate them. The shaman makes a gesture of devotion to the primitive shrine and Indy speaks to the village chieftain.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

Indiana seems skeptical as he kneels to study the shrine. On top of the pile of rocks, there is a carved niche. The niche is empty but an indentation indicates the conical shape of the stone that was stolen.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Was the stone very smooth?

INT. INDIANA'S HUT - NIGHT

The wind swirls into the hut and Indiana's eyes open. He lies still a moment and then sits up slowly. He sees Short Round sleeping nearby.

Sensing something strange, Indy gets to his feet. He steps around Short Round and goes to the door of the hut.

Indy walks against the rising wind and looks around. The village is asleep and seems deserted. Then he turns and sees something.

The little boy's eyes open and he begins to revive. Shrot Round And Willie watch from a corner as the little boy looks at all the faces peering down at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The little boy's arm moves and he reaches out to Indy rather than any of the others. Indy takes his small hand and sees that the boy's fingers are cut and bruised -- his fingers open and drop something into Indy's hand.

The little boy tries to whisper. Indy has to lean close to hear as the little boy's lips move again --

A mother rushes into the hut now and kneels and hugs her little boy. His skinny arms go around her as they are reunited. Indy stands slowly and looks at what the little boy gave him --

A BOA CONSTRICTOR is moving out along the branch, the enormous snake slithering over Willie's clothes.

Willie watches Indiana walk away as she reaches up for her dress -- her hands feel something strange -- not the dress and not the tree limb --

Willie looks up and sees that she's pulling on a snake! She SCREAMS as the boa constrictor falls off the t-ee on top of her!

	Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.

Indy picks up a blanket and spreads it on the ground.

<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, in- credibly rich prince.
	</DIALOGUE>

Indy lies down on the blanket.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Fortune and glory...

</WILLIE>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe...

</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Indy reaches into his pocket and removes the old piece of cloth.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She walks over to where he's lying down and sits on a boulder. He hands her the cloth and she looks at it by the firelight.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something that kid gave me last night. It's a piece of an old manuscript.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Willie sees a crude drawing in reds, blue and gold.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does the writing say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(examining it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at Indy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Indy looks at her meaningfully.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It could be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Willie seems frightened. She hands him the piece of cloth and stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fortune and glory...sweet dreams, Dr. Jones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up a blanket and starts off.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you should sleep closer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(seeing her sus- picious look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I meant for safety.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She steps over to a tree by the fire where her clothes are dry- ing. Indy watches her pull her dried clothes from the lower branches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches up to remove another piece of her clothing -- it's stuck to the tree and she looks up and yanks it. Suddenly the piece of clothing moves!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two enormous winds open and the hideous face of a GIANT BAT screeches and hisses at Willie! She screams hysterically as the bat flaps against her, biting and scratching at her before it fi- nally takes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bat flies off into the darkness and Indy chuckles as he watches Willie shanking as she backs slowly toward the fire --
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you see it?! It was one of those bats!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(staring into the darkness)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, what else is out there...?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She quickly picks up her blanket and lays it out very close to Indy.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Couldn't keep away, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just try and control yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana watches her lie down and wrap herself in her blanket. then he rolls over and tips his hat down over his eyes to get some well-deserved shut-eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a moment, however, we see something grotesque and snake-like slide into frame and move towards Indy -- finally, we realize it's an elephant's trunk. The trunk nudges Indy's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
(without looking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still scared? Okay, Willie, you can get closer if you want...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
The elephant's trunk moves closer and nuzzles Indy's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, I knew you'd be the first one to give in...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Now, we see that Short Round is guiding the baby elephant's trunk with a prod. Willie watches, stifling a laugh as the elephant's trunk sniffs Indiana's ear --
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to start something I'm going to have to finish.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moaning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, doll, you asked for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana rolls over, lifts his hat and hollers! He nearly jumps out of his pants as he stares into the elephant's trunk. Willie and Short Round dissolve into laughter.

EXT. THE JUNGLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tall, vine-covered trees sway in the wind. Beneath them, the el- ephants plough through the dense tropical forest. The sounds of the teeming jungle multiply as Short Round surveys the distant hills.
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_ROUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indy, look!

</SHORT_ROUND>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>

EXT. A JUNGLE CLEARING - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their Mayapore guide walks toward the camera and suddenly looks frightened. He barks commands and the elephants stop. Indiana jumps down an joins the fearful guide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stare at a small statue of a malevolent goddess with eight arms. Around the goddess's neck, a carved necklace displays small human heads -- her eight hands hold other heads by their hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana moves closer to the statue as the terrified guide backs away. Indy is fascinated by the ritual objects adorning it: leaves, dead birds, rodents and turtles. Indiana grimaces as he lifts a necklace of real pierced human fingers...
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are we stopping here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana goes back and joins the scared, jabbering guide who is helping Willie down from the elephant. Short Round jumps down.
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_ROUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you look at, Indy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a statue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the guide talking about? He hasn't said a word the whole trip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Indy listens to the agitated guide and then speaks a few words in Hindi back to him. They watch the distressed guide trun the ele- phants and start away with them as fast as possible.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's afraid of something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Willie moans and follows Indy. Short Round watches the elephants trudging away. The little elephant turns and looks back. Short Round quickly wipes a tear from his face.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A PALACE APPROACH - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana and Short Round hike up a rock-paved road beside a high wall. Exhausted, carrying her high heels, Willie trudges along behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- shot at, fallen out of a plane, nearly drowned, squashed by a snake, attacked by a bat -- I smell like an elephant!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tell you I'm not going to make it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana finally stops. He walks back to Willie, suddenly picks her us in his arms and starts carrying her the remaining way. Willie is surprised and puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any more complaints?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling faintly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't seem to mind being carried by Indy. He arrives at the entrance to the palace and puts her down -- she stands close to him and he gently smoothes the collar of her dress.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't feel like there's been any permanent damage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles at him again and then turns around -- and whistles as she sees Pankot Palace: a sprawling, monumental mixture of Mo- ghul and Rajput styles, the palace is an extravaganza of Princely architecture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three travelers start across a marble bridge toward the main entrance. Lined along the bridge, palace guards stand with lances.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the threesome passes, the first Rajput guard snaps noisily to attention and Willie jumps. As Willie continues across the bridge, the other guards snap to attention in sequence and she grins, enjoying the attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE OUTER COURTYARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round and Willie follow Indiana through a dark archway into a glittering courtyard. The palace seems deserted and forebod- ing.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Hello?...(hello?)...(hello?)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy's voice echoes off the marble facades -- three enormous Raj- put guards with curved swords in their sashes appear silently at opposite sides of the courtyard.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(frightened)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi...(hi)...(hi)...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Then, a tall severe-looking Indian in an English suit material- izes out of the shadows and comes forward slowly. CHATTAR LAL appraises the intruders suspiciously:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees a whoozy beauty in a weary evening gown; a dirty Chinese kid with a baseball cap; a rugged-looking American carrying a bullwhip...
</DIRECTION>
<CHATTAR_LAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would say you look rather lost.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(disdainfullt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHATTAR_LAL>
<INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling evenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.

INT. PANKOT PALACE - AFTERNOON

<DIRECTION>
They walk along the marble halls, past dazzling walls inlaid with pieces of mirror and semi-precious stones. Fountains spray in ivory countyards and they gaze in awe at the ornate splendour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Willie walks with Shorty she appraises the chronolgoical portraits of the Pankot Prices that line the hall. Dissipated faces, elegant faces, evil faces -- she reacts to them.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Short Round)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you like to run into him in a dark alley...that one's kind of cute...I could see myself married to a prince like that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead of them Chattar Lal walks with Indy and questions him suspiciously --
</DIRECTION>
<CHATTAR_LAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHATTAR_LAL>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should have been there...

</WILLIE>
<INDIANA>

	I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.

<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that him?

They've come to the last in the row of Princes portraits. Wil- lie stops and looks up disappointedly at a picture of an aged, immensely corpulent Rajput prince.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>

	He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".

	No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.

<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- good. And maybe the pres- ent Marahajah is a little younger? And thinner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Two female servants approach silently and bow.
</DIRECTION>
<CHATTAR_LAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHATTAR_LAL>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to to get ready!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She hurried off with one of the servants toward her room. Chat- tar Lal smiles cooly at Indiana --

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An extraordinary gold dome rises in the middle of the eleaborate gardens. The Pleasure Pavilion is ablaze with torch lights, flickering candles and exotic music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana comes out of the palace with Short Round. Indy has on a tweed jacket and a nectie -- his university professor's outfit. Short Round has been cleaned up, but still sports his baseball cap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie joins them, looking stunning is a silk Western-styled gown. She's also been loaned some Moghul jewelry which sparkles on her neck and arms.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look like a princess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Willie's flattered by the first nice thing Indy's said to her.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's sort of like being in heaven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
They cross the garden toward the pavilion and Willie's eyes are like a kid's at Christmas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PLEASURE PAVILION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they enter, Indiana gives a half-dressed dancing girl the once-over as she spins to the music of drums and "vinhas".

They walk among the rich court ministers and Indian merchants. Chattar Lal approaches with a British cavalry captain in unifrom.

As Willie chatters on with the Prime Minister, Indiana wanders off. He moves to a wall where bronze statues and strange devo- tional objects are displayed.

Indiana puts the doll down and looks over at Chattar Lal and Willie.

	The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.

</CAPT_BLUMBURTT>
<DIRECTION>
Indy and the Prime Minister exchange distant looks as Willie comes back over to Indiana. She talks to him conspiratorially --
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think this Maharajah is swim- ming in money. Maybe coming here wasn't such a bad idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Blumburtt finds these Americans quite suspect and seems relieved when he hears a drum.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPT_BLUMBURTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe we're being called to dinner.

<WILLIE>

	Finally!

</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
As the drum beats the assembled guests move toward a long, low table surrounded by colorful pillows. Short Round follows with a little monkey he's found perched on his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As everyone stands around the table, Chattar Lal makes an an- nouncement in Hindi and then in English --
</DIRECTION>
<CHATTAR_LAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His Supremem Highness, guardian of Rajput tradition -- the Maharajah of Pankot -- Zalim Singh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHATTAR_LAL>
<DIRECTION>
All eyes are on two solid silver doors which open -- and through which now walks the MAHARAJAH ZALIM SINGH. Everyone is bowing, including Indiana and Willie, who looks amazed --
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe he likes older women.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Indeed, Zalim Singh is only thirteen. Outfitted in silver and gold brocade, festooned with enormous jewels, the litlle Mahara- jah gazes imperiously at the bowing crowd -- and then glares at Short Round.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy sees Short Round chewing gum, staring antagonistically at the Maharajah. Indy pushes SHort Round into a bowing position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Maharajah finally sits down on golden pillows. He nods and his guests take their seats. Indiana sees Willie's dreams of queendom have vanished.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never been so hungry in my life...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Servants appear with silver platters of steaming food. They place a platter in front of Willie and she stares at it in amaze- ment:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a whole raosted boar, replete with a decorative arrow pierc- ing its bloated stomach and tiny broiled baby bores placed around it as if they were suckling on their well-cooked mother.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(grimacing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My god, sort of grusome, isn't it...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing the meat being served, Indiana looks across the table at Blumburtt who seems equally puzzled. Meanwhile, the little Maha- rajah whispers to his Prime Minsiter. Then Chattar Lal speaks to the table --
</DIRECTION>
<CHATTAR_LAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His Highness wants me to welcome his visitors. Especially the renowned Dr. Jones from America.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHATTAR_LAL>
<DIRECTION>
Indy bows slightly toward the Maharajah.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are honored to be here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Servants put down another platter. Willie stares at an enormous steaming boa constrictor on the platter. With a flash of a knife, a servant slits the huge snake and exposes a mass of squirming, live baby eels inside...
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suddenly I'm not so hungry...

	I had a question, Mr. Prime Mini- ster. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<CHATTAR_LAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHATTAR_LAL>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, very fine. But not all of the pieces look old. Some were carved recently and look like images used by the Thuggees to worship the god- des Kali.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
At the emntion of the Thuggees, the Indians at the table quiet, as it a taboo has been broken. Chattar Lal glares at Indiana.
</DIRECTION>
<CHATTAR_LAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHATTAR_LAL>
<CAPT_BLUMBURTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The Brit- ish Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.

Short Round avoids the dinner by feeding it to his little monkey as he listens to the scary conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The talk is bad enough, but Willie finds the food unbelievable! A servant leans overher shoulder and places a six-inch long BUG on her plate!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie whimpers quietly as she watches the fat merchant next to her lift one of the black, shiny baked-beetles -- and crack it in two! The man proceeds to enthusiastically suck the gooey innards out.

</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana smiles and shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<CHATTAR_LAL>
<DIRECTION>

Indy catches a glance between the little Maharajah and the prime minister, who answers slowly --
</DIRECTION>
<CHATTAR_LAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The local peasants are just as superstitious. You're very ob- servant, Dr. Jones. But you're beginning to worry Capt. Blum- burtt.

Blumburtt's phlegmatic attitude has changed to curiosity.

Short Round's monkey suddenly screeches and takes off. Willie closed here eyes in dread - but curiosity gets the best of her and she looks -- it's worse than she could imagine:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plates full of small, dead monkey heads! (*Production note: be- cause of his extremely sensitive nature, the director has reque- ted that these monkey heads be simulated).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tops of the monkey's skulls have been cut off and sit loose like little covers. Willie watches in utter dismay as the Maha- rajah and his guests remove the skull-tops and start dipping spoons into what's inside --

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hundreds of lanters illuminate the garden where after dinner drinks are served, cigars lighted and hookah pipes puffed on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana comes out of the pavilion into the garden with Capt. Blumburtt and they talk quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPT_BLUMBURTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rather bizarre menu, woundn't you say?

Now, the little Maharajah comes over with his retinue and he reaches for Indy's whip which Short Round is carrying.

<MAHARAJAH>

</MAHARAJAH>
<SHORT_ROUND>

Short Round grabs for it, but Indiana restrains him.

	We're guests here, Shorty.

The Maharajah glares are Short Round and five the whip to Indy.
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARAJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will show me how it works please.

</MAHARAJAH>
<DIRECTION>
Indy bows to the little prince and smiles ironically --
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wish is my command, your Highness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
While Short Round watches angrily, Indiana walks across the gar- den and unfurls the whip. Indy sees a servant lighting a candle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the whip flies and CRACKS like a pistol shot. The candle disappears! Indiana whirls and CRACKS the whip again, snagging a flower out of a dancing girl's hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Maharajah reacts like any kid -- he shoops happily.
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARAJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is wonderful! Please teach me how!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARAJAH>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round sulks as he listens to Indiana instructing the Maha- rajah on how to hold the whip. As the young prince practises the grip, Indy notices Chattar Lal slip behind a fountain to talk to a dark figure in robes who appears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana sees Chattar Lal bow to the dark figure -- and Indy catches a glimpse of the stranger's pale face and dark hollow eyes. Then the robled apparition seems to disappear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile everyone watches respectfully as the Maharajah unfurls the whip for his first attempt. He flings the whip but it flies back and snaps -- biting his own cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a stunned silence -- then Short Round laughs at the little prince who is holding his wounded cheek. The incensed Ma- rahajah suddenly flashes the whip as Short Round.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round grabs the end of it and pulls hard -- the whip is tugged taut between the two hostile boys. As they draw near each other, Short Round sees something weird:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The little Maharajah's eyes begin glowing yelloe and he hisses softly in a strange voice. Nobody else sees or hears the bizarre transformation...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana finally intercedes -- he grabs Short Round by the neck.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Short Round, let go of it.

Short Round lets go and Indy gently takes the whip back from the little prince.

Short Round shakes his head scornfully as Indy crosses the hall and knocks on another door. After a moment, the door opens and Willie is standing there in a tempting nightgown.

As he puts on his jacket he walks past the life-sized paintings of armed gaurds standing in silent vigil. Suddenly we see something frightening behind him: one of the wall paintings sees to come to life!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large figure in robes and a turban looms out from the wall and lifts a silk cord -- the figure wraps the cord suddenly around Indiana's neck!
</DIRECTION>

The huge assassin stands behind Indy, twisting the cord even tighter around his neck. As Indy attempts to break free he sees the assassin's face is a mirror -- and a strange yellow light glowing in the killer's eyes.

INT. INDIANA'S SUITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy shoves the assassin backwards, ramming the big man into the wall. The assassin maintains his deathgrip -- while on the chaise, Short Round sleeps through it all!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gasping futilely for air, Indy sinks slowly to his knees - his eyes bulge and he stares at the tiny, smiling skulls at the ends of the death-cord wrapped around the assassin's fists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana sinks lower and then feels something -- desperately he grabs a brass pot on the floor by the handle and swings it with his last strength, smashing it up into the assassin's head with a skull-crushing clang!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The assassin is stunned and Indiana curls forward pulling him into a somersault and sening him flying over his back. The ass- assin crashes on his sping next to the chaise. Short Round still doesn't wake up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana rips the cord from around his neck and gasps for breath. He sees the assassin pulling a knife. Indiana dives as the knife flies through the air and slams into the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana grabs his whip, rolls and lands on his feet. As the ass- assin tries to retreat, Indy unleashes his whip -- it CRACKS and wraps around the killer's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The big man struggles, pulling on the whip, trying to release it from his throat -- and Indiana holds fast, watching the killer gasping for air now as his face turns red.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the assassin does a full-blown backward sommersault which rips the whip out of Indy's hand. The assassin has an in- stant to grin victoriously --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until he sees that the whip handle is arching toward the ceiling where is gets caught on the revolving fan! The surprised assass- in it tugged upwards -- and the whip twists around the ceiling fan like fishing-line around a fishing-reel--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And like a doomed flounder, the assassin is slowly reeled up and dragged toward the ceiling, his toes lifting off the floor. The assassin screams as he is hanged! His legs twitch in his death throes -- and below him, Short Round finally wakes up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Always Indiana's protector, Shorty instictively leaps off the couch and draws a small dagger --

INT. WILLIE'S SUITE

<DIRECTION>
In a tight close-up: Willie screams again. She's lying in bed looking down at something --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving up her shapely leg, a green and black, monstrous-looking insect crawls onto her stomach and Willie stops breather. Immo- bilized by fear, Willie watches in silent agony as the hideous insect climbs slowly up her breast and slithers toward her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the suite, the doors burst open and Indiana rushes in. Shorty is behind him, carrying Indy's whip. Indiana leaps on a stools and slides up to the bed to save WIllie --

Then he spots the giant insect crawling on her and decides to have some fun.

Indiana shrugs and leans over and casually swats the horrible bug off her face. He and Short Round watch the insect skid across the floor -- and suddenly disappear as if by magic!

Puzzled, they wander toward the wall, leaving Willie behind, bathed in sweat, staring at the ceiling --

She dashes behind a screen to start getting dressed. Meanwhile Indy feels the marble walls. He moves to a niche in which there is a small statue of Ganesha, the friendly elephant god.

Indiana lifts the statue -- and a panel in the wall opens slow- ly. Short Round looks amazed. Indy watches the light fall across the far wall of a tunnel as the door opens slowly.

Indiana, Short Round and Willie exit the spike chamber and head down a larger tunnel through which a roaring wind intermittantly blows, howling eerily like a note of gloomy music.

Indiana follows a curve in the tunnel and they see light approaching. The wind holws another dramatic note which gales past them as they reach the mouth of the tunnel.

Indiana is joined by Willie and Short Round. They all stop in astonishment at the sight below them:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TEMPLE OF DEATH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the camera pulls back, the mouth of the wind tunnel in which they are standing becomes just a small hole overlooking the stag- gering vastness of the incredible TEMPLE OF DEATH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The colossal subterranean temple has been carved out of a solid mass of rock. A vaulting cathedral-like ceiling is supported by rows of carved stone columns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Balconies overlook the temple floor. Pillared halls leading to dark side chambers. Moving out of these chambers, hundreds of faithful worshippers chant as they enter the temple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mammoth stone statues of elephants, lions and demi-gods (half/man, half/animal monstrosities) loom above the swelling crowds or wor- shippers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the wind howls out of the tunnel high above the temple, the worshippers chant in response to the strange tunnel music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The moaning wind rushes past Indiana, Willie and Short Round as they watch the mystery cult below bowing toward an enormous altar at the far end of the temple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This altar is a platform jutting out from the stone wall of the cavern. Separating the worshippers from this altar is a wide crevasse out of which wisps of smoke rise occasionally.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE ALTAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the other side of the crevasse, evil-looking priests materialize out of clouds of swirling smoke. The priests carry smoke-billowing urns to a giant stone statue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, we see the hideous protectress of the temple, the obscenely malevolent ombect of the cult's devotion: the bloodthirsty god- dess KALI!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The red-eyed priests bow at the base of the statue and gaze reverently at their KALI MA. Skulls surround her stone feet carved serpents twist up her legs, while around her waist there is a guresome belt of human hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Naked to the hips, Kali's hair falls about her four arms. In her hand, she holds a sword, in the second the severed head of a giant.With her other hands she encourages her worshipers, who are chanting louder and louder!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kali's face is loathsome: her earrings are two corpses. Her evil tongue extends out of her twisted mouth and what looks like read blood flows over her long fangs and down her naked breasts.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
A huge drum sounds three times and the chanting stops. The silence is chilling as another robed figure appears out of the some on the altar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is MOLA RAM, the High Priest of the Thugge cult. Mola Ram's red-rimmed eyes glare from the sunken sockets in his sinister face. Here is a man who looks as vile and diabolic as the unholy goddess rising behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up in the wind tunnel, Indy stares down at the High Priest and realizes that is was Mola Ram he saw conferring with Chattar Lal in the palace garden.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the drum booms three times more, Mola Ram lifts one arm up from his emaciated body and suddenly there is a scream!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All heads turn toward an unfortunate, struggling Indian begin dragged out by priests. The man's face and body are wildly painted. He screams again as he's tied onto a square iron frame laying atop a large flat stone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mola Ram steps forward to the stretched-out victim and the Indian looks up into the High Priest's grotesque face --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Mola Ram's hand shoots out toward the man's chest -- and pierces it! The High Priests hand sinks into the victim's writing body and rips out his living heart!

Stranger still, the sacrificial victim is still alive -- there is no evidence of a gash on his chest, only a reddish mark The priests add chains to the iron frame and carry the victim over toward a hoist hanging over the crevasse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man thrashes about helplessly on the iron frame as it is up ended and then lowered with the victim hanging face down --

As the sacrificial victim looks down into the crevasse below -- he screams -- and we see the molten lava bubbling crimson at the bottom of the chasm!

INT. THE WIND TUNNEL

Willie closes her eyes but Indy and Short Round watch horrified as the iron frame is lowered -- and the bloody heart continues to beat in Mola Ram's hand -- and the molten lava burns and flickers as the screaming victim is lowered deeper into the crevasse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TEMPLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The weird paint on the victim's face starts to smoke and sizzle -- the man's skin blisters as he's lowered within feet of the lava. His flesh smokes and he screams one last time as his body bursts into flame.

The iron frame sinks and submerges into the boiling fiery lava.

Above the crevasse, Mola Ram continues to hold the heart in his hand -- the heart is smoking and bursts into flames - and disappears!

INT. THE ALTAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sankara Stones shimmer brightly, and inside the crystallized quartz, the enormous sparkling diamonds of legend are now re- vealed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mola Ram stands facing Kali with his arms outstretched and kneels and bows and then walks off the altar and disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE WIND TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana sees the woshippers below start to leave the temple. He looks at Willie and Short Round.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay -- now listen -- you wait here and keep quiet. Shorty, keep an eye on her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round nods and hands Indy his bullwhip and shoulder bag. Willie sees Indiana peering down at the sheer drop below the mouth of the wind tunnel.

	I keep my eye peeled, Indy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana nods and looks down at the now empty temple. Then he slips down from the mouth of the wind tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TEMPLE WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana skillfully clumbs down an enormous tmeple column -- find- ing footholds on stone cobras, carved lions and the stone breasts of dancing girls. Slowly, he makes his way down and swings across a balcony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BALCONY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana walks quietly along the balcony overlooking the temple. He stops -- between him and the altar is the crevasse with the lava bubbling fire at the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana looks across the gulf and sees another column near the altar at the top of which stone elephants are perched. Indy curls his whip and suddenly lets it fly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The whip cracks and its end wraps tightly around the tusk of one of the stone elephants. From the balcony, Indy tugs the whip taut, takes a breath and runs --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CREVASSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana leaps and swings out on the whip, arching down and up, over the chasm of fiery lava in a spectacular curving jump!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LATAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy lands on his feet and turns to release the whip. Short Round waves to Indy that the coast is clear. Indy snaps the whip -- it releases from the elephant tusk and drops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Recurling the whip, Indy attaches it to his belt and moves to- ward the towering statue of Kali. The three Sankara stones start to glow and Indiana approaches them cautiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaching the stones, Indy's face is lighted by them. He notices that one of them (sthe stone from Mayapore village) has strange lines painted across it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suspiciously, Indy touches the stone, but it doesn't burn. He lifts it carefully and peers into it. The enormous diamond sparkles inside. He places the stone in his shoulder bag and reaches for the others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE WIND TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round and Willie watch apprehensively as Indiana bags the three stones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE ALTAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana backs away and looks up at the horrific statue of Kali. It seems to be watching him. He turns and is about to go when he hears something --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It sounds like a voice and Indy is afraid to turn -- could it be Kali? The he hears other noises echoing and turns slowly. Real- alizing the sounds are coming from behind the altar, Indy moves around it toward the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE WIND TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round and Willie are mystified as they see Indiana dissap- pear behind the altar.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh hell, where's he going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round looks worried. Then the wind rushes past them quickly and howls its somber musical note. However, the wind sounds dif- ferent this time, its tone quavering slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round is puzzled and looks around. He feeezes when he sees two shadowy figures coming down the tunnel toward them -- the bodies causing the tone of the wind to shift eerily --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie notices Short Round pulling a dagger from his belt -
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly she turns and screams as two huge Thuggee guards rush at them! One grabs at Short Round but the kid slashes the guard's hand with his dagger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie tries to get past the other guard, but he snatches her by the arm and pulls her toward him -- from her training at the Col- lege of Hard Knocks, Willie successfully knees the big man in the balls.
</DIRECTION>

</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The man groans and sinks to his knees. Willie sees that Short Round is in trouble. She runs over, leaps onto the back of the other guard and starts ripping his hair out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round picks up his fallen dagger. The big guard lurches backwards and smashes Willie into the rocky wall of the tunnel. Willie falls to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round approaches, holding the man at bay with his dagger. Willie turns as the other guard, the one she kneed, crawls toward her -- Willie scoops up some dirt and throws it. The man claws at his eyes and Willie jumps up.
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_ROUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run Willie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
Willie starts to run and Short Round backs away, keeping the guard at a distance with his dagger. Suddenly the guard cries out in Hindi and dives at Short Round.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Panicking, Shorty tries to run after Willie -- but he's tripped. The guard has Short Round by the foot and drags him back. Willie looks around and stops running. She sees Short Round is caught.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Run! Go get help!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
Willie hesitates, then runs down the tunnel. Meanwhile, a mam- moth hand clutches Short Round's throat -- the giant guard lifts Shorty completely off the ground and the kid looks terrified and helpless as he dangles in the air...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHAMBER BEHIND ALTAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana enters the dark chamber behind the altar. The only il- lumination is the back-light streaming around the silhouetted statue of Kali.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy slowly crosses a narrow stone bridge and moves toward a cy- lindrical shaft of light rising up from what appears to be an enormous hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy hears voices and the clink of metal against rock as he con- tinues forward. The ground is dark in front of the large hole. He edges toward the precipice and the light rising up illuminates the look of shock on his face as he peers down into Hell...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE THUGGEE MINES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy looks into a deep pit around which concentric paths leads off into numerous narrow tunnels. Crawling out of these burrows, scrawny children drag sacks of dirt and rock. Other hollow-eyed children pull these sacks to mine cars waiting on rails.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Straining to lift the rocks into the mine cars, several of the children slip and fall. Bare-chested Thuggee guards shout at the enslaves children and kick those who've fallen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For these children there would seem to be only one hope -- death -- an end to their travail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana edges around the hole, looking into the ghastly mine and feeling as if he's discovered an inferno of misery as grotesque as Dante's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy shifts the bag of stones on his shoulder. He hesitates and considers his choice: he has the Sankara Stones and can leave with them now...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Indy hears the pleading cries of one child and peers down to see a burly Thuggee guard beating the pitiful little slave. Indy gets angrier and angrier as he watches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finally steps over the grabs a boulder. He lifts it and flings it down into the mine --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE MINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Indiana above and the boulder hurtling down -- it crashes onto the head of the Thuggee guard who hits the ground like a sack of cement!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy sees the startled slave children looking up at him in shock. He smiles victoriously at the Thuggees below who've run over to see what happened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy's smile seems to fade as his anger turns to surprise as he feels something unnerving:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dirt is crumbling away from the rim of the hole, a small landslide starting beneath his feet. Suddenly the floor gives way and Indy slips!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire rim of the hole shears off and Indy topples with it and plunges down into the mine toward the assembled guards who scatter -- Indy yells as he falls and it echoes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A CELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana's yell continues to echo -- his head jerks suddenly -- Indy jolts awake as if coming out of a nightmare, awakened by his own reverberating shout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy is lying on the rocky floor of a dark cave/cell. He lifts his hands and discovers that they are chained. In the murky light, he sees Short Round sitting in chains across the cell.
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_ROUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indy -- you knocked out when you fall. You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>

Indiana nods groggily. He sees a young slave worker in rags sit- ting near Short Round. Through the iron bars of the cell, Indy sees the children slaving in the mine tunnels.

INT. A MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana and Short Round are pushed down a tunnel by guards. They are stopped at a door and shoved inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOLA RAM'S CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana and Short Round stumble into the chamber. It is a terri- fying gallery of occult yantras, ritualistic statues and grisly icons of the evil Thuggee sect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grotesque statues of Kali's baleful minions line the walls. In a corner, there is another statue of Kali herself, draped with flowers, necklaces of real human skills and slithering belts of live snakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fresh blood has been splashed over the statue and at its base are the three Sankara Stones recovered from Indiana. Mola Ram sits in a yoga position near the statue of Kali.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mola Ram opens his eyes and he sees Indiana and Short Round standing in chains before him.

Mola Ram stands and gazes transfixed at the stones glowing on the altar.

Mola Ram nods and two guards grab Indy. They drag him struggling to a rock and chain him to it. Short Round scuffles as he's pulled aside to watch.

Remembering the High Priest's earlier open-heart surgery, Indi- ana looks worried as Mola Ram approaches him --
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARAJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will not suffer. I recently became of age and tasted the blood of Kali.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARAJAH>
<DIRECTION>
Now the young initiate comes forward and Indiana looks startled -- it's Nainsukh. He is wearing robes and his eyes are glowing strangely. Nainsukh hands Mola Ram a hollow human skull full of blood!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guards hold Indiana's head back and force his mouth open. Mola Ram tips the skull and blood spills out of its death- grinning jaws and flows into Indiana's mouth. Indy gags --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he spits the blood, spraying Mola Ram and the little Maharajah. Looking at his blood-splattered clothes, the Mahara- jah is furious.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLA_RAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold him!

As the guards turn Indy face down, they rip off his jacket and chain his ahnds to the rock. The Maharajah uncurls the whip -- he notices Short Round smiling snidely --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the Maharajah cracks the whip -- it lashes out and cuts into Short Round's shoulder. Blood appears and Short Round looks stunned by the lash and by the fact the Marahajah knows who to use the whip.

The little Maharajah whirls and lashes the whip again. Indiana jerks as the bullwhip rips through his shirt and tears open his flesh. The Maharajah lashes again and again -- blood spurts across Indy's tattered shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the whipping continues- Short Round jumps as if he is also be- ing beaten. His eyes fill with tears as he watches Indy suffer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, the little Maharajah lets the whip fall limp. As the Maharajah approaches Indy, Short Round lunges as him angrily but the guards restrain him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana groans as he's turned over. Blood trickles from his mouth and he stares up hatefully at Mola Ram.

Diaphanous curtains billow silently into the moonlighted room. Two exotic birds sit on a golden perch, their eyes clicking watchfully. Suddenly the brids shriek and flap away --

Willie rushes out of her room and runs through the deserted pal- ace looking for help. She flies down the moonlit corridors, past the huge wall paintings.

EXT. THE PALACE ROAD - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dust swirls as the British cavalry moves off with their Highland Pipers at the head playing a military bagpipe tune. Capt. Blum- burtt comes out of the palace and gets into an open car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blumburtt's car moves off behind the cavalry and then the supply trucks follow.

INT. WILLIE'S SUITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The whine of the bagpipes is eerily muted in the dark room. Through the gently swaying mosquito netting, we see Willie asleep on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then through her side of the gauzy netting, we see the door opening across the room. Indiana enters quietly and moves toward the bed, his eyes fixed on Willie's sleeping body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy sits down on the bed slowly. Willie turns in her sleep and opens her eyes. Through the mosquito netting she sees Indy sit- ting with his back to her.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indy? Did you walk to them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</INDIANA>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So now they believe me.

</WILLIE>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, they believe you.

Indiana speaks in a strange monotone.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then they'll send the soldiers down into the temple...

</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Willie looks at Indiana's back and continues quietly.

<WILLIE>

(Cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.

	No... they won't kill me.

</INDIANA>
<WILLIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Now Indiana starts to turn slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't lose me, Willie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
She sees him turn and his face slowly comes toward the mosquito netting -- his face pushes into the netting and Willie looks stunned as Indy's mouth opens --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts hissing grotesquely, smoke billows out of his mouth and the mosquito netting BURNS OPEN to expose his terrifying face moving toward Willie --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is forzen with fear and unable to utter a sound as Indy's malevolent face looms at her -- and then she notices his eyes -- his eyes glowing a hellish luminscent yellow!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie SCREAMS!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She suddenly bolts from the bed and tries to run -- Indiana goes into a rage, ripping the mosquito netting from the bed as he fol- lows her.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! I've found it -- you can't -- Kali knows!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Willie tries the door but it's locked. She sees Indiana moving toward her ranting incoherently as he smashes a vase out of his way --
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- been too many lies -- there's no god's heaven -- just -- the horror! I've seen it -- life preying on life!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Willie cowers in a corner, horrified by the transformation she sees in Indiana. Shouting and pacing Indy holds his head against the pain of his terrible thoughts --
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- rivers -- destroying mountains -- a comet in space -- exploding!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(holding his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaahh! -- the screams -- pitiful people -- their pain -- the hate -- and greed -- always greed!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
The light throws his shadow over Willie -- a giant shadow float- ing back and forth over her as she cries in the corner, unable to fight the evil devouring Indiana.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- but I've found -- Kali's touch! Death -- no more lies -- the death I've been searching for!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quit crying! She can hear you -- Kali knows fear -- don't you under- stand -- Kali is freedom!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana stops pacing and Willie freezes in terror. Now a bizarre yellow light wipes across the room. Indiana turns and watches silently as two Thuggee guards emerge from a secret doorway that's opened --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shadows of the Thuggee guards loom over Willie and she SCREAMS again!

INT. THE TEMPLE OF DEATH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sea of frightening faces once again intones the horrible sacri- ficial chant. Among the shorshippers, the little Maharajah sits on a riased platform. Like the other believers, he stares across the crevasse at the altar of Kali Ma.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wailing wind howls out of the high tunnel and the terrifying chanting reaches a fever pitch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TMEPLE ALTAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And once again the three sacred Sankara Stones glow magically. Mola Ram materializes evilly amidst the swirling smoke and he begins chanting in Sanskrit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beside the altar, half-clad female acolytes pass in front of the robed priests -- with their fingers the women paint two white lines across the priests' foreheads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An acolyte moves in front of Chattar Lal -- the Prime Minister is now dressed in robes. As the devotional markings are painted on his forehead, Chattar Lal translates the High Priest's speech to Indiana who stands next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHATTAR_LAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHATTAR_LAL>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana bows his head to receive the mystical markings. He lis- tens to Mola Ram's rantings -- Indy's eyes are ominously vacant as he stares up at the hideous statue of Kali.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MINE TUNNELS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beneath the temple, down in the bowels of the mountain, the piti- ful children dig at the earth with their fingers. A FAT GUARD slouches down the tunnel, flogging malingerers with a aleather strap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round sweats next to the others, clawing at the rocks, doomed to work with them now in their search for the last wo Sankara Stones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The leather strap suddenly flays Short Round's back and he barely manages not to scream out in pain. The fat guard passes -- Short Round and the other kids pull a large rock which suddenly comes loose out of the wall -- !
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They fall back and see they've exposed a vein of molten lava! Hearing their shouts, the fat guard returns -- yelling at their stupidity, he whips them and shoves them aside brutally.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round see the fat guard's eyes glowing fiercely in anger. Suddenly the fissure shoots out steam and spews some molten lava over the guard's legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guard screams and falls to the ground, thrashing about, try- ing to kick the searing lava off his smoking flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the other kids cower, Short Round's humane instincts cause him to jump forward to help the guard who moments earlier was beating him --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round tosses dirt on the guard's legs and grabs a gunny sack and starts rubbing the lava off. Shorty notices something strange:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guard's eyes, which were glowing yellow before, are now dim- ming and returning to normal. The moaning guard looks at Shorty thankfully and then looks around as if waking from a nightmare --
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
(to another slave kid)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His eyes -- they go out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
Other guards appear and lift the guard -- suddenly he starts struggling against the guards not wanting to return to the night- mare of Kali --
</DIRECTION>
<FAT_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
(as he's dragged away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! NO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAT_GUARD>
<SHORT_ROUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The pain -- the pain makes him wake up!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(thinking quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indy! I can make Indy wake up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
But the other guards push and beat the children back to work. Short Round is shoved against a wall and groans -- he reaches over and grabs a large rock, lifting it defiantly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But rather than heaving it at the guard, Short Round smashes the rock down on the leg chains binding him to the other children. Shorty beats at the chain with the rock, determined to escape.
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_ROUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TEMPLE OF DEATH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind moans and joins Mola Ram's voice echoing maniacally over the multitude gathered in the enormous temple. On his throne, the little Maharajah listens transfixed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE ALTAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chattar Lal watches Indiana staring hypnotically at the High Priest as he speaks --
</DIRECTION>
<CHATTAR_LAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You understand what he tells us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHATTAR_LAL>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kali Ma protects us now and for- ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly htere is a heart-rending scream of terror and the priests draf forward the next sacrificial victim --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana's glowing eyes watch emotionlessly as Willie is brought out. Dressed in a Rajput maiden's outfit, Willie has been jewel- ed and draped with flowers -- a strange contrast as she struggles desperately.
</DIRECTION>
<CHATTAR_LAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your friend has seen and she has heard -- now she will not talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHATTAR_LAL>
<DIRECTION>
As Willie is dragged past she sees Indy and calls to him --
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indy! Help me! Indy?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Willie is shocked seeing that Indiana remains impassive and un- caring as she's dragged to her death.
</DIRECTION>
<CHATTAR_LAL>
<DIRECTION>
(to Indy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This will prove your devotion to Kali.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHATTAR_LAL>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana looks away from Willie's terrified face and stares up adoringly at the monstrous statue of his goddess Kali.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE MINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the dark tunnel, a rock smashes down onto a chain -- and breaks it! Short Round is exhausted. He looks around furtively and sees a guard approaching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round takes a chance -- he dives and rolls across the tunnel. He ducks behind a mine car full of rocks being pushed out by two chained children.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guard lumbers past unsuspectingly as Short Round makes his escape using the moving mine car as cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE ALTAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up in the temple, Willie continues to struggle as her legs are strapped to the iron sacrifical frame. Chattar Lal grabs her hand and ties it down. Willie's free hand reaches out imploring- ly toward Indiana --
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(hoarsely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, God, don't let them do this to me -- help me, Indy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches out slowly and Willie grabs his hand tightly. Indy looks into her eyes and then stares at her hand -- and slowly lifts it and starts tying it to the iron frame.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Willie cries is disbelief as Indiana calmly betrays her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE MINES BELOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round races up a tunnel and then flattens himself behind a corner. He peers anxiously into a large carven and sees two guards walking away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the coast is clear, Short Round darts across the cavern to a long wooden ladder tilted up against a wall. Short Round looks up the high ladder and sees a kid with a sack of rocks descending from a burrow-hole half-way up the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The exhausted kid nearly collapses at the bottom -- then jumps seeing Short Round. Shorty motions for him to keep quiet. Amaxed, the kid watches Short Round scramble up the ladder. Shorty continues until he is high above the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dirty faces stare out of the high burrow as Short Round stops climbing. The kids are astonished as Short Round suddenly grunts and kicks the ladder away from the wall!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The high ladder falls in an arc and what seem like sure suicide slowly resembles a mini-Indiana Junes stunt as Short Round swings to the other side of the falling ladder --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round holds on for dear life as the ladder crashes against the opposite cavern wall -- giving Short Round access to the roof-hole that leads up to the temple!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round scurries up the ladder and pulls himself up into the chamber behind the altar. He looks at the light flaring around the statue of Kali --
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_ROUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indy -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TEMPLE OF DEATH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chains clank and gears grind as the sacrificial frame is raised over the crevasse. Stretched out on it, Willie looks horrified as she hangs suspended face down above the boiling lava!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The frame and victim descend slowly into the crevasse and the crowd around the little Maharajah changs louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE REAR CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round dashes across the dark chamber behind the altar. He peers out and sees Willie disappearing into the crewasse! He sees Indiana watching impassively --
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_ROUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- Indy -- wake up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
Then Shorty sees a flaming torch hanging on a wall bracket and he has an idea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE ALTAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round suddenly darts out onto the altar and Mola Ram sees him and yells. Several priests grab for Shorty. He eludes the first priest, smashes the second in the stomach with his head, and runs like a little quarterback toward the fiery torch --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round snatches the torch from the wall and charges toward Indiana. Seeing him coming, Indy's eyes start glowing yellow and when Short Round runs up to him, Indiana suddenly swings and backhands the little guy brutally across the face!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The torch flies out of Shorty's hand as he's knocked against at wall by Indy's vicious blow -- Short Round wipes a little blood from his chin and stares at his hero in wounded disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chattar Lal watches approvingly -- a priest moves toward Shorty. Chattar Lal looks back toward the crevasse --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie hangs on the lowering frame, heat waves rising up now to scald her skin and she chokes as the sulphuric air burns her lungs!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile Short Round is crawling backwards across the floor with a look of terror on his face -- Indiana stalks him, hissing, snarling, his eyes lgowing --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round springs to his feet and tries to run -- Indy grabs him and pulls him -- Shorty's hand grabs for another wall torch and just manages to yank it free!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana spins Short Round and clutches his throat. As Indy strangles him, Short Round struggles and finally jams the torch into Indy's side. The fiery torch burns Indy, smoking as it sears his flesh, and he yells in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_ROUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wake up! It's just a nightmare, Indy! Wake up, please Indy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana writhes in pain and Short Round sees the evil yellow glow in Indy's eyes getting dimmer and finally going out. Now it seems like theold Indiana staring at him --
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indy, you back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a priest grabs Short Round and pulls him off Indiana.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Give him to me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round is firghtened as Indy grabs him from the priest. Indy lifts Short Round into the air --
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_ROUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Indy, no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
He sets Short Round down on the brink of the crevasse an inch from doom. Shorty looks down at the lava and is terrified. Indiana finally flahses him a quick smile and winks!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Indiana whirls and punches the priest in the face! Short Round cheers, realizing that Indiana is back.
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got to help Willie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana springs into action, stopping another priest with a quick punch in the stomach. Then he rushes over to the crankwheel and pulley platform. Indy jumps onto it, yanking one priest off who spills onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A second priest, who works the controls lowering the sacrificial frame, sees Indy and releases the crankwheel --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down in the crevasse, Willie screams as the iron frame suddenly plummets toward the fulminating lava!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the platform, the priest lunges at Indiana -- Indy uses the man's own momentum to throw him over his head. Indy then dives for the crankwheel and manages to stop it --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down in the crevasse, the fram jolts to a stop only yards above the spumes of fiery lava. The heat is so intense now that Wil- lie's clothes start smoking and she passes out... On the platform above, Indiana cranks furiously, raising the sa- crificial frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TEMPLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chanting stops at the Kali worshippers notice the battle on the altar. The little Maharajah looks concerned and leaves, shoving through the crowd behind his bodyguards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE ALTAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mola Ram shouts at his priests and another one of them runs to- ward Indy on the platform. Short Round dives and tackles the priest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chattar Lal finally leaps onto the crankwheel platform and Indy sees him pull a dagger. He slashes at Indiana and Indy has to let go of the crankwheel -- the gears scream and the chains screech!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below in the crevasse, the iron frame plunges again toward the crimson lava!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the platform, Indy hears the frame lowering and looks pan- icked. Chattar Lal slahses again with the dagger -- keeping Indy away from the cogwheel mechanism --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy suddenly kicks the dagger from Chattar Lal's hand slugs him in the stomach and dives toward the cogwheel mechanism. He grabs a iron rod and throws it into the gears --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the gears mangle the iron rod but finally grind to a stop. Indi- ana grabs the crankwheel and starts winding it up furiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Short Round jumps onto the platform with Indy and grabs a long wrench. He starts swinging the wrench, keeping the last priests off the platfrom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sacrificial frame finally rises up into view and Indiana grabs it and swings it over onto the platform. He looks at Wil- lie anxiously as he releases her bindings --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie moans and moves her head. Indy pulls her off the frame and she starts coughing. Gasping for breath, Willie ervives as fresh air flows into her lungs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally Willie opens her eyes and she sees Indiana. Then she notices something else and manages to cry out hoarsely --
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look out -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Chattar Lal grabs a pistol from an unconscious guard and Indiana whirls to see him pointing it -- Indy kicks the gun from his hand and suddenly Chattar Lal starts shouting in a terrifying voice --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chattar Lal's eyes glow as he lunges suicidally at Indiana, at- tempting to take Indy with him as he dives from the platform!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crashing into Indy, Chattar Lal knocks both of them back onto the sacrificial frame which swings out over the crevasse --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy manages to dive off the frame just in time. He grabs hold of the platform as the crankwheel screams and the frame falls!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking up from the depths of the crevasse, we see the frame with Chattar Lal on it plummeting downward into the sulphurous smoke! The frame finally crashes, splashing into the molten lava.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chattar Lal's body explodes inot flame friefly -- his flesh is broiled off in an instant -- we glimpse a skeleton momentarily -- and then all is consumed and obliterated by the blazing lava.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
scramble over to Short Round who jumps off the platform and they follow him across the altar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy sees Mola Ram quickly collecting the sacred Sankara Stones. Indiana rushes over and spins Mola Ram around --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slugs the High Priest in the face and Mola Ram keels over backwards against the statue of Kali. Short Round helps stuff the Sankara Stones into Indiana's shoulder bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE REAR CHAMBER

Short Round, Willie and Indiana rush across the chamber behind the altar. They run over to the ladder and start climbing down into the mines.

Willie follows Short Round. Indiana jumps down last and pulls the ladder away, letting it crash to the floor so they won't be followed.

<DIRECTION>
They draw the attention of the slave children working in the tun- nels around the cavern. But it's the sight of the approaching guard that worries Indy --

<INDIANA>

<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're we going to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana looks around at the silent, frightened children who've stopped working in the tunnel and his anger darkens --
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to get them out of here -- !
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Then he looks at the bag holding the Sankara Stones and grows still more determined --

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, sir? Excuse me --

	Listen, I'm from the union and I'd like to talk about the working conditions here. Could you step inside a minute?

Indy smiles again and disappears into the tunnel. In astonished rage, the guard draws his sword and goes after Indy into the tun- nel -- there's a pause and then we hear the guard yell!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie flattens against the wall as Indiana catapaults the big guard past her back into the mine where he's set upon bu a horde of rebellious slave children.

In another location, kids wrap captured guards in layers of chains...

<DIRECTION>
Freed children scramble up numerous ladders to escape the mines below. They follow the mass of children moving toward the front altar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE ALTAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the altar, under the statue of Kali, Willie and Short Round are helping Indy and some of the bigger children rip down a long wooden panel decorated with hideous Kali figures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The childrens' escape is blocked by the chasm separating the altar from the deserted sorshippers' area of the temple. The swelling crowds of children push and teeter dangerously on the edge of the fire pit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana and the others carry the wooden panel through the crowd toward the chasm. They stand it up and when Indy gives thw word they drop it --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The panel crashes across the chasm forming a plank across which the children now begin running to safety.

Indy stares at the plank and sees that it's starting to smoke from the intese heat rising up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the far side of the plank, the children safely across scatter through the deserted temple toward freedom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie and Short Round help the last kids out onto the plank -- Indy sees one child's foot break though the smoldering wood -- the kid in front pulls the child to safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie and Short Round start to go out onto the plank but Indy shouts at them --
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, wait!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
He runs over and pulls them aside -- he steps out onto the plank and takes a few steps to test it -- suddenly the plank bursts into flame in the middle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy takes one more step -- and then the plank breaks! Indy dives back to the ledge of the altar and Willie and Short Round grab him and pull him up and the wooden plank plummets into the fiery chasm.

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana, Willie and Short Round run through the deserted mine tunnels. They hear a rumbling noise and Indy leads them down a side tunnel. They stop and peer into a quarry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE QUARRY CAVERN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large cavern is the depository for the mine cars rolling in with loads of rock. Emaciated children (still unaware of the re- volt and the other childrens' escape) break their backs shoving the heavily-loaded mine cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thuggee guards supervise the deadening work, while others oper- ate the pulley-and-hoist system used to drag the cars up the sloped dump ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind this operation, a thunderous waterfall cascades into a huge cistern. From there, chutes deply the rushing water to power the large conveyor belt below it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the cars rise up the ramp, they tip and spill rocks onto the conveyor belt which carries them toward an awesome stone cylinder that rolls relentlessly , crushing the rocks into sand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the side tunnel, Indiana watches the noisy operation.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those empty cars have got to go out of the mines.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Willie and Short Round watch the children push the empty mine cars. The cars gain momentum and roll away down two dark tun- nels.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, let's see if we can catch a ride...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Tey duck out of the tunnel and run for cover behind a slag heap. Loaded mine cars roaring down from the mines hurtle past them and crash to a stop against the cars in front.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Shorty -- go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes Short Round who darts out after a mine car roars past and dodges across the tracks before the next one descends. Indy pushes Willie into position and holds her ready --
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
After another car crashes past, Indy shoves her. Willie runs out -- her shoe gets stuck and she freezes in the tracks! Willie sees a rock-filled car blasting down out of a tunnel directly toward her!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana dives, knocking Willie safely to the ground on the other side of the tracks -- the heavy car hurtles past and crashes into the cars in front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy pulls Willie behind a massive wooden post holding up the dump ramp and they hide from a passing gaurd.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got to get across to the empty cars. Wait here until I signal you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
They watch him run and hurdle a pile of lumber, bound up three steps and duck behind a tool shack on the platform. Indy reaches out and grabs one of the passing slave children.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They see Indy put his hand over the kid's mouth and whisper to him. He releases the kid who sneaks away, alerting the other children who start making their escapes into side tunnels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Indy motions to Short Rounds and Willie to follow. As they start to move out they freeze dead in their tracks and Indy motions again angrily --
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Willie and Short Round see a guard coming up the steps on the other side of the platform. As the man rises he gets taller and taller -- until they see it's a Thuggee giant coming up behind Indiana.

<SHORT_ROUND>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana turns and looks into the bare chest of the seven-foot tall guard. Indy has to look up to see the man's mean-looking face.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see the problem...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana suddenly punches the giant in the stomach -- the giant does not flinch, he just belches rudely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana growls and winds up to take a killer swing -- he steps back, cocks his arm -- and suddenly turns and runs away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No dummy, Indy dashes over and picks up a piece of wood. The giant starts toward him. Indy drops the wood and looks around for a much larger piece of wood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the giant stalks toward him, Indiana raises the large piece of lumber -- Indy suddenly groans, drops the wood and clutches his stomach. Willie and Short Round looks startled --
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round shakes his head. They see Indy recover from the spasm as the giant rushes him. Indy jumps aside, landing on a loaded mine car that is passing by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car is being dragged up the dump ramp and the giant jumps out onto it after Indiana. Indy quickly grabs a rock and, as the giant rushes him, Indy smashes the rock against the big man's skull!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unfortunately, it's the rock that shatters and not the skull. Indy dives to the other end of the mine car and lifts a large boulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Indy drops the boulder and grabs him arm, feeling a shooting pain again. Then he yells as he feels yet another stab- bing pain in his left leg.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong with him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Shorty is convused and worried -- and then he sees something! He looks up and there on a rock-cut balcony over the cavern is the little Maharajah!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The little prince clutches the clay krtya doll that represents Indy. He jabs it in the leg with a long sapphire-tipped turban pin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the mine car, Indy yells and grabs his right leg, which collapses beneath him. Short Round takes off. He dashes under the platform toward a bucket-chain carrying spent water back up to the cistern.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round leaps over the pool of water and grabs onto a bucket. He rises up on this make-shift elevator toward the rock balcony and the malicious little Maharajah.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Indy is on the brink of unconsciousness as the giant's massive hands throttle his neck. Indy's head hangs over the end of the mine car and suddenly his eyes widen --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car with Indy and the giant reaches the peak of the dump ramp and its upended -- spilling both of them and a shower of rocks down the conveyor belt!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down below, Willie dodges wooden pillars and weaves around quarry equipment, trying to follow Indy's battle with the giant. She trips and swears angrily --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie pushes and empty mine car out of her way -- an empty mine car! She runs back and starts shoving the mine car along the rails toward the conveyor belt.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got one! Indy, I got one!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Near the waterfall, Short Round ascends on the rising bucket chain. Up on the balcony, the little Maharajah chuckles evilly as he watches Indiana on the conveyor belt --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Maharajah lifts the clay doll and viciously jabs the pin in the back of it!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On te conveyor, Indiana gets to his feet and then yells as a stabbing pain lacerates his back! He falls and writhed helpless- ly as the giant staggers up the rocky conveyor belt toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie shoves the mine car forward. She sees Indy's desperate situation as he's pulled along the conveyor toward the rock crusher!
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indy, look out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up and sees Short Round leap from the bucket-chain onto the balcony. The little Maharajah's eyes glow fiendishly as he lifts the clay doll -- and jabs the pin into the doll's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the conveyor belt, Indy yells agonizingly and clutches his stabbed face! Behind him, rocks explode as they're crushed and pulverized by the mammoth roller.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front of Indy, the Thuggee giant grabs a pick-axe as the con- veyor slides past a tool bin. The giant approaches Indy with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round dashes across the balcny and tackles the Maharajah. They fall and fight like mortal enemies. Short Round sees the little Maharajah's eyes glowing as he punches him in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only a few feet away from the rock-smashing roller, Indy is still on his back on the conveyor belt, thrashing in pain, feeling the Maharajah's pin piercing his face. The giant raises the pick-axe above his head and it about to split Indiana in two!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the balcony, the Maharajah drops the doll and Short Round dives for it -- he grabs the clay doll and pulls out the pin!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the conveyor belt, Indiana is suddenly released from the and looks up to see the giant swinging the pick-axe. Indy rolls aside at the last minute!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pick-axe cleaves into the conveyor belt and the giant lurches forward -- Indy gives him a helpful kick, sending the giant flying toward the rock-crusher as Indy jumps off the conveyor belt!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing the huge roller looming in front of him, the giant crawls desperately against the movement of the conveyor belt -- but he gets snagged!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sash around his waist gets caught under the rolling cursher and he's dragged back under it feet first. The Thuggee giant screams hideously as his body is rolled over and squashed by the enormous stone wheel!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the balcony, Short Round is jabbing the pin into the squirming little Maharajah. The little pricne's eyes still glow yellow as he hollers --
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_ROUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How you like bing pin cushion, Mr. Rajah-ha-ha?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
The little prince rolls on the ground and tries to fight off Short Round who keeps jabbing him -- suddenly the Maharajah swings and the pin is accidentally rammed clear through his hand!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shorty sees the pin sticking through both sides of the kid's hand. The Maharajah stares at his pierced hand, gasping in astonishment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round notices the yellow glow dying out of the Maharajah's eyes -- just as Indy's eyes cleared after he was released from Kali's trance.
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARAJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please -- pull it out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARAJAH>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round yanks the pin out of the little prince's hand. The Maharajah looks like he's jsut awakened from a bag dream.
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_ROUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was the black sleep of Kali...

<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Indy runs along the catwalk above the conveyor belt. He jumps and grabs onto a cross-bard -- he kicks out with his feet and knocks a quarry guard off the catwalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guard flies through the air and topples into the sand pit where he thrashes around blindly under the sand falling from the crusher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the cavern, Willie shoves the rolling mine car toward the balcony.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get down here, Shorty! I got us a ride!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>

Up on the rock balcony, Short Round lowers himself over the edge. The little Maharajah grabs his arm --
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARAJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please -- listen -- to go out you must take the left tunnel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARAJAH>
<DIRECTION>
Shorty looks at him and he knows he's telling the truth.

</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round slips over the edge and slides down a wet stalactite to the floor of the cavern.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There he finds Willie swinging the brake-handle and smashing the guard in the gut. The man doubles in pain -- Willie kicks his putt and he splashes into the pool of water.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Across the quarry, Mola Ram and six temple guards run out onto a high platform next to the waterfall. Mola Ram sees Willie and Short Round pushing the mine cat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mola Ram shouts to his men -- two of them pull pistols and open fire!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bullets ricochet off the mine car and Short Round shoves Willie to the far side of the car where they both take cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, up on a catwalk, a guard slices a sword through the air and Indiana ducks! The sword slashes into a wooden railing and the guard tries frantically to pull it out --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana slams kis knee up into the guard's stomach and then smashes his fist down on his neck -- the man collapses. Indy hears more gunfire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana rushes along the catwalk toward the platform above. He edges against the wall below the platform, staying out of sight as he unfurls his whip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of Mola Ram's guards fires again from the high platform and Indiana lashes the whip -- the whip wraps around the gunman's arm and Indy yanks on it --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gunman topples through the air and crashes down onto the cat- walk. Indy grabs the gun. He kicks the guard off the catwalk and the man falls into the waterfall pool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the other guards fire down at him, Indiana dodges along the catwalk and fires back at them. A bullet explodes near Mola Ram and he ducks back --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Short Round and Willie have the mine car rolling and they jump into it --
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_ROUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indy! Hurry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana spots the rolling mine car racing across the quarry. Indy takes off and runs along the catwalk -- bullets explode around him, splintering wood. Indy reaches the end of the catwalk --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he dives into the air and catches hold of a block and tacke! Indy skids along the pulley system, sliding down a cable toward the mine car in which Short Round and Willie are riding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bullets whiz past as Indiana sails in the air above the speeding mine car - when they are in sync, Indy lets go and drops into the mine car next to Willie and Short Round!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mola Ram rushes forward and watches the speeding mine car rolling down the track toward the tunnels --
</DIRECTION>
<MOLA_RAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've stolen the Sankara Stones -- they must be stopped!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLA_RAM>
<DIRECTION>
In the speeding mine car, Indy sees the tracks separating in two directions -- one back into the quarry, the other toward two tun- nels that lead out of the mines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana lifts a shovel from the floor of the car and swings it just in time -- he hits a switch which CLANGS as they speed by and the car is shunted tipsy-turvy onto the track toward the two tunnels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie hangs on as the car tears down the track toward the tunnel on the right -- and Short Round looks worried --
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_ROUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Indy, it's left tunnel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
But it's too late and they all hold on as the mine car shoots donw into the darkness of the echoing tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind rushes past Indiana as the car descends into the tunnel and picks up speed. Willie hangs on with Short Round -- the mine car roars around a curve and flies fater along the rails.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE QUARRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back in the quarry, Mola Ram supervises the guards as they shove empty cars toward the tunnel. Carrying long Khyber rifles, they jump aboard the cars. The first one rolls into the dark tunnel and the second car speeds after it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two Thuggee cars shoot past, descending into the darkness in pursuit of the infidels who stole the Sankara Stones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mine car hurtles past. Indy sits in front, pulling back on the brake-lever to control their speed and keep them from careen- ing off the tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Expecting trouble, Short Round peers over the back end of the car. Willie ducks low, watching the heavy beams flashing danger- ously close above their heads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Willie's eyes go wide and she groans in terror like a girl on a roller coaster as the mine car suddenly plunges downward, taking their stomachs with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gunshot rings out and Short Round sees the first Thuggee car appear around a curve behind them. Mola Ram's gunmen start blasting. Bullets ricochet off the mine car and Indy yells back to Short Round.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>

Short Round grins as he holds the brake -- Willie realized that this is Shorty's idea of a good time!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CAVERN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up in the quarry, gunmen push a third car toward the tunnel, but Mola Ram stops them. He shouts and they turn and look instead toward the waterfall and huge cistern....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana is crouched in the back of the zooming mine bar blasting away with the pistol he captured in the quarry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gunman in the car behind returns his fire, the explosions lighting up the tunnle walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy aims and fires again -- the gunman is hit and knocked back in the car. Another guard with a Khyber rifle moves up to the front and starts firing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, as the car goes into a hard turn, Short Round rides the brake -- beneath the car we see the brake-pad scraping on the metal wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tunnel gets lower and Indy has to duck under each beam flying over and can only pop up to fire between the low beams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rifleman in the car behind is relading. Then he lifts his rifle -- Indy pops up simultaneously and shoots!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gunman is hit, his rifle flies up and his head smashes against the beam hurtling above! Screaming horribly, the gunman is knocked from the speeding car like a broken doll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CAVERN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up in the quarry, Mola Ram's men swing sledge hammers, bashing away at the rock supports under the huge water-filled cistern.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana runs out of bullets. He sees the car behind getting closer. He tosses the pistol and hits a Thuggee in the head. Another Thuggee retrieves Indy's pistol and starts reloading it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Indy is being shot at by his own gun and he yells to Short Round
</DIRECTION>

<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What above the curves?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round looks scared as Indy released the brake and the car hurtles toward a curve. They grab the sides of the car as it tips precariously. Behind them, the curve throws the gunmen from side to side in the car following.
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_ROUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indy, look out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
A sharper curve looms ahead and Indy shoves the brake completely off!
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you doing?! We're going too fast!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Willie closes her eyes as they rocket toward the curve. In the car behind, the Thugge guard at the brake also shoves the brake off -- and looks extremely worried.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy's car hits the curve and the centrifugal force lifts the in- side wheels off the rails!
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get over on the other side!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Willie and Short Round jumps over to his side as the car whips around the curve! Indy looks back and sees the car pursuing them is also taking the curve at full speed --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the Thuggee car swereves dangerously, the weight shifts too much to the outside -- and the car derails!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car bounces off the tracks and flies through the air into a siding where is CRASHES against a stone wall in an EXPLOSION of rock and metal!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pieces of debris pommel the drive of the second Thuggee car and he quickly grabs for the brake to slow down and avoid the same fate!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the lead car, Indy smiles smugly as Willie opens her eyes.

INT. THE CAVERN ABOVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mola Ram's guards continue to bash away with sledge hammers at the rock supports under the mammoth cistern. One of the supports starts to crumble --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From above, we see the cistern list to one side and water laps dangerously over the edge as the huge tank creaks and sawsy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana and Short Round heft a railroad tie out of th bottom of the car and Willie watches them lift it onto the back --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As gunfire continues to explode from the car behind them, Indiana and Short ROund shove the railroad tie off the back of the car --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wooden railroad tie falls and bounces back across the tracks. The gunmen in the car behind spit it and yell in panic --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy and Willie watch the car behind crash into the railroad tie -- but the tie just skids, catches and bounces up and out of the way like a huge tumbling matchstick!
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>

<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CAVERN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sledgehammers continue -- until two of the rock supports give way! There are shouts as the guards run for cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mola Ram stands on a platform watching the huge cistern slowly keel over -- the noise is incredible as the colossal tank crashes to the ground!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a half-million gallons of water explode across the cav- cern and surge in a tidal wave toward the tunnels!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The walls of the tunnel flash past and curves appear suddenly out of the darkness as the hair-raising chase continues --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round and Willie struggle to help Indy lift a large boulder from the bottom of the speeding mine car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cars descend again into a stretch of much lower tunnel where the beams flash past inches above them. Indy judges the beams --
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay -- one -- two -- NOW!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
All three of them groan as they raise the boulder and shove it off the back of the car -- ducking instantly to avoid being de- capitated by the next beam!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking back, they see the gunmen pop up between the beams -- and they see the looks of terror on the gunmen's faces as they see the boulder in front of them!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Thuggee car hits the boulder and upends! The guards scream horribly as the car tumbles end over end, slamming against the tunnel walls, getting ripped to shreds so that finally only pieces of metal, wheels and debris fly like a meteorite shower down the tunnel!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie whoops for joy and hugs Indy who smiles modestly --
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Shorty, hit the brakes!
	</DIALOGUE>

Short Round dives for the front of the car and ahppily pulls the brake lever -- it doesn't work! Short Round yanks on it harder -- the brake level suddenly breaks off!
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_ROUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indy!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
Indy sees Short Round holding up the broken brake lever! Indy crawls quickly toward Shorty while Willie holds on for dear life!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Completely out of control, the car hurtles down a decline into a section where the tunnel if larger again --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana bends over the front of the car and looks underneath. He sees the brake tension hanging loose from the brake-pad. Indiana pulls himself back up and looks at Willie and Short Round.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grab onto me -- I'm going to try and slow us down from underneath!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Willie looks terrified but helps Short Round grab onto Indy's arm and the back of his jacket. He skips over the front of the car and swings a leg underneath --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy is inches above the rails and the rocky ground blurring be- neath the car as he tries to kick at the brake-pad. His feet fall and he bumps along, dragged dangerously for a moment --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy manages to find a foothold on the undercarriage of the car. As they hold onto him, Indy kicks again and his foot hits the brake-pad. He shoves it and slowly the pad closes against the spinning wheel...
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Willie and Short Round look up and see that the tunnel is ending ahead and the track dead-ends into a stone wall!
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around -- and sees the car rocketing directly toward the stone wall!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy's foot starts kicking in high-gear underneath the car -- he slams at the brake-pad with all his strength -- the pad screeches against the spinning wheeel and starts sparking!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car seems to slow as it shoots toward the end of the tunnel. Indy groans and pushes hard against the smoking brake-pad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car slows more and more until it runs down the last few yards to the dead-end and rolls gently to a stop, just nudgeing Indy's back against the wall....
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ouch...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Willie looks faint as Indiana gets to his feet and Shorty jumps out of the car. They help Willie out and she stands shakily --
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm okay -- I'm fine -- I love to flirt with death...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana sees that the tunnel ahead continues without any more tracks. Then they hear something --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A strange rumbling sound echoing down the tunnel from behind them. The walls seem to reverberate. Looking worried, they start walking away down the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They walk faster as the noise behind them becomes louder and they keep glancing over their shoulders --
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?...Indy?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana isn't sure and he pulls Willie by the arm and all three of them start jogging.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rumbling behind them sounds increasingly ominous and finally they start running full tilt. They rush down the tunnel and the awful noise becomes defening! Willie looks around again and slows suddenly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie stops dead in her tracks -- paralyzed -- awestruck -- DOOMED!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie sees a monster wall of water (released from the quarry) as it thunders around a curver -- a mammoth tidal wave crashing spec- tacularly against the opposite tunnel wall!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A veritable "tsunami" caroming off the tunnel wall and spewing furiously forward like a hydrous Juggernaut!
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(frozen in her tracks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana and Short Round notice that Willie's sloed and they stop running -- they also see the cataclysm of water crashing down the tunnel toward them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy runs back and grabs Willie. All three of them take off, running faster than they've ever run in their lives!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tidal wave smashes forward, booming behind them and Indiana realizes quickly that they're going to lose this race. Suddenly he sees a small side-tunnel in a bend ahead --
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There! Dive!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
They lunge toward the hole and Short Round dives in it first. Indiana shoves Willie into the hole and jumps in after her just as the colossal tidal wave explodes past!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CHUTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The small tunnel drops precipitously and they slide down, shower- ed by the small side-current of water that's broken off from the main force.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A LARGE TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They rolls and tumble out of the small chute into a larger tunnel. The roar of the tidal wave sounds distant and receding as they catch their breath.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucky I found a short cut. Look, there's a light at the end of the tunnel...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly an EXPLOSION! They turn and see the thundering tidal wave crashing around a curve and cascading down the tunnel behind them again!
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some short cut!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
They all holler in unison and start running like bats out of hell toward the daylight. The towering wall of water surges relent- lessley after them --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tidal wave looms up to annihilate them as they race to the mouth of the tunnel -- and Willie SCREAMS! Indy grabs her and all three of the flail their arms to keep from losing their bal- ance!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE TUNNEL EXIT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tunnel exits midway up a cliff and the three totter precari- ously on the brink looking down at a 300 foot sheer drop to a gorge below!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana swings Willie onto a narrow ledge on one side and pushes Short Round after her -- he jumps himself to the other side just as the tidal wave crashes past them!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water bursts out of the tunnel -- the gusher spews forth from the cliffside into the air as if Hoover Dam just broke lose!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round and Willie balance on the narrow ledge on one side of the geyser -- Indy is perches on the ledge on the other side of the incredible eruption of water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie gets vertigo looking down into the gorge where the water crashes at the bottom. There crocodiles are disturbed and slither angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy looks up and sees a rope bridge swinging about twenty feet above Willie and Short Round. Indy shouts across the blasting water --
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Willie -- the bridge! Climb up to the bridge!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Willie looks frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_ROUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing to it -- follow me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
He edges along the narrow ledge toward the bridge and Willie follows him. Once under the bridge, they start climbing up the rocks to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Indiana is scaling the cliff face to get over the water geyser to the other side. He grabs at scrub brush and finds a few perilous footholds as he makes his way to the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROPE BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie and Short Round pull themselves up at the end of the bridge. Behind them a dark tunnel runs back into the mines. What's in front of them is hardly more reassuring --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rope bridge across the gorge is a century old and defintely wasn't built by army engineers. Laying across the two bottom rope-spans, worm-eaten and moldy boards offer risky footings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vertical side ropes connect the bottom rope-spans to the two up- per ropes that constitute the dangerous hand-railings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round steps tentatively out onto the bridge. It holds him and he turns and smiles at Willie --
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_ROUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy like pie! Kid's stuff!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the board under him breaks! Willie grabs Short Round before he falls into the abyss! Looking pale and less cocky, Short Round starts out again and Willie follows his carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They continue stepping across the bridge cautiously, a feat made more difficult by the bridge's constant swaying and the hear- stopping up and down movement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them, Indy finally pulls himself up from under the bridge. He stands up and sees Willie and Short Round halfway across already. Then he hears something and turns quickly -- he takes his whip out and ducks to the side of the tunnel as two Thuggee guards rush out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy cracks the whip, catching the first guard around the neck -- the guard spills forward and trips the second guard. The first man tries to stand but Indiana kicks him in the head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second guard gets to his feet and seings his sword -- Indy ducks, slams him in the stomach and dives for the first guard's sword. He grabs it and rolls aside quickly as the second gaurd attempts to slice him in two!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy gets to his feet and immediately finds himself about to en- gage in a sword duel with the enraged Thuggee guard. Indy looks at the unfamiliar sword, hefts it, and tries to quickly decide the best way to use it --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the guard shouts and charges. Indy decides shouting must be the "de rigueur" technique and shouts back loudly -- the two swords CLANG and spark as the duel erupts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy flails and feints and the Thuggee guard lunges and slashes. Indy finally gains the upper hand and dispatches the Thuggee guard who slumps defeated into the dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keeping the sword, Indy starts out onto the bridge, walking as quickly as possible across the rickety span. He hears shouting ahead and looks worried then temple guards appear at the far end of the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guards suprise Willie and Shorty as they finally get across the bridge. Struggling futilely with the guards, Willie shouts at Indiana --
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indy -- looks out behind you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Indy sees more Thuggee guards rushing out of the tunnel behind him. He turns and sees two of the tmeple guards who captured Willie and Short Round coming across the bridge in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy stands helpless in the middle of the swaying bridge with guards approaching from both sides, and nothing but heaven above and the rocky gorge hundreds of feet below!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wind comes up and the High Priest, Mola Ram, appears on the far end of the bridge. He stands with the guards who hold Willie and Short Round.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind whips around Indy and he staggers unsteadily on the swaying bridge as he watches Mola Ram --
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let my friends go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Mola Ram shouts in Hindi and the guards start to move toward Indy from both sides of the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's far enough!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<MOLA_RAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLA_RAM>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana indicates the bag over his shoulder --
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want the stones, let them go and call off your guards!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Mola Ram motions and the guards move farther out on both sides of the bridge -- suddenly Indiana swings the sword and it cuts into one of the bottom rope-spans!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rope is half-severed and frays slowly under the tension!
</DIRECTION>
<MOLA_RAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Impressive, Dr. Jones. But I don't believe you would kill yourself!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLA_RAM>
<DIRECTION>
Mola Ram motions again the his guards (looking more nervous now) step farther out onto the bridge, mvoing closer to Indy from both sides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy swings the sword again, cutting into the other rope-span! It, too, is now partially severed and frays slowly. The bridge jolts and Indy and the guards sway precariously!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Mola Ram shoves Short Round out onto the bridge. The High Priest draws a dagger and pushes Willie onto the swaying span, holding the knife behind them both.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLA_RAM>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your friends will die with you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLA_RAM>
<DIRECTION>
In different times this would be called a Mexican stand-off Indiana looks at the guards in front and behind him. He sees Willie and Short Round out on the bridge now with Mola Ram at their backs.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I guess we're all going to take a big dive!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Indy and Short Round's eyes meet -- and the kid realizes that his hero isn't kidding. Willie looks at Shout Round anxiously -- she notices that Shorty is surreptitiously wrapping his foot around a rope support.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Petrified, Willie also secretly wraps her foot around a rope and does likewise with her arm --
</DIRECTION>
<MOLA_RAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me the stones!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLA_RAM>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana swings the sword with all his might -- it whooshes through the air and slashes clear through the top and bottom ropes --!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Immediately Mola Ram's guards start to flee in panic -- too late! Indiana swings the sword again and the two ropes on the other side are severed --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rope bridge is sheared in two! It breaks in the middle and both halves fall apart! The guards scream horribly in the air as they plunge down into the rocky gorge!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie and Short Round cling to their established footholds and fall with the bridge toward the wall of the gorge. Mola Ram spills forward, clutching desperately at the ropes and slats --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below them, Indiana has latched onto a rope and swings with the bridge as it hits the gorge wall and hangs vertically now, dang- ling from its moorings at the top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's an instant of suspended animation as all who remain alive realize they are alive. Short Round and Willie cling near the top of the now vertical bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below them, Mola Ram clutches onto one of the main ropes while directly above him the last of his guards holds on for dear life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round and Willie struggle upwards, clutching ropes and stepping on slats. Finally, Short Round heaves himself up onto solid ground and turns to help Willie up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, dangling below on the bridge, Indy reaches up and grabs Mola Ram's leg. The High Priest kicks and tries to break Indy's grip. He kicks again and smashes Indy in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy won't let go. Suddenly the High Priest reaches up and grabs his own Thuggee guard and yanks his down by the front of his shirt --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mola Ram shoves the luckless guard down onto Indy, trying to dislodge him by sacrificing the screaming Thuggee. Indy manages to hang on. The Thuggee is less fortunate and falls screaming to his death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Mola Ram looks across the gorge and yells. Indy sees a dozen of the last Thuggee guards streaming out of the tunnel -- only to be stranded on the far side of the now bridgeless gorge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy starts climbing up after Mola Ram again. He grabs at the back of Mola Ram's robe and pull him down. Slipping, Mola Ram turns and it's Indy's chance to punch Mola Ram in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mola Ram's eyes are glowing yellow and he's shouting incoherent- ly. He grabs the strap of Indy's shoulder bag and stamps on In- dy's hand -- Indy falls!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana slips downward, scrambling to catch hols of something -- meanwhile, Mola Ram now has the bag with the Sankara Stones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy finally stops his downward slide and dangles dangerously near the bottom of the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the gorge, the Thuggee guards run up a path to a small gove of trees growing on a plateau above the gorge. The guards have bows and arrows and take firing positions --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the top of the bridge, Mola Ram keeps climbing until rocks start poundinghim from above -- Willie and Short Round pely him with rocks which he tries to block with his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana starts to climb again, using all his strength. He reaches for a wooden slat -- suddenly a flaming arrow smashes into the wood!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy turns in amazement and sees more flaming arrows rocketing across the chasm directy for him!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the gorge, by the grove of trees, a Thuggee priest yells orders to the archers who continue to launch the flaming arrows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana crawls up as the bridge starts to burn from the continu- ing bursts of fiery arrows. At the top, Mola Ram reaches up des- perately for a hand old -- Willie smashes his hand with a rock!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The High Priest yells in pain and slips down to where Indy slugs him again in the face! They struggle as the fire burns up from beneath them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the cliff above the fallen bridge, Willie watches the fire rising toward Indy and Mola Ram as they fight. Short Round turns and sees something --
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_ROUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Willie, look!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORT_ROUND>
<DIRECTION>
They see horses galloping through a narrow pass -- the British cavalry is returning. Captain Blumburtt and the first troops draw up their forses and dismount quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fussilade of flaming arrows force the British to take cover -- they quickly start firing back at the Thuggees with rifles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the battle above the gorge continues, Indy and Mola Ram fight below on the dangling bridge --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana sees the High Priest's eyes begin glowing and he hisses insanely. Mola Ram's hand thrusts out toward Indiana's chest and Indy yells in pain --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy looks down and writhes terrified as he sees Mola Ram's hand starting to enter his chest (as it entered the victim's chest during the temple sacrifice)!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mola Ram's finger are inching into Indy's body -- Indy clutches at Mola Ram's piercing hand, trying to keep the deadly fingers away from his heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, Indy is able to push Mola Ram's hand away and his fingers withdraw from Indy's chest. Indiana suddenly slugs the High Priest in the face and grabs for the bag of Sankara Stones --
</DIRECTION>
<MOLA_RAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, the stones are mine!
	</DIALOGUE>

<INDIANA>

	You're betrayed Shiva. *(He re- peats in Sanskrit Sankara's warn-

ing)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Indy pronounces the magical words, the bag begins glowing and starts to burn Mola Ram as he clutches it -- the stones begin to spill out of the bag and the High Priest grabs from them.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
(Cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	*(He repeats Sankara's warning

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blazing stones sear Mola Ram's flesh and he screams in pain. The light suddenly dies in his eyes and for one instant he looks at Indy as if awakened from a nightmare --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mola Ram loses his balance and Indy grabs for the stones. He manages to clutch only one of them as Mola Ram screams and falls!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy sees the stone in his hand suddenly cool. He watches Mola Ram plummeting downward into the chasm and finally crashing into the jagged rocks at the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The irritated crocodiles are disturbed once more -- but soon wel- come the meal that just dropped in. Jaws flash and teeth rip at the High Priest's likeless corpse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Indy's bag with the Sankara Stones sinks into the murkly cur- rent and disappears down the river ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE CLIFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana crawls up the burning bridge and Willie and Short Round reach for him at the top. They pull him up onto the cliff and they all look around exhausted --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the gorge, more British troops emerge from the mine tun- nels to subdue the remaining Thuggee guards on that side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally the little Maharajah comes out of the dark mine tunnel. He sees Short Round across the gorge -- and bows to thank him for his help. On the other side, Short Round waves his cap, saluting him back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie stands at the edge of the gorge looking down into the riv- er far below.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>

She sees Indy reach into his pocket. He pulls something out slowly -- as she watches he reveals a crystal stone --

<INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The last Sankara Stone.
	</DIALOGUE>

Short Round watches Willie take it carefully from Indiana. She gazes at it and looks delighted --
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the diamond hidden inside...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Willie holds the stone up to the sun and it sparkles and flashes
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE MAYAPORE HILLS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun flares and silhouettes three figures coming over a hilltop. Behinf them we see more smaller silhouettes appearing over the rise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana, Willie and Short Round walk back down the dirt road into Mayapore -- followed by a multitude of children returning to their homeland.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie looks at the changed landscape and seems astonished: the barren countryside has been reborn. They see streams flowing beneath green trees, flowers blooming and peasants harvesting golden grain in the fields.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAYAPORE VILLAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana, Willie and Short Round lead the children down the village road. Ahead they see villagers rebuilding their primi- tive dwellings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now they hear shouts of joy from the peasants. The children returning home start running to meet their parents who are rush- ing out to greet them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is laughter and tears as families are reunited. Indiana sees the old shaman approaching with the chieftain and the village elders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shaman touches his fingers to his forehead and bows. The three travelers return his greeting and the shaman is quite moved as he speaks to Indiana --
</DIRECTION>
<SHAMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We know you are coming back --

The old shaman smiles wisely at Indiana. Indy takes the stone out of his bag and unwraps it.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I've seen its power
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Willie watches the shaman take it reverently and bow to them. The shaman joins the elders and they walk to the village's small sacred mound. Indy and Willie stay back. They see him kneel and replace the stone in its niche.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>

Suddenly the bullwhip CRACKS and wraps around her waist. Star- tled Willie looks angry as Indiana reels her in, pulling her to- ward him and into his arms. But when he finally kisses her, she doesn't seem to mind at all...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round shakes his head, but looks sort of pleased. When he turns away, his face lights up!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Short Round runs toward the sunset, toward the three elephants being brought back to the village. The baby elephant starts walking faster, as if he recognizes Short Round running out to meet him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
