:SC: OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We MOVE through the city in a series of brief shots that define and establish our setting, from commercial district to residential neighborhood. Eventually we find ourselves moving down a street of two-story apartment buildings. Many of the windows are lit from within by an EERIE BLUE LIGHT. As we track past at window-level we see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glum, sedated-looking COUPLE watching TV. An ignored TODDLER runs amok behind them as a cheery commercial plays..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An empty room...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large, hirsute MAN, wearing only Lycra jogging shorts, watching the Home Shopping Network while eating mashed potatoes with his fingers...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dazed old woman staring out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The silhouette of a TEENAGE GIRL dancing by herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We enter her room and see the TV SCREEN. The source of the THEME MUSIC is A VIDEO of an insane East Indian production number from the 1960's. The room is cluttered with heaps of clothes, old records, odd knick-knacks. We see her silhouetted back as she dances along to the video while trying on a GRADUATION CAP AND GOWN.

A modern high school auditorium. Over the entrance a banner with a "Coca Cola" logo reads: "GRADUATION TODAY 2 PM."

:SC: INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - SAME DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A graduation ceremony is in progress. We DOLLY PAST the bland faces of teary-eyed graduates until we stop on ENID. At first, we only see the top of her mortarboard; as she lifts her head we see that she's trying desperately not to laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She makes eye-contact with REBECCA, another graduate, who is also trying to stifle her laughter. The SPEAKER is in an elaborate wheelchair with severe-looking traction devices.
</DIRECTION>
<SPEAKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	High school is like the training wheels for the bicycle of real life. It is a time for young people to explore different fields of interest and to hopefully grow from their experiences. After all, that which we learn from our mistakes can be as valuable as what we learn from our textbooks, and often we can turn the negative experiences that are common to all high-schoolers into positive steps toward personal growth and achievement. In coming to terms with my own personal setback, which I'm sure you've all heard about, I've been able to learn a lot about myself. I've learned for one thing that I don't need to rely on drugs and alcohol
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(APPLAUSE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and that I'm very lucky-that more people besides Carrie and myself weren't hurt in the accident; I've learned that I'm blessed with wonderful parents, teachers and above all the best classmates in the world -- I love each and every one of you guys!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(APPLAUSE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and I've learned that to get through life's obstacles you need faith, hope and, most of all, a sense of humor.
	</DIALOGUE>

A trio of TEENAGE GIRLS (one white, one Asian, one black) come running out from the wings and start dancing and rapping. The audience loves them.

	<DIALOGUE>
	That piece is entitled "Mirror/Father/Mirror." I like to show it to people I'm meeting for the first time because it says so much about who I am and what it feels like to inhabit my specific skin. And this is exactly what I'm hoping to get from each of you over the course of this Summer: a picture of your own self-exploration. My own background is in video and performance art, but I'm hoping that doesn't influence you and that you'll find your own ways of externalizing the internal. At the end of the Summer, this class has been invited, along with several others in the area, to participate in a show of High-School art at the Neighborhood Activity Center. The title of the show will be "Brotherhood and Community: Art as Dialogue." I think the "Brotherhood" theme ties in nicely with the theme of self-discovery that I'd like to emphasize in this class. Are there any questions so far?

There are three mail slots. Enid pulls the mail out of the first one. We see FLOWER BULB CATALOGUES, and LADIES HOME JOURNAL.

	This is girl mail.

She grabs the mail out of SLOT NUMBER TWO.

Rebecca is looking at the mail from SLOT NUMBER THREE.

	Bingo!

She shoves back the contents of slot number two and grabs the mail from Rebecca. We hear MALE VOICES around the corner.

Enid jams the mail back in the slot in a panic.

</ENID>
<JOE>

Joe shuts off the TV. He turns to the girls, not wanting to lose the rapport he's established with two potential customers.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, are you looking for anything in particular? There's a lot of other stuff in storage...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up a plastic Casio-type guitar/keyboard (a child's toy) and starts noodling pre-programmed rock licks.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you. Absolutely no practice necessary. You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's okay...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>

She notices several modern jazz LPs on Joe's table.

	Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.

Enid glances at Rebecca and mouths the implausible name: "Seymour?!" Rebecca snorts, unable to control her laughter, and turns away from the table. Enid keeps her cool...

	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<DIRECTION>
Enid drifts over and begins thumbing through a box of 78s.
</DIRECTION>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>

He points her to a nearby box of LPs.

<SEYMOUR>

</SEYMOUR>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well there's a few choice LPs in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<DIRECTION>
Rebecca tugs on Enid's sleeve. Enid gets free and continues looking through the records. She stops on one with an especially wacky cover.
</DIRECTION>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this one any good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls out a bland-looking record: "COLLECTOR'S ITEMS, VOLUME THREE." Rebecca shifts impatiently behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<ENID>

	I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...

</ENID>
<REBECCA>

	That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...

	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?

</ENID>
<REBECCA>

	That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.

:SC: INT. ENID'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enid dejectedly enters and heads straight for the bathroom. She rummages through a cabinet until she finds the right box (black hair dye). She wets her hair, then goes into the bedroom and mechanically turns on her boom box. The punk rock song we heard earlier plays. She yanks out the tape and flings it away. She skims through her records and CDs, dismissing them all. She notices Seymour's bag in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes out the record and puts it on. The first tune is an upbeat instrumental number. She returns to the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several minutes pass. TRACK TWO begins on the LP. She (and we) slowly begin to take notice. It's a strange, haunting old BLUES RECORD. We see that the tune has struck a nerve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ENID'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The song continues. Enid sits in her bean-bag chair. Her hair is now dyed back to black. As the song ends, she picks up the needle and starts it again.

	Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.

Seymour returns with the 78, holding it like a precious object.

<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here it is. It's only about V minus and has an incipient lam crack, but plays decent as I recall.
	</DIALOGUE>

Seymour passes the 78 to Enid who follows suit and holds it carefully by the edges.

:SC: INT. ART CLASS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Starts with a PAN ACROSS a wall of unimpressive high school art: dumb drawings of fighting Chuck Norris-types, traced centerfolds, highly sexualized horses, etc. And, on a table, a wire sculpture made from two coathangers.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to start a discourse on the subject of "good" art vs. "bad" art; these judgments are for each person to make on his own. I merely want to help each of you find the best way to look within yourselves the best key to your particular lock. Last week I asked you to-try and create a piece of artwork that responds to something that you have strong feelings about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
Enid enters late and puts her sketchbook on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it looks like we have some really interesting work up here....

</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
Roberta peruses some of the art, then points to a very violent drawing.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can you tell, us about your piece... uh...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought maybe this was supposed to be your father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTION>
No response from Phillip. Roberta nicks up Enid's sketchbook and leafs through it.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what can you tell us about this...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(searches for name)
</DIRECTION>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<DIRECTION>
We see several sketches, including the drawing of the SATANISTS. Roberta shows a few pages to the class.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves. We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause, points at WIRE SCULPTURE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is responsible for this?

<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talk to us about it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier.

A CUTE GIRL, mid-20's, stands near their table sipping her drink. Enid nods in her direction for Seymour's benefit as if to say, "check it out."
</DIRECTION>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, that would certainly do...

Enid gets up before Seymour can stop her and talks to CUTE GIRL who looks back at Seymour and smiles. She goes to join him. Enid walks off in the direction of the bar, giving Seymour a "thumbs up."

	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, technically what he was mostly playing would more accurately be classified in the "ragtime" idiom. Although of course not in the strictest sense of the more classical ragtime piano music like that of Scott Joplin or Joseph Lamb. Authentic Blues has a more conventional twelve- bar structure in its stanzas.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Oh if you like authentic blues, you've just gotta see Blueshammer! They're so great!

ANGLE ON: Enid standing alone at the bar. We see Seymour and Cute Girl from her POV. Her gaze drifts to the other people in the bar. WE MOVE OVER the faces of all the guys and stop on a skinny, introverted-looking guy with a pool-cue. He makes a shot and instantly goes into an ostentatious cue twirling routine. Her gaze drifts on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees herself in a mirror behind the bar and takes off her hat reconfiguring her hair. She reaches into her purse and puts on a bulkier pair of glasses. This is interrupted by BLUESHAMMER taking the stage. Young, white, cocky, pretty boys.

A din of loud noise. CUTE GIRL immediately leaps to her feet, boogeying to the music.

Enid finds a PAINTING leaning in a pile of stuff against the wall in the corner. It's an old-fashioned cartoony stereotype of a black man's head, with big lips and a huge toothy smile.
</DIRECTION>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?

<SEYMOUR>

	Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.

	I'm obsessed with all this stuff - this lost culture of the 20th century.

</SEYMOUR>
<DIRECTION>
She looks through the scrapbook - we see the Coon Chicken logo transform first into a less stereotyped black man, then into an older distinguished black chef with the logo "Cook's Chicken Inn." Then to a white version of the same chef, followed by a female white chef, then to a streamlined 90's version. On another page is a collection of cosmetic labels tracing the design evolution of a different company.

He puts on another record.

	These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you actually do this painting?
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."

	<DIALOGUE>
	And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And how does an image like this help us to see that?

	I'm not sure... I mean...

:SC: INT. COMMUNITY CENTER - EVENING

<DIRECTION>
A homemade banner reads: "HIGH SCHOOL ART SHOW - BROTHERHOOD AND COMMUNITY: ART AS DIALOGUE." Along one wall is all the work from Roberta's class: a collection of eccentric abstract bric-a-brac and Enid's large painting. The painting has drawn a small crowd. We see a chain of events beginning with three PARENTS talking to a matronly DIRECTOR/CURATOR who in turn seeks out Roberta (wearing make-up and fancy-ish clothes for the first time).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid you're simply going to have to take that painting down. Several of the parents have complained.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will do no such thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTA>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you leave me no other choice than to remove it myself!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
She marches towards it. Roberta runs after her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we should give the artist a chance to talk to the parents about her intentions with this piece... We should be promoting discussion as a solution, not censorship.
	</DIALOGUE>

Roberta sees Margaret and grabs her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Margaret, have you seen Enid?

Margaret shrugs "no." ROBERTA looks through the crowd. A college-age news-hack-type with a FREE WEEKLY T-SHIRT snaps a photo of the DIRECTOR removing Enid's painting.

<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<ROBERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!

</ENID>
<ROBERTA>

Enid walks the streets - it's dark out now. She goes by the Cafe - it's CLOSED FOR REMODELING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/BUS STOP - LATER
</DIRECTION>

She continues walking until she's across the street from Norman's bus stop. She sees him there, as always. Suddenly, a BUS, well-lit from the inside and completely empty, pulls up to the stop and Norman gets on.

:SC: INT. SEYMOUR'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (ABOUT 11 PM)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A knock on the door - Seymour shuffles out in T-shirt, pants, and goofy slippers. He looks through the peephole and sees Enid. He opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing here?

</SEYMOUR>
<ENID>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<DIRECTION>
She returns from the kitchen with a giant bottle of champagne.
</DIRECTION>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<ENID>
<DIRECTION>
(as she starts opening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.

She opens it and drinks straight from the bottle. Seymour's look says: "Oh well, I'm fucked, I give up."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enid & Seymour sit on the bed listening to old records and drinking out of the bottle.

	You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.

	I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<DIRECTION>
Enid notices an extremely ugly modern sculpture in the corner. She goes over and picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did you get this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<ENID>

Seymour takes another slug off the bottle.

	God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<ENID>

	What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.

</ENID>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just being realistic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate sports.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?

</ENID>
<SEYMOUR>

	Yeah, sure. Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<ENID>

	<DIALOGUE>
	whiny, disdainful

voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>

(more drunk than before)

	<DIALOGUE>

TEN MINUTES LATER

</ENID>
<SEYMOUR>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So where would we go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?

</ENID>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno, I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?

</ENID>
<SEYMOUR>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him passionately. He's shocked but kisses back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This escalates, leading to the sex act, shown with merciful brevity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE Enid & Seymour, post-coital.
</DIRECTION>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, Dana's going to kill you!

	Yeah, well... me neither...

	You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?

<ENID>

	<DIALOGUE>
	But, I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhh... I really need to get some sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<DIRECTION>
Enid turns her back to him. We see from REVERSE ANGLE that she's only pretending to be asleep. She looks troubled, as though she's just made a big mistake. Seymour puts his arm around her. It's the only time we've seen him look relaxed and happy.
</DIRECTION>
<SEYMOUR>

She hangs up and high-fives her colleague. They bear-hug.

	Great job! I'm proud of ya! Well, I'll check you guys later. I'm gonna go start the paperwork.

</DANA>
<SEYMOUR>

<DANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you trying to say?

Dana sits down, staring ahead, stunned for a moment. Suddenly she breaks down sobbing.

Dana pushes him away violently.

:SC: INT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seymour sits in dim light, dialing an antique "candlestick" telephone. In the background, a Peter, Paul and Mary concert plays on the TV. We hear three rings followed by Enid's answering machine message. He hangs up before it finishes. Joe walks by the doorway.

	Well, here's where the fun never stops!

	Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records?

<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She could at least have the decency to call me back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Again no answer from Seymour, he stares off into space.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>

	Maybe she's got another boyfriend.

Joe leaves. Seymour is left listening to the record.

:SC: INT. COOK'S CHICKEN HEADQUARTERS - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seymour is at work, walking down a carpeted hallway with many doors on both sides. A door opens and a Tony Robbins- ish, 35 year-old MANAGEMENT EXECUTIVE sticks his head out.
</DIRECTION>
<EXECUTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seymour! Just the man I want to see. Step in here for a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
Seymour enters.
</DIRECTION>
<EXECUTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a seat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
He plunks down the current issue of THE FREE WEEKLY - it's open to a 1/2 page article on page 8 with the headline "Oh Brother!" and a photo of THE PAINTING being removed.

<EXECUTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can you tell me about this, Seymour?

:SC: INT. ENID & REBECCA'S NEW APT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enid is wearing a bright orange "Computer Station" T-shirt and a yellow vest with a "trainee" tag. She's looking around at her new home: a hopelessly drab, characterless apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, whaddya think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So where's all your stuff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
Enid points to a small box with sketchbook, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all you're bringing?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
She drags Enid into the kitchen and opens a BUILT-IN IRONING BOARD as though it's the most amazing thing she's ever-seen.
</DIRECTION>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't this the greatest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ENID'S ROOM - LATE EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enid is sorting her stuff into boxes. Digging through her closet, she finds a box that she doesn't recognize. Inside are her old children's records (45's). She excitedly takes one out and plays it. She folds her clothes while listening to this song, which clearly is getting to her. She grabs mechanically for the next thing hanging in her closet. It's the uniform from her job at "Computer Station." She folds it, puts it in the box, then stops, staring at the orange fabric.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ENID AND REBECCA'S APT. - THE NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rebecca is nervously arranging and re-arranging her stuff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She puts up her gigantic new kitchen wall clock and sets the time to 12:45. She goes to the phone and calls Enid. The machine picks up and Rebecca hangs up. She does another tedious, pointless task. IT'S NOW 3:30. She's pissed off and goes to the phone to call again. As it rings there's a knock on the door. Relieved, she hangs up and goes to answer.
</DIRECTION>
<REBECCA>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong with you, retard - it's three-thirty!

</REBECCA>

It's Seymour standing there, not Enid.
</DIRECTION>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's not at home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... they said she was here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure she wasn't there? Maybe she was just hiding from you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would she be hiding from me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know... where is she, then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe she's with Josh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? What did she tell you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no idea - I just want to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really, I don't know enough about it to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That slut!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<SEYMOUR>
<DIRECTION>
(changing subject back to me)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
(getting revenge on Seymour)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did she say that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, what do you expect? Considering how we met you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On that pathetic fake blind date.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What fake blind date? What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<DIRECTION>
Rebecca goes over and gets Enid's sketchbook out of the box and flips through it. When she gets to the right page she hands it to Seymour.
</DIRECTION>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. Read it and weep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
We see a pasted-up PERSONAL AD beside a DRAWING OF SEYMOUR in Wowsville. On the facing page we see a drawing of JOSH with his name surrounded by RED HEARTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SIDEWINDER - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seymour's car screeches into the parking lot. He bursts into the store, ready for once in his life to make a scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SIDEWINDER - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Josh is behind the counter cleaning the Slurpee machine, with his back to the entrance, as Seymour storms in. Doug is over by the magazine rack reading a dirt bike magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you had a good laugh at my expense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<DIRECTION>
Josh turns around - what's going on? He recognizes Seymour.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh... oh... hi... uh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSH>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to see something funny? I'll show you something funny!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<DIRECTION>
As he says this he flips over a SMALL DISPLAY RACK of potato chips. Then he tries to flip over a BIG DISPLAY CASE in front of the counter but is unable to budge it - he keeps trying and gets more and more frustrated.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HEY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSH>
<DIRECTION>
Josh runs from behind the counter to stop him before he creates a huge mess. He tries to grab Seymour and they get into a ridiculous frantic scuffle. Seymour starts yelling. Suddenly Doug appears and gets Seymour in a choke hold with his nunchucks. Doug ad-libs cop-style jargon. Josh is freaked out. Seymour realizes what a fool he is and starts to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Boss comes out of the back room...
</DIRECTION>
<BOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Josh! What going on here?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOSS>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ENID & REBECCA'S APARTMENT - AROUND MIDNIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The apartment is dark - lit only by a harsh, annoying streetlight. Rebecca sits on the couch in sweat clothes, exasperated. She goes to look out the window. Cars with loud radios can be heard driving by. She goes to the phone - she checks it and hangs up. Pause. She picks it up again - one last try. She dials the number and waits. We hear the BEEP of the answering machine. Rebecca hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gets into a sleeping bag (spread out in the center of a cold linoleum floor). She zips the zipper all the way over her head and curls up into a whimpering ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	TITLE CARD: "SEVERAL MONTHS LATER"
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dialogue begins in voice-over as the title card fades. We slowly fade in to see Seymour, lying on a pink pastel psychiatrist's couch, as he speaks to his THERAPIST, a handsome, well-coiffed woman in her late 40s.
</DIRECTION>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<THERAPIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THERAPIST>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<THERAPIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THERAPIST>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<THERAPIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't we start with that next week?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THERAPIST>
<DIRECTION>
Seymour looks up. She nods toward the large wall clock behind her: thirty seconds after five. Re gets up and she walks him slowly toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<THERAPIST>
<DIRECTION>
(as she opens the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THERAPIST>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. They stand facing each other.
</DIRECTION>
<THERAPIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seymour?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THERAPIST>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<THERAPIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have a check for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THERAPIST>
<DIRECTION>
Seymour takes a filled-out check from his shirt pocket. In the waiting room, we see SEYMOUR'S MOTHER.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seymour? Are you done? Did you have a chance to think about what you might want for dinner while you were in there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<SEYMOUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can talk about it in the car, Ma...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYMOUR>
<DIRECTION>
As they leave Seymour looks back and smiles weakly at the doctor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. QUALITY CAFE - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cafe has been FULLY REMODELED and now resembles Wowsville more than the old Quality Cafe. There are no neighborhood "characters" anymore, only well-heeled twenty-somethings. We see that Rebecca is now a waitress here. She tears off a check and places it in front of a super-muscular, polo shirted EUROPEAN HIPSTER, who is too busy tapping away at his POWERBOOK to notice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks toward the end of the counter to total up her receipts. She looks up and sees Enid, wearing tasteful 1930's style clothes, sitting across from her.
</DIRECTION>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<ENID>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding toward muscular HIPSTER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, he's a really nice guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
We see at this point that Rebecca & Enid are no longer friends, but there are also no hard feelings evident.
</DIRECTION>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe an orange juice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<DIRECTION>
Rebecca goes to get it. Enid looks around, bemused and saddened by what The Quality Cafe has become.
</DIRECTION>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, look what I got...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a crumpled envelope from her pocket and pulls out her DIPLOMA.
</DIRECTION>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow... finally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It just came yesterday...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. Josh enters. Enid turns around.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi Enid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSH>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Josh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<JOSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you ready to go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSH>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment it's not clear who he's talking to, and then:
</DIRECTION>
<REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
(still counting receipts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, just one second...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
She finishes, takes off her apron and emerges from behind the counter. She kisses Josh perfunctorily.
</DIRECTION>
<REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Josh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<JOSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSH>
<REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Enid)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call me sometime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<ENID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Definitely. We still have to go to that shoe store sometime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENID>
<DIRECTION>
Rebecca & Josh leave. Enid is totally alone in the now-alien world of the Quality Cafe. A momentary pause as she calmly stares into her orange juice. We see a small, round TRAVEL BAG at her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CITY STREETS/ACME SHOES - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Enid walking down the familiar streets of her world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's early evening, quiet except for distant street noises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks toward the old ACME SHOES AND REPAIR STORE. It looks the same, miraculously preserved, until she stands right in front of it. She looks through the partially papered over window and sees WORKMEN inside installing new fixtures: a modern counter and several small tables, all made from a FAMILIAR GREEN PLASTIC. A sign in the window reads: "Coming Soon: Another COFFEE EXPERIENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CITY STREET - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She continues walking as the sun has set and there is a calm stillness to the city. She turns a corner and is startled by her reflection in a large window made of one-way glass. She stops and looks at herself. Everything about her looks perfect for once; no need to change a thing. She moves closer to the glass and, shading her eyes, tries to look inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She continues walking. Darkness is just setting in and she has the street all to herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/BUS STOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Enid at NORMAN'S BUS STOP, sitting on the bench. She looks at the apartment building across the street. A woman who has just arrived home from work turns on the TV, bathing her living room with that EERIE BLUE LIGHT. The same thing happens in another window down the street... then another... Enid looks down the street. In the distance A BUS rounds the corner and heads toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From a third-story window across the street, we see the bus as it arrives and stops, blocking Enid from view. A moment later it pulls away, leaving an empty bench. The CAMERA moves upward, farther and farther away as the music swells and the credits roll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BRIDGE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bus disappears over the crest of the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
