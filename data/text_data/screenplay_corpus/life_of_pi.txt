<PRIEST>

Pi heads upstairs to the deck.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE CARGO DECK - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The deck of the ship is dark. Pi steps out into a bracing rain and walks to the rail, wind whipping his hair. He laughs, exhilarated, as rain splashes over his face. Throwing arms wide, Pi dances in imitation of Anandi's dance, slipping more than once on the rain-soaked deck, shouting in giddy adolescent triumph.
</DIRECTION>
<PI>
	<DIALOGUE>

He finishes, laughing as he falls against the railing. The deck lights suddenly all come on at once; a warning alarm sounds over the loudspeakers.

Pi slips to the front of the deck and stands up, watching in horror as a wave washes over the bow, carrying several sailors overboard. He pushes himself away from the railing and runs back down below.

Halfway down, Pi hits water. He dives, searching for his family. The hall lights flicker - the passage falls dark an instant before the emergency lights come on in the water below, which nearly reaches the ceiling. Pi dives, trying to swim against the flowing current; he's astonished to find a ZEBRA swimming toward him, passing overhead. He tries to swim further, but the enormous force of rushing water and air is too great; he scrambles backward, groping toward the stairwell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Pi bursts on deck, coughing and gagging for air.

Pi sees movement - animals running. He scrambles toward them, the ship groaning as it lists sideways.

Oxen and deer are visible on the far side of the deck, backlit by emergency lights; Pi hears monkeys screeching, the clatter of hoofs pounding. In the distance, Sailors shout orders in panicked voices.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi comes onto the lower deck, where he sees three men - the Buddhist (Taiwanese Sailor) from the dining hall; the JAPANESE CAPTAIN, and SAILOR #1 - arguing with the French cook, who has climbed into the stern of one of the lifeboats that hangs off the side of the ship. Pi runs to the Captain.

They guide Pi to the side, where a section of the ship's railing has been removed to give access to the lifeboat. They push Pi over the edge; Pi falls onto the lifeboat, bouncing on the protective tarp that is still stretched taut across the bow. He grabs at the rope holding the bow, trying not to slip off. The sailors are shouting at the French cook, who stands at the stern.

The sailors look towards the upper deck. Pi follows their looks and watches in horror as a zebra launches itself over the side of the ship, careening through the air toward the safety of the lifeboat. The French cook staggers backward and jumps out of the way, falling to the water below. Pi throws up his arms as the life boat starts to drop. The zebra arcs through the air, missing the tarp, landing on the exposed stern with a sickening thud, shattering the rear bench. The force sends the rig lines spinning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lifeboat plummets to the water below. The impact spins it around, nearly washing Pi overboard. He is left clinging to the back of the tarp, the zebra on the floor of the lifeboat before him. As the lifeboat drops down the side of the swell, Pi slides to the front of the tarp. The Tsimtsum's propeller rises behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Pi steadies himself, a swell lifts the lifeboat, crashing it onto the deck of the Tsimtsum. It drops back into the sea, rolling over completely. The vessel instantly rights itself - the lifeboat is designed to be virtually unsinkable. Pi lands on the lifeboat's floorboards, next to the zebra.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi sees the Tsimtsum at an angle, it's bow dipping below the water. As he tries to get up, Pi notices the orange emergency whistle that dangles from the vest. He grabs it and blows, shouting between blasts.

Pi plunges into the roiling water. An enormous wave rolls toward Pi - filling his lungs with air, Pi dives under, away from the assault of the raging storm.

EXT. BENEATH THE WATER - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence as Pi hangs below the surface, arms wide, groping for focus and calm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lightning casts a blazing white veil over the surface of the water above him, backlighting fish and animals, waves frozen in time like wrinkled bedsheets, their motionless texture pocked and dimpled with raindrops. As the sky explodes in white flashes, the scene is caught in surreal still shots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hippo swims past, it's heavy form moving gracefully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi swims toward the camera - then freezes, reacting in horror as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shark swoops past him and up toward the struggling animals near the surface. Pi dives defensively - the camera follows. Ahead, the Tsimtsum is visible, fifty feet beyond Pi, its deck lights dipping below the surface, casting an eerie underwater glow, bubbles flowing up to the surface; nearby, Pi can make out the floating oar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE OCEAN/THE BOAT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi bursts above water in total panic, throwing his arms around the oar, coughing up sea water and bile. The lifebuoy floats a dozen feet off; he swims toward it. He grabs the oar moments before a huge wave sweeps him up and over the lifeboat. He lands on the other side, the oar lost, and drags himself onto the stern. He jumps over the kicking zebra and scrambles onto the boat tarp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An oar sticks out from under the boat cover, hanging out over the front of the lifeboat. Pi climbs out on the oar, keeping himself a safe distance from the tiger he assumes is beneath the tarp. The air vibrates with a tremendous belching groan; Pi looks over to the cargo ship, watching, astounded...

WIDE SHOT - from top, looking down into the water: the Tsimtsum abruptly keels and sinks beneath the surface. Pi watches in horror as the Tsimtsum plummets into the depths of the Mariana Trench, it's deck lights gradually fading. Pi bursts into tears as waves from the sinking vessel buffet his lifeboat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi weeps uncontrollably.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The storm has passed, but the skies are still heavy with disgusting grey clouds. Pi has hung the lifebuoy on the oar and now sits on it, slumped in exhaustion and shivering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With what energy he still has, he weeps - his face is puffy and swollen from a night of tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi watches a shark fin knife through the waves. His feet have been trailing in the water; he quickly lifts them out. He raises his head, looking at his new surroundings - water and air, clouds and sky. Nothing on the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi creeps forward on the oar, pulling himself onto the gunnels - the side of the boat. No sign of Richard Parker.

The zebra comes into view in the stern of the lifeboat, injured legs folded beneath it, staring indifferently into space.

Pi stands a few feet away from the zebra, using an emergency bucket to bail water out of the bottom of the boat, exhausted from the effort. He pauses to catch his breath, then becomes aware of a slight movement at one side of the tarp.

Hari, the hyena, with a sloping, bear-like forehead and the nervous manner of a beaten dog, reappears. Pi instantly dives across the tarp, scrambling for safety on the oar. The hyena staggers and stumbles listlessly. Pi turns to face the creature, struggling for calm.

EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
High noon. Intolerable heat. Flies circle the zebra, landing on Pi's face and arms. He's too exhausted to brush them away. The only sound is the incessant lapping of water against the hull. Pi stares out across the ocean - no rescue in sight. He pushes himself upright, calling over the waves.
</DIRECTION>
<PI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HELLO...! HELLO...! ANYBODY?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PI>
<DIRECTION>
Pi kneels and bangs his bailing bucket against the hull. The hyena emergees, shaking its head violently in an attempt to clear its thoughts. It screams in frustration and begins yipping. Pi picks up the oar and pokes the hyena to fend it off. He watches with increasing alarm as the hyena paces in frantic circles - whatever tranquilizers this animal received are wearing off. The boy wraps his grip around the paddle, prepared to defend himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hyena abruptly stops pacing, coughing and retching - then lies down, shaking from emotional and physical distress. It sets its head on the edge of the tarp, predator eyes fastened on Pi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DUSK

<DIRECTION>
A boy, a hyena, a zebra and an orangutan silhouetted against the last fading light of day.

Pi has hung the paddle and lifebuoy off the end of the boat and perches on the bow. The hyena's eyes seem to glow in the last light, fixed on Pi. Pi stares back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi fights fatigue as waves splash interminably against the hull. He winces at each creak of the lifeboat; his eyes glaze over as he stares out at the endless, dusky seascape. Pi sees movement in the shadows. The hyena attacks the zebra; the zebra barks and squeals. O.J. reacts to the violence, crying out.

Silence. Morning. Hazy. Pi slumps over the oar, eyes half open, glazed. He has stayed up a second night for fear of being attacked, and now he slowly nods sideways, giving in to exhaustion despite himself, and tumbles into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi gasps in shock as the water slaps him into full consciousness. He climbs back onto the life ring - coughing, tired, wet, sad and fearful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lifeboat rolls and growls beneath Pi's feet as he stares - and then he notices O.J. The poor orang is sitting on a side bench half-hidden by the tarp, and horribly seasick. Her tongue lolls out of her mouth and she's visibly panting.

Pi opens the rearmost bench and finds a "LIFEBOAT MANUAL AND NAVIGATIONAL GUIDE" in a plastic bag along with a pencil lying on top of bags of supplies. He pulls out the manual and flips through it - an illustration shows that the boat is lined with compartments. He opens the next bench - it's stuffed with life jackets.

He tosses one of the life jackets to O.J., who has no idea what to make of it. O.J. turns to watch him, utterly bewildered.

An hour later. Pi finishes tying a knot in a piece of rope that joins oars to the lifebuoy. Pull back to reveal that Pi has built a makeshift raft, tying three oars into a triangle around the lifebuoy and using the banana net to gather the life vests into a bunch beneath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi sits back, mopping his brow, then begins pushing and dragging his raft over to the edge of the lifeboat to launch it.

The hyena comes out from under the tarp to see what all the noise is. As it paces, it gets too close to O.J., who suddenly comes to life, rising up to her full height, pulling back her lips and roaring. The hair on the hyena's neck and shoulders stands up - suddenly, it launches an attack. Pi cries out, flinching - but O.J. uses one of her long arms to thump the beast on top of the head.

Pi feels the tarp move under his feet... suddenly, Richard Parker launches like a blur from under the canvas, going straight after the hyena. Pi falls backward on the tarp, stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the tiger clamps his jaws around the hyena, finishing it off, Pi leaps back to the bow, shoving his makeshift raft into the water. The raft splashes in the water and the tiger turns; Pi looks back and comes face-to-face with Richard Parker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tiger stands with front feet on the crossbench, sniffing the sea air, examining his surroundings for the first time, agitated by this open air environment. As he turns to go back under the tarp, his gaze falls on Pi. Richard Parker's ears swivel, and his lip twitches, revealing a canine as long as a finger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi, terrified, grabs an oar and holds it out, trying to prevent an attack. Unfortunately, he also blocks Richard Parker's path back under the tarp. The tiger tries to go around the oar, and when Pi blocks his way, the tiger swings a paw, knocking the oar into the ocean with such force that Pi is spun completely around with his back to the tiger. He falls into a crouch, cowering, prepared to die.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard Parker's predator instinct takes over. He snarls and pounces on the tarp, menacingly close to Pi - then hesitates, unsettled by the softness of the tarp beneath his feet. The tiger retreats, examining his surroundings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi jumps toward the raft. He belly flops into the ocean and rises in a panic, trying to scramble up onto the raft, only to have it flip completely over his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT THE RAFT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grey, lifeless skies above the vastness of the ocean. Pi shivers, his eyes glassy, his lips chapped and skin waxen from hours of exposure. He tries various ways to re-shape the raft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shark slips up alongside Pi and bumps him, sending Pi scrambling back to the safety of the raft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi pulls the raft to the back of the lifeboat, tying the rope line on one of the tarp hooks. Hands appear on the gunnels. Pi lifts his head over the bow. The tiger is nowhere in sight. Pi quietly climbs aboard. He tries in vain to control his chattering teeth and shaking limbs as he opens the starboard bow storage bench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees a duffel bag, zips it open and rifles through the contents. It contains an array of survival supplies - as he lifts it out, his eye falls upon a stack of cans marked "Water." He pops a hole in a water can with the can opener and drinks one, tilting his head back and closing his eyes in ecstasy. He throws a few on the raft. He grabs a couple of boxes marked "Baked Wheat Biscuits." Pi tears open a box and stuffs a biscuit into his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The biscuits are so dry that he is barely able to chew them - crumbs fall from his lips into the supply hatch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rat skitters out from under the tarp, grabbing biscuit crumbs, then retreating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A low growl. Richard Parker charges out from his den and bounds onto the tarp. Pi staggers in terror and falls helplessly into the storage bench, with only his head poking out above the tarp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tiger steps toward Pi, then hesitates - again, the softness of the tarp unnerves him. He steps back off the tarp and paces the stern.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi creeps out of the storage bench - then watches in horror as Richard Parker swivels and charges him again, this time beneath the tarp. The rat scurries back out of hiding and Richard Parker's head follows, looming up out from the gap between the tarp and the storage bench. Pi jumps onto the tarp, out of the tiger's reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard Parker scrambles backward and reappears at the far end of the tarp, roaring, prepared to attack from above - then halts, watching in astonishment as the rat hops around the lifeboat, finally running up Pi's shirt and landing on Pi's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi grabs the rat by the tail and throws it. The rat sails, paws and tail stretched wide, across the boat. Richard Parker opens his mouth and the rat flies in, its tail disappearing between the tiger's lips like a spaghetti noodle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Richard Parker enjoys his treat, Pi climbs backward over the bow, unhooking the rope, grabbing the water cans and the biscuits and slipping over the side, falling into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drops onto the raft and pushes himself back with his feet. The raft floats back and hits the end of the ropeline with a jerk. Pi remembers the rope and goes back to untie it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Richard Parker appears at the bow and lunges at him, almost falling off the front of the lifeboat onto Pi. The tiger scrambles back onto the boat and off the tarp, while Pi paddles the raft away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he is finally at a safe distance, fear and stress overwhelm Pi - he throws up what little food and water he has taken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE RAFT, BEHIND THE LIFEBOAT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A full moon, backlit clouds rolling through the skies, reflected in the water below. Pi floats behind the lifeboat, weeping, surrounded by nothing but terror and the abyss. A thick range of clouds moves in, threatening to cut off the light from the moon and stars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi watches Richard Parker on the lifeboat, a shadowy silhouette on the bow ahead. The tiger takes the zebra carcass under the tarp. The clouds blot out the sky. Darkness envelops them.

He tears the page out and stuffs it into an empty water can, sealing the opening with a plastic lid. He tosses it as far as possible; the can splashes down, rippling the water, then bobs, going nowhere. Pi stares at the bobbing can, crushed as he sees the futility of this plan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A defeated pause, and then Pi looks up and sees the majesty of his surroundings. The cloud cover breaks; dawn light glows down on Pi.
</DIRECTION>

A grunt from the lifeboat. Pi turns, surprised. He grabs the tow line and reels into the lifeboat.

	For castaways who must share their lifeboats with large dangerous carnivores it's advisable to establish a territory as your own. The following course of action is recommended. Step one: choose a day when waves are moderate but regular. Step two: with the lifeboat facing into the waves, making the ride as comfortable as possible, blow your whistle soothingly. Step three: turn the lifeboat sideways to the waves, accompanied by harsh aggressive use of the whistle. With sufficient repetition, the animal will associate the sound of the whistle with the discomfort of seasickness. Similar methods have long been used by circus trainers, though they generally lack access to rough seas.

He reels in this line, turning the boat sideways to the waves. The rocking increases. Pi blows the whistle several times harshly ("warning" signal) as the rocking increases.

Richard Parker strikes and splashes as fish streak past. Pi grins at the tiger's predicament - but the moment Richard Parker realizes he can't climb back aboard, he begins swimming toward the raft. Pi snaps to, recognizing the danger he's in. He reels the raft over to the lifeboat, practically leaping onto the bow.
</DIRECTION>

As he hauls the raft aboard, Richard Parker manages to catch the netting on the raft with one paw. Pi leans back against an oar with all his weight, trying to lever the raft aboard; the weight of the tiger tips the entire bow lower in the water. Pi is about to lose the struggle when the tiger's claw rips through the netting, and the lifeboat springs back up in the water; the momentum flips the raft up onto the boat.

One of the dorados gets very close to the net - Pi realizes his opportunity. He hauls in the netting and wrestles the dorado onto the raft, flailing against the creature's strength and throwing his full weight onto the creature to keep it from sliding back into the ocean, riding it like a bucking bronco. Pi grabs a hatchet from the raft and strikes the fish over and over again.

A full moon. All around the raft, the green surface of the water glows with millions of flecks of glowing plankton - and beneath the surface, fish swim past at multiple depths and in multiple directions. Pi brushes his fingers over the surface of the water. The surface ripples where he touched it, the plankton glowing more brightly, the effect moving outward and downward through the water, an ever-expanding ring.

Pi hears a faint, rapid succession of blows. He peers into the encroaching darkness but can see nothing. Richard Parker is nowhere to be seen. The blows stop and Pi returns his attention to the light show below.

Pi senses movement deep within the water, a cone of rushing energy pressing up toward the luminescent surface.

Suddenly, the glowing silhouette of a huge creature wrapped in phosphorescent plankton - a HUMPBACK WHALE - streaks to the surface nearby, its mouth gaping. Fifty feet in length, it thrusts itself up into the air. Pi barely has time to react, gripping the raft and holding on for his life as the whale comes crashing back down into the water.

Richard Parker is nowhere to be seen.

Pi reaches out with the boat hook to try to snag the gaff, but it is hooked deeply into the tarp. He lays the boat hook on the tarp and climbs aboard, crawling forward to free the gaff. As he wiggles the hook free, Richard Parker's head pops out from beneath the tarp only a few feet away.

The air around the boat whirs to life as they are struck from all directions by a school of flying fish that descends upon them like a swarm of locusts. Some sail clear over the boat; a number crash into the side. Other, less fortunate fish land in the boat, where they start a racket of flapping and flailing. Pi yelps in anguish as he is struck repeatedly.

The school of fish is being pursued through the ocean by tuna. It is a feeding frenzy - the ocean boils with jumping fish and snapping jaws.

He uses his knife to carefully sharpen his pencil, then begins writing in the margins of his survival manual, which are covered with journal entries...

	I never thought a small piece of shade could bring me so much happiness. That a pile of tools - a bucket, a knife, a pencil- might become my greatest treasures. Or that knowing Richard Parker was here might ever bring me peace. In times like these, I remember that he has as little experience of the real world as I do. We were both raised in a zoo by the same master. Now we've been orphaned, left to face our ultimate master together. Without Richard Parker, I would have died by now. My fear of him keeps me alert. Tending to his needs gives my life purpose.

A series of shots to show that Pi has grown gaunt, his eyes wild from exhaustion and endless solitude. The tarp has faded; the paint on the boat has become sun-bleached and weather- beaten.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The storm front sweeps across the ocean in a squall line, high winds and rain striking Pi and the lifeboat with tremendous force. The manual slips from his hands and Pi is knocked off his feet and into the water. He lifts his head out of the water in time to watch the manual flying off into the storm.

Thunder, rain and surf hammer the tarp from above; Pi pulls himself under the tarp. Richard Parker's grunts and labored breathing can be heard, but man and beast are only fully visible when lightning strikes, Pi trying to stay as far away from the tiger as he can manage. Before long the boat is tossing Pi and the tiger as though in a washing machine, the two helplessly colliding with one another, Pi choking as water splashes in.

Richard Parker lies in the stern of the boat, severely emaciated, his coat dull, his eyes clouded. Shivering, Pi uses the last of his strength to drag himself over to the tiger. The animal's body is curled, his tail flat. Some of his fur has fallen away from his shoulders and haunches. He's a skeleton in an oversized bag of fur. Pi reaches out to place a hand on the tiger.

<DIRECTION>
Pi lies, unconscious, in the bow of the lifeboat. Waves lap at the sides of the boat, which presses against the shore of an island.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gust of wind blows across Pi's face, tousling his hair. Pi gradually opens his eyes. A beat. He tips his head back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi's POV - above and behind him, the tops of trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi turns, looking at the island, amazed. The trees have a pale bark with an amazing profusion of leaves, their color burning with a neon-like intensity. There is no sand; instead the ground is an intricate, tightly webbed mass of tube- shaped seaweed, about two fingers in diameter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi turns to look back to the stern; he calls under the tarp.
</DIRECTION>
<PI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard Parker?

Pi rises, stepping out of the boat. The seaweed is rubbery - uncertain ground. His legs are wobbly. He hooks the gaff on a root and falls to the ground. Pi tears up a piece of the seaweed and examines it. He takes an experimental bite. Soon he's grabbing handfuls of the seaweed, eating as fast as he can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi climbs the ridge on unsteady legs. A forest comes into view with nearly symmetrical ponds dotting the island here and there, many of them reaching 40 feet in diameter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Half the island seems to be covered with meerkats - thousands of them standing together in groups all over the island. The moment the first of the meerkats notices Pi, it turns and stands on its hind legs - and the others immediately follow suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ISLAND - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi walks slowly forward, taking in the meerkats and the island. Gradually, the meerkats return to all fours - their squeaking and barking noises coming and going in waves throughout the herd. They pay him so little attention that Pi has to shove them aside with his legs in order to walk.
</DIRECTION>

	Excuse me... Go on, move!

Pi walks beyond the throng of meerkats toward a pond, pausing to examine the fish bones that litter the edge of one of the ponds. The edge is steep; he gets too close, slips down the side and into the water. Pi tastes the water. He begins a gentle, blissful breaststroke across the pond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi hears a commotion. He lifts himself up to peer over at the meerkats. In the distance, Richard Parker blazes a trail through the meerkats, catching, pinning and eating as many as he can. Pi smiles, watching the tiger.

Pi sits cradled in a nest of branches, rigging a hammock. As the last rays of the sun disappear, he hears a commotion below on the island and pushes aside branches to see better. The meerkats are abandoning the ponds, scurrying up onto land and running for the forest, their collective stampede noisier than a herd of elephants. Richard Parker, in the meantime, runs for the shoreline, scrambling down the ridge as fast as possible and leaping into the lifeboat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trunk beneath Pi is swarmed as meerkats settle upon all the branches in the tree. Several invade Pi's hammock, sitting on him, climbing over him, making themselves comfortable at his expense.

Pi sleeps, nestled in the branches of the tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meerkats snore - at least one of them in the branches beneath Pi does. Pi wakes up, staring grumpily into the darkness at the noisy offender.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is amazed to discover that what he can see of the island from his perch is bioluminescent. The leaves of the tree around him and the seaweed below all glow in gentle greens, while the ponds beneath seem to shimmer like liquid silver - it is a scene at once beautiful and threatening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi hears a burbling noise coming from the pond at the center of the tree. He looks down; fish bubble to the surface. One of the larger fish writhes in agony at the surface before falling still along with the others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi watches as the water below begins churning with the bodies of the dead fish, the surface of the water aswirl with the flash of fins - then gradually the fish begin to disappear, as though slowly dissolving in the water. Pi stares at the mysterious pool, then looks out over the island to where the lifeboat is anchored along shore -

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pi notices fruit growing on one of the branches above his head. He looks around at the rest of the tree, but the fruit only seems to grow along the one branch. Pi plucks one of the fruits and examines it. Each stem that he pulls causes a leaf to peel off. He reaches the center of the ball, peeling back the last of the leaves, to reveal a tooth.

	You know, I've left so much behind. My family, the zoo, Anandi, India - I suppose in the end the whole of life becomes an act of letting go. But what always hurts the most is not taking the moment to say goodbye. I was never able to thank my father for all I learned from him, to tell him that without his lessons I would never have survived... And I know he's a tiger, but I wish I'd said: 'It's over. We've survived. Thank you for saving my life. I love you, Richard Parker. You will always be with me. May God be with you.'

	<DIALOGUE>
	...The cook and the sailor were already onboard. The cook threw me a lifebuoy and pulled me aboard. Mother held onto some bananas and made it to the lifeboat. The cook, the cook was a disgusting man. He ate a rat. We had food enough for weeks, but he found the rat in the first few days - and he killed it, and dried it in the sun and ate it. He was such a brute, that man. But he was resourceful. It was his idea to build the raft to catch fish. We would have died in those first few days without him. The sailor was the same man who brought rice with gravy, the Buddhist. We didn't understand much of what he said, only that he was suffering. I can still hear him - the happy Buddhist who only ate rice with gravy. He had broken his leg horribly in the fall. We tried to set it as best we could, but the leg became infected and the cook told us we had to do something or he'd die. The cook said he'd do it, but mother and I had to hold the man down. And I believed him - we needed to do it. So... I kept saying, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry", but he just kept.. looking at me, his eyes so... I'll never understand the point of that man's suffering. We didn't save him, of course. He died. The morning after, the cook caught his first dorado, and I didn't understand what he'd done at first, but Mother did, and I'd never seen her so angry. 'Stop whining and be happy,' he said. "We need more food or we'll die. That was the whole point.' 'What was the point?' Mother asked. "You let that poor boy die in order to get bait? You monster!' The cook got furious. He started towards her with his fists raised, and Mother slapped him hard, right across the face. I was stunned. I thought he was going to kill her right then. But he didn't. The cook didn't stop at bait either, no. The sailor, he went the same way the rat went - the cook was a resourceful man. It was a week later that he... Because of me. Because I couldn't hold onto a stupid turtle. It slipped out of my hands and swam away and the cook came up and punched me on the side of the head and my teeth clacked and I saw stars. I thought he was going to hit me again, but then Mother started pounding on him with her fists and screaming, "MONSTER! MONSTER!" She yelled at me to go to the raft - "Nee poda!" I thought she was coming with me or I'd never have... I don't know why I didn't make her go first. I think about that every day. I jumped over and turned back just as the knife came out. There wasn't anything I could do; I couldn't look away... He threw her body overboard. Then the sharks came. I saw what they... I saw. The next day I killed him. He didn't even fight back. He knew he had gone too far, even by his standards. He'd left the knife out on the bench. And I did to him what he did to the sailor. He was such an evil man, but worse still, he brought the evil out in me. I have to live with that. I was alone in a lifeboat, drifting across the Pacific Ocean. And I survived.
