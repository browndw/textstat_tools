INT. TELEPHONE COMPANY INFORMATION OFFICE. DAY. We move slowly through a crowded office. A hundred information operators in booths. SHARON works at a computer terminal. Close on her. She's on a kind of autopilot as she does her job, and the people talking to her hear so little personality that her humanity barely registers. That she might have a beauty that is becoming hollow, or a private life that would astonish them -- this, no one thinks about. She watches the clock. Five minutes to six.

Six o'clock.

SHARON gets up. The other OPERATOR takes her place and takes her headphones. SHARON starts to stand as she begins the next sentence. Pause.

EXT. STREET. NIGHT. And now we see her sitting in the back of a Jaguar convertible. VIC is driving the car. VIC looks to someone offscreen.
</DIRECTION>
<VIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIC>
<SHARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. He's wearing a rug, and she has a nose job.

Now we see VIC. He is a beardless werewolf [I mean, spiritually]. SHARON is excited. She likes danger. Underneath, we feel her deep exhaustion.

<VIC>

INT. BAR. NIGHT. A rummy's bar in Hollywood. SHARON and VIC lean against a wall, drinking from bottles. VIC studies a couple sitting alone at a table, side by side. Sharp-featured, long-haired, not talking, they are smoking.

<SHARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now we're looking for something a little less obvious.

<VIC>

<SHARON>

INT. VIC'S STORE. NIGHT. VIC leads the others in, turning on lights and slow dance music (Little Richard singing "Directly from My Heart"). We move through the store to a far corner, to a model bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHARON reaches out to RANDY and pulls him to her. RANDY lets go of DIANA and dances with SHARON. They dance to be watched. They are moving toward a bed. DIANA takes VIC'S hand. They dance. A blues song plays.

SHARON sees this and shakes her head. DIANA goes to RANDY and SHARON.

INT. VIC'S STORE. NIGHT. SHARON, RANDY, and DIANA on a bed. Their sex is a ritual, and the surprise here is their need. SHARON is the subject. They finish. They are still for a moment. SHARON gets up. We watch RANDY watching her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHARON sits on the arm of a leather couch, smoking. RANDY comes over to her. Behind them, Vic begins fucking DIANA. SHARON looks grim. RANDY studies her.
</DIRECTION>
<RANDY>

SHARON turns to look at him.

INT. TELEPHONE COMPANY VENDING-MACHINE ROOM. DAY. Coffee break. Move through the room. Everyone sits alone, recovering from the phones. SHARON enters staring into space. Behind her are a group of workers, talking quietly but passionately. At first, SHARON doesn't listen. Bits of the following drift into consciousness.

	<DIALOGUE>
	And did you do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHARON>
<RANDY>

The tattoo is not finished: we see a long boat with an angel blowing a horn on the bow. Behind the scene is a large pearl.

MARY wakes up, and she cries deeply. Her face tells us everything: she has given up hope.

SHARON tries to make sense of this. She can't; she's too tired right now for tests of faith. She smiles and looks her daughter in the eye.

MARY makes a face as though she's about to enter icy water. With her panda tucked under her arm, she clasps her hands in prayer even harder.

SHARON pulls the trigger, and the gun fires. MARY is dead.

<DIRECTION>
SHARON takes the gun and puts it to her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She holds the gun. We watch. We wait. Will she? Can she? She empties the gun into the air, screams at the sky; then she sits down on the ground; then she lies down beside MARY and goes to sleep.

Fade-out.

Fade-in:

EXT. BURNED HILL. LATER. NIGHT. SHARON places a cross on the panda on top of the grave and then gets up. She walks away, empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear hoofbeats, one horse, distant. The sound gets louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHARON'S CAR. NIGHT. SHARON speeds down the highway, and everywhere she looks she sees a white horse flashing in her vision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cut to:

EXT. FREEWAY. NIGHT. SHARON keeps speeding. The white horse is gone. And then the red lights of a sheriff's police car appear in the mirror. The siren is close. She is sure she has been caught. She pulls over. The sheriff's OFFICER MADISON from the campground. He shines his searchlight on SHARON'S car. Then he walks to the car and knocks on her window.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Could you step over into the light, please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOSTER>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the identification and goes back to his bike. SHARON nods yes. He studies the license. We look at him for a moment. He is not a bad man, and he is studying SHARON, less as another speeder than as a woman in obvious trouble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the beginning, SHARON is catatonic; her answers are short and sparse. As FOSTER continues to press her, she starts to unravel. She realizes what she has done.
</DIRECTION>
<FOSTER>

<SHARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I killed her. I was going to kill myself too, but you can't get into Heaven if you kill yourself. You can get into Heaven if somebody else kills you but not if you kill yourself. Life is some kind of punishment, isn't it? You have to go through with it, even when you know what life is for.

	</DIALOGUE>
</FOSTER>
<SHARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think He says that, basically, you have to love Him, no matter what. But I don't love Him, not anymore. He has too many rules. He told me to meet Him in the desert. And I did and I waited. He didn't come. He broke His promise. He let me kill my little girl. And He still expects me to love Him? I'm afraid of Hell, so I have to wait out my life, waiting for God. Now: He'll forgive me and He'll let me join my daughter and my husband in Heaven, but first I have to say I love Him. You can send me to the gas chamber, and if I let God into my heart before I die, then I can go to Heaven, because God is merciful. How fast was I going?

INT. PRISON. DAY. A guard leads SHARON down a row of cells. A door is opened and then locked behind her. A woman on the next bed is reading the Bible, and when she lowers the book, we see it is ANGIE, the swinger with the tattoo. SHARON says nothing to her.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you. I should be embarrassed to even tell you where we met, but I'm not ashamed, I'm not ashamed of anything anymore, I found God, God found me. I was preaching the word of God at a shopping mall in Palm Springs, and they had me kicked out. So I went back in, and they had me arrested. Have you heard the word of God?

Another angel drifts into this scene outside the cell. MARY appears dressed as she was when she died.

INT. PRISON. NIGHT. We move through the cells. A trumpet plays one long, extended note. The prisoners look outside.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGIE>

	That's the first call. It's Gabriel blowing his trumpet. There will be six more calls. We have until the last call to repent. After that, it's too late. After that, it's too late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGIE>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the hoofbeats again, getting louder. People look up. The sound seems to be in the middle of the room. The sound of the hoofbeats is impossibly loud, and we see on the TV screen the faint image of a white horse over a ballgame. Then the game disappears, and we see the feet of the horse.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's God. He's giving us a last chance to save ourselves. At war, the First Horseman of the Apocalypse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGIE>
<DIRECTION>
The horse is replaced by a trumpet. The channels are changed, and the golden trumpet blowing the pure tone is seen across every channel. It is a long trumpet raised high before a deep blue background. A hand holds the trumpet, but we don't see the angel's face. ANGIE begins to sing:
</DIRECTION>
<ANGIE>

</ANGIE>
<DIRECTION>
As she sings, the trumpet sounds again. The hoofbeats grow. The blast gets louder. Prison bars start to collapse. All of the bars fall out of the walls, collapse to the floor with a great noise. Women step slowly out of their cells. A helicopter sounds in the background. Everyone sits quietly. No one knows what to say.

SHARON and FOSTER get off their motorbike and watch the horseman. Then, they begin to rise slowly into the smoke. She doesn't want this.

</SHARON>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There really is a Heaven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<SHARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why should I thank Him for the gift of so much suffering, Mary, so much pain on the Earth that He created. Let me ask Him why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHARON>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell God you love Him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

<DIRECTION>
And then we hear Gabriel's final call. Gabriel's melody is like the infinite regression of an image in parallel mirrors, and the melody stretches into the end of time. While they listen, a gold light, as though a sun is setting, fills SHARON'S face. MARY takes her hand and stands beside her. The gold light shines on both of them.

MARY fades away.

And to the darkness, SHARON says:

She is alone. We pull back.
