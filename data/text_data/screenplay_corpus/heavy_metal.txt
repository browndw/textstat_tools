:SC: A WHEATFIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun. As the camera skims overtop, titles start to roll. Ahead of us an odd-looking service van comes into view, sputtering along a dirt road. Getting closer, we can see the driver, a thin, bookish man with a neat mustache. This is AUSTIN GRIMALDI.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck pulls up to a strange Victorian house in the middle of the wheatfield. The house has several futuristic radar devices on the roof that rotate constantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AUSTIN gets out, opens the van's rear doors, and pulls out two large metal boxes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO :SC: THE ATTIC WINDOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The curtains part ever so slightly, and a pair of eyes peer down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO :SC: THE VAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AUSTIN shuts the van's rear doors, and carries the two metal boxes into the house. The titles stop rolling as we;
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO :SC: INSIDE THE HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AUSTIN is reading a schematic diagram as he sits in front of the exposed chassis of a complicated futuristic electronic contraption, twice his size. There are strange tools all over the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Putting down the diagram, he opens one of the metal cases and takes out a sophisticated-looking glass sphere with electronic receptacles mounted in the sides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He places this sphere in a space in the middle of the contraption, clamps it down, and plugs some wires into the globe's receptacles. Then he opens the second box. Inside is a glowing green ball. Using a pair of special tongs, AUSTIN carefully lifts the ball out, and inserts it into an opening at the base of the machine, in the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As soon as the ball is inside, the machine hums to life. The glass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a green planet in space appears inside it.
</DIRECTION>
<AUSTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at the holograph)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmmm ....
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUSTIN>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a strange tool, and moves out of frame to make an adjustment underneath the machine. Suddenly a wire comes loose from the sphere and begins to spark.
</DIRECTION>
<AUSTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(seeing sparks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh - oh ....
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUSTIN>
<DIRECTION>
As the camera pulls closer to the holograph screen, the green planet begins to silently shake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO :SC: SPACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With an explosion that rocks the universe, a huge chunk rips out of the green planet and shoots off into space, leaving thousands of glowing particles in its wake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO :SC: AUSTIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not noticing the silent image on the holograph, he quickly repairs the sparkling connection and returns to his other adjustments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO :SC: A FOREST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the forest floor we see the green planetoid fly overhead, dropping balls. We watch as it moves away and disappears beyond a far-off mountain range. The forest rumbles as the planetoid crashes in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera then pans over to a forest patch, where a beautiful girl approaches, picking mushrooms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO :SC: A GREEN BALL NEAR HER FEET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ominous note is struck as the girl notices the glowing ball, and is drawn to it. Picking the sphere up, she looks at it. Something inside her warns her of its danger, but, unable to resist, she puts it in her basket and continues on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GATES OF KRAAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Night falls over this futuristic chromoid city as the beautiful girl passes through the glass gates and heads home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO :SC: THE GIRL'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girl yawns and gets into bed as the camera pans over to her basket in the corner. Through its side, the green ball begins to glow brightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Getting closer, we see a slimy silk-like webbing ooze out of the ball and move towards the sleeping girl, pulling the green ball behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins to surround the girl, like a cocoon. Slowly the camera pans up the wall, and moves out through the window, and beyond the city gates, rising higher and higher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO :SC: THE OUTLANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flying quickly overtop futuristic villages, the camera heads further and further out into the less civilized sectors, where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations of a past civilization have been overgrown by scrub-bush and weeds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera zooms across this strange landscape toward the distant mountains where the huge planetoid fell. Finally, from high above the foothills, we begin to come down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the hills below us, hundreds of blue humanoid barbarians are moving along, mesmerized, toward a pulsing green glow high in the mountaintops. Suddenly the mountains begin to rumble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO :SC: THE LINE OF BARBARIANS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the front of the line, the largest barbarian - obviously their leader - stops and points.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO :SC: THE MOUNTAINS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A strange, green, foamy liquid comes pouring down the mountains toward the barbarians.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO :SC: THE LINE OF BARBARIANS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The barbarians stand frozen as the foam washes over them and keeps on going. One by one, their eyes turn green and they start to change, becoming hairier, uglier, and stronger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As their transformations are complete, the barbarians gather behind their leader into an ever-growing mob of murderous looking sub-humans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO :SC: THE GATES OF KRAAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A frightened Kraanian councillor spurs his horse forward through the beautiful glass gates, as in the distance we hear the sound of ten thousand approaching footsteps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera pans to a hillside overlooking Kraan. In the glow of sunset, the outline of the BARBARIAN LEADER, riding a black war-horse, appears at the hillside and stops. Then with a thundering of footsteps, the outline of five thousand barbarians comes into view behind him, filling the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO :SC: THE BARBARIAN LEADER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is now wearing a strange medallion around his neck as, wild- eyed, he screams to signal the attack. The bloodthirsty horde charges down the hill behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through the gates of the city, destroying everything in their path. Smoke and flames are everywhere. Ahead of us, terrified Kraanians run from the onslaught.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we track up over the burning rooftops, we see the BARBARIAN LEADER riding his war-horse in the streets below. Shouting a command, he waves his men on as they move toward an impressive doomed building in the middle of the city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO :SC: THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the far end of this huge glass hall, the Kraanian Council sits around a marble table. From outside, we hear the battle raging.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulling closer we can hear the worried voices of the Council members.
</DIRECTION>

</ELDER>
<DIRECTION>
As the Councilmen take up the chant;
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO :SC: THE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the boy begins to bar the door, it bursts open, flinging him aside. Standing in the doorway, surrounded by his men, is the BARBARIAN LEADER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a laugh, he raises a Medieval-looking multiple cross-bow and fires a burst of arrows into the boy's chest, as the crazed troops rush in around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chanting continues as we;
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO :SC: THE OUTLANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We look down over this uncivilized wilderness with only decaying pipelines and the occasional jagged rock structure breaking the barren uniformity of the land. As the Council's distant chanting fades out, all is quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly from behind us, we hear the sound of flapping wings and a huge rush of air. Just above our heads, TAARNA THE DEFENDER comes flying in, sitting proudly in the saddle of a giant crimson bird.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TAARNA'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is beautiful, with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing behind her in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below her, on the ground, she sees a humanoid running in terror, chased by an ugly, four-legged mutant creature.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spurring her bird forward, TAARNA sweeps down over the ugly beast and lassoes it. She then hoists the creature up into the air and, tossing her end of the rope over a tall jagged rock, she leaves the snarling beast hanging helplessly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts. As she approaches we see that he has a barbarian medallion on a chain around his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<HUMANOID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I owe you my life. Let me repay you ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUMANOID>
<DIRECTION>
He takes off his medallion and places it around her neck. Suddenly he twists the chain tight in his hand, pulling her towards him. His eyes change to a bright green as he forces her to the ground and starts ripping at her clothes. As he molests her, TAARNA is distracted. She hears something - voices inside her, chanting her name.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quickly she grabs the chain and rips it apart. Then she powerfully smashes both her hands together around her attacker's ears. As he holds his ringing ears, she gets up, lifts him above her head, and hurls him mercilessly to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still hearing the chanting, she jumps on her bird, pulls out a second rope, and lassoes the barbarian's feet. She then lifts him up and leaves him hanging from the tall, jagged rock, next to the growling creature.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As TAARNA flies off, the hanging beast eyes the barbarian hungrily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO :SC: AUSTIN GRIMALDI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is still sitting on the floor, working on his machine. As the camera pulls closer, we see that AUSTIN is reaching deep inside the machineworks, trying to solder a small orange diode in place with an odd-style soldering iron. The connection breaks, and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into the machine and start smoking and sputtering. As the smoke grows thicker, the machine starts to buzz loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<AUSTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUSTIN>
<DIRECTION>
AUSTIN pulls his face out of the smoking chassis, grabs a pair of needlenose pliers, and reaches back to retrieve the part.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera follows AUSTIN'S arm into the chassis, where smoke surrounds it and clouds over everything. The buzzing sound grows, and changes into the sound of powerful, throbbing engines. Slowly the smoke begins to clear as we hear a voice crackling over a radiophone.

Suddenly the smoke dissipates and a formation of B-17 bombers come tearing out into the moonlit night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO :SC: THE GROUND BELOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of jungle night creatures fills the air. We see palm trees silhouetted against the moon bright sky. The scene is almost serene. The camera pans and suddenly the nose of a large parked bomber fills the screen, and as the camera continues panning, we pass a large red rising sun on the bomber's fuselage. The pan stops at the tail of the aircraft, and we see a Japanese soldier - a guard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a moment of tranquillity, as jungle sounds fill the air. The soldier almost dozes ... suddenly the cacophony of sound stops, and for a brief moment there is complete silence ... then with an agonizing wail an air raid siren shatters the silence and the guard looks skyward, startled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly all hell breaks loose as we hear pounding feet. Silhouetted figures rush by.
</DIRECTION>

Japanese soldiers crank the barrel of an anti-aircraft gun skyward. We begin to hear the sound of approaching engines.

He has landed, and is undoing his parachute harness. He looks around incredulously. The island is a junkyard - a veritable graveyard of aircrafts. There are many aircrafts, both old wrecks and futuristic-looking ones lying everywhere. Skeletal corpses are still left in some of the wrecks. The camera pans to the remains of one machine. It is an old American Lockheed Electra. It glints dull in the half light of dawn. Painted on its side are two names; "Amelia Earhart" and "Fred Noonan".

The camera continues to move through this panorama of metallic junk until it stops on a long chrome rod sticking up out of a pile of scrap.

Tilting up to the sky we see the clouds part as two gargantuan metal arms emerge and descend down toward the junkpile. The metal arms reach the chrome rod, grip it tightly, and begin to lift it up.

Gliding overtop the deserted streets, she sees a column of smoke rising through the wrecked dome of the building in the town's center. As she watches the smoke rise, she pulls hard on the reins, and heads her bird up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera follows as she rides in through the shattered dome down to the Council Chambers below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corpses of the Councilmen are strewn everywhere. In the center of the room, a large pile of ancient books and manuscripts lie smouldering. Reaching the floor, TAARNA dismounts and starts to look around. At the head of the marble table sits the ELDER - dead. In front of him, a roll of parchment lies on the table. TAARNA opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains, their tops glowing green.
</DIRECTION>

TAARNA looks at it, and puts it in her sack. Then she notices that the ELDER is clutching something in his hand. Prying his stiff fingers apart, she finds a blood-stained medallion just like the one her attacker wore on his chain.

The WITCH cackles and crumbles into dust, but her green eyes stay suspended in the air, and her cackle echoes through the room.

The WITCH'S green ball zooms through space, as Earth appears in the distance. Then another object comes into sight. Getting closer we see that is is a modern winged rocketplane of no determinable nationality, soaring high above Earth. The green meteorite passes, briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rocketplane banks sharply, then stabilizes. Slowly the hatch-doors in its belly open up, revealing the underside of an automobile suspended in the open hatch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hydraulic metal arms emerge, lowering the automobile out from the belly of the cruising rocketplane. We can see now that the car is a white, '59 Corvette convertible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a "thunk", the metal arms release the car, and as the rocketplane blasts away, the Corvette begins its free-fall to Earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the car falls gracefully through space, the driver plays with the wheel, causing the Corvette to bank smoothly one way, then the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once his direction is stable, the driver clicks on the car radio and adjusts it through various channels, until he settles on one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the music playing, the car falls closer and closer to Earth, entering and emerging from the cloud cover over the atmosphere. In the heat of entry the vehicle's paint starts burning up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he heads down over a deserted area, the driver begins his approach. Touching down at breakneck speed, the smoking Corvette bounces violently, every part straining at the repeated impact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver's face is expressionless as he jams the car into high gear and floors it, spinning the wheels in an attempt to translate downward momentum into forward motion. Then he pops his drag chute to help slow down.

Instinctively, STERNN leaps back as FISTE'S giant hands come smashing down in the spot where STERNN stood. The gallery scatters screaming as STERNN runs for the door. Slavering, FISTE thunders after him. STERNN runs through the exit, bolting the door behind him. FISTE follows, tearing the door apart, and bringing the entire courtroom wall down in the process.

Taking a deep breath, STERNN reaches into his pocket, pulls out a wad of bills, and counts them out as he hands them to FISTE.

CUT TO :SC: THE OUTLANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All is quiet across this vast expanse of rusted pipes and barren desert. The silence is broken by a whistling sound which gets louder and louder. Then, thud!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A green ball lands in the dirt in front of us. Fluttering down around it are HANOVER FISTE'S tattered clothes. Then the burnt ashes of Hanover's body land in a small pile beside his clothes. Panning up we see TAARNA flying on her bird in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TAARNA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She swoops down and flies through a maze of rusting pipes and cables which look like the ramnants of an ancient power station. Then she steers her bird through a hidden opening in the rotting floor, and enters a magnificent secret hideaway cut deep into the rock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO :SC: INSIDE TAARNA'S HIDEAWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landing her bird on a circular slab of gleaming marble, TAARNA dismounts and walks over to a shimmering pool. Here she disrobes, and picking up a small gold pitcher, she pours an ancient oil over herself. It shines and sparkles as it touches her skin. Then she steps into the water, where her body seems to sparkle even brighter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finishing her sacred bath, she steps out and walks to a stone wall. When she touches it, a rock panel slides away to reveal a gold chest. TAARNA opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the chest lies a glistening set of armoured garments, so bright that TAARNA must shield her eyes for a moment. Then, as she looks down at the armour, the voice of TAARAK THE DEFENDER comes into her head.
</DIRECTION>
<TAARAK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To defend - this is the Pact. but when life loses its value, and it taken for nought, then the Pact is ... to avenge!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAARAK>
<DIRECTION>
Through a series of dissolves we see TAARNA'S hands sensuously fitting the various metallic pieces over her firm body. Finally we pull back to see her fully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing before us, glistening in the torch-light, she looks magnificent. Reaching once more into the chest, TAARNA pulls out a golden sword. As she holds it, it seems to vibrate, almost buzzing in her hands. Suddenly she swings it, slicing cleanly through one of the stone torches on the rock wall. As the burning torch falls to the ground, TAARNA leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO :SC: THE SKY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From over our heads, TAARNA comes soaring past, her armour gleaming in the rays of the setting sun. Below her, she sees a metallic holiday-town filled with barbarian soldiers. Drunken blue men fight in the streets, strange animals run around loose, and dead or drunken bodies lie in the gutters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking down, amidst the melee, she sees three winged creatures tied up in front of a bar. The camera zooms in on one of the creature's saddlebags. It has a silver medallion set into the leather, identical to the one which TAARNA pried from the Elder's fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO :SC: INSIDE THE BARROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbarian honky-tonk music fills the crowded room, as various barbarian soldiers sit drinking and fondling the bar-girls who are dressed in cheap, flashy metal outfits.
</DIRECTION>

Three of the blue barbarians are particularly drunk and rowdy as they push a non-barbarian down, dump a drink on his head, laugh and kick him.

TAARNA walks in through the swinging silver and plexiglass doors, past the three soldiers kicking their victim. She sits down at the bar.

The three brutish blue soldiers finish stomping the man and walk over to the bar, crowding close around TAARNA.

Taarna slowly stands up, pushing their hands away, and takes a step back.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARIAN_1>
<DIRECTION>
Still laughing, they move towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a blinding flash, TAARNA draws her golden sword, and wielding it like a Samurai master, slices off all three of their heads. In an instant, the sword is back in its sheath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The barbarian's heads stop laughing as they fall to the ground. The music stops, and everyone in the bar stares at TAARNA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stepping over the bodies, TAARNA walks up to the bartender, pulls out the parchment picture of the glowing mountains, and shows it to him. The bartender looks at it carefully, then points out the window.

AUSTIN is crouched over the machine turning several knobs, trying to make the ball move. Nothing happens.

	Hmmm ... must be jammed.

Frustrated, AUSTIN picks up a flashlight, opens up a compartment underneath the control knobs, and takes a look inside. While AUSTIN fiddles inside the machine, we see two hands appear on the holograph screen and pick up the green ball. AUSTIN looks over to the holograph and notices.

(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It all started when I found the green meteorite. I read in Farraday's "Life of the Planets" that smaller ones like this are supposed to burn up when they enter the atmosphere, but for some reason this one didn't ...

DAN carries the ball into a typical small-town house.

DISSOLVE TO :SC: T.V. ANTENNA ON ROOF - STORMY NIGHT

As the narration continues, we follow two red wires down from the T.V. antenna, along the roof, and into DAN'S attic window. The wires run through a bucket of water and are hooked up to some electronic parts on DAN'S desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DAN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... so I brought it up to my room, stuck it in my rock collection and forgot about it. I was experimenting with natural electricity ...

<DIRECTION>
The camera pans around the room to show various displays of DAN'S scientific tinkering - blue-ribbon science projects, transparent models of a man and a woman showing all internal organs, and many books.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the corner, the green ball sits in DAN'S rock collection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At his desk, DAN impatiently shuffles through the dusty pages of an old scientific journal.
</DIRECTION>

Suddenly, an electric arc jumps from the bucket of water and crosses the room to join with thw ball on his shelf. Caught in the middle, DAN begins to glow green.

Then, tiny beams of light join to form a glow in the corner of the screen. The glow gets brighter and starts moving slowly around the screen. Now, we can make out some of the images whipping past - a half-formed hand, pages of a book, a crumbling pyramid, a green ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DAN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then, a body started to re-form around me. Only it wasn't my body - this one had muscles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAN>
<DIRECTION>
Sturdy muscular parts begin to materialize around the moving light. They join up with each other to form a powerfully built human figure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally a man's face takes shape, and as it forms, eveything gets brighter and clearer.

	It was a great body, but I wasn't too crazy about the face.

The powerful figure, DEN, turns slowly as he floats and begins to look at his hands and arms. Moving his mouth, he speaks in a new voice - deep and powerful.

DEN, strong, masculine and hairless, materializes cradled in the hand of a huge stone idol. He is naked and unconscious Above him, the glowing green ball is held in the idol's other hand.

The camera pulls back to show that the idol is standing on the deck, stop a huge, truncated pyramid. The deck forms a walkway around a swirling pool of green water.

Two bestial guards approach from behind, brandishing curved short-swords. DEN turns instinctively, dodges the first thrust and delivers a bone-shattering elbow to the beast's head, crushing his skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spinning with his own momentum, DEN throws a rock-hard fist into the second guard's chest, snapping his rib-cage and sending him flying across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without pausing, the bald muscleman grabs the nearby beast- Captain and lifts him into the air by his machine-gun. The Captain hangs on as DEN twists the gun, butts it into the creature's groin and then drives the weapon through the Captain's jaw.

The creature crumples, leaving DEN with the gun.

	As I saw the Loc-Nar's glow I had this real funny feeling. All by themselves, my hands reached forward to touch it. But the Loc-Nar moved out of the way. Instead, my hands felt something else - warm flesh. Then the lights came on.
	</DIALOGUE>

In the brightly lit room, DEN is standing before the beautiful semi-clad QUEEN, and holding her firm, naked breasts in his hands. Looking around, he sees that he and KONG are surrounded by a brigade of the Queen's ugly guards, swords raised.

The Queen's guards attack with battle-axes, clubs and swords. As DEN knees one in the groin and swings his gun into another's face, four of the guards surround KORG and club his brains out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But DEN, still going strong, throws two guards into the wall and heaves a third out the window. As the QUEEN watches with glee, more guards rush into the room and DEN is finally over- powered and held down. The Captain of the guards places a long knife against Den's throat.

DISSOLVE TO :SC: THE QUEEN'S BED

DEN and the QUEEN are lying undressed on the enormous bed. The QUEEN has a very contented look on her face. DEN looks exhausted. As the Neverwhere moon rises outside the chamber window, the QUEEN slowly runs her hand over DEN'S bulging muscles.

ARD is kneeling at the edge of the sacrificial pool. Beside him sits a long glass case wrapped in chains. Through the chains we see KATHERINE trapped inside - fully conscious and terrified. Ard's bestial warriors stand all around carrying torches and spears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above them, the Loc-Nar sits glowing in the stone idol's hand.

<ARD>

	By the power of the magic Loc-Nar placed in your idol's hands, I command you - come forth Uluhtec!

The green water in the pool immediately begins to churn violently and leap into the air. A bolt of lightning crackles in the sky.

CUT TO :SC: THE NEVERWHERE DESERT

<DIRECTION>
DEN is racing across the barren desert on his leopard/horse. Visible in the distance is the outline of the huge, truncated pyramid where he first saved KATHERINE.

As he rides, he sees the green glow of the Loc-Nar, sparkling in the glass surfaces of the coffin in front of it.

Chanting the name "Uluhtec", the two monks start to throw the girl in when suddenly a third monk leaps forward and grabs her, kicking the other two monks into the water.

Holding KATHERINE in one arm, DEN smashes a nearby soldier and grabs the beast's spear. With the battle raging all around him, DEN looks up at the sky.

Lightning crackles, illuminating the night with electricity.

</DIRECTION>

DEN reaches down, picks up the long chain that was wrapped around the glass case and attaches one end to his spear. He kicks the other end into the raging water, then heaves the spear with all his might into the head of the stone idol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the same instant, a bolt of lightning fires down from the sky, striking the idol full force. The lightning bolt travels through the spear and down the chain, into the water. Suddenly, the electrical energy arcs across to join with the Loc-Nar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding onto the Loc-Nar, ARD and the QUEEN begin to glow green, then de-materialize into a shimmering dimensional warp. The troops stop fighting and look on in amazement, until all that remains is the glowing Loc-Nar, hanging in mid-air.

CUT TO :SC: THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera pans down the stone statue to the glowing sphere, which lies abandoned on the ground. The soldiers are gone. As we watch, time begins to accelerate and the Neverwhere Pyramid ages and crumbles all around the green ball. The earth heaves and shifts, and dense vegetarian grows up through the cracks in the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A prehistoric man walks up and sees the glowing ball under a fern. Fascinated, he picks it up and looks at it, as the foot of a Tyrannosaurus Rex comes down, crushing him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Time advances again as the dinosaur becomes a skeleton, and a Biblical tent-community grows up around the ball. In the fire-light, the Nomadic tribesmen are watering their animals, when one of the camels paws at the ground, uncovering the glowing ball. Scared, the camel struggles and trys to break its ropes. Out of nowhere a Roman Legion attacks, slaughtering the tribesmen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Time accelerates again, and the conquering Romans build a temple, placing the green ball in the head of a golden idol. Then the Romans grow fat and debauched, while slave-girls feed them grapes. As the ball glows, the temple crashes down around the debauched Romans, covering them and the green ball in rubble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over the ruins of the temple, a succession of primitive mud and clay huts evolve into the thatched-roof cottages of a Medieval village.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Medieval stone-cutter finds the ball, and mortars it in with his stones as he builds a water well in the centre of the village. Satisfied with his work, he lowers the bucket to draw himself a drink. Behind him, an ox-cart comes roaring around a corner. The axle breaks and a heavy wooden wheel careens along, striking the stone-cutter in the back and knocking him into the well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Time advances once more as the Medieval village grows and transforms into a Victorian-style town. It is evening, and the stone well now sits under a gazebo at the centre of a gas- lit village green.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fancy carriage carrying a Victorian gentleman passes by and circles the green.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving in through a window across the street, we see a seductive- looking woman dressing herself in black garters and lace. This is intercut with the carriage circling the green, until the woman, who looks like a high-class harlot, finishes dressing and leaves her room. Crossing the street, she walks up to the gazebo and leans provocatively up against the well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gentleman gets out of his carriage, approaches the woman and propositions her. She smiles, touches, and teases him. We pan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well-wall. Suddenly red blood begins to drip over the ball, and the woman's body falls to the ground. The camera pans up to the well-bucket, where the gentleman is washing the blood from his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As time begins to move forward again, the man ages and hobbles away, as the well crumbles and cheap turn-of-the-century row- housing grows up, covering the green ball. The town becomes dirtier and blacker, and smokestacks blow soot into the morning sky. Almost on cue, the doors of the houses open, and grim coal-miners emerge, shuffling through the filthy streets on their way to work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera pans down to a drain in the gutter. A rat appears. Panning back up, the street is now empty. A bell is heard ringing, and a horse-drawn Red Cross cart pulls around a corner and into view. Masked workers follow the cart. One rings the bell, while the others pull corpses from the doorways and load them into the cart. The gutters and windowsills are now full of rats. Time advances again and the buildings become deserted derelicts. Their decaying timbers groan under the weight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A support snaps, and one of the buildings starts to collapse. Falling amidst the crumbling plaster and rotting wood is the glowing green ball. As the ball hits the ground, it is covered over by rubble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscape grows drier. Sand blows all around, covering over everything. As the sandstorm clears, the entire terrain is nothing but desert. In the distance we can see a group of people walking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PEOPLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The people appears to be a band of aboriginal workmen, carrying futuristic laser-shovels over their shoulders. They are led by a goateed archaeologist with an elaborate metal detector. As he walks, his detector starts bleeping. He points to a spot on the ground, and the natives start digging with their laser- shovels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the workers finds something.

<DIRECTION>
The archaeologist waves the workers away and directs a tread- driven shovel-sifter up to the spot. The shovel-sifter digs in and pulls up a large chunk of desert. When the sand has sifted out, we see the tarnished Loc-Nar in the machine's grip. It is not glowing. The machine swivels, and a native foreman plucks the Loc-Nar from the shovel-sifter's teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the foreman touches it, the Loc-Nar starts glowing brightly. The foreman's hands turn green. He looks at his green hands, then he looks over to the archaeologist. Suddenly the foreman's entire body glows green, and crumbles into dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The archaeologist and the natives stare in horror at the glowing Loc-Nar, lying in the pile of green dust.

DISSOLVE TO :SC: NEW YORK - AERIAL SHOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera comes down from high above the city. The general shape and outline of New York looks familiar, but as we get closer we sense that something is different. Fires are burning in various locations below us, and intermittent gunshots become audible as the narration begins.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, New York, big deal. Scum-centre of the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Moving down through the skyscrapers, the city gets dirtier and slummier. We pass a dead man hanging from a tenement clothesline. Below us, scruffy children dodge traffic as they play gyro-ball in the garbage-filled street.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and now they're talking about letting in low-lifes from other planets, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Under the narration, the camera turns a corner and zooms down through the roof of a parked taxicab. It stops full frame on the newspaper held in the cabdriver's hands. A slow pan across the front page reveals that the paper is the New York Times, July 6, 2031
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One headline reads: "400,000 Traffic Deaths Over Holiday Weekend". Another reads: "Venus Declared 73rd State". The camera stops on a headline reading: "Professor Discovers Ancient Relic --- to be shown in N.Y. Museum".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is an accompanying photo of the goateed archaeologist and his beautiful daughter standing beside a glass and metal case containing the Loc-Nar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A knocking is heard on the cab's window, and the driver throws down the newspaper.

CUT TO :SC: OUTSIDE CAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The young man climbs into the back seat and closes the door. Harry's yellow Checker cab pulls out into traffic. The vehicle looks pretty normal except for some vaguely futuristic chrome panels cut into the sides, and thicker, deeper bumpers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO :SC: INSIDE CAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry slides open the plexiglass shields separating him from his passenger.
</DIRECTION>

<HARRY>

	The U.N. Building. What a joke. Used to be a nice place until they turned it into low rent housing. Now it's a dump. I wouldn't live there if you paid me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He switches on the car radio. The music plays as Harry's cab passes various time-altered New York landmarks; a graffiti -covered Empire State Building - windows all boarded up, a decrepit Lincoln Centre, the marquis reading "Continuous Live Sex Show, Also Inter-Planetary Mud-Wrestling", new ultra-tech buildings crammed between half-destroyed Wall Street office buildings, garbage everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the cab, the YOUNG MAN pulls a gun out of his jacket, sticks his arm through the opening in the plexi-glass shield, and holds the gun to Harry's head.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MAN>

</YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Harry's foot stretches forward and pushes a footswitch. A buzzing is heard, and the young man's body suddenly dematerializes. The gun which he held at Harry's head falls to the seat beside HARRY, who picks it up and tosses it into the glove compartment, beside all sorts of other futuristic guns and weapons.

EXT. METROPOLITIAN MUSEUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera is close-up on the illustrated banner over the main entrance. The banner reads; "Treasures of the Loc-Nar - Coming July 8th".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pan down to the museum doors, as a man's body comes crashing through the plate glass and sprawls forward, cut and bleeding. It is the goateed professor from the desert. His daughter runs out behind him, ripping her clothes on the broken glass.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>

The girl takes off down the museum stairs as men with laser guns come out and start firing. A fat, evil-looking man (RUDNICK) bends down and grabs the professor's head, jerking it up.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDNICK>
<DIRECTION>
(to henchmen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's dead. Get the girl!

The girl, clothes torn, runs out into the street, just as Harry's cab comes cruising by. She runs alongside, pounding on the window.

	<DIALOGUE>

A laser shot narrowly misses her and blasts Harry's side-mirror. HARRY flips the switch, unlocking the passenger door, and waves her in.

She dives in the back and HARRY floors it. The cab screams away as Laser-shots land all around.

CUT TO :SC: POLICE STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The police station is an all-metal building with no windows. A plaque on thr front reads "N.Y. POLICE - 52nd DIVISION".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry's cab pulls up. He gets out, carries the unconscious GIRL up to the front door, and pushes a buzzer.

<DIRECTION>
A buzzer sounds and the door slides open. HARRY carries the GIRL in and heads across the room toward the main desk. As he walks he passes cops using a strange metal detector/vaccuum cleaner to suck dangerous weapons from a pair of suspects. Piles of weapons can be seen in the machine's transparent belly.
</DIRECTION>

Okay, this guy's clean - next.

This futuristic bachelor pad is constructed entirely of brightly coloured molden plastic. Bowling trophies sit on a shelf underneath a neon "Buweiser" clock. The place is a mess.
</DIRECTION>

HARRY carries the GIRL in, pushes the light button to "On", and lays her down on the sofa. As he takes off his jacket he looks down at the unconscious figure - her clothes torn in all the right places. She moans and starts to come to.
