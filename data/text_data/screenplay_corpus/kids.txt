The face of a very pretty young girl with long blond hair. Her face is inches from the CAMERA, the CAMERA is above her, looking down, almost like the POV of the person she's having sex with.

<DIRECTION>
AN EXTREME CLOSEUP OF THE GIRL'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she screams in total agony. Telly and the girl are on the bed having sex. All the lights are on. This scene should look very white and bleached out, very electric and shocking. Everything should be exposed as Telly takes advantage of the virgin girl.

INT. UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRCASE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Telly gently shuts the door. He has a huge smile on his face. He looks down the center of the staircase and spits. He watches his spit fall down till it smacks against the floor. He runs down three flights of stairs as quickly as possible. He jumps down the last four steps and bumps into the side of the wall. He is very happy. He runs down the skinny hallway and smacks the metal mailboxes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE - SIDEWALK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Telly exits the building. CASPER is sitting on a middle step. He is reading a comic book and drinking a 40oz. Bottle of malt liquor. The bottle is wrapped in a brown paper sack. As he sips his drink he laughs at his comic book.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casper is Telly's second half. The two have been best friends since grade school. Casper is small and funny, everyone likes him, he has a quick temper, and he isn't scared to fight someone twice his size. Telly provides Casper with a sense of adolescent wisdom. Casper makes Telly happy; he's a smart ass, he has a strong New York accent, an assortment of tattoos, and crooked teeth. Telly and Casper are always together, They help each other to survive.

</TELLY>
<CASPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long did you fuck her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASPER>
<DIRECTION>
They cross the street, paying no attention to speeding cars. Casper is listening to every word that Telly says. Casper seems much happier than Telly. Telly is laid-back. Casper is hyper as he jumps up and down and claws Telly's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<TELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TELLY>
<CASPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

</DIRECTION>
<CASPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why virgins are the best. I love that smell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASPER>

As they walk down the street, joggers, men in business suits with briefcases, ambulances, and women with baby carriages all pass by.

<CASPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASPER>
<TELLY>

<CASPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you tell her that you loved her?
	</DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</TELLY>
<DIRECTION>
They stop walking. Casper takes the last sip of his beer, then throws it toward an orange trash can. He misses the can and the bottle smashes in the middle of a busy street.

<CASPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASPER>
<TELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TELLY>
<CASPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's no big deal, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASPER>
<TELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.

EXT. NEW YORK SIDEWALK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back in time. Casper is a little boy, age 11. He is walking down the sidewalk with a lunch box and a "Casper the Friendly Ghost" T-shirt. He is wearing his hat on backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Music accompanies this entire episode.
</DIRECTION>
<TELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, one day Casper had a stomachache and he got permission from his teacher to leave school early and go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Casper walks up to a nice middle-class home, it could be in Queens or Brooklyn, it doesn't matter. He pulls out a key and opens the door. He enters his home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASPER'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house is dark. Plastic on all the furniture. A velvet picture of Christ is hanging on the wall in the hallway. Very simple and plain, a generic adobe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casper enters his house and flips on a lightswitch.
</DIRECTION>
<TELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So he walks into his house and hears some strange noises.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TELLY>
<DIRECTION>
The sounds of his mother screaming from upstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<CASPER_S_MOM>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming from upstairs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get away! Get away! Help! You monster! Please help!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASPER_S_MOM>
<DIRECTION>
Casper puts his lunch box down and walks to the first stair to listen to his mother's screams.
</DIRECTION>
<TELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The noises were coming from upstairs. In his parents room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Casper's mom continues to scream from upstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<TELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, this freaked the hell out of Casper. He was just a little kid and he wasn't sure what to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Casper moves off the step and runs into the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<TELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So he ran and got a big knife. The same knife his pops used to cut the turkey on Thanksgiving with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TELLY>
<DIRECTION>
He opens a drawer full of silverware and pulls out a humongous glistening knife. He picks it up, and it shines on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As his mother screams he looks up at the ceiling with the knife in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CASPER_S_MOM>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming from upstairs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop! Please stop! Oooh help!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASPER_S_MOM>
<DIRECTION>
Casper runs up the stairs, he is holding the knife straight out.
</DIRECTION>
<TELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So he heard his mom's screams, and knew that she was in trouble. It sounded like she was getting ready to be killed. Like someone was kicking her in the head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Casper runs down the hall and opens the door to his parents room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What he sees is very shocking. His face becomes extremely animated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casper's mom is on the bed. She is completely naked except for a pair of bright red high heel shoes. In between her legs is a man wearing all black, including a black ski mask and motorcycle boots. He is having sex with Casper's mom. He has her arms pinned down on the bed. He is grunting like a pig.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casper watches for a moment in awe.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_IN_BLACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bitch. You fuckin bitch. Fuckin bitch. Slutty whore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_IN_BLACK>
<DIRECTION>
The man in black slaps Casper's mom hard on her naked ass.
</DIRECTION>
<CASPER_S_MOM>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Stop! Get off me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASPER_S_MOM>
<DIRECTION>
She is struggling to get loose.
</DIRECTION>
<TELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Casper opened the door and he saw some big guy with a ski mask fucking his mother. What a sight for an 11 year old kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Casper runs up to the bed. He climbs on top of the bed with the big knife in the air, all the while the man in black is having sex with his mother. And they don't even notice Casper at first.
</DIRECTION>
<TELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he goes and jumps on his parent's bed. And for a second he just looks and watches.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Casper takes his knife and starts stabbing the guy in black, over and over. His mother is kicking and trying to stop him. All the while, she is screaming outrageously and blood is pouring out.
</DIRECTION>
<TELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you know. Casper loved his mom, he didn't want anything to happen to her. So he started stabbing this guy, over and over. But it was a mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Casper's mom is kicking Casper as he stabs the man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casper is biting his tongue as he stabs the man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man falls off the bed and onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casper's mom is going totally nuts. She is completely naked, with blood all over her body. There is blood all over the sheets. His mom is clawing her face in complete hysterics.
</DIRECTION>
<CASPER_S_MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fuck!!! It's your father!!! We were playing a game you fuck!!! That's your father!!! We were just playing!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASPER_S_MOM>
<DIRECTION>
Casper looks very confused as he looks at his naked mother. He has the knife in his hand, and a little blood on his T-shirt and cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casper's mom continues to yell at him.
</DIRECTION>
<CASPER_S_MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Casper, you fucker!!! Oh, my god!!! Help me God!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASPER_S_MOM>
<DIRECTION>
Casper looks at his mother, then he looks at the dead guy on the floor. He bends down and takes off the mask. It's his father.
</DIRECTION>
<CASPER>
<DIRECTION>
(calmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASPER>
<CASPER_S_MOM>
<DIRECTION>
(crying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fuck. You killed your father!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASPER_S_MOM>
<TELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Casper killed his father. He came home with a stomachache and ended up murdering his pops. It was a very embarrassing thing.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - ON THE FOUNTAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casper and all his friends are passing around the blunt, which by now is almost gone. All that is left is a roach and Casper is sucking on it really hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casper breathes out the smoke and then passes the roach to Hamilton.
</DIRECTION>
<CASPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yo, that weed is mad good.

Casper rubs his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hamilton puffs on the little roach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casper grabs somebody's skateboard and stands on it. He starts rolling around slowly and doing some tricks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other kids continue to smoke. They watch Casper and laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casper is slowly trying to do tricks, but he's so stoned that he just falls off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he skates in front of is friends he doesn't pay any attention to where he's going.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tall HOODLUM with gold front teeth is walking by. He is wearing all Polo and a thick white Fila headband. He is biting down on a chew stick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hoodlum walks by. He has a certain ominous strut. He is looking at the ground as he walks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the chew stick out of his mouth and looks at some girl's ass as she walks by. He makes a little noise with his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the hoodlum walks by, Casper is rolling backward, not paying attention. He rolls into the hoodlum's heels. Casper falls down and laughs. Everyone watching laughs, including Telly who is still sitting with Misha.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casper jumps up and grabs his skateboard. The hoodlum is turned around. Casper walks up to him with a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<CASPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yo, sorry money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASPER>
<DIRECTION>
The hoodlum is a good seven inches taller than Casper. He puts his arms out like he's upset.
</DIRECTION>
<HOODLUM>

Casper throws his skateboard down. He quickly turns around and pulls his pants up. He runs right up to the hoodlum and he looks up at him.

	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
Steven and all the guys run up and surround the hoodlum. They all start screaming taunts. "Fuck 'em up Casper!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casper is inches from the hoodlum. They are both in a fighting stance. Casper keeps pulling his pants up. Casper has a huge smile on his face, like this is his favorite thing in the whole world.
</DIRECTION>
<CASPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sup. Sup.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASPER>

	I'm gonna fuck you up bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASPER>
<DIRECTION>
They are both right about to swing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone in the whole park has turned their attention to the scuffle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All of a sudden, out of nowhere, Harold runs up behind the Hoodlum and with the truck of his skateboard, smashes the guy in the back of the head. A huge thud is heard and the hoodlum just kinda falls forward on his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casper, with a big smile, steps back and kicks the guy in the face as hard as he can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone gets in a big circle around the fallen hoodlum. They're all screaming. Even the girls are screaming. "Fuck 'em up!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harold continues hitting the hoodlum with his skateboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hitting him on the legs and stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casper is jumping up and down on the hoodlum's head.
</DIRECTION>
<CASPER>
<DIRECTION>
(everytime he kicks the guy he says this)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suck my dick! Suck my dick! Suck my dick!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASPER>
<DIRECTION>
All of a sudden, all the skateboarders in the park, including Hamilton and Steven, take their boards and start smashing this guy, over and over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hoodlum is on the ground holding his head, as everyone frantically tries to kill him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The focus should be on the face of the skateboarders. How much they are enjoying this. They continue to pound him, over and over, like animals in on the prey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This should look very scary, as twenty guys try to kill the fallen hoodlum. Even little kids are in the middle, beating the guy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Telly looks up to the sky. He makes a loud noise as he clears his throat, like he's gathering mucus. Then he puts his arms down and stops some of the kids from hitting the hoodlum. His face is completely cracked and bloody. Telly steps over him and spits a huge phlegm wad onto his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casper, still smiling, kicks the guy in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<CASPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suck my dick, Suck my dick. Suck my dick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASPER>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone stops kicking the guy and they all get kinda silent and look at him. He looks completely twisted, bloody, and dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casper bends over, right in his face.

	What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIE>
<TAXI_DRIVER>

	Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier.
