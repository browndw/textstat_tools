	Poet Henry David Thoreau once wrote, "I cannot make my days longer, so I strive to make them better." With this election, we here at Millard also have an opportunity to make our high school days better. During this campaign I have had the opportunity to speak with many of you about your concerns. I spoke with freshman Eliza Ramirez, who told me how alienated she feels from her own homeroom. I spoke with sophomore Reggie Banks, who said his mother works in a cafeteria and can't afford to buy him enough spiral notebooks for his classes. I won't bore you with long- winded promises about all the new and innovative things I will definitely achieve during the year in which it will be my honor and privilege to represent each and every one of you, but I can say that my years of experience on the student council have taught me the three most important attributes the president needs to possess; commitment -

Walt backs away to his seat. Tracy resumes

<TRACY>

	The three most important attributes the president needs to possess are: commitment, qualifications, and experience. I'll add one more; caring. I care about Millard, and I care about each and every one of you, and together we can all make a difference. One of the things I would like to establish is a regular open forum where any student can come and voice their concern about issues we face here at Millard. I and the rest of the student council would then interface with the faculty and staff, so a continuous dialogue would exist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRACY>

Walt whispers to Jim.

Paul awkwardly makes his way to the mike. Though by no means thunderous, his applause clearly exceeds Tracy's. A small cluster of jocks "woof" for him, shaking their fists in the air. Paul manages a weak grin for his buddies.

Tracy shifts in her chair, her smile stiff and forced

Tammy's eyes dart between Lisa and Paul. She shows no emotion, reveals nothing.

The applause quickly dies, and after a moment Paul remembers to look at the white paper in his hand. He speaks in a barely audible monotone, never once glancing up.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>

	As many of you know I broke my leg pretty bad thi3 year and the experience has made me reevaluate what I want to do with my life and that is help people when you think about it a school is more than a school it's our second home where we spend all cur time and grow as individuals and a community but is our school everything it could be I want our school to reach its true potential that is why I am running for president.

The only person it matters to is the one who gets elected. The same pathetic charade happens every year, and everyone makes the same pathetic promises just so they can put it on their transcripts to get into college. So vote for me, because I don't even want to go to college, and I don't care, and as president I won't do anything. The only promise I make is that if elected I will immediately dismantle the student government, so that none of us will ever have to sit through one of these stupid assemblies again!

</TRACY>
<DIRECTION>
THE MONITOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
displays a DIGITIZED PHOTO of the Millard yearbook staff. DAVE NOVOTNY peers proudly from behind two of the taller students. A CURSOR in the shape of tiny SCISSORS makes a small circle around Dave's face. Suddenly, the cursor turns into a tiny HAND and drags Dave's dislodged head into the TRASH.

Tracy concentrates as she deftly controls the mouse.

:SC: INT. MILLARD HIGH HALLWAY -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tracy is heading down the hall toward the exit when she rounds a corner and, suddenly deeply troubled, sees that
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER NEW "WHO CARES?" BANNER has come loose on an upper corner and is drooping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tracy puts down her things and JUMPS up to slap the corner back into place. Satisfied, she turns away. But then - SHOOP! The banner fights back, peeling even further from the wall. Tracy prepares for battle.
</DIRECTION>

:SC: INT. YEARBOOK OFFICE NIGHT

Tracy enters and grabs a long aluminum STRAIGHT-EDGE.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HALLWAY NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing on an overturned GARBAGE CAN and wielding the straight-edge, Tracy tries to smooth the banner. But she's not holding the ruler flat against the wall and -- RIP! -- she slices the banner lengthwise. Now the plastic garbage can begins to buckle. Struggling to retain her balance, Tracy accidentally hooks the banner and as she TUMBLES yanks the whole thing down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Overcome with anger and frustration, she thrashes around on the ground and TEARS UP what remains of her banner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAUL METZLER smiles down at Tracy from his poster across the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tracy looks up at it. Instantly she is on her feet, lunging for the poster. She jumps up, TEARS it down, and RIPS Paul's head into pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood issues from a thin paper cut on one hand. Tracy regards it at first without comprehending, then raises it to her mouth. While sucking her wound, her gaze falls on --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER SMILING PAUL mocking her pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE FROM WAY DOWN THE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hurricane Tracy begins a savage assault on the fragile coast of Millard High. Paul's campaign posters fill the air, shredded to pieces by the powerful winds of jealousy and rage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIME DISSOLVE --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
to Tracy even farther down the hall, still jumping, still ripping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACK FROM OVERHEAD - THE HALLWAY FLOOR - where a thousand bits of Paul lie scattered -- a grinning mouth here, an eye there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TILT UP finally to Tracy, sweating, panting. She finishes ripping a poster and looks to find another. But there are no more Paul posters: she has destroyed them all. Tracy raises her hands and sees they are streaked with Blood.
</DIRECTION>

:SC: INT. GIRLS ' BATHROOM NIGHT

Tracy is at the sink, washing away the blood. She pats her hands dry with paper towels. The gravity of what she's done now sinks in, and she panics.

	This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.

You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.

</JIM>
<TRACY>

	And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.

	Hello, students, I'm Clark Naylor of Joslyn's Educational Resources. It's election day, and how you vote will make a big difference in the activities, events, and perhaps even the policies of your school. Over the past few days or weeks, you've heard candidates for the various offices make their speeches and tell you where they stand. You've probably seen their posters. Maybe you've even had a chance to speak with them personally.
