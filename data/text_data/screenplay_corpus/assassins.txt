EXT. PLAZA COLON/INT. BANK - DAY (1980)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK and WHITE. The past was so clear-cut. Or was it?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tiled roofs, the stark white stucco of a colonial town square. Black iron bars at a bank. A briefcase carried in a man's hand. A sniper's rifle being assembled. Thick blocks of hundred dollar bills. Placed in the briefcase. A man's teeth as he smiles grimly at the sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sounds over a SUBJECTIVE VIEW. The BRIEFCASE SNAPS SHUT. A VAULT DOOR SLAMS. RUBBER SOLES WALK a tiled floor. Ahead, brilliant, white light suffuses the exit. Like the way people describe near-death eperiences. We're either going outdoors or over to the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long rifle silencer juts from a window. We see the shooter FROM BEHIND, a view OVER his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the bank, the man crushes out a cigarette. A pause and a DEEP EXHALE as we step outside into a flood of light. In answer, the LOW PUFF of a SILENCER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only the plaza pigeons notice. As they take flight...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man lies dead on the cobblestones. And as we look UP TOWARD the window, there's nothing there. The pigeons wheel above the plaza. We FOLLOW, finally losing them to the sky. SLOWLY that sky BLEEDS from gray to blue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And as we PAN BACK DOWN...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MARSH - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're no longer in a plaza, but in a vast marshland. Not in the past, but in the present. The sun sparkles over the water. Two silhouetted figures move past in the dis tance. One walks a little behind the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man in front is KETCHAM. He wears an expensive suit and Gucci loafers. He swats at flies nearly too small to see, curses under his breath at the calf-deep mud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man behind is RATH. He moves easier; the flies don't seem to bother him at all. His jeans are tucked into rubber boots. He holds a silenced .22 at his side. Like it was part of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They continue until one of Ketcham's shoes is sucked off by the mud.
</DIRECTION>
<KETCHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw-shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Ketcham balances on one leg, holding his silk-socked foot in the air. The shoe disappears, filled with mud.
</DIRECTION>
<KETCHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I first saw you I wasn't scared. I was just wondering why you were dressed like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(re: mud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KETCHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Ketcham pulls off his sock, sticks his foot in the mud. He smiles. It feels good. He pulls off the other shoe, tosses it. Grabbing for the other sock, he loses his balance and sits down in the mud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath waits patiently as Ketcham laughs at the absurdity of it all. Ketcham finally pulls the sock off, then stands, digs his toes into the dark, wet earth.
</DIRECTION>
<KETCHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This feels good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KETCHAM>
<DIRECTION>
They move on, Rath still a little behind. Ketcham enjoys the new sensation, but after a bit, the pleasure fades.
</DIRECTION>
<KETCHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's twisted, but I'm honored. You're the best. It means at least they're still afraid of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KETCHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Ketcham looks ahead as they close on a grove of trees. He knew they were going somewhere, but it's a chilling realization all the same.
</DIRECTION>
<KETCHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew this day would come. But this morning, I could've sworn I was going to live forever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KETCHAM>
<DIRECTION>
They're only a few steps away from the first of the trees. Desperation begins to creep into Ketcham's voice.
</DIRECTION>
<KETCHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any chance of you telling me who the Contractor was? Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off no answer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least tell me how much I was worth. A dime? Two?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KETCHAM>
<DIRECTION>
They're into the trees. Ketcham doesn't need to be told. He stops just where a dead branch hangs from a tree.
</DIRECTION>
<KETCHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KETCHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Rath uses the .22 to gesture Ketcham to the left. Ketcham gives the branch a wistful smile. Leaving his last hope behind, he takes a few steps over.
</DIRECTION>
<KETCHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We both play the game, Rath. Sooner or later the wheel turns. For everybody. Who's got your bullet? What kind of shoes'll you be wearing when the day comes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KETCHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Rath's answer is to move directly behind him. Ketcham is finally showing his fear.
</DIRECTION>
<KETCHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever the contract is, I'll double it. Just say you couldn't find me. Buy yourself some good karma.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KETCHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Ketcham can't see, but he almost senses it as Rath raises the silenced .22 to the back of his head.
</DIRECTION>
<KETCHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God. Don't pull yet, not yet. Christ, I've done some bad things in my time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(trembling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't die like this. Not like a mark. I'm not a mark!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KETCHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Ketcham begins to just cry. Nothing left to say. A man in mourning for himself. But Rath is not unaffected, not without his own peculiar version of mercy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keeping the .22 steady, an inch behind Ketcham's head, Rath reaches into his jacket. He pulls out a second, nearly identical silenced .22. Ketcham looks down, curious as the clip drops into the mud at his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath, ready to fire at any sign of trouble, gently eases the gun into Ketcham's hand. Ketcham looks down, smiles. It's his gun, his dignity.
</DIRECTION>
<KETCHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, old friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hefts it; knows)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One in the chamber.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KETCHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, so Rath can see, Ketcham raises the .22, sets the tip of the silencer against the side of his head. He squints at the sun, the last thing he'll ever see.
</DIRECTION>
<KETCHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last few years I've been looking for a sunrise. Maybe a sunset's better.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Rath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KETCHAM>
<DIRECTION>
The sun disappears over the horizon. Ketcham squeezes the trigger. The SILENCER WHISPERS and he crumples, begins to sink into the mud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath lowers his gun. He takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly, standing alone in the middle of nowhere. We TILT DOWN TO an EXTREME CLOSEUP of blood in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath closes the curtains. There is a makeshift office on the desk. A cell phone is connected to a lap-top computer. The prompt flashes epectantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the coffee table, we see the dismantled .22, spread clean on a white towel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath stands at a window looking out at the city. He leans forward until his forehead rests against the window. He closes his eyes, enjoying the cool of the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Then he looks to the street below. For just an instant, he's wondering what it would be like to fall. Breaking from his reverie, Rath steps to the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits, regards the computer with loathing, then types in a long access code sequence. He waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a few moments, a line of dialogue appears. Rath is communicating with someone... The Contractor.
</DIRECTION>
<Contractor>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where have you been, Robert?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Contractor>
<Rath>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sick. The flu.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rath>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTRACTOR'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTREME CLOSEUP OF eyes, hands, mouth, computer, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<Contractor>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Contractor>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO RATH.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care what you believe. I want out. I've had it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<Contractor>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been sitting on a prime contract.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Contractor>
<DIRECTION>
But these days, something else is on Rath's mind.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you, you sonuvabitch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<Rath>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Send the file. I'll have the estimate tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rath>
<Contractor>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm worried about you, Robert.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Contractor>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<Rath>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rath>
<Contractor>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. You are my #1.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Contractor>
<DIRECTION>
The screen goes blank. A beat and the word "TRANSMITTING" appears. Rath stands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A slimline PRINTER HUMS, starts to reproduce a newspaper photo of ALAN BRANCH. Strong. Hard eyes which Rath studies a moment, then circles. As a second sheet feeds, Rath isn't that interested.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREETS - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mist fills the air. As night comes on, Rath walks. He has no real purpose at the moment. And the crowds don't magically seem to get out of his way. He watches them laughing, talking, hurrying this way and that. Rath's a loner. An outsider. Life moves around him, but he's not part of it. At least not this version. The mist turns to darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MALL - UPSCALE WOMEN'S CLOTHING STORE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath pauses, his eye caught by a scene inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dowager berates a female CLERK. The Clerk takes it stoically, nodding, placating. Huffing and puffing, the dowager heads back to the racks. The Clerk watches her in easperation. No one deserves this kind of abuse. Rath is going to continue when, on an impulse, he decides to enter the store instead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UPSCALE WOMEN'S CLOTHING STORE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath steps inside, begins to look around. The Clerk sighs to herself. Another customer and it's almost closing time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dowager jams the dress back on the rack and it fallsto the floor. She ignores it, but Rath doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you dropped something.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The dowager gives him a look.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you better hang it back up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
And it isn't a question. The woman looks shocked, then gruffly hanging the dress back up, hurries out of the store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tired, a bit apprehensive, the Clerk gives Rath a moment before joining him.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I help you, sir? We're just closing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
Rath suddenly wonders what the hell he's doing here.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm looking for something. I, I'm not sure what.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
(knows the routine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Birthday? Anniversary?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
Rath shakes his head. There's something sad about him, but she misreads it.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A fight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
Rath starts to say something, but then stops. She takes it as a yes to her question.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said something you regret?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. It takes Rath a moment to confess:
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Regret... Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
She thinks, decides on a way to get rid of him.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CLERK Are you really sorry?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Rath nods. He is. Finding what she's looking for, she holds up an elegant red velvet dress.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring this home and she'll say she's sorry. But it's expensive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
That price tag should get him out of here. A beat. There's something oddly appealing about the moment. It's hard to say, but Rath is charmed. Then, almost shyly...
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's about your size. Would you?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
The Clerk is caught off guard by this request. She is all alone and it is getting late. Still, it'd be nice to end the day with a sale.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me two minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MALL - UPSCALE WOMEN'S CLOTHING STORE - NIGHT Rath stares out the window. There's something mournful almost haunting about him. An old soul to be sure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UPSCALE WOMEN'S CLOTHING STORE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath scans the empty store, then checks his watch. He's lost his mind. As he heads for the door, the Clerk steps out. The transformation is stunning. Rath stops short, takes in the beauty of it all.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<RATH>
<DIRECTION>
(soft, gentle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's perfect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
She can't believe it.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll write it up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
She steps to a desk, scribbles out a receipt. Rath notices an open textbook, several lines have beenhighlighted.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	College?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think I'm too old?... My daughter says I'm too old to go to school... I just sit in right now. I don't have the money yet. But I don't want to spend the rest of my life selling somebody else's dresses. I mean, you're never too old to have dreams, right? To start over?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
Rath looks away, can't hold her gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
An awkward beat. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should I wrap it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Rath nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE as she finishes tying the box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steps out. Her smile fades as she sees he's gone. The sale is lost.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
She plops the bow on the counter, then notices a wad of$100 bills sticking out from her textbook.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls them along with a note written on the back of a store business card. She reads it. INSERT CARD: Your daughter is wrong. She steps to the window, looks out. Rath's lonely figure exits to the street outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside it is raining. Rath is at the window looking at a faed photo of his net target, Alan Branch. On the street below a fire truck and an ambulance race along -- SIRENS BLARING. Rath crosses to his bed. He reviews photos, scribbles notes as he scans articles, one head- line: "Billionaire Recluse Linked to Financing of Central American Death Squads." A photo of a brother. An obituary mentions "car accident."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath sketches a diagram on a legal pad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Satisfied with what he's got, he calls up a box on his computer screen and dials an Internet number. A beat and he enters the access code.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath picks up the photos of Branch. Studies the eyes -- circled, the only thing that matters. They're cruel eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The network comes on line. Rath takes a brath, lets it out slow. Types:

	I have my bid.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An American Airlines 757 approaches right to left, descends toward the runway. INT. AMERICAN AIRLINES 757 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Staring pensively out the window, Rath barely notices as the plane touches down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIRPORT - RUNWAY 8 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone else is here. Left to right, an Avianca Airlines jumbo 747 glides silently down, its landing gear reaching out like talons. As it touches down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AMERICAN TERMINAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath walks, blends in perfectly with the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tired travelers trudge, clogs the concourse. But one man moves briskly. Singular of purpose. Dressed stylishly, we don't quite see his face. He's BAIN, a presence, and for whatever reason, no one ever seems to be in his way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LUGGAGE CAROUSEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath reaches down, picks up a case.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CUSTOMS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glass booth. A similar case is checked off. The CUSTOMS OFFICER looks up at Bain, who we still only see in glimpses. And reflections.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER>

	Is your visit business or pleasure?

Rath gets into a hotel courtesy van, blending in with everyone else.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seen FROM BEHIND, Bain cuts a swath, raises a hand for a cab which immediately scoots forward to meet him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pretty, but with a sense of foreboding. It isn't big enough for the two of them. Bain's cab moves briskly along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OAKWOOD CEMETERY - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sky glows red. The taxi waits, parked just inside the gates. In the distance, Bain moves among...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEADSTONES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are rows of chairs set up. A fresh grave has been dug. Preps for a service tomorrow. Perfectly at home, Bain wanders as though looking for something specific.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old CARETAKER in a pair of worn coveralls watches from a mausoleum. His voice dies on the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<CARETAKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARETAKER>
<DIRECTION>
Bain turns. It's our first good look. His features are strong, refined. He looks like a fine young man. He's not. He smiles warmly.
</DIRECTION>
<BAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm looking for someone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAIN>

Turning, Bain heads off. The Caretaker just shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DRUG STORE - MAGIC HOUR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM OUTSIDE we see Rath move down the aisles. Selecting an odd array of items. Rolls of gauze. A box of plaster of paris. A sling... He pays and exits onto the busy sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OAKWOOD CEMETERY - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A crowd of onlookers. Police lines. Private securityguards control entrance into the service area itself. The media are here in full force.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
SECURITY TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seated, a "Security Systems" tech checks a name against a driver's license with Rath's picture. It carries the name Paul Gray -- the name Rath typed into the computer. He looks up and hands the license back to Rath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he turns we see that under his jacket, his right arm is in a cast, in a sling close to his side. He moves past a hearse and several limousines as he joins other latecomers who are walking up a hill towards a group at a gravesite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRAVESIDE - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As a soloist finishes the last notes of "Ave Maria." The PRIEST invites those assembled to stand. All do except for Alan Branch in his wheelchair. He is ten years older than the photo -- now frail but with the same eyes. His BODYGUARDS stand on either side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Rath move into position across the grave from Branch. Rath removes a piece of white tape from his cast, eposes a barrel opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Priest raises his hands, all heads bow. Branch's. Rath's -- though his eyes stay on his mark.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
As the Priest continues, Rath twists his body slightly, taking aim with the .22 which must be inside the cast. He's got a clean shot at the back of Branch's head.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	shall not die, but have everlasting life.

Water pelts as sprinklers surge to life on all sides of the service area. Bad timing. Or is it? All heads turn. Several people move to get away from the spray.

It is Bain sighting along the barrel of his silenced rifle.

TELESCOPIC POV OF BRANCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in his wheelchair. TIGHT ON a spot above his heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO GRAVESITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath spins back to look toward Branch. The old man's head is still bowed in prayer. Or is it. Crimson spreads out across his white shirt. He's been shot through the heart. As one of the Bodyguards realizes...
</DIRECTION>
<BODYGUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's been shot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODYGUARD>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd panics -- people running everywhere. Rath spots a young caretaker. Wearing coveralls. Nonchalantly heading off beyond a mausoleum, wheeling a trash can full of leaves. It's Bain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath turns his body to aim. In all the confusion, no one notices a .22 shell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reacts as a BULLET drills the trash can. Pulling a sniper's rifle from the can, he runs, dives as another BULLET RICOCHETS off the tombstone just in front of him.h)0*0*0* BODYGUARDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All this has attracted their attention. Drawing guns, they charge after Bain. He comes up FIRING silently. The Bodyguards go down. But now police are on the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stands and tries to run. Again, he's pinned down as TWO BULLETS blossom granite around him. He scans the crowd, has no idea who's shooting at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CEMETERY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And a small army of POLICEMEN are advancing, service revolvers everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop it! Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Bain makes one last attempt to move. A BULLET nearly takes off his ear. Making a strategic decision, he tosses out his rifle and waits for the cops. In an instant, they've surrounded him. They pin him to the ground -- find his .22 pistol and handcuff him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RATH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sidesteps for a clear shot; Police are everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Move, you sonuvabitch. Give me a line. Goddamnit, get out of the way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
Cursing again under his breath, he won't take the chance of hitting a cop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAIN

As they hustle him along, he ducks and weaves, perfectly aware of how to take advantage of his human shield. For an instant, he sees a man. Fifty yards away. Silhouetted by the low sun. Watching. Bain squints against the light, can't make him out, but knows it's Rath. He ducks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CEMETERY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Far ahead Rath sees Bain being frisked against a police cruiser. The cops handcuff him, shove him in the back. His rifle goes in the front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a moment the cruiser rolls out, led by a second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath hurries across the cemetery, headed for...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY - UPPER ROADWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath climbs into his rent-a-car. He releases two Velcro strips and the cast neatly separates -- revealing his silenced .22 held comfortably in his hand. He slaps in a new clip and ROARS forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INTERSECTION - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath eyeballs the street. Crowded with people and cars. The police cruisers are gone.
</DIRECTION>

Rath continues, reaches under the seat for a portable police band RADIO. He switches it ON. Garbage until:

As the DISPATCHER ROGERS they got the message, Rath spins the wheel, hangs a right to try and catch up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two police cars race by. Bain is in the back seat of the second one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE CRUISER - STREETS - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bain sits in the back seat. Handcuffed. Separated from the two cops up front by a steel mesh screen. The sniper's rifle is in the front seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second cruiser is up ahead, leading the way. As city blocks whizz past, Bain stares back over his shoulder. The street is empty behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bain stares ahead. Silent. Behind his back, he grips his left hand with his right thumb. Slowly, he pulls his left thumb out of its socket. The digit folds unnaturally into his palm, as Bain slides the cuff over his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RENT-A-CAR - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath turns onto Victoria. No police cruiser in sight. Rath turns west, GUNS it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE CRUISER - STREETS - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Speeding along. COP #1 looks back at Bain who stares out the side window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Cop #1 looks ahead -- BOOM! Bain rears back with both feet and kicks out the side window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before either Cop can even react, Bain reaches through the rear side window and through the driver's side window. As he wrenches back on Cop #2's neck...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CRUISER SKIDS out of control. It slams into a row of parked cars, straightens for an instant before it cart- wheels end over end, lands on its roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second cruiser starts to break as they realize what's happened behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A silent moment before Bain pulls himself out the side window of the wreck. He has blood trickling from his hairline.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bain reaches into the cruiser for his rifle. Cops #1 and #2 hang upside-down in their seats. Cop #2's neck is twisted -- broken. Groggy, Cop #1 is still alive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bain lies flat on his stomach, aims back through the window at Cruiser Two which has turned and is speeding back the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

EXT. WRECKAGE - LATE DAY

<DIRECTION>
Bain looks at the wreckage for a beat and disappears between two buildings -- the rifle at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RENT-A-CAR - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath slows as he nears the wreckage. Bain is nowhere in sight. Rath stops. Holding his .22, Rath leans low out of the sedan for a quick look. Four dead cops, but no Bain. Just a discarded pair of coveralls on the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath scans the deserted streets. It's a little spooky. Then, a shadow moving. Across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath gets out of his rent-a-car, .22 in hand. As we hear a DISTANT SIREN, Rath crosses to a chainlink fence, peers through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our hearts are in our throats as, without warning, a big watch dog lunges at the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Rath is unphased. He gets back in his car, continues driving and scanning for any sign of life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREETS - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs a left, coasts, then hangs a right. A block ahead, a yellow cab waits at a red light. Rath looks a little more determined as it gives him an idea. A police car races by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. YELLOW CAB/INTERSECTION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DRIVER's eyes look to the rearview as headlights loom. He winces as his cab is bumped from behind. EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath gets out of the sedan and the Driver out of the cab. As they converge on the bumper...
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There better not even be a scratch, you dumb sonuva --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Before the Driver can finish his point, Rath knocks him cold with a short, powerful punch. He catches the man, drags him over to the safety of the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath relieves the Driver of his cap, sticks two hundred bucks in his hand and hops into the cab. The light turns green and he's off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. YELLOW CAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cap on, Rath is behind the wheel. He turns up the CB, hoping to get lucky. CALLS CRACKLE, then...
</DIRECTION>
<DISPATCH>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's near Adams and Nine? I got a fare going to the airport. Rath picks up the mic, pulls the Driver ID from the dash, checks the cab's ID number.

</DISPATCH>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is 501. I got it.

Rath clicks off, shoves the ID under the seat. Sticking the .22 down between his legs, he rolls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ADAMS AND NINE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An empty payphone on the corner. Not a soul in sight. The Yellow CAB pulls up, IDLES at the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. YELLOW CAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath holds the .22 with one hand, the door handle with the other. Tense as a tiger ready to spring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A couple exit from a dingy bar across the street. Rath looks over, frowns as they start toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In that instant, the opposite passenger door opens and someone gets in the back. As the door slams shut, Rath checks the rearview mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Bain. He carries his rifle wrapped in his jacket. For the first time we realize that the front and back of the cab are separated by bullet-proof glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An awkward silence as Rath slides the .22 back between his legs. Bain looks at his eyes in the rearview. (Bain never really saw him at the cemetery.)

Rath studies Bain in the rearview. Bain stares out the side window, chuckling to himself, a thin trickle of blood on his temple.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're cut.
	</DIALOGUE>

Bain touches the blood, looks at it a bit surprised.

Rath slaps the cab in park, looks over his shoulder at Bain. Only we see Rath grip the .22.

Bain almost finds it funny. He opens the door to get out. Rath faces forward. He'll shoot him when he does.
</DIRECTION>
<BAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Bain has one leg out when he looks back, sees the ID is missing from the dash. An odd beat as Bain wonders.

<DIRECTION>
Bain looks to Rath's eyes in the rearview. It's now all the confirmation he needs.
</DIRECTION>
<BAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cojones de Dios. Robert Rath.

The cab rocks as both men draw their guns. Bain is poised at the door; Rath leans back across the front seat. They draw down on each other despite the glass. Bain looks like he'll make a run for it, but then...

Moving like lightning, Bain slides, reaches the RIFLE through the right rear passenger window and FIRES.

Rath cuts hard back across the yellow lines. The cab slides, slams into the side of a bus traveling the same direction.

The white of Rath's computer screen.

Rath types, calls up a file. A chess game sets up in four neat rows. A line reads: Game Started May 5, 1980. The pieces move, accompanied by COMPUTER VOICE notation of the move and the date they were made. Rath studies the screen.

A live cat with the same eyes. She watches as a kid's remote control dump truck whirs past her. In the truck bed, a bowl of tuna fish. Pearl chases. Her pride stops her. She waits, pounces as the truck backs up. Pearl wins. As she eats...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Electra sets down a remote control, kneels to watch Pearl eat. A surveillance genius, an "information assassin," Electra depends on smarts and intuition to succeed in a dangerous world. Like most geniuses, she's a free spirit.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmm. Hungry Pearl.

Electra steps over to check on the progress of a coffee machine. Almost done.

EXT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

At the base of three massive transmit towers. Two stories, eight apartments. We see Electra enter her second floor living room. In the apartment directly below we see a young couple (JENNIFER & BOB) fighting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like the control booth of a low-rent nextwork television show. TV's of various size, make and quality are stacked and set in a semi-circle around an overstuffed chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Electrical cables and bundles of fiber optical cable are duct-taped to the walls. Some disappear through holes punched in the floor, others the ceiling. They hang like vines in a jungle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Electra settles into her chair. Flicks a remote. The CD PLAYER KICKS IN SOME MUSIC. The first two TVs show empty apartments. A third -- an old woman rolling out dough. The view is wide-angle, from above. Just like a cooking show.

Bob exits the apartment, slamming the door on his way out. Electra switches all the TVs to shots of Jennifer. She watches, listens to her cry.

From inside, the doors open at the lobby level. A man and a woman with a white fur coat step inside.

Backed in a corner, Electra stares at a veritable wall of fur. She doesn't like it. Setting down the port-a- pet, she reaches into her duffel for what looks like a canister of breath spray.

Remy hangs up, motions to his men to follow. As the Dutch move away, we RACK FOCUS back to a man in the b.g.

It's Rath. Looking absolutely non-descript. He waits till they're almost out of sight before following. Rath scans faces as he moves. Someone else may be here as well.

UNITED TERMINAL EXIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dutch exit. Rath's about to follow when he spots a young man turning away to a cash machine. Bain?

Drawing the .22, Rath closes the gap, spins him. The young man, holding his cash, turns into the barrel. It's not Bain and in an instant the gun is gone. Rath is shaken, but nearly as much as the young man. Rath moves on.

The elevator stops at nine. As the Dutch step off, Bain slyly slips "something" into Remy's jacket pocket. We see, but we're not quite sure what.

The Janitor rushes out. The office is empty. A beat and Rath enters. Tucking his cell phone (he made the call) into his pocket, he takes a seat at the terminal.

Here comes Bain. Resolute, but excited at what's about to happen. He passes the couple. They don't see him or they don't care. But as Bain gets a few steps past...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wheels, raises the SILENCED .22 and FIRES. The couple crumple, both head shots. He drags them into a stairwell.

Bain leans over the bodies of the attractive couple. Amazingly, he relieves them both of silenced 9mm pistols. What the hell's going on?

Bain steps to the middle of the hall. Watching several doors at once, he takes out a cellular phone, punches in a number, then hits send.

A very LOUD BEEPING sounds! After a confused moment, Remy reaches into his pocket, pulls out the slim BEEPER Bain deposited there.

They barely have time to exchange a look before the room door blasts open and Bain enters, both the .22 and one of the 9mm's BLAZING.

The Dutch try to return fire, but Bain has them. As he EMPTIES both GUNS...

Sudden fear washes over Electra. Flipping down her sun- glasses, she grabs her duffel bag, picks up Pearl, pulls the disc. But as she turns to the door...

SLAM! It bursts open and she's staring right at a silenced .22. Rath is here, quite obviously there to kill her. But maybe surprised she's a woman.

Electra's jacket -- in haste forgotten -- draped over a chair.

Rifling through it, he finds the photos Electra had of Pearl. Bain flips through them. Nothing, but Pearl. Inside, outside. But Bain flips back one. Pearl outside. Bain's finger jabs down on something in the background. Three TV transmit towers. Bain strides to the window, looks out...

Electra moves to slow down, but at the last second she accelerates, rear ends the car ahead. Electra is braced, but Rath slams the dash.

Electra takes the keys, leaps out of the car. Grabbing the porta-pet, she dashes across the median. Rath is quickly after her.

Electra nears the bus which is taking on the last of its passengers. As she looks back over her shoulder, she slams into a man, drops the porta-pet.

Rath is closing. There's no time. Acting on survival instincts, Electra leaps onto the bus. It's away just as Rath arrives.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHAIN HOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mustang drives up. Rath is at the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHAIN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Electra enters ahead of Rath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sets her bag down, lets Pearl out of the porta-pet. Feeling like a prisoner, she sits in a chair in the corner. Pearl jumps up in her lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath gets a quick feel for the room. After checking the view out the window, he draws the curtains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath takes off his jacket. Pulling off his shoulder holster, he sets the rig on the coffee table, then sits in a couch opposite Electra. The gun is halfway between the two. Electra does her best to be nonchalant, but she's well aware of the fact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
May be the very first time we've seen Rath rela. Pearl jumps to the carpet, pads her way toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pearl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
Ignoring her owner, Pearl leaps up, settles into Rath's lap. As he scratches her ears...
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
Electra snaps her fingers, but PEARL just closes her eyes, begins to PURR. Electra is not happy about this.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She likes me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She likes dead fish, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
As Rath looks down at the cat, Electra looks at the gun, measuring the distance with her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you call yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Robert Rath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, sure. Call me Electra...7 F So, are you one of them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Used to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(checks watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Retired.

</RATH>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon me if I don't believe you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I was going to kill you, you'd be dead already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
She pretends to look away, but as Rath looks down at Pearl, Electra lunges for the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He never moves or even blinks an eye. He just watches as she struggles a moment to free the .22 from its holster. She realizes, suspects the worst.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? It's not loaded?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's loaded.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could shoot you. I could be 500 miles away by the time they find you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
Electra keeps the gun on him, but can't shake the feeling he's got the upper hand. A long silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath scratches Pearl's ears.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it. She doesn't like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
PEARL begins to PURR.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Afraid you'll hit the cat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
Rath sets Pearl down, looks back to Electra. Waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without warning she starts squeezing off ROUNDS. A LAMP EXPLODES on one side of Rath. Two tufts of stuffing erupt from the couch on the other side. Rath doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
(steps forward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think letting me get this gun was a mistake, don't you? You think I'm afraid. Don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
She FIRES just over his head; the round digs the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know shit about me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're wrong. I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
A final step, she levels the gun at Rath's face.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was supposed to be a good day. A payday. Forty grand. I was going to get Pearl a boyfriend. Now two people are dead. I'm almost dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm in way over my head, Rath. I just want out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
For the first time really, she looks into his eyes. Her hand begins to tremble. The gun barrel shakes.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have the gun. The keys are on the dresser. Go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
Electra covers Rath as she steps over to the dresser, scoops up the keys. Her next words are more to reassure herself than to convince Rath.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have a social security number, a driver's license. I barely remember my real name. I'm a ghost; I can disappear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found you. So did he.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want my life back. Please, that's all I want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
Rath shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
Electra's finger tightens on the trigger. Suddenly, jerking her arm left, she FIRES a wild shot. A CRASH as a cheap print is obliterated by the bullet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Electra lowers the gun limply to her side, lets it drop to the carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to be alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't spent this much time with someone in years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
?PNear tears, Electra moves blindly for the bathroom, Pearl at her heel. As Electra closes the door behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither have I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
He closes his eyes, listens as we hear her begin to CRY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her back to the door, Electra slides slowly to the floor as she cries. Hugging her knees to her chest, it gets worse. A lonely, desolate moment. As PEARL MEWS...
</DIRECTION>

EXT. CITYSCAPE/INT. PAYPHONE - NIGHT

A twinkling panorama. We PAN ACROSS TO a computer screen. A cursor blinks to life as...
</DIRECTION>
<Contractor>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What went wrong, Miguel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Contractor>
<DIRECTION>
We're at a payphone booth. Bain has hooked his laptop into the payphone wiring.

<Bain>

	Nothing. I retired the buyers. And the seller.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Bain>
<Contractor>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The disc?

</Contractor>
<Bain>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rath has it. He's a difficult mark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Bain>
<Contractor>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rath isn't the mark. THE DISC.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Contractor>
<DIRECTION>
Bain is taken aback by this response. He's not used to being criticized.
</DIRECTION>
<Bain>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Bain>
<DIRECTION>
A long pause. Even Bain notices. The Contractor is never this reticent. Finally...
</DIRECTION>
<Contractor>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had your chance. The contract has been reassigned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Contractor>
<BAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?! No lo puedo creer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Bain is in a rage as he types...
</DIRECTION>
<Bain>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you.

</Bain>
<Contractor>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's no way to talk to a lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Contractor>
<BAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care what you are --

Bain hits the repeat key. "Fuck you's" flash across the screen. As the Contractor logs off, Bain slams his fist against the glass of the booth.

INT. CHAIN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Rath is at his desk conversing with the Contractor. Electra must still be holed up in the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<Rath>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have the disc.

</Rath>
<Contractor>

<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. CHAIN HOTEL - BATHROOM - NIGHT Freshly showered, Electra looks better. Drying her hair, she sees that Pearl is peering into the toilet.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many times have I told you?

Pearl paws down the trip handle. The water swirls. As she leans down to drink...

<DIRECTION>
INT. CHAIN HOTEL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath watches the late news. Troubled, he holds the disc. The bathroom door opens and Electra emerges. She watches over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did they say about the dead guys at the Hyatt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>

<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were C.I.A. Or Interpol.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
Rath CLICKS OFF the SET as the "Weather" comes on. He considers the disc. Rath has a hunch, but wonders if he really wants to know.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's on this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's encrypted. Breaking the code on my laptop could take two, maybe three hundred years.

	I thought you were a genius.

(re: disc)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish I had an insight, but it was all anonymous. Just an intercepted satellite transmission.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
Rath knows that in this case, ignorance is bliss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath stands, goes into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Electra steps over to the bed. The blanket has been "turned-down." Two chocolate mints rest on the triangle.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's only one bed. I guess you picked up on that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
Rath exits the bathroom, rolling two towels together.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want the couch?

</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
Rath sets the roll on the floor. He switches on a ceiling light directly over it. Electra watches, under- stands, but teases.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that, a trick of the trade? So you don't get too comfortable?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

Rath reenters the bathroom; Electra can't help but smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath sits on the toilet seat and looks at his reflection in the mirror. He's not quite sure he knows who he's looking at. Sensing someone else, he looks down to where Pearl stares up at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHAIN HOTEL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Electra is in bed. The lights on her side of the room are off. Rath passes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He kicks off his shoes, sits on the floor. He sets the .22 down, stops short. Electra has set one of the "turn -down" chocolates on his towel. Rath picks it up. He lies on his back, stares at the ceiling. On her side, Electra faces the other way. As Rath unwraps the chocolate...
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?

Electra behind the wheel, in sunglasses and a kerchief. Rath in the passenger seat as they pull up to the curb.
</DIRECTION>

	Follow our plan. And if I don't show...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. Split!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
Rath barely nods. Reassuring a woman is a skill he never had. He takes the laptop from the back, casts about the front seat for something he can't find. Electra holds up the disc. He reaches, but she doesn't give it to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In ten minutes you'll have two million dollars and no reason to come back. I ditched you. I really didn't know you that well at the time, but who knows, maybe you hold it against me and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>

Rath gently crosses her lips with two fingers. Then, with absolute finality:
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Partners.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him the disc. Rath gets out of the car. Electra watches as he disappears, swallowed by the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>

	Be careful... Partner.

</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
Electra drives on.

Carrying the laptop, wearing sunglasses, Rath boards a northbound monorail. The doors shut and it glides away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET BELOW MONORAIL - DAY

<DIRECTION>
As the monorail moves along above, the Mustang follows below. Her eyes looking up, Electra nearly rear ends a car slowing for a left turn. As she swerves around it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MONORAIL CAR - DAY

Rath sits, his back to the window. Turning on the computer, he inserts the disc. A list of file names scroll across the screen.

Two tracks run parallel. The northbound train slows as it nears a southbound. Reaching a station, the two trains stop directly across from each other.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two facing doors open. Rath stands, partly concealed behind one. A courier behind the other. He holds up an open briefcase. Inside: 20 stacks of banded $1000 bills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath, his face hidden, holds up the laptop, the screen visible. The laptop and briefcase are both closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ABOVE TRAINS

<DIRECTION>
All we see are hands as the briefcase is exchanged for the laptop. As both trains continue on their way.

Electra drives, falling behind. As the light turns red ahead, she swerves 'round traffic, shoots through the intersection inches ahead of the cross traffic.

Picking his spot, Rath pulls down on the emergency stop cord. The monorail lurches to a stop.

Rath grabs the release handle on the door, pushes it open.

Rath nods. As he swings the briefcase onto his lap, the RADIO LOSES RECEPTION.

Rath frowns. He moves the briefcase away and the RECEPTION RETURNS. Rath looks around them. Pedestrians everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>

Hearing his urgency, Electra turns.

<Contractor>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It will take two days to arrange the transfer. What's the bank code and account number?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Contractor>
<DIRECTION>
Pulling out a small notebook, Rath checks a bank account number.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe it. Twenty million and he wants to know what the account number is.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a long beat)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Partners?

Rath nods, types in the information.

As the plane lands in the b.g., Bain types on his computer. It's set on the hood of his car. Bain looks at the screen as...

Bain lets the Contractor sweat.

Bain pauses, types his one condition:
</DIRECTION>
<Bain>

A long beat. Bain watches with satisfaction as the letters appear one-by-one: P-L-E-A-S-E.

<DIRECTION>
Aquamarine that can only be the Caribbean. Without warning we WHIP UP OVER a sea wall, CLIMB hard ABOVE the ruins of a colonial Spanish fort. HIGHER and a modern city spreads out below us.

<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA DROPS, CLOSES ON a beat-up local tai. As it bounces over blue cobblestones...

INT. LOCAL TAI- DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath and Electra sit in the back, both in sunglasses. Electra looks out the window, taking everything in. But Rath stares straight ahead. He's been here before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOTEL PARAISO - PLAZA COLON - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cab stops at a four-story, boarded, blackened husk. It's surreal, truly the shadow of its former glory.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
<DIRECTION>
(shocked)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Paraiso. Why didn't you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<CABBY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't ask. Fire, Senor. Years ago. There was no money to rebuild.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABBY>
<DIRECTION>
Rath gets out, stares up at the hotel. Electra is out behind him. Her attention drifts to the people around her, the bustle on the plaza.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath only has eyes for a third-story Paraiso window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Electra looks at the International Bank across the way. It's a beautiful old building, the ornate black iron bars on the windows in great contrast to the white-washed con- crete walls.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that the bank? Is that where our siteen mil is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
Rath isn't listening. He's somewhere else. She follows his gaze to a hotel third-story window. It's spooky.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's up there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll be.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL PARAISO - ATRIUM COURTYARD - LATE DAYA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ruins. Spooky even in the daylight. Rath and Electra enter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around, taking the place in. Rath gestures her toward a rickety stairwell. Up they go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL PARAISO - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIMBERS CREAK as they make their way down. Rath takes Electra's arm, guides her 'round a hole in the floor. They're going to a bad place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL PARAISO - ROOM 302 - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They enter. Electra looks about as Rath goes to the window. Pulling back on a decrepit shutter he looks across the plaza and remembers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK - EXT. PLAZA COLON - DAY (1980)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black and white of the prelude. The plaza. A sniper's rifle in the window. A figure steps out from the bank. We see more detail than before, but it seems to strobe AWAY FROM us. The gunman is a younger Rath. The Mark seems familiar. He looks up to the blank, is shot down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As pigeons take wing.
</DIRECTION>
<CUT_BACK_TO>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL PARAISO - ROOM 302 - LATE DAY (PRESENT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath is snapped from his reverie as real pigeons flap by the window. Electra studies him.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
Rath gestures her over. He points to strategic spots below as he talks.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At ten o'clock tomorrow I'll enter the bank. He'll be in the plaza somewhere. In the crowd. When he sees me go in, he'll move up here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<RATH>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll be at the cafe. You'll see him when he goes inside. We'll have two-way mics so we can talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do we do after he goes inside?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
Rath describes the rest not the way he planned it, but the way he remembers it.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll take all day, but he'll begin to doubt himself. He'll start to think he missed me. He'll have to see with his own eyes whether I'm still in the bank. It'll be sunset, closing time. He'll have to leave the rifle here when he goes to the bank. There are metal detectors at the door. When he's out of sight, you'll come in here and take the rifle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
Electra looks back at the bank.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if he tries to shoot you before you go into the bank?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
Rath speaks like it was all written in stone.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll wait for the prime shot. When I come out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you be so sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because he likes history...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifteen years ago I was at this same window.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifteen years...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
And as they stand side by side, suddenly everything is clear to Electra.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
Rath finally looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your friend Nicolai. You said he was taken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
Rath nods.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
(a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You killed him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
Rath doesn't answer. And suddenly Electra is scared again. She looks at him a beat longer then does the only thing she can to protect herself: she puts on her sunglasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We MOVE IN ON the lenses, see Rath reflected in them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW HOTEL - MAGIC HOUR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cab pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEW HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath and Electra walk through an archway and start upstairs. In front of them walks a newlywed couple -- kissing and giggling -- very much in love -- Rath pays no attention while Electra can't take her eyes off them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEW HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They reach a landing. To make things worse, they have adjoining rooms. Rath opens their door, enters. Electra lingers, watches the other couple as he fumbles for his keys. Watches as she runs her hand over him. He finally gets the door open. He pushes her inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEW HOTEL - ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Electra listens to the sounds coming from the other side of the wall. LAUGHTER quickly turning into PASSION.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should check them out. Maybe they're Interpol.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<RATH>
<DIRECTION>
(in no mood)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not even professionals could pull that act off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
As the sounds become MORE MUFFLED, Electra grabs a glass, holds it to the wall. Rath watches with distaste.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a voyeur.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
Electra looks at him, hears the disgust in his words. But she has some in her own.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are worse things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
Rath looks away. There are. Electra is possessed of knowledge she can't understand, let alone forget.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Nicolai and me... It's none of your business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
(fierce)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is my business. I'm with you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
Rath isn't going to say anymore. Electra turns back to the wall as the sounds of PASSION BUILD.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't trust you. You can't trust me. How can we possibly help each other-

</ELECTRA>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I trust you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Why do you trust me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't have an answer. She picks up Pearl, walks into the bathroom. As the door locks behind her.A
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLAZA COLON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almost deserted, a different story after sundown. As the last fruit VENDOR shuts up his cart.
</DIRECTION>
<BAIN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Un momento. Por favor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAIN>
<DIRECTION>
The Vendor sighs, waits as Bain, carrying a nylon bag, steps over. He nods politely, scans the fruit, picks out two apricots. He hands the Vendor a twenty, walks on without waiting for his change.
</DIRECTION>
<VENDOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gracias, Senor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VENDOR>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE WITH Bain as he strolls across the plaza. Biting into the apricot, savoring the taste, he looks at the bank, at the big iron gates barring the front entrance, but also at the modern metal detectors just beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taking another bite, he turns, scans the opposite side. The Hotel Paraiso is even gloomier than the first time we saw it. By instinct, Bain settles on the same window that Rath did.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks to the bank entrance, imagines the sight line back to the hotel. Doing his homework.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finishing the first apricot, Bain sets the second on a column ledge just to the right of the entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bain crosses the plaza to the hotel. Pulling free a 24 nailed to the entrance, he steps inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL PARAISO - LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An atrium courtyard. The burnt-out interior hall bal- conies stare down from four sides. The ceiling is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bain stares up at the moon. It casts broken patterns of light across the walls and floor. Bain seems almost reverent. Like he was in a holy place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving cautiously, Bain starts up the staircase, headed for the third floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL PARAISO - ROOM 302 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bain enters. We jump as a FLOOR BOARD gives way with a SNAP. Taking it in stride, Bain pulls his leg free, steps carefully over to a...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THIRD FLOOR WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bain stares across at the entrance to the bank. A good clear view, the vertical angle not too EXTREME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He unzips his bag. Quickly, epertly, he puts together a sniper's rifle complete with a two-foot silencer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding up the rifle, he closes one eye, sights. A CLICK as Bain squeezes the TRIGGER on an empty chamber. He looks up from the sight, across the plaza. This is good.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW HOTEL - BALCONY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding Pearl, Electra stands looking out at the city. What holds her attention is the procession moving down the cobblestoned street, following a trail of marigold petals to a nearby cemetery. It includes children made up as skeletons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEW HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WAITER pushes a room service cart. We don't see his face, but we suspect the worst. As he reaches the door to Rath and Electra's room...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEW HOTEL - ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath looks up at a KNOCK on the door. Drawing his .22, he steps over, stays to the side of the door.A
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is it
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<MUFFLED_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Room service.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUFFLED_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Rath places the end of the silencer against the door -- head level.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't order room service.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
As he cocks back the trigger, Electra steps in from the Balcony.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
Rath pulls the gun away, pauses a moment to collect himself. He holsters it, opens the door. The Waiter smiles, rolls the cart in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he sets up the plates, Electra steps over.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(points out balcony)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's happening out there?

</ELECTRA>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Day of the Dead, Senora.

</WAITER>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are the flowers for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Families make a path from their homes to the cemetery. So the souls of the dead loved ones can find their way back home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<DIRECTION>
Electra is fascinated. As the Waiter finishes, Rath tips him and he exits.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll be here by now. This room and the bank. That's it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
Disappointed, she sets Pearl down and steps back out on the balcony to watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath pours himself a drink. As he does, he notices something. There's a slight tremble in his hand. He h)P ?sets the drink down, looks to the balcony. After a moment, he steps over, stops to the side of it.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish I could explain why I killed Nicolai. I may have been manipulated. I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what it's worth, I'm sorry did it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. He waits for her to say something, can't really blame her when she doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to hope the same thing would happen to me. A least it's a way out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
It may. Finally, Rath steps out to be with her.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Electra...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath steps out. Electra's gone! Not on the ground a floor below. Nowhere in sight. Rath looks to the cemetery and the fire escape leading from the balcony down to the cobblestone street below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OLD CEMETERY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A procession emerges from a tunnel, through old gates and into a cemetery. It includes some American tourists. Marigold petals and candles are everywhere. There are headstones, many of which lie flat. Also much well-made statuary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two local women stand to one side selling coffee and shaved ice. Solemn, but not dreadfully so.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stepping up from the shadows of a darker part of the cemetery is Electra. She looks on eagerly. This is prime people-watching territory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She spots the coffee women, starts to move in closer. As she passes behind a larger memorial, she hears...
</DIRECTION>
<BAIN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hola. Que pasa?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Electra freezes, peeks around the memorial to see Bain not more than four feet away, standing near the coffee women. They smile at him. He seems respectful. In fact, as Bain watches the ceremony, he's in his element.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He speaks, almost like he's addressing the women, but not really. Electra can't take her eyes off him.
</DIRECTION>
<BAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Death is like me. Quiet, a little scary. Sharp, he's real sharp. And even though you want to stay away from him, you can't. He draws you. You dig him and fear him at the same time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a million years old, but I look like I'm thirty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAIN>
<DIRECTION>
ELECTRA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hurries away into the shadows. In the gloom, she nearly trips over a headstone. In the process she sends an old GLASS CANDLE HOLDER flying. As it SMASHES...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At first we don't think he heard it, but then he turns, looks back into the darkness. He's going to turn back to the ceremony, but he can't. It's instinctual.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaching into his jacket, Bain heads into the darkness. The two women watch him go. One looks to the other, makes "crazy circles" around her ear with a finger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DARKENED CEMETERY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Electra moves. Hears someone behind her. Or was it to the left? She ducks behind an angel statue. Moments later, Bain steps up. Electra holds her breath as he scans the area. All of Bain's senses are working, including smell.
</DIRECTION>
<BAIN>
<DIRECTION>
(under his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jasmine...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAIN>
<DIRECTION>
His .22 in hand, Bain moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Electra stands, moves back. She hasn't gone far when a hand slaps down over her mouth. It's Rath! BAIN -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's starting to get a little spooked himself. Sure that he's cornered someone, he leaps around a corner, takes aim down a row of tombstones. No one's there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RATH AND ELECTRA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath's feeling the same way. Motioning for her to stay put, he creeps around a statue, sees Bain, draws a bead -- but a large group from the procession moves in between them -- when they clear, Bain is gone. Rath takes Electra's hand and they move on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking about, the feeling passing. Then he spots it, a Jasmine in a vase by a stone. Bain takes a sniff. Laughing, he turns, heads back to the ceremony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEW HOTEL - ROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Electra enters followed by Rath. Rath is ehausted from the past tension. Electra watches as he locks the door, leans his forehead against it. Finally...
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I attractive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
Rath looks at her a beat, nods. She is.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you attracted to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

	That's strange, don't you think?

	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a strange man, Robert Rath.

</ELECTRA>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joseph. My real name is Joseph.

For a man like Rath, this is like giving her the Hope Diamond. Electra knows it. A beat and then...

(savors the sound)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joseph... I'm Anna. It's awfully 7 nice to meet you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
She holds her hand out like a promise. All Rath has to do is take it. He does. They come together. Kissing, wanting, needing contact. And they're on the bed. Never have two people needed each other more. As Pearl runs out of the room...
</DIRECTION>

Rath opens a case. He takes out two small "hearing aid" mics. He sets them on the table alongside his gun. Electra immediately scoops up one of them.

Glossed with light. We PULL BACK and see other squares. Black and white. Like a chessboard. A woman's HEELS CLICK past. RISING HIGHER, we see the woman walking. man crosses behind her going the other way. HIGHER STILL and we realize we're looking at the black and white marble floor of the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BANK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ceilings are vaulted and vast, the suspended lights baroque. An enormous clock (10:00 AM) hangs from the wall. With its massive oil paintings and bronze statues, the bank could be a museum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Armed guards stroll the floor. Customers go about their business. Carrying a large black briefcase, Rath steps onto the checkered floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Set just off the plaza with a view of the side of the hotel and the front of the bank. Electra sits on the patio sipping a thick, almost sludgy espresso. She hears Rath over her ear-piece.

	</DIALOGUE>
</TELLER>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>

</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
Rath slides a withdrawal ticket over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL PARAISO - ROOM 302 - DAY7
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bain steps into the same room we saw him in last night. He reaches overhead into some charred, half-collapsed timbers, pulls down the silenced sniper's rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stepping to the window, Bain aims at the bank entrance. Through the scope he follows an eiting man. The cross- hairs are right on the man's forehead. Bain pulls the trigger. CLICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Satisfied, Bain slaps a magazine into the rifle. Reach- ing into his pocket he pulls out an orange. Watching the bank, he starts to peel it. He reaches into a duffel bag, pulls out his small keyboard and a set of headphones. He plugs in the phones, begins to play, always watching the bank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BANK - TELLER'S WINDOW - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Teller returns with a BANK OFFICIAL. He carries a printed receipt, wears a great big smile.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Senor. We have received your transfer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICIAL>
<DIRECTION>
He hands the receipt to Rath who sees a "two", counts the zeros after it. There are seven of them.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to close this account. Could you get the paperwork together?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
The smile fades.

	Today? You wish to close the account today?

Rath nods solemnly. No joking here.

<OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How would you like the funds?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICIAL>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	American currency.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
It's all the Official can do to keep from crossing him- self. He looks around, catches the eye of the one man in the building who looks even more official than he does -- the BANK PRESIDENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The President steps over, confers with his underling in low tones. In Spanish. Occasionally the President glances at Rath, but mostly he listens. Finally...
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're aware, Senor, that there may be... a withdrawal fee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. HOTEL PARAISO - ROOM 302 - DAY7
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bain sits in a charred chair staring out the window, his back soaked with sweat. He rubs his eyes. One at a time. He's afraid to blink lest he miss something. He checks his watch, raising it to eye level, rather than look down.
</DIRECTION>
<BAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing in there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAIN>
<DIRECTION>
The heat in the room makes it hard to even breathe. There! A man walks out of the bank dressed like Rath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bain's body snaps erect. Leveling the rifle, he sites the man's head. He's about to squeeze the trigger when he realizes it's not Rath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bain wipes the sweat from his forehead, leaves a smear of black from the charcoal. Fumbling for his bag, he pulls out a container of bottled water. He drinks, never once taking his eyes off the bank.

</RATH>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but it's a real thing. Hat makers, hatters, they used mercurous nitrate to make felt hats. They'd absorb it through their skin and some of them went insane. No one knew why at the time. As long as their hats fit.

Rath is amused.

Teeth gritted, Bain rocks side to side. He has to urinate. Bad. He tries to scan the faces coming out of the bank, but the situation has become intolerable.
</DIRECTION>
<BAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Esto es una locura!

INT. BANK RESTROOM - DAY

INTERCUT Bain's discomfort with Rath in the bank's elegant restroom. He stands at the sink, pats his hands dry on a towel. Not a trace of sweat on his brow.

The sun clock on the wall reads 5:10. After a long beat, the MINUTE HAND CLICKS over to 5:11. PAN DOWN TO where the Bank President approaches Rath.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL PARAISO - ROOM 302 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun is getting low, filling the room with golden light. Bain is just a knot by the window. As a large group exit the bank, he scans faces through the scope. Frantically as they disperse. No Rath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bain pounds the butt of the rifle down, splintering a floorboard. He checks his watch. 5:47. In fifteen minutes the bank will close. Maybe he missed him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bain stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAFE - DAY

Electra sits up almost in shock as she sees Bain emerge from the shadows of the hotel. He moves with purpose, shoving aside people who don't get out of his way.

Soaked in sweat, his eyes covered by sunglasses, Bain scans the lobby. Rath sits, waits, unaware of Electra's plight.

Turning, Bain spots him. A man seemingly without a care in the world. Confused, Bain's first instinct is to run. But then, taking a breath, he starts for Rath.

Rath stops, slowly looks up. He sees the rifle's long silencer jut from the window, Bain's shadow beyond it. He's a dead man, but the worst part is not knowing where Electra is. Was he deserted? Is she in trouble? In another second, it won't matter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROOM 302 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About to pull the trigger, Bain hesitates...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAIN'S POV - THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees the mic in Rath's ear, the cord snaking under his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROOM 302
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bain frowns, then sniffs the air. There's something strangely familiar in it.
</DIRECTION>
<BAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jasmine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Bain whips a look back over his shoulder, sees Rath's .22, Electra who practically shrugs in apology.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Howdy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
The .22 SILENCER kisses the air. Bain's shoulder erupts red.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLAZA COLON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pigeons take wing as Rath sees the RIFLE twist up, FIRE wildly into the sky. A beat and Rath dashes forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROOM 302 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rifle dropped, Bain grabs his bag and charges for the wall. Electra FIRES TWICE more, misses twice as Bain crashes through the lathing into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROOM 301
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stumbling blind, he falls. The floor opens beneath him to let him pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLAZA COLON - CAFE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath races for the hotel. Past a man picking up coffee cups.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE HOTEL PARAISO - ROOM 301 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Electra steps up. The .22 trained on the hole, she looks down. Bain's bag is there, but the man himself is nowhere in sight. A ghost. Electra moves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bain on his back, aiming his own .22 at her footsteps overhead. He FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 3RD FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's no warning blast, just BULLETS silently drill- ing the floor at her feet. Electra runs, aware the floor could collapse under any given footfall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bain moves to the railing, aims at the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Electra appears on the landing above, freezes as she realizes she's eposed.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bain!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
Rath in the lobby. Before Bain can target him, he's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So is Electra.
</DIRECTION>
<BAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two against one. Is that your edge, Rath? You didn't take the mark. You took the bribe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Bain starts for the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<BAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take her, even the odds!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAIN>
<ELECTRA>

	I think he's serious, Rath!

ROOM 205
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath pulls himself up through a hole in the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got something of mine, Electra.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
3RD FLOOR HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Electra looks at the .22, gauges Rath's position from his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When do you want it back?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<RATH>

</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
ATRIUM - HALLWAY BALCONIES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Electra appears at the third floor balcony. Rath at the second, a little further down. Bain turns the corner on the staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Electra tosses Rath the .22, Bain FIRES. Time slows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath's hand closes around the gun even as he's hit in the shoulder. Stumbling back, he RETURNS FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Electra has disappeared from the railing as Bain con- tinues after her. And getting to his feet...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath gets to his feet and motors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
3RD FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Light plays through the lathing. Every creak could mean your life. INTERCUT BETWEEN Rath, Electra and Bain as they play the equivalent of the hedge-maze game.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bain FIRES at a shadow moving against a wall three rooms away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Electra nearly steps into a gaping hole as she looks back at a sound behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath wheels as the Electra WHISPERED NAME "Rath" ECHOES oddly. No way to tell where it came from.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
3RD FLOOR HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The full length stretched before us. Electra steps out from a room. Rath appears at the other end. As she starts toward him, Bain steps out from the opposite end. She's about to get caught in one hellacious crossfire.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
<DIRECTION>
(dashing forward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
As Electra hits the deck, Bain leaps forward with a rebel yell. The two men unload their silent .22's. Sprinting at each other. Bain shouting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath jerks to a sinew-stretching stop as his right leg goes through the flooring. He FIRES...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And as Bain's hit in the thigh, he goes down. Disappears h)f through the floor right at Electra's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FLOORS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE WITH Bain as he tumbles. Breaking, then continuing his fall at each floor he encounters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
3RD FLOOR HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath and Electra look THROUGH the hole. No ghost this time. Bain's down there. Motionless, nearly buried in debris. Rath looks up at Electra.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
Rath starts down the hall. A beat and Electra is following right behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL PARAISO - LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light from the lowering sun slips through gaps, cracks and broken window panes, casting surreal patterns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath steps over to where Bain lies broken. .22 aimed at Bain, he turns to face Electra as she comes up behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They embrace a moment before he pulls away. The only way to describe him is pissed with joy.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You weren't supposed to be here. What happened? What the hell happened?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
Before Electra can explain...
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's no way to talk to a lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A chill down Rath's spine. He wheels, but the voice has no source. Till The CONTRACTOR steps out of the shadows, holds a .22 about a foot from Electra's head.
</DIRECTION>
<CONTRACTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been a long time, my friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONTRACTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Rath turns, is stunned at the sight.h)g

Nicolai motions to Rath's gun. Rath has no choice. He drops it. Nicolai gestures toward Bain.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miguelito?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Rath nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never pictured him so young. shame. Second best after all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Electra can't believe what's happening. She looks from Nicolai to Rath.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You killed him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<NICOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Nicolai opens his jacket to reveal a bulletproof vest.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
(to Rath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walking out of that bank was the worst moment of my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Electra)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He always went for the heart. Predictable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Nicolai holds up a flattened slug, tosses it to Rath who lets it land on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifteen years, fifteen goddamn years you let me think I killed you. You sonuvabitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<NICOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're forgetting you shot me. You sonuvabitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Rath can't argue the facts.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Cold War was ending. I needed to die. To leave no past behind. You delivered me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks to Electra)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You, my darling, must be the mark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLAI>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you, my darling, must be the contractor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<NICOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
(nods; to Rath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm disappointed, Robert. You were supposed to kill her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Rath is the only one aware that Bain has come to.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With his free hand, Nicolai pulls the disc from his pocket, looks to Electra.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a thief. A good one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLAI>
<ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
(looks to Rath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm retired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<NICOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had to use both my best to track you down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLAI>
<ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
(re: disc)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me guess. There's something on there that would bring you back to life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<NICOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're very good. Also a shame.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Rath and Nicolai regard each other grimly. A moment of truth is at hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
(scared)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, can't you two just kiss and make up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
Nicolai smiles at her, picks the briefcase up off the ground. At the same time, Bain's hand moves almost imperceptibly to his gun a few inches away.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is sad for me, Robert. Sentimental, but I didn't want to find you alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First things first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Nicolai motions Rath to take a step aside. Nicolai moves forward. Leaning over Bain, he holds the .22 to the base of his skull. The coup-de-grace.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Always make sure. You should've known better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
As Nicolai's finger tightens, Rath dives for his own gun. Nicolai swings his aim for Rath enabling Bain to grab his own .22.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bain FIRES from the rubble, drills Nicolai up through the chest cavity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicolai drops. Rath rolls to his feet, aims at Bain who swings his aim to Rath. But neither man fires.
</DIRECTION>
<ELECTRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELECTRA>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Bain sticks out his free hand.
</DIRECTION>
<BAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ayudame...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me up, will you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Rath takes his hand, pulls Bain, bloody, covered in soot, to his feet. As Rath stares down at Nicolai.
</DIRECTION>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<DIRECTION>
Bain considers the implications.
</DIRECTION>
<BAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That would make me number one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAIN>
<RATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can live with that. Can you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATH>
<BAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutamente. Companeros.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Bain turns his aim away. Rath does the same. Electra breathes a sigh of relief. Rath moves toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<BAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Rath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Rath freezes as he hears the HAMMER COCK behind him. Bain has him dead, the .22 aimed at the back of Rath's head.
</DIRECTION>
<BAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As long as you're out there, I'll never be number one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Feeling like a fool, Rath looks across at Electra. beat. In a moment of compassion, Bain turns his aim away.
</DIRECTION>
<BAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to say goodbye?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Rath has nothing to say. He just looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In response, Electra raises her sunglasses, slides them on. Like she's withdrawing away at the end. But wait. That's not it at all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath's eyes flicker wide as he sees Bain in the lens reflection. Rath knows eactly where he's standing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bain realizes as well. As he moves to fire...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The side of Rath's coat blossoms as Rath SHOOTS through it. Like a Wild West trick shooter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hit in the chest, the gun slips from Bain's hand. His eyes flicker from his wound to Rath. Rath stares back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bain goes down hard. He's dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rath and Electra come together. A beat and they start out. On the way, Electra scoops up the briefcase. moment more and they're gone.
