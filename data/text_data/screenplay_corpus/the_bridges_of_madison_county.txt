EXT. IOWA LANDSCAPE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rolling green hills, lush farmland, vast open space. Not a house or sign of life in sight. On a long dusty road, a TRUCK is driving across the screen. Clouds of dirt follow in its tracks -- its motor, the only sound we hear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRUCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANCESCA JOHNSON is sitting in the front seat of the pick-up truck. Her expression is distant. Her eyes are sad, as if hiding a burden she can hardly bear. Her husband, RICHARD JOHNSON, is driving.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You feeling better Franny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
He nods, satisfied. He turns on the radio as the VOICE OF DINAH WASHINGTON sings a bluesy, haunting love song, "I'LL CLOSE MY EYES."
</DIRECTION>
<DINAH_WASHINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
(SINGS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I'LL CLOSE MY EYES... TO EVERYONE BUT YOU... AND WHEN I DO... I'LL SEE YOU STANDING THERE..."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONTINUES)
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What station is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(nicely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Richard shuts it off. Francesca turns her face away from him to look out at the vast expanse out of the countryside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck stops in front of an isolated FARM HOUSE. A wooden gate stands twenty yards from the front door. A barn and a hot house sits on either side, surrounded by acres and acres of beautiful pasture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAROLYN JOHNSON, a sixteen-year-old girl, steps out from the vegetable garden with an arm full of vegetable. She watches her parents exit the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca carries her groceries, walking briskly through the front gate and entering the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard grabs a bag of feed from the flatbed and strolls more leisurely. When he walks through the front gate, he notices something on the ground and picks it up. It is a BUTTON with RED NATURAL surrounding it. As if it had been torn from a piece of clothing. His daughter approaches him.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mother isn't feel well. I want you to help her out tonight with dinner.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell Michael to put this feed away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the feed bag down. She exits. He enters the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRONT HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard enters the front hall opposite the stairs to the second floor. To his left is the living room. To his right, through an archway is the kitchen. He moves towards the stair when he suddenly hears the kitchen radio turned on and "I'LL CLOSE MY EYES" continues. It puzzles him. He looks to the kitchen. Francesca is obviously there but we can't see her. He is about to call to her when his son, Michael, yells:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad! You bought the wrong feed!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
(irritated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
He exits through the house to the back door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The family-- Francesca, Richard, Carolyn and their seventeen- year-old son MICHAEL -- are eating supper. No one speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what are you going to do with the prize money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I might save up for one of those hi-fi stereo players like Peggy has.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca nods. Silence again. She asks her son:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you seeing Betty tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(eating)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. She is used to her son's one syllable answers.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! Frannie, is this yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
He places the button with red material on the table. Hiding her surprise, Francesca takes the button.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You found it! I got my dress caught on that damn gate. You must have eyes like a hawk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must all be tired. You got home so early. What time did you leave Illinos this morning?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Bout 4:30.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
This last remark she addresses to her daughter. Everyone returns to their silent eating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOHNSON HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house is asleep and dark except for a bright light coming from the kitchen. Carolyn quietly exits her bedroom in her nightclothes. She was awakened by noises coming from the kitchen downstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She enters to find the lights are on. An empty cake pan and a half-used bowl of frosting sitting unwashed in the sink. She hears the motor of the truck being turned on. She moves to the front hall and looks out through the door to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck driving away. She calls out:
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
But she gets no response. She stands there wondering where her mother could possibly being going this time of night, as we -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THIRTY YEARS LATER - SAME LOCATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn, thirty years older, stands in the same doorway of the same house thinking back to that evening her mother acted so strangely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LAWYER is unpacking a briefcase in the living room off the front entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn sees a car with Florida plates driving up to the house. She smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn steps out of the doorway and heads for the car, out of which exit her brother Michael and his country girl wife BETTY, a stout buxom chatterbox. Both boast Florida tans and fashion styles.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(to Carolyn)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom's orders.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lawyer here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
(proudly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I nearly died when we split the bill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn tries not to laugh. Betty shoots him a dirty look, then stops to take in the house and its surroundings.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy. It sure has been a long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(correcting her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were here two Christmases ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's a long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not that long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly upset)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Carolyn)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(defensive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
(angry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Jesus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
(staring to cry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I simply can not stand that tone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(sympathetically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come inside. You're just tired from the trip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
She comforts Betty who indulges in the attention.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(uncomfortably)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
Betty suddenly stops crying and abrasively focuses on Carolyn's problems.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, is he still cheating on you, hon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn suddenly hoses sympathy for her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lawyer hands Michael a document.
</DIRECTION>
<LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just sign here as having received the contents from the safe deposit box.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Michael does)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this one, which clears the bank of all further responsibility fo0r the contents.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
Betty whispers to Carolyn.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is kind of exciting. You think we'll find out your mother had secret millions lying around?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn smiles weakly. Michael hands back the papers.
</DIRECTION>
<LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. Why don't we begin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out Francesca's Last Will and Testament.
</DIRECTION>
<LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mother has been interred at Lakeside Funeral Home until arrangements can be made.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWYER>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(to Carolyn)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought everything WAS arranged.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there's a problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWYER>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cremated?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eeeww!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I don't understand it either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did she decide this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
(reading will)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apparently just before her death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWYER>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My Jewish friend's grandmother did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It clearly states in the will --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWYER>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWYER>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHAT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How bizarre!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWYER>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't matter. Move on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
The women dare not object. The lawyer raises his eyebrows and continues:
</DIRECTION>
<LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we'll come back to that. Shall we open the box?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
JUMP CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C.U. SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A key is inserted and the lid is opened. There are many papers, deeds, et. Michael begins sorting through these.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn notices a manila envelope addressed to her mother, postmarked 1965. She opens it up to find TWO LETTERS and A PHOTOGRAPH -- FRANCESCA standing NEAR A COVERED BRIDGE, her hair wind blown, her expression serene, beautiful and sad. She wears a RED DRESS with buttons down the front.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael, look -- I've never seen this picture of mama. Have you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
Betty and Michael look over her shoulder. He shakes "no."
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was in this envelope from 1965.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's not wearing a bra.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(takes bridge photo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Roseman Bridge in case anyone's interested.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
Interested yes, but no one thinks anything of it. Michael returns to the other papers. Betty takes the photograph for further examination. Carolyn opens one of the letters and begins to read.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The following dialogue is heard OS, as CAMERA ANGLES ON CAROLYN reading one of the letters:
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a beautiful picture of her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (to lawyer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are there two deeds here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<LAYER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of for the original parcel your father bought and this one is for the additional acres he purchased in '59.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAYER>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those are bills of sale from the equipment your mother sold in ..
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONTINUES O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Throughout their conversation, we focus on Carolyn as she reads and her expression sinks into one of shock and confusion. She flips to the last page of the letter to read who it is from. She can't believe her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn jumps a little, so engrossed in her discovery. She lies.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No treasure maps, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs nervously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
Betty starts inspecting knit knacks around the house she might be able to take. Carolyn looks to Michael.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(reading documents)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael.

<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(irritated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come here a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
Michael crosses impatiently to Carolyn. Carolyn looks around to the others, then guides him OS into the kitchen for privacy. He protests.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Where are we going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
They exit. Alone with the impatient lawyer, Betty examines a vase as she pumps him for info.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did she say anything in there about me? Leaving me anything in particular?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
Betty prattles on as she examines each item, much to the lawyer's dismay, hiding her resentment and hurt.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't expect so. She never liked me. It's okay. I always knew. Thought we married too young. Nobody broke his arm -- that's what I said but you know mothers and their sons. Also, she never liked the fact of us moving to Florida although what's where the opportunities were. Couldn't deny that. Suppose we should have visited more but you know she hardly ever made an effort to come to Tampa. Not even to see her grandchildren. She was a cold woman. They say Italians are hot-blooded but not her. She was cool as ice.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(picks up a candlestick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She leaves these to anyone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
Michael and Carolyn re-enter the living room. Michael's expression now matches Carolyn in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um... we were just wondering how it might be better if me and Carolyn went over the stuff by ourselves. Not keep you two waiting around. I'll contact your office about the legal work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Grateful, the lawyer packs up to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mind waiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I can help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said NO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
That came out a bit aggressively. Betty is hurt.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you go to your mothers. Or back to the hotel. Sit in some air conditioning. Take a bath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
(near tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not need instructions from you to bathe!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gets her bag)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(genuinely hurt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, Betty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn feels badly for her. An impatient Michael refuses sympathy. Embarrassed, Betty starts to exit then stops at the mantle.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You can have them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
Betty grabs them both and exits. Carolyn looks at him disapprovingly. Michael takes the letter from her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what's this about?

</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

<DIRECTION>
Sitting at the kitchen table, Carolyn is in the middle of reading the letter to Michael.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --

	What's he saying now?

</MICHAEL>
<CAROLYN>

	Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...

She dumps it over and a SMALL KEY FALLS OUT. Pause, as Carolyn and Michael look to each other -- they grab the key and run out of the kitchen, almost comically falling over each other in their obsession to put this puzzle together.

A SERIES OF JUMP CUT --

From one lock to another as they try to find the keyhole that fits the key -- they try closets, attic doors, jewelry boxes, night tables, vanity drawers... Finally --

INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the foot of their parents bed sits an WALNUT HOPE CHEST, covered with a tapestry. Michael and Carolyn look to each other first, before one removes the tapestry and the other tries the key. It fits. They open the chest to find:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera equipment, a chain with a medallion that reads "FRANCESCA," three leather bound notebooks -- and a sealed envelope with "Carolyn or Michael" written on it.

Carolyn relents. She takes out the lefter and reads:

<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"January, 1987. Dear Carolyn. I hope you're reading this with Michael. I'm sure he wouldn't be able to read it by himself and he'll need some help understanding all this, especially the parts about me having sex..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>

Insulted, Michael pulls the lefter out of her hand and defiantly attempts to read it aloud himself to disprove his mother's claim. But after looking at a few lines, he surrenders and hands the lefter back to his sister.

	But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay.

It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."

	<DIALOGUE>
	"It was late at night after a long day. Your father was tired -- fighting all afternoon with that new equipment Robert Harrison convinced him to buy. But I wasn't tired. Lately, I could hardly sleep more than two hours a night. I was reading some John O'Hara novel, skimming the words, turning the pages without absorbing what I was reading. My mind was far away. And no matter how I tried, I couldn't call it back."
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca closes the book and turns off the light. She nestles into the bed and tries to sleep. After a beat, she opens her eyes and turns on the light. As she gets out of bed she awakens Richard.

INT. ATTIC - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca sits at her sewing machine, working on Carolyn's skirt. When the thread runs out, she checks her sewing box for another spool of that color. Not finding it, she raises and walks to an opened closet. She pulls on a light cord and checks her supplies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are shelves of boxes, crates, old clothes and shoes all crammed together. She pulls out one shoe box and an entire stack of items tumble off the shelf onto her head.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it! Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at the mess and decides it's time to re-organize.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clock reads 2:30 AM. The closet has been emptied. Francesca rummages through box after box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two huge piles have been created -- one for items to be thrown away, another for items to be kept. Francesca is wiping the bare shelves down with a rag and some cleanser. Looking up to the bottom of the next shelf, she notices A SHOULDER STRAP hanging, wedged between the wall and the shelf. Pulling over a stool, she steps up to be eye level with the shelf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is an OLD HANDBAG -- of a style not seen since the forties when she was a young girl. She pulls it down to examine. It is very dusty and worn, but the snaps still work. She places it against her side to see if it would still be fashionable. She opens it and finds an old lipstick -- reading the bottom where the name of the shade is located.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha, they don't even made this color anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
She exits the closet and moves to an old mirror, trying the lipstick on. As she decides whether or not she likes it, a thought occurs to her... she remembers something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She crosses back to the handbag and feels the inside for a compartment hidden by a flap of material and a snap. She unsnaps it and an old BACK & WHITE PHOTO slips out. She looks at its image -- two young people against an Italian background. Francesca is twenty years younger with her arms around a handsome, black-haired charmer named --

FLASHBACK -

EXT. NAPLES COUNTRYSIDE, 20 YEARS EARLIER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hot, breezy summer day. A young vibrant Francesca is storming through an open field, angry, while Niccolo calls after her in pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The following scene is played in Italian with subtitles.

<NICCOLO>

	Francesca! Francesca! Where the hell are you going?

	You play these games and I'm supposed to follow -- run after you like a schoolboy. Well, I'm not! I'm fed up!

</NICCOLO>
<DIRECTION>
Niccolo stops. Several yards ahead of him, Francesca stops and turns. Suddenly, she storms back towards him until they are face to face.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that's it! You just give up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<NICCOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What "give up"? You agreed with them! Mommy and Daddy said stay away from me and you said all right. What am I supposed to do?

	Fight for me!

Niccolo grabs her violently.

<NICCOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ENOUGH! You don't know what you want! Stop looking for me to tell you! STOP IT!

</NICCOLO>

Francesca knows he's right. He releases her.
</DIRECTION>
<NICCOLO>
<DIRECTION>

	We can go back now and end it or we can go back and you tell them off. This is your choice! Not mine. But I won't do this anymore. This is for children!

</NICCOLO>
<DIRECTION>
Frustrated and sad, Francesca sits upon the ground. Niccolo knows she cannot face her parents yet he looks sympathetic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAWN 1965
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca sits on the back porch in her bathrobe, looking out over the pasture as if she were watching the previous scene happen right before her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the pasture stands NICCOLO as he was twenty years ago. Memories have overlapped. A field in Naples is now a pasture in Iowa and Niccolo is as real to her as the grass. He is staring at her seated on the porch of her Iowa home, a woman twenty yards older than when he knew her. He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."

INT. JOHNSON HOUSE - EVENING

It is a week later. Francesca is making dinner. A COUNTRY STATION is tuned in on the radio.

<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The following week was the Illinos State Fair. The two of you were going with dad to exhibit Carolyn's prize steer. It was the Sunday night you left. I know it sounds awful but I couldn't wait for you all to leave. You were going to be gone until Friday. Four days...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael! Carolyn! Richard! Dinner!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
She sets down a bowl of potatoes, a plate of sausages, coffee and corn as one by one her family enters and sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael enters through a screen door from the back, letting the DOOR SLAM SHUT.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael, what did I tell you about that door?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
Richard enters after Michael, letting the door SLAM THE same way. Francesca is about to say something, but gives up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone begins eating -- in complete silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Michel can't open the ketchup bottle, Francesca grabs it, palms the top skillfully and twists it off. She hands it back to Michael who makes no comment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Richard scans the table for something that obviously isn't there, Francesca is up out of her seat before he can ask, at the fridge, grabbing the sour cream, closing the fridge and back at the table with incredible swiftness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Michel moves his big arm to reach for the salt, he knows over his cup and saucer, which Francesca catches with both hands before they hit the floor. Her reflexes are like a trained athlete.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Francesca is able to sit and sip her coffee. She watches her teenage daughter fill her plate with a blank expression that lets nothing slip through -- no indication of all the tempests of emotions that go through a teenage girl.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You excited about going, Carolyn?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
Without looking up, Carolyn fakes a smile. Looking at her, Francesca remembers Carolyn as a three-year-old girl:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the same kitchen, THREE-YEAR-OLD CAROLYN runs around her mother's feet completely naked, squealing with delight as Francesca flicks her water from the tap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK ENDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca watches as Carolyn eats in silence, distant, locked in her own secret teenage thoughts and dreams.
</DIRECTION>

Francesca then looks to her son, shoveling food into his mouth at an alarming rate. She attempts a conversation.

Silence. Frustrated, Francesca has a fantasy -

FANTASY:

Francesca picks up a blunt butter knife, rises out of her seat, grabs her son and shoves the knife at his throat:

	Do you like her?

Michael finally reacts with more than one word -- frightened for his life.

He gives her a sweet peck on the lips. Francesca smiles, anxious for them all to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOHNSON HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alone, dressed in her bathrobe, Francesca checks the front door. She crosses to the living. Noticing two throw pillows on the floor, she arranged them neatly on the couch. She sits herself in an easy chair then flicks on a reading lamp and opens her book. After five seconds, she closes the book. She crosses to the TV and turns it on, then turns it off before the picture tuned in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and leans on the TV, flicking the ON/OFF switch on and off as her mind wanders. She gets an idea. She crosses to the hi-fi and looks through several albums she got from her Columbia Record Club. But nothing inspires her and she quickly loses the desire for music. She's antsy. She has this time alone and she doesn't know how to spend it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks through the dining room, passing a china closet filled with fancy dishes and glasses. She stops. Shoved in the corner behind is an old, un-opened bottle of BRANDY. She removes up, setting atop the dining table to open it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But when she catches a reflection of herself in the window opposite her, she stops. She sees a lonely, frustrated woman in a tattered bathrobe anxious to open a bottle of liquor. Deflated, she returns the brandy to the cupboard and exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACK PORCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca sits on the porch with a book in her lap, gazing out over the pasture. It's a hot night. She opens the top of her rope a bit. Feeling the air against her skin, she decides to open it a bit more. She gets an idea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing, she looks to see if anyone is around -- though rationally she knows there isn't a soul for miles. She turns off the porch light. With a brave and daring impulse, she sheds her bathrobe and stand naked under the night sky. The air feels good against her body. She opens her arms up against the night sky and moon like an Indian priestess.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, she starts hitting her body as mosquitoes begin attacking her bare torso. Thwarted, she quickly covers herself with a robe and runs into the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca trudges into the kitchen. As if on automatic, she takes the coffee pot and fills it with water. She gets the coffee and begins spooning it out. She stops. She gets the idea of taking herself out for breakfast and dumps the coffee pot out.

A one street town. On either side are rows of storefronts, an old coffee shop/diner, a bank, a medical center, a newspaper building, a courthouse and a movie theater showing CAT BALLOU. The steeple of the local church is the highest structure, towering over the town from the end of Main Street.

INT. COFFEE SHOP/DINER - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dressed in jeans and a light summer blouse, Francesca sits alone -- treating herself to breakfast and the paper. Some of the gossip news includes rumors of Frank Sinatra, 49, marrying Mia Farrow, 19: Cary Grant 61, marrying DYAN CANNON, 27. Francesca shakes her head in disbelief at such news.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to continue reading, but is distracted by the loud conversation in the booth beside her:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN and ONE MIDDLE-AGED HUSBAND sit after breakfast discussing the local gossip.

	Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.

</ELEANOR>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They got heat in Michigan.

</HENRY>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not this kind of heat.

</ELEANOR>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heat is heat.

</HENRY>
<ELEANOR>

	I don't know how that tramp stands living here. No one can bear even speaking to her. She has no friends.

	Well, nobody put a gun to his head.
	</DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Delaney acts as if nothing is wrong. Yet, she knows everyone knows and everyone knows she knows they know, yet no one says a word. She sits at the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_DELANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just coffee, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_DELANEY>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca hears the gossip continue in hushed tones:

	<DIALOGUE>
	See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLADYS>
<ELEANOR>

	I'd laugh first then I'd kill them. Make sure they heard me laughing.

Eleanor nods. Not being able to stand it, Francesca rises. She must pass them on the way to the counter, in order to pay. Eleanor immediately stops her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Francesca! So, everybody got off okay last night?

	Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.

</HENRY>
<ELEANOR>

	Don't talk about what you don't know. Besides, she's too young for "the changes."

At the counter, Francesca pays up. She looks to Mrs. Delaney and tries to smile, but Mrs. Delaney works hard at not making eye contact with anyone. Suddenly, she rises telling the waitress:
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_DELANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me for a moment, I left something in the car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_DELANEY>

Francesca exits and heads for her truck. As she crosses from one corner to another, she notices down the side street --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Delaney sitting alone in her own car, sobbing. Unable to bear the humiliation, she stole herself away to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca wants to help but feels useless. She quickly heads for her truck.

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca sits on the front porch with some iced tea, trying to cool herself off. It is a scorcher. She is barefoot, her blouse hanging out of her jeans, her hair fastened up by a tortoise shell comb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera begins a slow move into close-up, as she sips her tea and lets her mind wander. WE INTERCUT HER FANTASIES WITH HER ON THE PORCH:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FANTASY: Back in town, Francesca slides into Mrs. Delaney's car. She embraces the woman who cries into her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Francesca on the porch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FANTASY: Mrs. Delaney's car is surrounded by townpeople staring into it. Francesca hugs Mrs. Delaney closer to her in defiance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Francesca on the porch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FANTASY: Mrs. Delaney's car drives up to a train station. She and Francesca exit with suitcases. They are surrounded by news reporters as they make their way to the train.

	Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?

	<DIALOGUE>
	What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<FRANCESCA>

<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about your husband?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.

<DIRECTION>
She boards the train with Mrs. Delaney.

<DIRECTION>
END OF FANTASIES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tired of her fantasies, Francesca looks up to the sun to clear her mind. It is blinding. When she looks back out onto the road, her vision is momentarily blurred. Until, slowly, out of the blue, she sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TRUCK driving toward her house, kicking up dust, like some phantom appearing through the etheric plane. Francesca isn't even sure it's real. She sips cool drink & blinks to regain her vision. The truck slows down and turns into her driveway. Francesca watches with suspicious curiosity as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck stops and ROBERT KINCAID steps out. Flashing his blue eyes in her direction, he smiles and says:
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry to bother you, but I've got a feeling I'm lost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca remains guarded.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you supposed to be in Iowa?

</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you're not that lost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs. She puts down her tea and crosses to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm looking for a covered bridge out this way... uh... wait a minute --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
He looks through a small notepad for the name. Francesca finds herself scanning his body.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roseman Bridge?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, terrific. Which way?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Pause as Robert awaits directions and Francesca scans a sudden impulse.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I can take you if you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
Robert is pleased, but a bit surprised as is Francesca who anxiously recants:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or I can tell you. I can take you or tell you. It's up to you. I don't care. Either way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
Robert smiles finding her sudden nervousness charming.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, from the opposite direction of the road, A CHEVY barrels by. The driver, FLOYD, toots his horn.
</DIRECTION>
<FLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Howdy, Francesca.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLOYD>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Floyd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
He drives off. Francesca knows they've been seen. Slightly annoyed by Iowain neighborliness, she turns to Robert and with some defiance says:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'd be better if I show you, I think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I'm not taking you away from anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just have to get my shoes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
Robert watches her as she turns and heads back to the house. He watches her lift her blouse and tuck it into her jeans, revealing her shapely hips and buttocks. He turns back to the truck and notices the mailbox -- MR & MRS. RICHARD JOHNSON. He nods as if he knew all along and begins to make room on the front seat for Francesca.
</DIRECTION>

Francesca is slipping on her boots when she suddenly stops. "What am I doing?", she asks herself silently.

EXT. JOHNSON DRIVEWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca approaches the truck. On the door, she reads: KINCAID PHOTOGRAPHY, BELLINGHAM, WASHINGTON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert is clearing away paper cups, banana peels, paper bags, photography equipment. In the back, Francesca notices a cooler and a guitar case.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't expect company. Let me get this out of the way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
He hauls a case of film from the front to the back. Francesca notices his tanned, muscular arm move in one graceful sweep.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. All set.

</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm-mmm.

</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
She looks out at the vast expanse. It depresses her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's because I live here.

<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That must be it. It's a great smell.

<FRANCESCA>

	Are you from Washington originally?

<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. When did you move back?

<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca is overcome by the idea of such freedom.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches over with one arm, brushing slightly against her thigh. He opens the glove compartment and pulls out a pack of Camels and a Zippo lighter.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca, who doesn't usually smoke, accepts.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a cigarette out of the pack. Robert drops the pack and, with the same hand, flicks open the Zippo and ignites it. Francesca leans over. The road is bumpy and a breeze blows through both windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She cups her hands around his to shelter the flame. She feels his skin for a brief moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sits back and enjoys the ride and her cigarette as Robert lights up. Silence. They drive.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, how long you've been living here?

</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>

EXT. ROSEMAN BRIDGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck stops. They exit. Robert takes out some equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This won't take long. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. I just need to do some prep work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mind waiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles and takes his equipment to the bridge. Francesca slowly follows. She watches his body move. Catching herself, she stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert sets up a tripod in the small ravine beneath the bridge, pointing a view finder up as he plans his shots. Francesca walks through the bridge, noticing lovers names scrawled on the inside: CATHY & BUDDY 4 EVER... ROSIE AND HANK TILL THE END OF TIME. Through a crack in one of the wooden planks, Francesca watches like a voyeur as Robert works. She sees him take out a handkerchief and wipe the sweat off his neck, then inside his shirt and around his chest. Without knowing where Francesca is, Robert speaks aloud:
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it always this hot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca moves quickly away from the plank, like a Peeping Tom who's been caught.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This time of year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca obliges, grateful for something to occupy her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the truck, she scans for the leather bag. She sees it next to a duffel bag. The bag' zipper is opened. She glimpses inside as Robert's personal things -- clothes, socks, underwear, shaving kit. Life magazines from July and August, one depicting the death of Aldai Stevenson; the other a cover photo of the Watts riots. She grabs the leather bag and opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the bridge, Francesca looks for Robert in the raving but he is gone. She looks through the bridge to the other end and sees only the tripod. No Robert. She walks through the bridge and out the other end. She finds Robert bent over, picking flowers.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh there you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! You caught me.

<DIRECTION>
He rises with a bouquet of wildflowers for her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for your help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca smiles, not knowing how to take this.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?

<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not at all --

</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
He flings the flowers down. He wipes his hands furiously.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I was kidding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
Robert looks at her with a shocked smirk, secretly liking her strange behavior.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I don't know what -- I'm sorry. Really. They're lovely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
She begins picking up the flowers.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm not.

<DIRECTION>
(trying not to laugh)
</DIRECTION>

(looking for excuse)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
Robert looks at her like she's nuts. Francesca tries to dig herself out of her hole. Robert enjoys offering no help.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What with those riots in Los Angeles and people burning draft cards and ... Adlai Stevenson dying last month.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
She rises with the flowers. Robert gives her a friendly pat on the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shouldn't let things get to you so much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
He continues with his work. Francesca expresses relief and embarrassment behind his back.
</DIRECTION>

Driving back, Francesca sits with her feet up on the dashboard. Robert drives while he fiddles with the radio. All he can find are country stations.

	Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.

We hear a BLUES SINGER with a sax arrangement.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's nice.

</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want another cigarette?

</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>

Francesca's having a great time.

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert's truck drives down the road and into the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Francesca.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Francesca. Robert.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca nods, as if to say hello and goodbye in the same moment. She gets out of the car, closes the door, then asks:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like some iced tea?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert fiddles with the kitchen radio, tuning in to the Chicago station. Francesca is making iced tea. Robert sits back down at the kitchen table.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lemon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
With her back to him, Robert never takes his eyes off her. She turns and crosses to him, with the tea.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca smiles and sips her own. She watches him gulp down the tea so fast, some of it dribbles down the side of his face and neck. Francesca finds it sexy. He empties it.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like another one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
Robert nods and he pulls out his cigarettes.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mind if I smoke?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(at the sink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
Robert lights up as he watches her fix another iced tea. He watches her slip off one boot, then the other -- never missing a beat of her preparation. He can't help eyeing her body. When she returns, she also has the flowers he picked for her arranged in a Casper the Friendly Ghost jelly glass. She places them on the table and sits.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure you want to keep those in the house?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought it was funny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
She likes that.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you staying while you're here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And how long are you here for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. How old?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About a year and a half.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, your kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must be nice having kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca looks at him and FANTASIZES SAYING:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FANTASY:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not any more. It's awful. They're awful. I can't stand them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
END OF FANTASY:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But in reality, Francesca chooses instead to say:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're not kids anymore. Things change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I doubt that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(explaining)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's he like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
As Francesca thinks of an answer, she looks over to the entranceway between the kitchen and the front hall and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FANTASY:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard standing there in his underwear, reaching over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Franny, could you clean out my boil again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
END OF FANTASY:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca answers Robert, half of her still in fantasy --
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's very... clean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(catching herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And clean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Very clean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
They drink. Francesca thinks she sounds like an idiot.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you must like Oiwa, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca looks at him. She wants to tell the truth, but holds back.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's... uh... uh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
She stops. Robert smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead. I won't tell anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Surprised, Francesca looks at him oddly -- as if he already knows and is giving her permission.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(tries again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
She covers her mouth, like a reflex -- worried someone heard. Robert just smiles and nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca is so taken by his understanding and acceptance, she lets the flood gates open, speaking faster than her mind can keep up --
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (without a pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate it! I hate it! I HATE IT! I hate the corn and the dust and the town and the cows and that SMELL that you love! I hate the people. Everybody knows everybody's business, I mean it's nice now and then, they're always there to help out, but that's just it, it's like they're waiting for something awful to happen to help out and when nothing awful is happening, then they just sit around and talk about what is happening which is none of their business. I want to kill them sometimes for how cruel they can be --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
Camera begins slowly moving out to a wider angle...
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- everybody's talking about poor Mrs. Delaney whose husband is having an affair with that Redfield woman and "isn't it a shame," and "isn't it awful," and the truth is THEY'RE LOVING IT! Poor woman can't even be cheated on without the grocery man knowing about it -- no one respects anyone's privacy. You're not even safe in your own home! They think they can just walk right into your house because they BAKED you something. It's like they have a secret password and YOU CAN'T KEEP THEM OUT! I live in fear of that door opening and having a peach cobbler shoved at me...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONTINUES MOS IF NEEDED)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Throughout this rapid fire monologue, camera has moved to a wide angle as Robert just sits and listens, letting her get it all off her chest. She continues as we:

INT. LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca is lying on the couch as Robert places a cold cloth on her head. Her "confession" took a lot out offer.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feeling better?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is the dizziness gone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
She sits up. She feels exposed. But also, relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I better go. You sure you're all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel so embarrassed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I... We don't even know each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(sincerely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have no reason to feel ashamed. You haven't said anything you don't have a right to. And if anybody tells you different -- you just send them to me.

</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles. He turns to exit.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Better get my stuff.

</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca surprises herself. She doesn't want him to go.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like to stay for dinner?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he turns)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.

CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca rushes in and starts to disrobe, getting ready to shower and change for dinner. She glances out the window and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert is at the water pump. His shirt is off and he is washing himself. (WE INTERCUT THE TWO.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca finds herself staring, a bit open mouthed. He has a muscular, firm body. She watches how the water cascades over his body. How he seems so unashamed, so "in his skin," moving with such strength and grace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert pauses and looks out over the open pasture. The cold water feels good. Since the pump is the back of the house, hidden from the road, no one can see him. He decides to take off his pants and cool himself further.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca begins watching this in shock until she has to literally pull herself away from the window with such a force that she rams herself into a chest of drawers, knocking over an array of perfume bottles and a mirror. She deftly catches a falling bottle and freezes. Taking a breath, she pulls herself together.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is ridiculous. Stupid!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
She replaces the bottle and heads for the bathroom quite composed, then, without warning, makes an immediate 180 degree turn and heads back to the window to sneak a peek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing him, she gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
Watching him, she is possessed by some very frightening feelings and runs from the window, into the bathroom, closing the door behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca is gathering some vegetables for dinner, from her garden. Robert is at his truck, in his pants, changing into a fresh shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca is cutting up vegetables. Robert enters with some of his gear.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just going to put some of this film in your fridge. Heat isn't too forgiving out there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
He does. On the radio, TONY BENNETT sings "WRAP YOUR TROUBLES IN DREAMS." Robert approaches Francesca.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I help?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help cook?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
They stand side by side. Francesca hands him a stack of carrots and a knife.

MONTAGE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tony Bennett's up-tempo tone plays over a series of images of Francesca and Robert talk and prepare dinner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Four hands side by side, cutting and chopping. Occasionally, a hand brushes against another as it reaches for something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Robert's hand gently touching Francesca's waist as he reaches around her for an onion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Robert lighting Francesca a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Robert brings in his cooker through the screen door. HE MAKES SURE IT DOESN'T SLAM. FRANCESCA MAKES A NOTE OF THIS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Robert opens the cooler and removes two cold beers, tossing one to Francesca.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Francesca opening a new tablecloth and spreading it out on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Francesca handing Robert plates from the shelf, their fingers only barely touching.

INT. KITCHEN - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert and Francesca are in the middle of dinner. But instead of the usual silence that surrounds Johnson family eating, Francesca is mesmerized by Robert as he manages to eat and tell a story. The scene begins with a LAUGH FROM FRANCESCA.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... No, wait, it gets better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
He stands up and acts it out for her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to get the full picture here. I have three cameras around my neck, a tripod in one hand and my pants down around my ankles. I thought this was a private bush. I look up and this gorilla, this female gorilla, is staring at me with what can best be described as the most lascivious expression I've ever seen on a female with so much body hair.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Francesca laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I freeze. 'Cause that's what they tell you to do. In this position. She comes towards me and... and she...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he stops awkwardly)
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She starts sniffing me.

</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God...

<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're blushing.

</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then what happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got engaged.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh you!

</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
She throws a napkin at him.

<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None of this is true!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it is. Except for the engagement part. She wouldn't have me, although I still get a Valentine every year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca is laughing so hard she can't breath. Robert loves making her laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ought to write these stories down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(nods, smiles shyly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sound like an artist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(supportively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think you're normal.

He looks at her in surprise. She catches herself again.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean that the way it sounded.

</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(changes subject)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you love teaching?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes. When there was a particular student who made a difference. I know they're all supposed to, but it's not true. You tend to single out one or two you think you can contribute something to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you stop?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My children. And Richard didn't like my working.

<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you miss it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca smiles, a little embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. That was...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is your home. It's not nowhere. And it's not dull.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca smiles again, this time relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see -- my favorite place...

</ROBERT>

Francesca settles in to listen, never taking her eyes off of him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's the obvious choice, but I think I'd have to say Africa. It's another world. Not just the people and the cultures but the land, the colors you see at dawns and dusks -- and the life there. It charges every molecule of air.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca is fascinated, being drawn into his imagery.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's tangible -- the moment to moment of life and death, the co-habitation of man and beast, of beast and beast, who'll survive, who won't -- and there's no judgement about it. No right or wrong or imposed morality. It's just life. It's a voyeurs paradise really because those animals don't want anybody in their business. You can watch but at a distance.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(excited)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember one time I was on a truck headed for the Niger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>

Lights begin to dim as Francesca is so taken in by his story, she begins to actually see what he is describing.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were driving north. The truck was old so I guess the sound of the motor muffled this kind of rumbling in the distance -- until finally, it was upon us like, like a hundred thunder claps all at once...

The driver veers off towards the stampede as Robert opens his door and makes his way to the flatbed part of the truck with his camera. The truck takes its position within this breathtaking force of wildlife, as giraffes, zebras and gazelles surround it -- all going in the same direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert stands in the truck, shooting as fast as he can. The truck races to keep up with the animals. Robert is so pumped he can hardly catch his breath. Suddenly, the force and beauty of these creatures causes him to lower his camera. He is unable to film it because it overwhelms him. He just stands there in awe and lets out a primal scream. The animals gradually veer off to where the truck can no longer follow. Robert watches them disappear into the distance.

She shakes her head. He runs out the screen door, not letting it slam. Francesca looks like a teenager with first date excitement.

Francesca and Robert walk through the pasture. She sniffs her arm.

Silence. They walk. It is a beautiful night.

</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
She watches him with great appreciation. He smiles at her. Instead of looking away, their eyes remained locked for a moment. There is clearly an attraction. They simultaneously look away and continue walking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca's heart is beating a mile a minute yet she can't deny she is enjoying herself. Walking side by side in silence, Francesca turns back occasionally to look at her house as they get further away from it. Suddenly, the more distant the house becomes, the more frightened she starts to feel. Something inside her knows she's going too far with this man -- too far from home. Although a part of her wants it, she is surprised to find a larger part of her finds too unknown. She stops.

Francesca looks confused for a moment, not knowing what she wants. She can't move. She searches for a way out.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like some coffee? Or maybe, some brandy?

Francesca moves about the kitchen preparing coffee -- dropping the coffee pot basket, spilling the grounds. She acts tense. Robert sits at the table opening the brandy bottle Francesca almost opened the night before, aware of her mood.

Francesca gets the coffee going then sets the table with cups and saucers.

	Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.

	Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.

	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.

	No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.

Francesca exits her bathroom, in her bathrobe, shutting the light. She is brushing her hair and thinking of Robert. She sits on the edge of the bed. She sees her reflection in a mirror on the closet door.

She stands and takes her robe off. She steps forward to look at her body -- running her hands gently around her curves, her neck, down the side of her thighs, her face, her breasts.
</DIRECTION>

She shuts off the lights and gets into bed under the covers. She closes her eyes and tentatively begins to explore her body. It is awkward for her but we can see her trying to let herself go. Until she opens her eyes in frustration. It's no good. She can't do it. She feels ashamed. The shame turns into anger.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Francesca sits at a writing table with two large books opened before her containing literary quotations. She searches for the line Robert mentioned in the pasture.

A note sits before her as well. On it reads: "Robert. Again, I'm sorry for last night. Would you like supper again tonight after you're finished. I'd like it very much if I were one of those good friends you have in the world. Anytime is fine -- Francesca... P.S. By the way, "Of what I call God and Fools call Nature" was..."

Francesca sits at the kitchen table in her bathrobe with a cup of coffee -- a comic portrait of shame and self-pity. Her hair is a mess, she hasn't showered or dressed and she stares into space while listening to the bluesy Chicago radio station.

The sink is full of dirty dishes she refuses to clean. Beside it is an ashtray of butts from the night before. She carries it over to the table and begins fingering for a butt to smoke in desperation. She lights up and stares into space.

Francesca is thrilled. Her mind races with a list of things she must do before tonight. She opens a cabinet, removes a coffee can and empties it of her house money. She quickly counts it, then shoves it into her purse.

INT. SLOW BEND SALOON/ RESTAURANT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second of two eating establishments in Winterset. A lunch time crowd fills the place. Robert is seated at the counter. He can sense their eyes on him, wondering who this stranger is and what's he doing here. He knows the whispered conversation is about him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE talk at table.

<WIFE>

	Thelma told me he checked into the Motor Inn and the bill goes to National Geographic Magazine.

	He's taking pictures of the bridges.

<HUSBAND>

	Ain't no pygmies there either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUSBAND>
<DIRECTION>
Robert wants to finish his lunch as quickly as possible. At that moment, someone enters the restaurant and all the conversation stops. He overhears one waitress turn to the other and whisper --
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God. It's Lucy Redfield.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
Both the Waitress and Robert (though more subtly) turn to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE REDFIELD WOMAN. But instead of being the harlot we might think, she's actually a rather plain, demure looking woman -- not nearly as fancy or pretty as Mrs. Delaney herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she crosses the counter, Robert immediately picks up on the vibes in the room. He notices all the patrons stare then turns away to whisper. The waitress behind the counter ignores her. A customer eating at the counter places a bag on an empty stool beside her, so the Redfield woman can't sit down near her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert and the Redfield woman's eyes meet. She is clearly uncomfortable. She turns, about to leave, when Robert clears his cameras off of a stool next to him and offers:
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got room right here if you like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
She is surprised at his courtesy. Others are astounded. Some disgusted. She accepts his offer and sits beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<REDFIELD_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDFIELD_WOMAN>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hot out there today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
She nods and smiles. The waitress tosses a menu at her and slams down a glass of water, then moves on down the counter. The Redfield woman tries to act casual, glancing through the menu. Robert subtly scans the room as all eyes are on them, then turn away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert returns his glace back to the Redfield woman who is now only pretending to read the menu. She is so embarrassed. She wants to leave but can't move.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, are you ordering anything!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
Her harsh tone startles the Redfield woman as well as Robert. Gathering her dignity, she responds.
</DIRECTION>
<REDFIELD_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Thank you. I've changed my mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDFIELD_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She politely nods to Robert, gathers her things and exits. Robert looks to the waitress, as a SECOND WAITRESS enters.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd've thrown that water right in her face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_WAITRESS>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor Mrs. Delaney.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>

The waitress walks O.S. leaving the second waitress facing Robert, who looks at her curiously. The second waitress looks back as if to say, "What business is it of yours?" and exits.

Robert nods. He decides to have some fun and test the waters a little bit.

<ROBERT>

	Isn't it awful about poor Mrs. Delaney?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
With this, the damn bursts -
</DIRECTION>
<CASHIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tragic is more like it. The pain that woman has been subjected to by that no-good husband. I never liked him. Known him for years. People say he's quiet. Well, it's the quiet ones that can sneak up behind you and stab you in the back. I heard yesterday, that she confronted him. Gave him the ultimatum and you know what he did?--

INT. DES MOINES DRESS SHOP - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Francesca sits in her slip, alone in a dressing room, with several dresses strewn about. The panic of indecision has set in. She looks at herself in the mirror and begins to doubt that seeing Robert is a good idea. Or perhaps she's imagining something that isn't there. And what about Richard?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEMORY:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few years back. Francesca is dressed up for some formal affairs. She heads down the stairs. Richard is waiting in the hall, in a suit and tie. He looks at her admiringly.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready. You have the keys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>

But Richard doesn't answer. He's just staring at her. Francesca stops. Richard looks at her like a little boy.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter?

Richard is obviously impressed by how she looks, but he can't say anything. He just smiles shyly and shakes his head to say nothing is wrong and opens the door for her.

Francesca feels guilty when a SALESWOMAN enters with a pretty summer dress.

Francesca examines it. She likes it. But the guilt...

	I don't know. I haven't bought a dress for myself in so long.

	I mean, I'm just buying a dress. It's not a special occasion or anything. I'm just shopping. Just shopping for a new dress, that's all.

Francesca enters. Robert is in the bathroom, in the shower, with the bathroom door slightly ajar. His clothes are laid on the bed with his bag beside them. A fresh shirt is folded. Francesca takes his dirty shirt and decides to clean it. As she exits, her eye can't help roaming toward the bathroom door. For a moment, she pauses to listen to the sound of the water as it hits his body.

Unlike her husband, Robert has an answer.

He can't take his eyes off of her. On the radio we hear DIHAH WASHINGTON begin to sing "IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO" -- a beautiful, blusey lovesong. Francesca pulls out a pan of hot rolls as THE PHONE RINGS. Francesca moves toward it with a roll, which she tosses to Robert. He burns his fingers and he smiles at her joke.

She hangs up. The two are now almost face to face. Robert raises her hand up and slips his free one around her waist. They begin to dance to the song. The kitchen lights have not been turned on since the sun went down. The sky, a dark orange and magenta, illuminates the room through the window. They never take their eyes off of each other. Suddenly, Robert stops.

They kiss. Hands gently explore. Their bodies touch. Their lips never spend more than seconds away from each other. Robert gently slide his hands down her breasts and torso, exploring every inch of her. Francesca grips his massive back, sliding up to his neck and hair. Robert lifts her leg and presses it against his hip, kissing her neck and shoulders. Francesca starts to lose herself, clutching his head at her breast then pulling him up to her mouth once again.

EXT. SANDWICH CAFE - BARI - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca sits at the outdoor cafe in Bari with shopping bags around her feet. She re-arranges them as the waiter passes by, mumbling something vulgar under his breath. When she looks up -- Robert is standing there. She smiles. He offers her hand. She takes it and rises. They leave the cafe.

<DIRECTION>
FRANCESCA AND ROBERT MAKING LOVE ONCE AGAIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca looks at him and understands he is giving her full permission to explore whatever she wants. Hesitantly, she crosses to him and takes his plate away. She stands before him, leaning him back into his chair. She slowly, tentatively, opens her robe. She strokes his hair, then caresses his head and gently guides it between her legs.

<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet. You want to go?

EXT. IOWA LAKEFRONT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael and Carolyn have parked in a secluded area near a lake. Some place where the moonlight and the scenery create a beautiful backdrop. They sit on the ground, leaving the headlights and the radio on. They are getting drunk sharing a bottle of whiskey.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to love this place. I used to take Kathy Reynolds down here.

</MICHAEL>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<MICHAEL>

</MICHAEL>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did we want to?

<CAROLYN>

(ignores him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right -- that is sick.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead, Michael. You've got to do this. Just think, "Today I am a man."

Michael nods and takes another swig. He reads:

Camera begins to move to wide angle as Francesca takes over.

<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"It seems, thinking about it now, that in those few days I lived a completely different life as a completely different woman. What was recognizable as me before Robert was gone. We decided to spend Wednesday away from Winterset. Away from Madison County. Away from pastures and bridges and people too familiar and reminders too painful. We let the day take us where it wanted..."

INT. DES MOINES MOVIE THEATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIVIEN LEIGH is walking down a ships stairs in the 1965 film "SHIP OF FOOLS." She is alone on screen. She walks, slightly intoxicated. Suddenly, Charleston music plays out of nowhere and she begins to dance, by herself, without any self- consciousness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the movie theatre, Robert sits with his arm around Francesca like teenage lovers. Her head is nestled in his chest as she eats from a bag of popcorn. Robert barely keeps his eyes on the screen, staring at Francesca and stroking her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOWNTOWN DES MOINES STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca and Robert walk hand-in-hand, window shopping and taking in the sights. For Francesca, it is as if she is seeing everything for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOOK STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert introduces Francesca to the photography section, showing her a book of one of his favorite photographers, Walker Evans. Francesca admires one photograph in particular -- a mother and child during the depression.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet you could do a book.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I couldn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you say that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I already tried once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca is surprised. She senses his disappointment.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's no big deal. I know how to work a camera, how to make it "make pictures" -- but I don't know how to make it make art.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least that's what six publishers said. To take what we see of this world and give it back with a bit of ourselves in it. It's a mystery to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles, supportive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you don't mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
She brushes his hair away from his face affectionately. As he looks at another book, she notices their reflection in a mirror. She puts her arm through his. They look like a couple to her -- two people who belong together.
</DIRECTION>

INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - DAY

Francesca and Robert have an elegant lunch.

	Trouble. Why?

(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wondered. Why were you trouble?

</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>

Pause. Robert doesn't reply. She looks at him curiously.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do this, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is the first time either has mentioned their time clock. Francesca nods, understandingly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the room, Francesca notices A MOTHER having dessert with her FIVE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, a pretty little girl in a fancy yellow dress. The mother rises and exits to the ladies room while the little girl continues eating a large sundae.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca smiles. As the girl licks a spoon of fudge, she sees Francesca looking at her and smiles back. Robert watches the silent exchange as he eats. Francesca makes a funny face at her. The little girl giggles as she spoons more ice-cream. Unfortunately, she spoons too much and the ice-cream falls on her pretty dress. She tries to take it off her, but she slips through her fingers and stains her even more. She looks at Francesca as if she's about to cry. Francesca smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
Robert watches her cross to the little girl and kneel beside her. He sees her consoling the little girl while taking a napkin and dabbing it in the water glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She helps the girl carefully wipe away the mess, all the while calming her. The mother re-enters the scene and shakes her head at her daughter. The daughter is afraid of being reproached but the mother is smiling. She and Francesca begin talking. She thanks Francesca. Robert sees the two mothers exchanging a moment of common experience and brief friendship. The mother and daughter take their leave as Francesca says goodbye and returns to the table. Robert looks at her lovingly. Francesca returns to her meal, but suddenly she is no longer hungry. Robert senses something is upsetting her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're somewhere else, where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh. And?

Uncomfortable silence hangs between them. A waiter passes by.

<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check, please.

OS, as the MOTHER YELLS:

	I was paying the check. She ran outside. I told her to wait for me right here! Oh God, where is she? Rebecca!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
The sidewalk is filled with people. Francesca looks to Robert. He recognizes the concern in her expression. Going home will have to wait.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll check down here. Someone call the police.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
The Maitre'd goes back inside. Francesca comforts the mother.

Through the crowd of people, Robert looks across the four lane Main Street to a LARGE CITY PARK. He crosses to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RESTAURANT - AN HOUR LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca sits with the mother as TWO POLICEMEN take down a description. The mother is crying. A waiter brings over some water for her. The Maitre'd stands by.

<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was right outside. I turned my head for a second.

</MOTHER>
<FRANCESCA>

	Yes, they are.

At that moment, the mother looks up and cries.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	REBECCA!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
She jumps out of her seat as all turn to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert holding the little girl in his arms, entering the restaurant. He carefully hands her over to the mother. The two wrap their arms around each other. Francesca looks to Robert, loving him even more now.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where was she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You crossed the street by yourself?!

	Thank you so much!

</MOTHER>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(frazzled)
</DIRECTION>

Everyone laughs out of relief. Francesca wraps her arm around his shoulder and kisses his forehead. He kisses her back.

Robert drives as Francesca sits inside his arm. Neither speaks.

Francesca calmly leads Robert up to her bedroom.

<DIRECTION>
INT. JOHNSON BEDROOM

Naked, Francesca guides Robert into bed beneath the covers. They begin to make love -- softly, lovingly -- like a couple that are beyond the erotic, discovery stage; a couple that have been together and in love for years.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER -

<DIRECTION>
Francesca puts her arm around him as he nestles his head to her breast. Francesca strokes his hair as Robert closes his eyes.

<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.

</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>

Robert settles into her. But Francesca is wide awake. Something is on her mind -- "Tomorrow? What happens after tomorrow?"

<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca is serving Robert breakfast, then sits down beside him. Silence. We can sense some tension between them -- this being their last day together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca seems ingeniously friendly. Robert is suspicious.

<FRANCESCA>

<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
Her facetiousness startles Robert.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(insulted)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(upset)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.

She takes his plate away from him, rises and throws it into the sink.

	How do you know what I experience?

</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.

(angry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!

</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
He throws a cup at the wall. It breaks apart. Covering his face, Robert turns away from her as he holds onto the sink. Francesca reaches for him but he pulls away, embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you see, I've got to know the truth, Robert. I've got to know the truth or I'll go crazy. Either way. Just tell me. But I can't act like this is enough because it has to be. I can't pretend I don't feel what I feel because it's over tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
Robert, keeping his face from her, tries to tell her:
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What makes it different, Robert?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
Robert turns to face her. He is so hopelessly in love he can hardly find the words. His eyes fill up with tears.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because... if I even think about tomorrow -- if I...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(voice cracks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	even think about leaving here without you -- I'm not sure I can... that I -
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can't even finish. He kneels down before her wrapping his arms around her and burying his face into her body. Francesca starts to cry -- out of happiness, out of pain -- holding onto him as if for dear life.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God... what are we going to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him -- over and over, not wanting to be even an inch apart. As if any space between them might separate them forever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, OS, they hear a CAR DRIVE UP to the house. They panic. Francesca runs to the window to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MADGE, a girlfriend, has come for a visit. Madge is holding a homemade dessert.

	<DIALOGUE>
	"Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(MOVES INTO KITCHEN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.

Following her into the kitchen, Francesca doesn't know which question to answer first.

Madge and Francesca sit facing the pasture beside a table with coffee and brown betty. We parachute into the middle of the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<MADGE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<MADGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.

FANTASY:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca stands behind Madge, as the latter chatters on MOS. She calmly picks up the brown betty and, from behind, shoves it into Madge's face and holds it there, trying to suffocate her with it. Madge struggles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END OF FANTASY:

Francesca's mind races as Madge continues.

	No, of course not. I'll just clean up.

INT. BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY

Francesca enters to find Richard, laying on the bed fully clothed. She sits beside him. He strokes her arm, then guides her to lay down. Once she's in his arms, he speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca knew he was going to say this. Either answer she gives frightens her.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to him and they embrace. Robert, however, fears only one response. On the soundtrack, we hear the song "DARN THAT DREAM."

INT. KITCHEN - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The song continues over the next few images. Camera slowly pans from the radio, upon which the song is playing, to a beautifully set table and candles. It arrives on Robert preparing dinner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera pans the room from two OPENED SUITCASES, as Francesca packs to leave. She moves about the room as if with blinders on -- focused on her task, refusing to take in any sign or memories that might hinder her. She is wearing a RED DRESS, with BUTTONS down the front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert stands at the sink rinsing out some utensils. Waiting for the water to turn hot, he looks out through the window above the sink. He sees a beautiful view of beautiful night. He pauses as it strikes him that this is a view Francesca has seen a million times -- that soon she would not see ever again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera follows her as she exits the bedroom with her suitcases, then walks down the hall to the stairs, then down the staircase to the front hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She quietly sets the suitcases down, hearing the radio and Robert in the kitchen. She pauses, then enters the living room. One of the throw pillows has fallen off the couch. She replaces it then takes a moment to look about the room. She slowly sits down on the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear voices of the past, auditory memories conjured up by each stick of furniture Francesca sees.

She smiles and shakes her head. Robert opens a bottle and takes a sip.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I'd like to do before we leave? I'd like to take a picture of you -- at Roseman bridge. Maybe just as the sun's coming up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I'd like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. Robert smiles back and takes another sip. Then, knowing full well what hangs heavy between them, he asks:
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me why you're not coming with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca stops pretending to eat. She looks at him, having forgotten how well he can read her.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(getting aggressive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then he can move! People move!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about us? What about me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. It could get better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(desperately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>

	We are the choices we've made, Robert.

He turns his back on her.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Robert. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(desperate to explain)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But now that you have it -
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand -- we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
She embraces him. He wraps his arms around her. He whispers.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't leave me. Don't leave me alone. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
This breaks her heart, knowing how hard it is for him to say this. She holds him tighter, until -
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen. Maybe you feel this way, maybe you don't. Maybe it's just because you're in this house. Maybe ... maybe when they come back tomorrow you'll feel differently. Don't you think that's possible?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>

	I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Don't do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to.

She cries in his arms. He kisses her as if for the last time. Then, quickly, separates himself and leaves the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert walks briskly towards his truck not wanting to look back. He gets in, starts it up and drives away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca exits the house and watches the truck recede into the distance. She stops when she reaches the front gate, leaning against it. She murmurs to herself -
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep going. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
The truck drives away. Then, suddenly, stops. Francesca's heart quickens. She watches as the truck stands on the road in the distance. As if Robert was deciding to turn around or keep going. Francesca waits. Suddenly, the door to the truck flies open and Robert exits. Francesca loses all restraint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the gate but her dress is caught on it. Robert stands by the truck. Francesca tears at the dress, ripping off a button which falls to the ground. She runs down the road. Seeing her, Robert runs towards her as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They grab each other furiously. For these few moments, all considerations are gone. As he kisses her, he murmurs:
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I forgot to take your picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
She laughs through her tears as they continue to kiss. Camera pans up to the road beyond Robert's truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE RICHARD'S TRUCK DRIVING TOWARDS THEM. For a moment it seems as if they will be caught until we realize RICHARD'S TRUCK IS BEING SUPERIMPOSED as the LIGHT GRADUALLY BRIGHTENS TO REVEAL:

<DIRECTION>
MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard, Michael and Carolyn drive down the road toward the house. Robert's truck, and all traces of him, are gone.

Francesca steps into the doorway in a house dress to welcome her family home -- wondering how this will feel.

Francesca makes small talk with the grocery lady as she buys what she needs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca places a bag of groceries on the front seat of the truck, then gets in herself to wait for Richard. She takes a deep breath and removes a handkerchief from her bag to wipe the sweat from her face. She freezes -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the windshield, she sees ROBERT standing beside his truck across the street, staring at her. Her heart stops. For a moment, she isn't even sure he's real.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The town moves about its business around them. But neither notice or care. Whatever safety or forgetfulness she felt is gone. Her feelings burst through. She sits there helpless before him -- willing to go or stay depending on what he did.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He begins walking towards her. She prepares herself. Her life will change -- it has to. There's not turning back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the closer Robert gets, the clearer he can see that she is crying. And he stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without any words, he realizes what taking her with him would mean. With just a glance, he sacrifices her. With their eyes locked in the middle of Main Street -- in front of the whole town -- they smile and say goodbye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert returns to his truck. He drives off down Main Street, taking the first left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moments later, Richard throws the feed bag into the back of his truck and gets in. Francesca is wiping her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't notice. He drives off in the same direction as Robert.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For a moment, I didn't know where I was. And for a split second, the thought crossed my mind that he really didn't want me -- that it was easy to walk away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
As they pass the corner where Robert made his left turn, Francesca turns to look and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROBERT'S TRUCK IS PARKED just off the corner. As if he had to drive away to get out of sight, but couldn't bring himself to drive any further.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sight of him hiding there breaks Francesca's heart, she turns away from her husband to hide the tears.
</DIRECTION>

Carolyn is in the yard picking vegetables. Her parents drive up in their truck. She steps out with her bag of groceries and walks briskly into the house. Richard follows more slowly with his bag of feed, stopping at the gate to pick up the button from Francesca's red dress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca enters and places her groceries on the counter. She tries to compose herself. She sees the radio before her. She turns it on. The Dinah Washington song "I'LL CLOSE MY EYES" evokes every feeling of love and loss within her. She begins to cry.

<FRANCESCA>

	Hi. I'm Francesca Johnson. I just feel awful I haven't come to visit sooner. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. Is it too late?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
Lucy is shocked and moved at the same time.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Not at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was wondering if... maybe you'd like some company.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(almost manic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I baked a cake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>

Lucy looks at the cake. She's a little dazed by all this.

EXT. IOWA LAKEFRONT - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael continues reading beside Carolyn as the sun rises.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"We became inseparable, Lucy and I. The funny thing is, I didn't tell her about Robert until years later. But, for some reason, being with her somehow made me feel it was safe to think about him. To continue loving him. The town loved talking about the two of us but we didn't care. And neither did your father. Which I thought was a lovely thing. I received Robert's letter and my photograph soon after. I always wondered if your father found them. I was never quite sure..."

At dinner, Richard remembers the button he found.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>

	Oh, Franny, is this yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>

<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I almost told him. In that moment I felt as if I couldn't hold it back. If he really loved me maybe he'd understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
She returns to her meal. The family eats in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd; V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But love won't obey our expectations. Its mystery is pure and absolute. What Robert and I had, could not continue if we were together. What Richard and I shared would vanish if we were apart. But how I wanted to share this. How would our lives have changed if I had? Could anyone else have seen the beauty of it?

INT. JOHNSON KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

And older Francesca cares for a sickly Richard. He lies in bed beside an array of medicines and tonics. She wipes his forehead with a cool cloth as he takes his pills.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>

He nods. She smiles. She shuts off the light and lays beside him.

	After your father died, I tried to get in touch with Robert but found out he had left the National Geographic soon after the Madison County. No one seemed to know where he was. My only connections to him were the places we'd been to that one day. And so each week, I'd re-visit them.

Francesca reads the letter informing her of Robert's death. She then unwraps the package to reveal a MEDALLION with her name inscribed and A PHOTOGRAPHY BOOK; a published collection of black and white photos by Robert Kincaid entitled "Four Days."

	<DIALOGUE>
	"There is a pleasure in the pathless woods... There is a rapture on the lonely shore... There is society where none intrudes... By the deep sea and music in its roar... I love not man the less, but Nature more... From these our interviews, in which I steal... From all I may be, or have been before... To mingle with the Universe and feel... What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal."

<FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were bound together as tightly as two people can be. If it hadn't been for him, I don't think I would have lasted on the farm all these years. Remember that dress of mine you wanted, Carolyn -- the one you said I never wore. Well, I know I was silly. But to me, it was as if you were asking to wear my wedding dress to go to the movies.

She slams the door behind him and talks in a irate whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have been out all night long! Do I have a right to ask where you've been or is this a family secret?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
