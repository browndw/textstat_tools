A hand reaches into a breast pocket - pulling out two passports. One is opened. Belongs to EMIL SLOVAK. The next passport belongs to OLEG RAZGUL. The hand passes the Oleg Razgul passport to the man next to him. We notice several empty airline bottles of vodka and a small disposable camera on Oleg's tray table. The passport is set down.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is empty except for one table at the end of the bar. EDDIE FLEMMING, Manhattan's most famous detective, and his savvy, black partner, LEON JACKSON are having cocktails. Eddie is smoothly handsome, tough, smart and tired. Not only is he the best homicide detective Manhattan has ever seen, he's continually mentioned in New York columns and has been the subject of several magazine articles. There's even been a TV movie about one of his biggest cases. Leon has been with Eddie a long time and was also featured in the TV movie.
</DIRECTION>

Sitting with Eddie and Leon is ROBERT HAWKINS, host and star reporter for the tabloid show, "Top Story." Hawkins is also the best in the business and has dealt with them all: Joey Buttafuco and Amy Fisher, Lorena Bobbit and OJ.

Wait staff bustles in the b.g. doing the morning set up. Hawkins listens as Eddie, cigar in hand, finishes a "war story" and a vodka tonic at the same time.

	So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go. I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car. I go to get the cigar and BOOM! All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go. Right where I was standin'. That coulda been it. I coulda had my head blown off and for what? Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over. If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.

The roof is gone. The sky is exposed. It's charred ruins, smoked beams and watery muck. Eddie and Leon are standing by what's left of the mattress, looking at Milos and Tamina's charred bodies. Eddie grips a half-smoked Cuban cigar, listening to Leon.
</DIRECTION>
<LEON>

Leon and Eddie move to higher ground - on top of a burnt TV set. Eddie hands the brushed bracelet to Leon. As Camello hacks at the floor with an ax, Jordy continues to examine the bodies and Korfin explains:
</DIRECTION>
<KORFIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They have not soot in their mouths, which means they weren't breathin' before the fire and that usually means they were deceased - and this piece of cloth that my partner found means they were wrapped up in something, probably doused with a flammable liquid and positioned like this on the bed. To the untrained eye, it looks like an accident.

	Good evening, I'm Robert Hawkins and this is Top Story. Tonight we bring you an exclusive interview with Stephen Geller - who horrified the nation two years ago when he went berserk and murdered three clerks in a Manhattan shoe store. But now, Mr. Geller's claim, spoken softly and articulately, is that he is the victim. According to Mr. Geller, the events of that fateful day were not his fault but were the fault of his psychiatrist. Hard to believe...watch.

Oleg's hand reaches in front of the lens - turning up the volume. The scene cuts back to Stephen Geller being interviewed by Robert Hawkins and his camera crew. He's sitting on the front lawn of a mental institution in a paint stained shirt. A showing of his artwork is displayed in the background. Patients peruse the paintings of weird dysfunctional faces that avoid eye contact. One of the paintings depicts Eddie Flemming and Leon Jackson.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN_GELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.

<ROBERT_HAWKINS>

	No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it. I mean, to say the least, you outta know better. You don't know her well enough.

<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer. Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer. That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that. You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case. And lemme give you another piece of advice. Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television. And when you get out there, they know your face. And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job. And I get more done because of it.

Emil raises the pistol again - pointing the gun at Eddie's left temple. Emil cocks the hammer, but Eddie avoids the gun, ducking his head to the side of Emil's arm. Standing and following his head up Emil's arm and pushing him over into the desk. Eddie then knocks Emil with the chair and Emil falls off the desk and onto the floor.

Oleg still grips the videocamera. Eddie continues around with the chair and drives Oleg back across the room - pinning him to the wall.

Oleg gets up from the sofa and goes over to get the videocamera. Eddie has managed to get the gun and comes up as Oleg is moving in with the camera and starts shooting toward Oleg - managing to shoot one of the blinds off the window and one of the lampshades off the lamp.

Eddie stumbles backward, falling over but still attached to the chair - holding the gun. Eddie can't believe he got stabbed. Blood swells around his stomach. He can't be dying. This can't be happening. He looks at Emil. The pain is terrible. Oleg has knelt down next to Eddie - getting a close up.

Leon begins to sing "Amazing Grace." Oleg PANS from the TV and focuses it on a lightbulb. Hands enter the frame - carefully pouring clear liquid into an ashtray. A long hypodermic needle slides into the ashtray - the plunger is pulled back and the needle quickly fills with liquid. Gingerly, the needle is inserted into the lightbulb. Again, the plunger moves and the lightbulb is filled and placed on a table...next to a CAN OF GASOLINE. VIDEOCAMERA ZOOMS OUT revealing...Emil sitting at a hotel desk doing this.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening. Welcome to "Top Story". Tonight, I present to you material of a graphic and violent nature never before seen on television. And I do so with a heavy heart. You will be first-hand witness to the slaying of celebrated New York City Homicide Detective, Eddie Flemming. It would be only normal to ask, why? Why are we showing something so journalist, I must show it. A democracy survives through the freedom of its media, and if we cannot see what is happening then we don't deserve our democracy, or our freedom. Eddie Flemming was my friend. I cried when I watched this footage and vowed to fight this violence with every molecule of my being from this day onward. Hopefully, this will have a similar effect on you. One final word, this material is absolutely not appropriate for children.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BATTERY PARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jordy sits in a taxi, wearing sunglasses. Looking inside the park where a POLICE BARRICADE surrounds a POLICE TUGBOAT. Cutler and Emil are arriving - Emil is being transferred to Rykers Island. Jordy pulls his .38 out of his ankle holster and sticks it in his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON METER

to $42.00. The TAXI DRIVER looks in the rearview mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<TAXI_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe this guy got off. Unbelievable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAXI_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Jordy takes out money. All he's got is fifty bucks and he crams it into the slot.
</DIRECTION>
<JORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever's leftover, keep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Jordy exits the cab. The anger rising inside his body is coming to a boiling point. He walks into the park. Leon is sitting on a bench. Just sitting there. Also filled with rage and frustration. Jordy meets his eyes. Leon gets up and walks away. Disgusted by it all. Jordy's right hand grips the gun inside his pocket as he walks on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH WIDE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Many policemen are trying to control a swarm of reporters. All are waiting for Emil. WE SEE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAWKINS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and his camera crew, and, not far from him - frustrated and frazzled, waits Nicolette. Still grieving her loss, she looks over at Hawkins and his crew. She shoots him a disgusted look - Hawkins shrugs it off. He checks his watch - anxious - looks at his cameraman.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said he'd be here. Pick him up as he comes through the crowd. Do you hear me? For Chrissakes don't miss this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWKINS>
<DIRECTION>
THE POLICE VAN PULLS UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cutler's car behind it. Emil - handcuffed - is unloaded from the van. Reporters swarm forward - Cutler gets out of his car, hurrying up, taking his place alongside Emil and the POLICE ESCORTS. The swarm follows - firing questions at Cutler. He answers the barrage of questions with:
</DIRECTION>
<CUTLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...my client was suffering from a major illness of schizophrenic nature wherein during times of intense stress, as a result of paranoid and psychotic delusions - there was impairment of his ability to appreciate wrongfullness... This is a victory for the mentally ill!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUTLER>
<DIRECTION>
Jordy walks alongside the moving mass. His eyes focused on Emil - his hand in his pocket. We notice in the crowd Max, the celebrity-crazed pyromaniac. What's he doing here? Max's hand is also stuck deeply in his pocket. A weird gleam in his eye. We see Korfin in the group, speaking to other cops. Nicolette and her camera crew are vying for their place in the mass. She watches Emil with quiet rage. Cutler continues:
</DIRECTION>
<CUTLER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...before Emil boards the police boat and heads for Rykers Island where he will be checked into the psyche ward, I want to say one last word to you all... As you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg Razgul into committing these murders, yet Oleg is still out in the street, a free man, filming gruesome murders... My client and I hope he is brought to justice in the near future.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUTLER>
<DIRECTION>
They are through the monuments, approaching the steps when Jordy passes a distracted Hawkins - who's checking his watch obsessively.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where the hell is he? Goddamn it?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWKINS>
<DIRECTION>
Jordy glares at Emil. Emil looks back at Jordy, gloating. Smiles. He won. He beat the system. Jordy suddenly erupts.
</DIRECTION>
<JORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think this is funny?? What the hell are you laughing at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Emil stares down Jordy. Jordy grips the gun inside the jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<CUTLER>

(to a nearby escort)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Officer, keep this man back, he's assaulted my client on previous occasions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUTLER>
<DIRECTION>
A PATROLMAN blocks Jordy from Emil.
</DIRECTION>
<JORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is it? This bastard kills the best cop this city ever had and we do nothing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDY>
<CUTLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may not like it marshal, but that's the law.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUTLER>
<JORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what about the other victims?? What about their families? He'll end up in some country club nuthouse while his lawyer sells his rights to the movies and we just stand here and do nothing? We let this scumbag walk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Jordy moves past the officer. Emil breaks away from Cutler. Gets in Jordy's face. Laughs quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<EMIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be careful. I can kill you. I'm insane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMIL>
<DIRECTION>
Jordy shoves Emil into Cutler. A scuffle breaks out as the cops separate the two - pulling Jordy back as we cut to:

A VIDEO POV

as it approaches Hawkins from behind. A hand dips into frame tapping Hawkins on the shoulder. Hawkins turns - sees who he's been waiting for. His face lights up.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you wouldn't show up. Where is it? Where is the tape?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWKINS>
<DIRECTION>

In disguise - sunglasses and a hat. Holding his videocamera.
</DIRECTION>
<OLEG>

	It's all in here. All in here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLEG>
<DIRECTION>
MEANWHILE JORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has been separated from Cutler and Emil as Hawkins' voice cuts above the din of the crowd, announcing excitedly:
</DIRECTION>
<HAWKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute, Bruce! We've got some interesting evidence, something you should look at!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWKINS>
<DIRECTION>
Reporters turn as Hawkins speaks. His crew is taping as he continues introducing his broadcast:

	<DIALOGUE>
	I have exclusive rights to the ORIGINAL UNCUT videotape shot by Oleg Razgul, proving Emil Slovak was not insane! Hard to believe...watch!

Oleg PLAYS his videocamera as lenses focus, we see excerpts of the moment where Emil explains to Eddie:
</DIRECTION>

(points to Oleg)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUTLER>
<DIRECTION>
The police are attempting to get to Oleg, but a sea of reporters separate them. We hear the staccato calls from the press corps. Nicolette looks on in amazed outrage. Jordy notices and starts moving towards her. Before the POLICE CAPTAIN in charge of the detail can react, the rage which killed Milos, Tamina and Honey wells up inside Emil. He yells at Oleg!
</DIRECTION>
<EMIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Traitor!!

</OLEG>
<DIRECTION>
Oleg pulls his gun. Emil pulls Cutler in front of him as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oleg FIRES! Cutler is SHOT and goes down. Hawkins swings his camera over to Oleg - filming the would-be assassin. Oleg FIRES off another SHOT - hitting the COURT OFFICER escorting Emil. Emil grabs the down officer's gun. He swivels - rapid fires at Oleg. Oleg topples. People are screaming. It's CHAOS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emil darts forward - grabbing Nicolette who is closes to him. He puts his handcuffed arms over her head - points the gun at her head.
</DIRECTION>

Cops reluctantly lower their weapons. But Jordy is still aiming his gun at Emil. He is the only one who hasn't lowered his gun. The captain is yelling at him.

</EMIL>
<DIRECTION>
Jordy doesn't lower his gun. Emil tries to back away. The reporters - who have ducked and covered - are still keeping their lenses pointed at the scene. This is great film! Jordy follows after Emil - his gun raised.
</DIRECTION>
<JORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let her go.

</EMIL>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is screaming at once. It's mass chaos. The captain is trying to keep everyone calm. Cops following along with their weapons lowered. All except Jordy - his gun still pointed at Emil. Hawkins can't believe what footage he's getting. He's pushing his cameraman to the front of the pack. Trying to get the best coverage.

	<DIALOGUE>

The captain is yelling at Jordy.

<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Jordy struggles to get a clean shot at Emil. He can't. His heart pounding. Adrenaline pumping. He suddenly lowers his weapon. Turns away. The captain visibly relaxes. Emil laughs. Jordy suddenly turns back. Quickly raises his weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JORDY SHOOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emil takes a shot in the leg. Nicolette ducks under the handcuffs and scurries away. Emil looks at Jordy - surprised he shot him. Jordy FIRES AGAIN. Emil is hit in the shoulder. Jordy marches forward, EMPTYING HIS CLIP in Emil's chest. Abdomen. Head. Gun fire echoes in the humid air as Emil stumbles back. Does a funny dance and drops to the ground. Dead. The captain yells.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OLEG'S VIDEO POV
</DIRECTION>

as it ZOOMS from the Statue of Liberty and PANS to Oleg. He looks in the lens with his dying eyes, gasps:
</DIRECTION>
<OLEG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A film...by Oleg Razgul.

	Wait a minute. Where are you going? Learn from Eddie. Talk to the court of public opinion. Take the credit, you need it.

She turns him around. Straightens his tie. Starts to push the hair out of his face but he stops her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Jordy puts something in her hand. She looks down. It's EDDIE'S BADGE. The one Jordy took out of Daphne's bathroom. She looks up at him. Her cameraman rolling. The lens pointed at Jordy. Jordy looks at Nicolette. Meets her eyes. He doesn't want to make a statement. He still doesn't want the fame. He did learn from Eddie. Eddie was killed because he was a celebrity. Jordy wants no part of it.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut.
