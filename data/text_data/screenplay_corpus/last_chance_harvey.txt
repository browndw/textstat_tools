:SC: LAST CHANCE HARVEY

Sound of a piano being played. Sparse but beautiful.

FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RECORDING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARVEY SHINE, mid-60's, sits at a piano in a scruffy recording room, tinkering. We hold on his slightly sad, intense gaze. Just then a shaft of crude light illuminates him, accompanied by a knocking sound. From behind a studio window, JOHNNIE, a young rocker type in his 20's beckons. Harvey closes the piano lid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STUDIO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnnie, unpacking his lunch and turning on various buttons, sits at a mixing desk. In front of him are 2 large TV monitors. Harvey joins him.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put my score up first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<JOHNNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't want to hear it, Harvey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNIE>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, but I want to hear it. Put it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<JOHNNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm backed up already, Harvey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNIE>
<HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnnie, you were the one that was late. Just put it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Johnnie reluctantly presses various buttons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A `cheesy' commercial for a washing detergent plays. It is accompanied by a jolly classical score. Harvey looks on forlornly at his work. As it comes to an end with a flourish, Harvey lowers his head. Beat. Johnnie glances at him.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Harvey. Marvin wants me to present my ideas while your away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Harvey looks up, confused.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<JOHNNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I'm not doing myself any favours here, Harvey. But, I'd watch your back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNIE>
<DIRECTION>
We hold on Harvey's tired, pensive face.
</DIRECTION>

INT. STUDIO CAR PARK / QUEENS - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Harvey hurriedly exits the studio, catching up with a man walking to his car.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>

	Marvin? Hey, Marvin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<MARVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Harvey. Shouldn't you be in London?

</MARVIN>
<HARVEY>

	Yeah, I'm heading there now. What's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<MARVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?

</MARVIN>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnnie said something about you wanting him to present on Monday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<MARVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah, No, I was just thinking that, what with you being in London - you should stay a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARVIN>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<MARVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no need to rush back. Enjoy your daughter's wedding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARVIN>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<MARVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Johnnie can do it. I mean, he can pitch the Samuelson account.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARVIN>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm coming back. Those are my connections. They have been for years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<MARVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know but... they've got new people running things over there. I think they're after something...

<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<MARVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	`There in person'? Harvey, nobody cares.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARVIN>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to stand behind my music!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<MARVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're demos! - They're already pressed. No one needs to be there. They're not looking for you, they're not looking for me. They just need a fucking track.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat/sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harvey, you haven't booked a top line in 8 months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARVIN>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got me doing triangle chimes for Christ's sake - give me something to compose!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<MARVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I'm trying to tell you! It's not about composition! It's different now!

Silence. Harvey looks at Marvin.

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enjoy London.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARVIN>
<DIRECTION>
And with that Marvin gets in and drives off, leaving Harvey standing alone in the car park. We hold on his face - he's tired. He looks about him, then down at his raincoat draped over his arm. He lifts it and drapes it over the other arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BLACK.

INT. PLANE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harvey, seated in a crowded economy cabin, looks down from the now extinguished seat-belt light. He looks a little hot. Reaching up to turn on the air, he knocks his tray - knocking his drink into his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
An attractive middle-aged woman, seated next to him, looks over.

<HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(to his neighbour)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why's it always me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
The woman, perhaps wary of the length of the flight, smiles noncommittally. The Stewardess returns.
</DIRECTION>
<STEWARDESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall I take that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEWARDESS>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks... And could I get another?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<STEWARDESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A whiskey, wasn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEWARDESS>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. `Jamesons', no ice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
The Stewardess heads off. Harvey mops himself up. He places the small mass of wet towels on his tray and sighs. Glancing out the window, he then turns to the woman.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A holiday?

The woman looks over.

Harvey nods.

	<DIALOGUE>
	She's marrying an American. But for some reason we've all got to go over to London.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told her we had a perfectly good wedding system here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat/expecting more of a response)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They both work there, you see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
The woman smiles again, then looks up as the Stewardess returns with Harvey's drink.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Harvey is about to continue speaking when the woman interrupts.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm really sorry but I have a meeting in the morning and I must try and get some sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... Of course. I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just, I'll be useless - unless I get some sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
The woman covers herself in a blanket and turns out her light, turning herself away from Harvey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hold on Harvey from a distance, spotlit in a sea of darkness.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harvey enters the room. He places his case on the bed, takes off his jacket and goes to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A roller blind is pulled down. Harvey tugs on the cord, to no avail at first. Then suddenly it whips up, causing Harvey to duck backwards as the flailing cord almost takes his eye out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Warily, Harvey steps forward and looks down at the busy street below. He goes to open the window but it is stuck. He tries again - but it won't budge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around the room, then up at the now fully contracted blind. Tentatively he reaches up and pulls the cord to lower the blind a little. It slowly starts to unravel and unravel...and unravel, until it hits the bottom of the window sill with a gentle thud. Harvey stands in semi-darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, to his relief, his phone rings. He hurries over to the bed and retrieves it.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>

Harvey enters the rest-room and heads to a bank of basins. He turns on a tap and bends down - drinking profusely. He splashes his face then rises and begins to dry it with some paper towels.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fuckin' asshole!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Harvey suddenly bends over as though he'd been punched hard in the stomach. He rises, red in the face, holding his nose, desperately trying to hold it in. But he can't - Harvey sobs huge heaving muffled cries...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, someone enters. Head down, Harvey lunges for the door and exits.

INT. LADIES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Bride and Groom stand at the head of the room, saying their vows. Harvey stands near the back, looking on. As the ceremony is concluded the audience spontaneously burst into applause.

<HARVEY>

	Marvin. It's Harvey. Listen, there's been a mess up, the traffic was crazy. I'm going to have to reschedule the pitch slightly. Frank can set up.

<KATE>

<DIRECTION>
Kate's mum pulls the phone away from her ear, perplexed by the lack of response. Her eyes wander to the window. Drawing back the curtain, she looks out. POV: The Neighbour, now sporting a white apron, busies himself as usual. He suddenly bends down and heaves what would best be described as a body bag onto his shoulder.

</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.

The boy remains silent, keeping his gormless gaze fixed on Kate.

<BRIAN>

Harvey suddenly stands and clears his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um... Excuse me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Nobody really hears. He picks up his glass and a spoon and begins to tap it. People stir and turn to Harvey. Brian comes to a stop. Jean looks on furious. Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry Brian... Sorry to interrupt.

Everyone stares at Harvey. Silence.

<HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

A waiter brings Harvey a microphone.

</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For God's sake Harvey, don't make a scene.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Harvey stares out at the party. They all stare back at him. He glances down at Kate who smiles back. Harvey lifts the microphone up off the table and raises it to his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No Jean. I want to make a scene. You know. I'm tired of being embarrassed.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>

(MC)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and Gentlemen, the first dance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
The BAND strike up as Susan and Scott take to the dance floor. They dance a slow dance. Harvey and Kate sit watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a while Susan, looks over for her Father. Harvey hesitates, before Kate encourages him up. She plucks a flower from the table display and places it in his lapel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harvey joins Susan and Scott on the dance-floor. Shaking Scott's hand, he leads Susan into a dance.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for coming back Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for having me back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Kate looks on, as Harvey dances happily with his daughter. Feeling something, she turns to find the eight year old's head slumped against her shoulder as he sleeps soundly. Kate smiles at her lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back on the dance-floor, Harvey encourages Brian to take over the dance with Susan. Harvey turns away and is joined by Uncle Fred and gang. They all chat animatedly. Uncle Fred pushes Harvey into a dance with his wife. A `Boogie' strikes up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate looks on as Harvey dances and reunites with his extended family. She sees the delight in his face. She looks around at all the happy faces. It's time perhaps to let the family celebrate alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Extricating herself from the sleeping boy, she pushes two chairs together and makes a bed for him. Covering him in a jacket, she glances back at the dance-floor before turning to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back on the dance-floor, a `Boogie' is in full swing. Harvey caught up in the fun, energetically swings Aunt Maddie around. He suddenly catches himself and turns to his table to look for Kate, but finds it empty save for a row of dozing children.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harvey makes his excuses and turns away, looking for Kate amongst the crowded room.
</DIRECTION>

On turning into the hall, he sees Kate standing in the distance. Just then, she steps forward and out of sight. Harvey runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR / CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate stands in the empty elevator, waiting for the doors to close. She stares at her feet. Just then we hear a burst of a piano being played. It stops. Kate looks up to see, across the hallway, in an empty conference room, Harvey seated at a grand piano. He smiles a showman's smile before giving it another `old school' burst.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops again. Kate smiles. Just then the doors begin to close. Kate reaches forward and presses a button - opening them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harvey starts up again - but this time he plays something sincere - beautiful. Kate listens before slowly stepping out of the elevator. She walks towards him, joining him at the piano.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harvey slides along the seat and indicates for Kate to join him. She does so and listens as Harvey plays beautifully. He's good.

He finally brings the piece to an end.

Harvey, a man, seemingly impatient to start a `new life', runs up the steps. Surprised at first by his agility, he begins to slow. He stops to catch his breath. Suddenly his spare hand holds tight onto the bannister. Unsteady Harvey sits down. Close up on Harvey's face, confused. He tries to stand but again is forced back down. He begins to place his coffee on the stair next to him, but suddenly shudders, grabbing his shoulder. The coffee topples, spilling down the steps.
</DIRECTION>

</OONAGH>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't. I won't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Oonagh continues to eye Harvey. Finally...
</DIRECTION>
<OONAGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's not here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OONAGH>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<OONAGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's left for the day.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you might find her at her class.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at her watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it starts around now. Down on the Southbank. At the National.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OONAGH>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<OONAGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh you do, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, go on. Go get her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OONAGH>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Harvey turns and hurries away. Oonagh and Aggie share a smile.

INT. WRITING CLASS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The blood oozes from his wound like dark chocolate on a warm summer's day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate sits listening in a daze, as `mild-mannered Mike' unleashes his latest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WATERLOO BRIDGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harvey alights from the Taxi, paying the driver. He runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLASS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone gathers their things as the class wraps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WATERLOO BRIDGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harvey hurries towards the Southbank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SOUTHBANK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate comes down from the upper terrace of the National, saying her good-byes to her classmates. In her hand she holds a book. As she turns she sees Harvey coming to a stop in the distance. She momentarily falters before approaching.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're still here - still in London...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kate, I just wanted to apologise and explain...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you don't have to - explain - it's fine -
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, but I do -
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't need to hear - it's fine, seriously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I want to...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(comes out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had to go to Hospital.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God! Why?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's nothing, I'm fine, I just forgot to take my pills. I have this condition, I've had it since I was a kid - it's an irregular heart- beat sort of thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arrythmia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! How do you know what it is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling a little sheepish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My...My father has it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, young men get it too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Kate can't help but smile. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kate, I'm so sorry I wasn't there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Kate takes a breath, and gives him the practical response she's gone over in her head.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harvey, I like you, I really do. And I had a lovely time - it was great. But, you know, I don't really do fountains at noon.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I live in Willesden. And you live - in -
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	White Plains.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. And we're not teenagers, so - you know, monday morning and life kicks in, all that jobs and family and brown envelopes with bills in - it was a lovely day and I won't forget it, but it's not exactly real life...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is. It can be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Harvey, it's not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kate, I want this. I want you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
A button is pushed in Kate.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's not just about you, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know anything about me. Look at me. It's pathetic. I expected you not to show for God's sake. I think I even wanted you not to be there, it's easier that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You - you just dive in wherever, deep end, whoosh. But, I'm not your bloody swimming pool Harvey.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(starting to break)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I am not going to do it, I'm not going to do it because it will hurt. Not right now, maybe, but soon - there will be a "it's not quite working is it" or a "I need some space" or whatever it is and it'll end and it'll hurt and I won't do it, I won't and...I...Oh fuck, I don't want to cry. I don't want this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate turns and walks away, standing by the balustrade, looking down at the river below. Harvey watches. She takes a seat on a bench. Harvey gives her, her space. Then slowly he approaches, leaning against a tree nearby. Long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's actually easier for me to be disappointed. I think I'm actually angry at you for trying to take that away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Long beat. Just then Kate's phone rings. She reaches into her bag and takes it out. She stares at the phone, thinking for a beat, before answering.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (firmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mum, I love you, but not now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She hangs up. Long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should I take that as a hopeful sign?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Kate can't help but smile.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you just give me a little wider smile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling/laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shut up, Harvey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Kate collecting herself, looks up at Harvey.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how's this going to work, Mr Shine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have absolutely no idea...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it will.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I promise you that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Kate stares at Harvey for the longest while. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall we walk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Harvey nods.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Kate gathers up her things, stands and joins Harvey. They begin to walk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a short while Kate stops, puts her hand on Harvey's shoulder and takes off her shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Harvey glances down at Kate's feet, then up at her.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're my kinda girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Harvey and Kate smile. And as they walk away from us we hear.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you ask me those questions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which ones?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, from the airport. When I wouldn't stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, the questionnaire.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok. Name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harvey Shine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Place of residence?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<HARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm in transition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
We watch as Harvey and Kate disappear into the sea of London...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
