EXT. STREET - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Theo walks outside with his coffee. All around him, people have stopped, their faces turned upward, transfixed by the news. Atop some buildings, old billboard style LED screens display the coverage. Some of the pixels are burnt out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a nearby wall, a mural of the country's current leader, known only as the "Warden." A stoic visage with steely, watchful eyes.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo continues past dusty storefronts. Homeless huddle in doorways, bundled in threadbare blankets. Pedestrians hurry by, on their Monday morning rush to work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo sets his coffee cup atop a post box. A few cars roll by. Mostly "older" vehicles -- 2008's, a couple of 18's. Some motorized rickshaws, a double-decker bus with metal mesh on the windows. Bicycles. He takes a flask from his pocket, unscrews the top, about to pour into his coffee, when behind him
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- BOOM! A BOMB EXPLODES inside the cafe, blowing out the windows, shaking the ground. Theo's knocked off his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smoke pours through the shattered facade of the cafe. The counter where Theo stood moments before, simply gone. WAILS of pain as people stagger out of the blackened wreckage, bleeding, covered in debris. A woman splattered in blood, holding her own severed hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo gets up, shell-shocked, hands pressed against his ears. SHRIEKING ALARMS from nearby buildings blending with the "Eeeeeeeee" of his ringing ears...

The LOUD RUMBLE of steel wheels on a stone floor, aged MAINTENANCE WORKER rolls a heavy bin out the front doors of the lobby. He passes Theo who is on the other side of the open doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo, looking lost, disheveled, walks in and approaches the SECURITY GUARD. He displays his ID, looks into a retinal scanner and moves toward the metal detector. Absently, he begins to empty his pockets -- then stops, pressing his palms against his ringing ears, staring off with a lost expression. A beat. He notices the guard looking at him expectantly. He then continues through the metal detector.

A wall of locked drawers, like safe deposit boxes. Block letters spell out: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. Theo slips a small key into one of the boxes and slides out a long metal tray containing stacks of coupons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the side of the tray, a digital readout: 1,028. Theo takes out five coupons, and the readout instantly reflects the change: 1,023. Tearing a corner from a piece of paper, Theo fashions three tiny spitballs and, with a quick glance over his shoulder, slips them between the remaining coupons. The readout turns back to 1,028. Satisfied, Theo slips the pilfered coupons into his pocket.

A mushroom cloud over Beijing. The battered Eiffel Tower surrounded by ruins. Tanks in the streets at Washington Square. Militias on the march in Oslo. Riots in the streets of Rio. Only one Petronas Tower still standing in Kuala Lumpur...

The montage ends with an image of Big Ben, still ticking, its famous chimes BOOMING on the soundtrack. Title: "OTHER - COUNTRIES FALTER. ENGLAND SHOULDERS ON." Then, superimposed over this, the ghostly, domineering face of the Warden.

INT. TRAIN - DAY

Theo sitting next to the window of a passenger train, watching the flat screen mounted on the back of the seat in front of him. His eyes begin to close as the soundtrack's PATRIOTIC MUSIC swells... Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POCK! POCK! Rocks smack against the side of the train, jolting Theo out of his sleepy moment. He looks out...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GANG is hurling rocks and bottles. Some of the faces are covered in war paint. They're mostly "ZEDS" -- 20-year-olds, members of the final generation. The gang disappears behind a billboard: "IS YOUR NEIGHBOR A TERRORIST? REPORT ALL SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY."
</DIRECTION>

Another billboard flashes by: "AVOIDING FERTILITY TESTS IS A CRIME!" Graffiti on a wall: "LAST ONE TO DIE PLEASE TURN OUT THE LIGHT."

EXT. TRAIN STATION - AFTERNOON

Stepping off the train, Theo passes police officers patrolling with German Shepherds. A pleasant female VOICE on a taped loop announces: "Transit Papers must be current and verifiable. Travel to Zone One requires a valid Zone One pass. Travel to Zone Two requires..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo joins a queue to exit the station. Up ahead, passengers swipe ID cards and push through turnstiles. Off to one side, police stand guard over detained TRAVELERS (early 30's), some sitting on their luggage. Tears roll down the face of one woman as she WHINES to the others in Dutch.
</DIRECTION>

Theo glances at the woman, then looks away. When he reaches the front of the line, he pulls out his ID card -- fastened to a self-coiling chain -- and swipes through the turnstile.

A beautiful sunlit beach. Waves crashing in the b.g., palm trees, a gentle breeze.

A female form approaches wearing a sarong. She's carrying a tray with one perfectly designed tropical drink centered on it. The sun is behind her, partly silhouetting her. When sh- reaches us, she smiles, impossibly beautiful, youthful, the sun glistening behind her long hair.

Dressed for work, Theo walks out of Starbucks with his coffee in hand. A bit of visual deja vu as he stops at a mailbox to pour some whisky from his flask into his cup. He takes a sip and heads down the street
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo passes a row of apartment buildings. As we move with him, the multicolored facades behind him casually give way to a wall of riot shields. He seems oblivious as he app- roaches the intersection, where...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Police Officers butted next to each other block off the cross street. Theo barely glances at the human barricade, when a Police Dog lunges at him, SNARLING. Theo jumps back, dropping his coffee, spilling it everywhere --
</DIRECTION>
<THEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEO>
<DIRECTION>
He now notices the activity on the street beyond the barricade: Bewildered faces of frightened NORTH AFRICAN MEN and WOMEN, some with scarves around their heads, being lead out of their homes by uniformed officers... a school bus, painted over black, waiting for them in front of the building. Then, someone YELLING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo looks up to see objects, personal possessions being thrown out of an upper-floor window. A jewelry box smashes onto the street. A policeman trying to keep order...

Theo looks up at Peter. Then, without saying a word, he opens the folder, picks up a stamp and stamps the various forms, barely glancing at the pages. He then signs them, closes the folder and hands it back to Peter.
</DIRECTION>
<THEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEO>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Then Peter turns away. As Peter heads out into the hallway, TWO MEN pass him on their way in. One is a head taller and a foot wider than Theo, dressed in a baggy maroon jogging suit. The other is smaller, slickly dressed with gold inlays in his teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo quickly shrinks down in his chair and slips under his desk, huddling there, listening to the SOUND of approaching footsteps. The footsteps stop near his desk...

EXT. MINISTRY OF ENERGY BUILDING - ALLEY - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Theo bangs out a side door and hurries down the alley...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quickly putting as much distance between the office and himself as he can. He rounds a corner, slows down, trying to catch his breath. Up ahead, a MOTHER (30's) is pushing a pram down the street. A YOUNG COUPLE approach, crouching to look at the infant and cooing "Lovely, lovely baby."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the YOUNG MAN grabs the infant and runs. The mother chases after him SCREAMING... and the man TOSSES the WAILING baby to his GIRLFRIEND. The mother lunges at the girlfriend, PLEADING, but she LAUGHS and tosses the flailing baby back to her boyfriend -- playing a horrific version of keepaway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The frantic mother does her best to stop them when, abruptly, the man raises the baby over his head and SLAMS it head-first into the pavement... The baby shatters... porcelain and springs and computer chips flying... a tiny blue eye rolls to a stop... The mother crumbles to her knees, wailing as she gathers the pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo watches the pranksters dart off LAUGHING. He doesn't notice TWO MEN coming up behind him, pulling on ski masks. Then, they're on him --

A van pulls up alongside them, the door sliding open. Theo is shoved inside. A motorcycle skids to a stop nearby. The gunman hops on the bike, and the motorcycle speeds off, racing against traffic along the one-way street. The van takes off in the opposite direction.
</DIRECTION>

INT. VAN - DAY

Theo stares at four masked faces. He's frightened and confused... Clearly these are not the men who were after him earlier. A burlap sack is whipped over Theo's head and we...

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... a fuzzy, overexposed silhouette moving in front of a light, reaching around to remove his handcuffs. A second human shape moving closer, right up to his face and..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... slowly coming into focus: He's looking at the face of an angel. JULIAN TAYLOR is about Theo's age. Life on the run has taken its toll, but she still has the radiance of someone who believes in her cause. Julian is the woman in Sandra's photographs. A scar runs down the side of her face.

Theo blinks, everything corning into focus, a few shafts of daylight in the otherwise huge, darkened space. Silhouettes of his four abductors, still wearing their ski masks, standing in the shadows.

A beat, and the Smaller Man releases Theo's hand. The SOUND of FOOTSTEPS receding. Theo crawls painfully down the hallway to his door. He struggles to his knees, leaning against the - wall. He then reaches inside his jacket with his good hand and pulls out -- his flask. He manages to unscrew the top and gulp the booze down his aching throat.

Theo walks down the hall with a bit of a limp. There's a small Band-Aid above his eye and a splint on his finger.

One is on a ladder, the other passing him some tools.

Rolling clouds across a glorious blue sky. You almost don't notice the pixels.

	We just moved to Paris. We didn't have anything, a mattress, two cups. We were so broke. One day I finished early at the Sorbonne and I saw her from the window, coming home, carrying flowers. There was a curtain that was our closet, and I hid behind it. I was going to surprise her.

WOOF! Two Irish Wolfhounds laying on the floor in front of the David. Theo doesn't speak dog, but knows that means stop. Deep growls, the Wolfhounds standing up.

Tom points to the coat rack. Theo crosses to it and glances through an open door into the next room: Luke is putting the black satchel in a closet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rain has stopped. Theo, wearing a long tweed coat, stands outside the farmhouse. He takes the first sip from the bottle. Tom catches up, rifle in hand.

</THEO>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeh.

</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
A frayed rope dangles from a thick branch, moving with the breeze. A faint smile on Tom's face, a memory.

Theo steps through the wooden door. Miriam stops at the threshold.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll wait outside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Miriam closes the door. The old stone barn houses forty cows and industrial milking equipment. Theo spots Kee standing among the cows in the back. He starts toward her and...
</DIRECTION>
<KEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know they chop the poor cow's tits? They do -- zzzt. Gone. Only leave four. To fit the machine. Why not make machines to fit the cow? Wacko, eh?

</THEO>
<DIRECTION>
Kee steps from behind the cow. Her arm covering her swollen breasts, her hand covering her panties. She's staring straight into his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo is paralyzed at the sight of her naked form. The curve of her hip. Her hair dangling over her shoulders. Her taut belly. A million possibilities flash through his mind, but there can only be one explanation: Kee is pregnant.

</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>

Kee immediately retreats behind the cow, covering herself up.

<MIRIAM>

</MIRIAM>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And who is she? Nobody authorized it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's her body.

Luke looks at Miriam. Seems to consider this. Then:

Luke turns an eaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TV: Grainy footage of the Multipla approaching from the opposite direction, the windshield blasted out. The image is blurry. Then a series of FREEZE FRAMES: Kee, Luke, Miriam, Julian, and Theo.
</DIRECTION>
<NEWSWOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any citizens with information regarding the identity of these killers should report to the Ministry of Security immediately.

	</DIALOGUE>
</NEWSWOMAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Luke shuts off the TV with the remote and turns to the - assembly of the Five Fishes -- about fifteen men, a few women -- gathered in the musty living room. Theo stands in back.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was broadcast an hour ago. It's only a matter of time before identifications are made. For the present, it's too dangerous to proceed with the original plan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Kee squeezes Miriam's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Julian wanted her to go to Iceland.

</MIRIAM>
<FISH_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not all of us agreed on that.

	She is public -- She was on the telly! A dead cop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FISH_2>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Warden would never let the people know that an illegal became pregnant. He'd lock Kee up, take the child and parade an Englishwoman as the mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And a baby in the hands of the Warden would perpetuate the regime.

</LUKE>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why we must go to Iceland!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<FISH_4>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes-- The Human Project! They're all waiting for her. The scientists.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FISH_4>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's too late for that. Our faces are on TV, we'd never be able to reach the coast. It was agreed that getting Kee to Iceland was the best choice, but the reality has changed. We will have to adapt to it: The baby will have to be born here. After the birth, when the time is right, we will show the country we can do what the government cannot --

He looks out at the others...
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have all suffered under the tyrant's heel. Our brothers and sisters have been tortured, imprisoned, murdered, because their hearts burned with the flame of truth. It's this flame the Warden fears. It is this flame that spreads. We have been handed a torch in the form of a child. As the flame of truth obliterates darkness, so shall this new flame destroy the Warden and his regime!

SHOUTS of "Yes!"; "He's right!"

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Quiet. One light burns in the living room. Tom keeping guard at the door. The hum of a motorcycle in the distance, growing closer. Faintly, its HORN sounds three times.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo asleep, lying in a lower bunk. A CREAK. Past Theo's face, a FOOT descends the bunked ladder. Theo's eyes open: Fish 1 is covertly climbing down the ladder. He quietly joins Fish 2 who is freshly out of bed and is looking out the window. From outside, MUFFLED VOICES. The two Fish slip quickly out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo gets up, moves to the window. Theo's POV: Two Zeds on a motorcycle... the driver straddling the bike, the rider slumped over, clinging to him. Theo recognizes the driver: Patric. Cut, bloody, clothes torn, soaked to the bone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patric is pleading with Luke and Ian.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...quickly!.. quickly!.. He needs to be treated.

Fish 1 and 2 (from Theo's room) join them. Ian motions toward the slumped figure.

Tom disappears into the bathroom. Luke, Patric, and Ian head into the kitchen and close the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo starts down the stairs, toward the back door as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom steps out of the bathroom with an armful of medicine and supplies. No place to hide. Theo backs against the wall, waiting for Tom to pass. Tom walks out the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo steps out the back door... SQUISH! Theo's expression his socks are soaked in the cold mud. He sloshes quietly alongside the farmhouse, no coat, shivering in the cold. He reaches the kitchen window and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke pacing, Patric in a chair, Ian leaning on the table.

INT./EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Theo dons the tweed overcoat, looks out the side door: There's a row of six cars parked in front of him. Two Fishes standing nearby. Activity in the barn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo steps out the door... SQUISH! Theo's expression -- he forgot to get his shoes. He continues, moving quietly to the car in front of him. He opens the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Through the windshield, Theo sees the Fishes up ahead. He reaches down to the hood release -- POOK! The hood pops open. The Fishes don't hear it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE FIRST CAR

Theo squatting, sneaking around to the front of the vehicle. Lifting the hood quietly. Reaching in... YANKING OUT the distributor cap. He gently lets the hood down.

<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE SECOND CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo repeating the operation. Reaching for the hood latch, when:

Fish 2 returns from the barn, on a beeline for the car. His hands and coat stained with blood. Theo hunches on the car floor.
</DIRECTION>
<FISH_2>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shite, he looks bloody awful.

Fish 2 reaches in the car, just above Theo's head, feeling for: a pack of cigarettes on the dash.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His bones are sticking out, no skin, no way to hold the blood in...

Theo has the hood up on the last car, he slips the distributor cap in his coat pocket, eases the hood down, glances over at...

The woods past Jasper's home becoming dark, shadowy shapes as the last rays of daylight fade. Smoke wafts from Jasper's stone chimney.

EXT. BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glistening blue wave, rolling luxuriously toward the beach. The wave slowly ebbs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and we become aware of a figure lying in the sand... perhaps asleep. Empty liquor bottles poke up from the sand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another frothy wave rolls in, just reaching the still, prone figure, his back to us...
</DIRECTION>

Past him, a woman is hurrying out of the surf, her shorts and top soaked.. She's smiling, lifts a beach ball from the sand And we can make out, now, that it's Sandra.

<DIRECTION>
ON THE SCREEN, the vague infrared image of a car pulling up to the perimeter of Jasper's property. Then, a second car. Both cars rolling slowly forward with their headlights off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first car stops. The passenger door opens, and a man gets out and stares at the fake bushes that obscure the road to Jasper's home. The man gazes upward... it's Luke.
</DIRECTION>
<THEO>

	Shit.

JASPER'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jasper enters the living room. He flicks on the stereo, cranks the volume, BLASTING "Ruby Tuesday. He sits down in his chair facing his wall of photos, his eyes on one of Sandra.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the windows -- the dark shape of the Fishes' car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAUXHAUL - DAYBREAK

Theo at the wheel. Miriam and Kee in back. Theo's face is set as the car winds up a steep path through the woods, emerging out on the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HILLTOP - DAYBREAK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... hilltop. Theo stops at the top of the hill. He gets out of the car, hurries to the edge of the ridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance he can see Jasper's home. A couple of Fishes stand outside the door. Jasper between them, seems to be calmly deflecting their questions. From here, they look slightly larger than black dots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, Patric hurries out the door, holding the tweed overcoat Theo took from the farmhouse. He shoves Jasper now, shouting questions. The Fishes circling Jasper; someone pushes him roughly to the ground. One of the Fishes pulls a revolver, and we hear the flat POP of a gunshot. They shoot Jasper in the foot. He crumbles in pain. They continue to question
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
him. Unhappy with Jasper's answers, they shoot him again, in the hand this time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo watches helplessly, the ordeal tearing his heart out. Patric lifts Jasper from the ground and the old man appears to break, yelling out and pointing down the road. The Fishes seem satisfied. Luke moves in, takes the pistol from one of the others and aims it at Jasper's heart. POP... and it's over.
</DIRECTION>

Theo stares.

Theo answers with a look. Not another word. Theo puts it in gear, floors the accelerator. The Vauxhaul bounces through the woods, out onto...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ABANDONED COUNTRY ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and speeds down the wide, deserted road, toward Rye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAUXHAUL - DAYBREAK

Theo staring silently and darkly out the windshield. Miriam and Kee consumed by grief. Shadows from the muddy windshield pass over their faces like tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RYE - DAY

The Vauxhaul putters down the empty streets of the-ghost town suburb. Turns left, down a narrow street.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABANDONED SUBURB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE as the car door opens and Theo gets out, looks around at a vast, empty suburb. Handsome homes with overgrown yards stretch out as far as the eye can see. Theo stares out at the empty streets, empty yards. It's eerily quiet. Miriam and Kee are nowhere to be seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christmas decorations adorn the overgrown lawn of the nearest house: gnomes and giant mushrooms and lawn elves. The front door is missing. Inside, a flash of movement.

Theo steps up on the porch of the door-less, two-story home and peers inside...

INT. HOUSE - SAME

... Dust particles in the sunlight. The house looks untouched... large rooms full of dusty furniture. Paintings on the walls. Apparently once the home of the well-to-do.

Theo walks inside... spots Miriam in the kitchen, snooping around. He watches as she PINGS various pots and pans that are hanging from a rack. She turns on the faucets, nothing comes out.

<DIRECTION>
Theo looks around the empty living room in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PORCH

Theo steps out on the porch. He sees Kee by the side of the house, walking across an overgrown lawn toward a wooden fence. She seem drawn to something...

Kee looks out at Bexhill. Remnants of the happy times: a sign for a fun house, what's left of the facade of the Bexhill Aquarium. Small, Jury-rigged plastic tents around the sidewalks. People warming their hands around scattered piles of burning rubbish, watching the passing rickshaw; suspicion in their eyes.

Theo notices graffiti spray-painted on the side of a building... the words "The Uprising" above a drawing of 5 fish lined up in a row. Before he can consider the implications. Kee is struck by another painful contraction.

He goes to the window, looks out the dirty pane into the street. Deserted. He waits, still nothing. Another painful MOAN from Kee. He takes out his flask, looks like he wants to drink it, but instead, pours the alcohol over his hands, washing them.

Theo pulling it free, still hooked by the umbilical cord, the placenta spilling out in a bloody finale -

There is a moment, a pause.

For the first time in eighteen years, four months, two days, sixteen hours and eight minutes, a human child has been born.

Theo moves the shard of glass from one spot on the umbilical cord to another -- unsure where to cut it. Then takes a breath and makes a decision and SLICES. The cord splits, spurting a bit of blood. Theo takes a bracelet from Kee's wrist, ties it to the stump left on the baby.

Theo takes off his shirt and cleans the white, cheese-like residue from the baby.

EXT. BEXHILL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bexhill skyline. Battered three and four-story buildings blending into the black night. It's silent. Even the dogs have stopped barking. In one small window, a dim light glows -- the silhouettes of Theo and Kee beholding this new life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUND OF THE SURF FADES IN...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHITE OCEAN FOAM tops a wave, blue and glistening, rolling luxuriously toward the beach.

The backlit woman in the sarong, her beautiful form moving closer...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo in the sand, smiling, in heaven... as she approaches...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo shades his eyes as she nears... and now we see... the woman is Kee, but she's not carrying a drink. She's carrying a baby, smiling and laughing... She walks right by Theo. He looks down the beach after her, is blinded by a blazing sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo leans back -- the texture of the sun and sky decays... seems less real, like a mixture of reality and watercolor, and the sounds of the rolling surf slowly give way to distant HELICOPTERS... sporadic GUNFIRE... and a dog YAPPING...

INT. BARE APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

<DIRECTION>
YAP! YAP! The barking is now outside the door. FOOTSTEPS following. Theo creakily gets to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone PUSHES the door. But a chair wedged against it holds it shut.

Kee is awake now, looking at Theo. Whoever is outside gives the door a powerful shove, and the chair skids forward, about to give.

He slaps her hard, silencing her. But as he turns back toward Theo, Marichka gives Syd a forceful shove and...

<DIRECTION>
...he trips down the last few steps... his gun hand folding under him as he tries to break his fall and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo quickly puts Kee down, leaps toward Syd, who gets a SHOT off in the air before Theo lands. Theo's weight snaps Syd's head against the floor. Syd's stunned, his gun hand flailing like a snake as he struggles with Theo.

And Marichka grabs Kee, guiding her toward the back hallway while Theo and Syd struggle for control of the pistol.

Theo's hand -- trying to muscle the gun away while Syd tries to point it back toward Theo. Theo's bandaged finger getting bent back -- Theo screaming in AGONY as he pulls the trigger BAM! BAM! BAM! The bullets fly into the wall, plaster falling -- BAM! BAM! two more shells -- barely missing Theo's head, until the chamber CLICKS. CLICK. Empty.

Syd drops the gun, reaches for Theo's throat. Theo gasps, trying to break Syd's grip.

Syd tightens his grip around Theo's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marichka spots the gun on the floor, grabbing the barrel and roundhousing it -- SMACK! into Syd's face. Syd falls backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marichka helps Theo get to his feet. Theo's still gasping for air as he looks down at Syd. Syd seems to be out cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo and Marichka join Kee at the mouth of the corridor - they rush down the passageway and reach a door at the end of the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's blocked with boxes and junk. Theo forces the door open... just enough space to pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marichka snakes through, out to a small alley, Santo following her. Then it's Kee's turn, but she can't fit through while holding the baby. From the alley, Marichka extends her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<MARICHKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby, Marichka!

Kee hesitates. Behind them, in the lobby, a groggy Syd getting up off the floor. Picking up his gun, loading it.

<DIRECTION>
Kee passes the baby through the doorway, fearing the worst. Marichka takes the baby. The point of no return. A moment. Marichka motions for Kee to follow.

Theo trying to squeeze out, but no one is helping with the door. And BAM! a bullet flies past his head.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo slips into the trash-strewn alley... SQUISH! Theo's expression -- he's lost one of his flip-flops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His bare foot sinking in a mound of rotting garbage. Then POCK! POCK! POCK! Bullets pierce the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at Kee and Marichka. Both are on the left side of the door, while he's on right side... and POCK! POCK! two more bullets cut holes in the door.

	<DIALOGUE>

The women hurry down the alley. POCK! Another bullet pierces the door. Desperate, Theo digs through the trash at his feet. Worthless plastic, rotting food, a heavy old electric mixer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door jerks open -- Syd's face appears. He looks at Theo, furiously shoving his way out and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo swings the rusty iron mixer -- SMACK! into Syd's face. Syd falls back inside. Theo stares at the door, ready for another round, mixer in hand. But there's no movement from inside. Theo drops the mixer and hurries to catch up with the others, one flip-flop on, one flip-flip off.

AT THE END OF THE ALLEY

They pass the mob, heading in the opposite direction. Passionate chanting, some wearing masks, all carry guns -- modern semi-automatics, a few old Glocks.

Theo and Kee stare: Nothing is surprising anymore.

<DIRECTION>
They pass a wall spray-painted with graffiti: five fish and the words "The Uprising." Theo and Kee exchange a look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FORMER BANK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This street seems quiet, "La Marseilles" now distant. Marichka gestures, leading them into what once was the city courthouse, now covered with graffiti. Further down the street, on rooftops, men with rifles dart from building to building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORMER BANK - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo, Kee with the baby, Marichka and Santo, enter. Dozens of old shoes on the floor, neatly paired. They hear CHANTING -- rhythmic prayers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It was once a bank, but now it's just skeletal remains: a few teller windows, pieces of tumbled Plexiglas. Past them, they see men kneeling on a carpeted floor, bowing toward Mecca in humble prayer. The bank now a makeshift mosque.

Marichka guides Kee toward stairs at the end of the hall. Theo is still staring at the shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORMER BANK - SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

<DIRECTION>
At the end of the dark corridor, Marichka is bent down at a metal door, talking to someone through a low eye-slit. A tiny flashlight shines through the opening, at her face. A trembly voice on the other side of the door, in Russian:
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGIAN_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nyet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGIAN_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Theo and Kee watch from the other end of the corridor. Kee leans on Theo, resting. On Theo's feet, a very worn pair of slippers. He looks up as Marichka waves forward, insistent, prattling. Theo helps Kee down the dim hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGIAN_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nyet, nyet...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGIAN_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
As they approach the secure metal door, the flashlight from the eye slit shines in Theo's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marichka grabs Kee's cloak. The light shifts to Kee's face as she resists, but the cloak opens. The light tilts down, shining on the baby, eyes closed, feeding on Kee's breast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the eye-slit, the flashlight shaking, a gasp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GEORGIAN MAN'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ancient GEORGIAN MAN (90) stands beside his wife. The pale, withered WOMAN (87), sitting in a wheelchair, hums a folk song as she carves the final touches onto an orange that she's cut into a swan. She presents the swan to Kee, who lays in bed eating some sort of potato stew, the baby asleep at her side.
</DIRECTION>
<KEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEE>
<DIRECTION>
We're in a simple home that was once a banker's office. One table, two chairs, a gas burner, photos, a reproduction of Chagall's cow on the farm. And, in the clean, big windows, a few potted plants. Classical music playing.
</DIRECTION>
<KEE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (calls out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Theo, they love my baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEE>
<DIRECTION>
Theo sits at the table, also eating stew, across from the old Georgian man. Marichka stands nearby, wolfing hers down -
</DIRECTION>
<THEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need a boat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEO>
<DIRECTION>
The Georgian Man speaks in a trembly voice with thick accent.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGIAN_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why boat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGIAN_MAN>
<THEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Human Project is sending a ship for Kee. We have to be out in the bay at sunset.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEO>
<DIRECTION>
Theo holds out a handful of bills. A SOFT RAP at the door and the Old Georgian Woman hobbles for it.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGIAN_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Human Project real?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGIAN_MAN>
<THEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It better be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEO>
<DIRECTION>
The old woman opens the door. A MAN carrying a rifle steps in, thirties, Slavic features.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's an imposing figure, tall and broad. The butt of an automatic pistol is visible in his waistband. The Georgian Man wheels over to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo watches the two men converse quietly in Russian. The younger man looks over at Theo with cold eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An amplified voice echoes from the street.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (over loudspeaker)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Warden has declared a State of Emergency! Everyone remain indoors! A curfew is now in effect!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Theo moves to the window, looks out: A caravan of armored carriers and tanks move slowly down the empty streets.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (over loudspeaker)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone on the streets will be considered hostile and shot! England supports you and provides you shelter. Do not support terrorists.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Then the same message repeated, translated into French. On top of the building across the street, men in masks armed with rifles run in the opposite direction of the tanks.
</DIRECTION>
<KEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Theo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEE>
<DIRECTION>
She's holding up her baby.

<KEE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</KEE>
<THEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first baby born in twenty years and you want to call her Froley? It sounds like a dog's name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEO>
<KEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a good name. I like Froley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEE>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles to hersellrf, her eyes closing. The Georgian Man and the Younger Man, SERGIUS, approach. Sergius stares in awe at child, finally turning to Theo...
</DIRECTION>
<SERGIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sunset is five-thirty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Sergius's eyes sparkle disarmingly.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGIAN_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay here for now. In one hour, you go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGIAN_MAN>
<SERGIUS>
<DIRECTION>
(mimics rowing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have boat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Theo holds out a fistful of 100 pound bills. Sergius closes Theo's fist on the money, not interested in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo looks over at Kee; she's fallen asleep nursing the baby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FORMER BANK - DAY (HOURS LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fog rolling in now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sergius stands in the middle of the street, his senses on alert. Sporadic gunfire and shouting in the distance, but the street seems safe. He signals, and moves off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo pushes Kee from the bank in the Georgian Man's wheelchair. Marichka with them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BAY STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They move down the fog-shrouded street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RUMBLING is heard. Santo stops, turns around and starts barking. The ground shakes... Through the fog... a silhouette slowly taking form... mammoth. A mechanical clatter drowning out Santo's barking.
</DIRECTION>
<THEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEO>
<DIRECTION>
IT'S AN ENORMOUS TANK. And it's close, coming right at them. Sergius darts into a cross street, turns to the others...
</DIRECTION>
<SERGIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Theo pushes Kee toward the cross street. Marichka following behind. She looks back: Santo is still holding his ground, barking at the metal monster. Marichka races back for him.
</DIRECTION>
<THEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marichka...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEO>
<DIRECTION>
The tank looming closer, appearing larger. Santo losing his courage, whimpering, backing off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marichka snatches up the dog and runs back toward the others, trying to catch up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWN BAY STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass a long metal pole wedged in a sewer, buttressed by a mountain of broken concrete and debris -- a barricade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sergius gestures toward a narrow alley. Theo turns the wheelchair, veers toward the alley and stops...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... seeing a Basque man holding a machine gun. Sergius has seen him too. Theo follows Sergius's gaze... finds another armed Basque man... and another... and another... They are surrounded. A beat then...
</DIRECTION>
<BASQUE_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(in Basque)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Down! Down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASQUE_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Theo and The others scurry into the alley as the tank rolls down Bay Street -- A metallic CREAK as the tank runs up against the metal barricade pole. The tank's tracks churn, but the pole holds fast. The Basque Man signals --
</DIRECTION>
<BASQUE_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now! Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASQUE_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Basque men swarm into the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More men surge forward -- a flaming bottle hurled from a building EXPLODES against the tank. The ambush is on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NARROW ALLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sergius guides Theo and Kee through the alley. The distance and fog mask the carnage, but not the SCREAMS OF THE WOUNDED AND DYING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHARF STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three armored carriers cruise by...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo and the others, huddled in a doorway, waiting for the formation to disappear into the fog.
</DIRECTION>
<THEO>
<DIRECTION>
(low, to Sergius)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEO>
<DIRECTION>
Sergius shows Theo his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<SERGIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is okay. Close.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGIUS>
<DIRECTION>
The coast clear, Sergius leads Theo, Kee and Marichka into a quiet alleyway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The alley seems a sanctuary from the fighting. The SHOOTING seems MUFFLED, distant now, fog obscuring the far end of the street. They stop near a courtyard with a small fountain. Sergius bends to lift a manhole cover near the fountain.
</DIRECTION>
<SERGIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Theo helps Sergius pry the manhole cover up. Then, FOOTSTEPS. They drop the manhole cover as, from both ends of the alley, vague figures appear in the fog and circle around them.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop your gun! Drop your gun! Drop your gun!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICES>
<DIRECTION>
Sergius spins, weapon in hand... Theo blocks Kee and the baby with his body...
</DIRECTION>
<THEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't shoot! Don't shoot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEO>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then drop the gun!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Sergius lays the weapon down.
</DIRECTION>
<SERGIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is safe! No gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGIUS>
<DIRECTION>
A man rushes in and grabs Sergius's gun -- it's Patric. Other armed men surround the group. Patric moves to Theo and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUD! -- slams his rifle into Theo's gut, knocks him to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<KEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patric!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEE>
<DIRECTION>
From the fog, more FOOTSTEPS. Luke walking toward them, out of the mist. The tout with the cracked eyeglasses behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the girl...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<KEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NOOOOOO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEE>
<DIRECTION>
And Patric and Ian subdue Kee. Luke squats down, eye level with Kee in the wheelchair.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kee)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're safe now. Are you all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Kee SPITS in his face. Luke suppresses his anger and takes out a handkerchief to wipe his cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<THEO>
<DIRECTION>
(struggling to his feet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let her go, Luke! You don't know what you're doing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEO>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no? Look around, Faron. It's happening! I did what Julian couldn't. I called for The Uprising. And the people are responding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
He gestures vaguely out at the sound of the gunfire.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're following me. And they haven't even seen the baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns to Ian)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Detain Theo and the others. When Kee and I are far enough away and they can no longer cause trouble -- let them go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back to Kee, speaking in a gentle tone.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Theo has been nothing but a thorn in my side, yet, I hold no malice toward him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now we must go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the others)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help her...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Kee struggles, SCREAMS, as two of the Fishes grab her, holding her in the wheelchair as they hustle her away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke holds back, one last look at Theo and Marichka before turning to Patric
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (low)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait until we're far enough away...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Patric understands. Luke leaves the quiet of the alley. Patric cocks his pistol, looks out into the street, waiting for Kee and Luke to turn the corner. As they disappear from sight...
</DIRECTION>
<MARICHKA>
<DIRECTION>
(begging)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, please, please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARICHKA>
<DIRECTION>
... Patric points the gun at Sergius and POP! Shoots him in the head. Sergius falls backward, and Patric aims the pistol at Theo, finger on the trigger, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM! BAM! Shots ring out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM THE OTHER END OF THE ALLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An armored carrier is rolling toward them, two soldiers shooting from the turret.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patric fires back -- POP! POP!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo grabs Marichka and hustles her back to Wharf Street. He guides her to a doorway, Theo looks down the street and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FURTHER AHEAD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees Luke and his men pushing Kee, rounding the CORNER onto 3rd Street and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shielding the group of soldiers SHOOTING at Ian and his men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CORNER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ian and his men hold their position, FIRING BACK, but are unable to stop the advancing tank.
</DIRECTION>
<IAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to the men)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAN>
<DIRECTION>
The two men peel off after Luke. Ian fires a few more rounds, then follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH THEO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo looks to his right: the tank advancing, soldiers marching, holding their fire, weapons trained, focused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And he musters his courage, runs out into the open, chasing after Luke and Kee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The soldiers are caught by surprise, a double-take before they BLAST AWAY...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHARF STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Theo runs, makes it across Wharf Street turning the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORNER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He presses himself against the wall, catching his breath. He looks out and sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP AHEAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke and the Fishes fleeing with Kee. Ian and his men, not far behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo trails after them. IAN turns, fires at Theo. THEO dives behind a stoop. AN ARMORED CARRIER emerges from the fog, cutting off the Fishes' escape. Luke gestures, leading Kee and the Fishes into a modern apartment building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo in hot pursuit when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soldiers fire the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT! One of Ian's men is hit in the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo dives into a burned-out double-decker abandoned on the sidewalk across the street from the apartment building and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BURNED-OUT DOUBLE-DECKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... falls on top of people huddled inside. SCREAMS of fear in SPANISH as bodies scramble away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo gets up. He's just crashed into crowded makeshift living quarters: mats butted along the floor of the bus, a stove in the middle of them. The inhabitants ducking for cover, a few peering out through the cardboard-covered windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo bends the cardboard back from the window, looking out:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soldiers fire as Ian and the last Fish make it to the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MODERN APARTMENT BUILDING... bullets RIDDLING the concrete facade as the Fishes slip through the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Soldiers rush the apartment building, disappearing inside... and a fierce fire-fight ensues -- TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT! Flashes of GUNFIRE visible in the doorway. SCREAMS. Soldiers stagger back out of the doorway, some wounded, retreating from the opposing gunfire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BURNED-OUT DOUBLE-DECKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stray bullets strafe the bus. Theo ducks out of the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK OUTSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TANK rumbles into position behind the soldiers, its gun turret cranks slowly toward the apartment building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
realizes the tank is about to fire on the apartment building with Kee and the baby inside.
</DIRECTION>
<THEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, no, no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEO>
<DIRECTION>
He runs out of the bus into the street soldier positioned near the tank open hits the ground and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM! The tank recoils with the blast, the explosion rips a gaping hole in the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo rolls out of the way of falling concrete. He looks up at the apartment building -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
White sheets and clothes wave from windows, desperate pleas for mercy from tenants still in the building as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...from the floor above, Fishes open fire on the soldiers. Someone throws a Molotov cocktail... it explodes in the street. Soldiers return fire -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenants streaming out the front doors, hands in the air, SCREAMING SURRENDER in a dozen languages and TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT -- the soldiers gunfire CUTS THEM DOWN. A few survivors scramble back into the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tank tilts its big gun up, aiming at the snipers on the fourth floor... BOOM! The tank shell blasts another hole into the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the silence of the aftershock, a thick cloud of dust in the air Theo gets up and races for the apartment building
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's almost at the doorway when a soldier spots him through the haze and opens fire -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BULLETS RAKE the entrance. Theo sidesteps the bodies of dead soldiers and refugees, makes it inside and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slips on the blood-slicked cement, crawling in panic further into the blood-splattered building. Staying low, he moves through the lobby, desperately searching for any sign of Kee when --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gunfire erupts from the staircase. Theo takes cover behind a pillar -- it's Ian who's firing at him, but bullets from one of the soldiers in the street tear into him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo spots Kee's wheelchair, abandoned at the foot of the stairs, and heads up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND FLOOR STAIRCASE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches the second floor landing -- looks down the hallway. A few tenants huddled in the dim shadows, staying low, keeping away from the windows. A man crying in agony bleeding badly. The heavy gunfire is playing out on the upper floors. Theo continues up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THIRD FLOOR STAIRCASE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo steps out onto the third floor. Tenants on the ground covering their heads, a few wounded, screaming. Theo spots Patric in a blown-out apartment, firing at the street below. Soldiers' bullets strafe the room, and Patric bursts out into the hallway. Theo hides as Patric pushes past tenants...
</DIRECTION>
<PATRIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck outta my way, fuck outta my way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRIC>
<DIRECTION>
... and kicks open the door of another apartment. Theo starts after him but then he hears, faintly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MUFFLED CRY OF A BABY. It's coming from the floor above. Theo heads for the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FOURTH FLOOR CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo emerges on the fourth floor, moves toward the MUFFLED CRIES. Following the sound into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FOURTH FLOOR APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The apartment has been tattered by bullets, glass shattered, everything upended. Kee in a corner, protecting her baby girl with her body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke lays by the window in a pool of his own blood, with his back toward Kee, firing out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo steps into the room, moves to Kee and her crying baby.

Shots from outside RIDDLE the wall near them. At the window, Luke fires back at the soldiers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo and Kee making their way across the ruined room to the door. Luke turns and sees them. He points his gun. Theo freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>

BAM! Luke shoots. Theo grimaces TAT-TAT-TAT. Glass shatters as guns fire from the outside, ripping Luke to pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo walks out the door, Kee following. He's in momentary shock, clutching his gut, looking at a trickle of blood spreading across the fabric of his shirt.

</THEO>
<DIRECTION>
Theo breathing through the pain, holding up Kee, walking down the hall, the baby still crying. A volley of bullets from outside tear through the walls. The ROAR of the GUNFIRE is punctuated by the BABY'S CRIES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People huddled in the corridor, looking in disbelief. A WOMAN falls to her knees.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>

<DIRECTION>
Theo and Kee approach the stairwell. Bullets are still flying, but people seem fearless, poking their heads from doors, risking their lives to get a closer look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The baby's crying gives Theo and Kee a sense of security. They are no longer dodging bullets but are walking straight down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man breaks into tears. An old woman, bleeding to death on the floor, reaches her gnarled finger to touch the baby's blanket. She smiles as they pass -- she has heard the song of an angel.
</DIRECTION>

Theo and Kee reach the stairs. Kee starts down the steps, but Theo stops her.

Kee allows Theo to pick her up. He strains to lift her, then starts down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FOURTH FLOOR STAIRWELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The baby's cry echoes through the stairwell. Theo slowly carrying Kee down. People huddled on the stairs, amazed, eyes glued to the baby. Others looking down at them from the upper. floors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TAT-TAT-TAT. A gun battle, moving up the stairs toward them. It's Patric and two other Fishes -- backing up the stairs, battling pursuing soldiers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patric hears crying, turning, pointing his gun at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Theo and Kee. No place to hide. Patric points the gun at Theo's head, about to pull the trigger. But the baby is wailing in Kee's arm. Patric looking at the baby in stunned disbelief. Then he lowers his gun. He and the Fishes back away, staring at the infant as Theo and Kee continue down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THIRD FLOOR STAIRWELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gunfire from below forces people against the wall. Theo and Kee continue their descent. A SOLDIER surges up the stairs, pointing his gun at the newborn girl, who wails away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo and Kee walk past him. The Soldier breathless, the baby's cry clashing with his adrenaline.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold positions and hold fire!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
Theo continues carrying Kee down. People on the stairs standing up, getting a look. More soldiers, holding their weapons in silence, immobilized by the baby's cry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The baby's cries echo through the lobby, now held by the military. Soldiers hold strategic positions, watching Theo and Kee pass, glimpsing the child in confusion, awe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the shattered doorway, Theo staggers. Kee sees his sweat, his pain. His shirt is covered in blood.
</DIRECTION>
<KEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put me down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEE>
<DIRECTION>
Theo hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<KEE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanna walk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEE>
<DIRECTION>
Theo sets her down. Kee walks slowly, resolutely, leaning on Theo for support. They pass through the shattered doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK PLAZA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo, Kee and the baby step into the murky light of the foggy day. An impenetrable line of soldiers positioned in the plaza
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
face them, their weapons pointed, ready. The heavy machinery of war silenced by the cries of a baby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo and Kee walk forward, toward the soldiers. The weapons aimed at them begin to lower. An instinctive shuffle to the side, as if commanded by the cry, creating a space for them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kee carrying her child, Theo at her side as the soldiers part like the Red Sea. Somber faces watching as they pass, touched by the baby's crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM! BAM! BAM! Rifle shots from the fourth floor window shatter the silence. Two soldiers behind Theo are hit. Theo covers Kee as soldiers open fire on the apartment building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A new battle flares. Theo and Kee walk on, ignored by the soldiers who race forward, taking up new positions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM! The tank blasts a massive hole in the fourth floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORNER - WHARF & 3RD Leaving the battle behind, Kee and Theo hurry down the street. Marichka emerges from a blown-out doorway, holding Santo, greeting them with a crooked smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE LITTLE FOUNTAIN - A LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With great effort, Theo pries off the sewer lid. They all disappear down the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SEWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ceiling lamp illuminates a concrete sewer drain, a narrow channel of foul water running through it. Boxes of contraband stacked to one side: alcohol, batteries, medicine, cans of food, electrical wire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo holds Kee's arm as she steps into a wooden launch. Marichka lights the candle fixed to the bow of the boat. She prattles on, Santo on her shoulders, tears in her eyes, gesturing toward the end of the tunnel where ambient light filters in.
</DIRECTION>
<MARICHKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go, go boat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARICHKA>
<DIRECTION>
Theo extends his hand to help Marichka into the launch.
</DIRECTION>
<MARICHKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marichka no go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARICHKA>
<DIRECTION>
Marichka smiles. Theo nods a thank you. And he climbs in the boat and sets the oars. Marichka gives the boat a shove...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo puts the candle into a holder and starts to row. They glimpse graffiti on the walls, like cave paintings, as they pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A breeze from outside extinguishes the candle. Theo rows - toward the light. Passing through a metal grate which has been cut away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SEA'S EDGE - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The launch emerges into the fog at the end of a large harbor. Behind them, misty air cloaks the back side of the Bexhill Fence which runs the length of shoreline, separating the prison-city from the sea. The MUFFLED SOUNDS of the riot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo rows steadily, painfully. Dead calm, but the tide is on their side. What lays beyond is obscured by milky fog and growing darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OPEN SEA - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo is rowing slower now, his strength waning. The fog has enveloped the city behind them, the riots a distant echo. The world around them has disappeared. From somewhere off, the sound of a BELL.
</DIRECTION>
<KEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The buoy! Theo, the buoy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEE>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead of them, through the fog, patches of dull orange sunlight. The buoy visible in the distance. Theo rows once more, groans with the effort.
</DIRECTION>
<KEE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What time is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEE>
<THEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEO>
<DIRECTION>
The launch gains momentum, then slows. The sun touching the horizon, the day ending. No sign of any boats anywhere on the desolate sea.
</DIRECTION>
<KEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll come back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEE>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUND of the bell is drowned out by the WHINE of JETS high in the sky. Followed by the ROAR of EXPLOSIONS -- POOF POOF POOF and, behind them, a glowing light, expanding in the fog...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo rests, exhausted. He feels his gut, which has been steadily oozing from the bullet wound. His eyes drop down to his hands, now covered in blood. Something is poking through the ripped lining of his pea coat -- He lifts a hundred pound note, staring at it. The sounds of the sea gently lapping at the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kee looking around, anxious. The buoy rocking rhythmically, splashing water... no trace of a boat.
</DIRECTION>
<THEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am sorry, Kee. I am so sorry.

He shakes his head. His eyes are watery.

Kee looks at him.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Froley. That's a fine name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEO>
<DIRECTION>
Theo musters all he's got left, reaching the oars back, wood cutting through water, propelling the launch a little further. He closes his eyes. HOLD as the SOUND of the surf fades in...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CLOUDS PARTING -- REVEALING A RED SKY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo is sitting in his chair on the white sandy beach, watching a mother and child in the blue water, laughing and splashing in the waves. The mother is Kee but her child is now a toddler. Then, two other woman rush down to the beach, planting their infants on the sand, letting the foamy waves lap at their baby's feet. Kee looks from the babies to Theo and waves. A smile slowly comes to Theo's face. He is happy, content.
</DIRECTION>
<KEE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Theo...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kee looking at Theo. He's slumped over, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The launch drifting. No direction. Drifting... Drifting... Kee is still, silent... The baby begins to CRY...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A light flickers, piercing the fog -- Kee looks up
</DIRECTION>
<KEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Theo...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEE>
<DIRECTION>
The fog gives way, revealing purple sky...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cutting through the water toward them, A LIGHT, A BOAT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wooden vessel approaching, nets and gear -- A FISHING BOAT. The name painted on the stern. "THE TOMORROW."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
