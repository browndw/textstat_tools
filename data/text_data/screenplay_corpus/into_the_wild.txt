EXT. THE STAMPEDE TRAIL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPER: Tuesday, April 28th 1992
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE-SHOT: A vast, snow-blanketed wilderness that sits beneath the icy summits of the highest mountain range in North America. This is BIG Alaska.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat up 4x4 pick-up enters very small into the upper left corner of frame on an unkept, snow-packed road, and comes to a stop. A figure exits the passenger side and moves around the front of the truck. We can just make out the rifle sticking out of his backpack. We HEAR a very distant "Thank You" as the figure walks away from the road and away from the truck, seemingly into nowhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>

	Hey!

<DIRECTION>
The figure with backpack and rifle, henceforth BACKPACK, stopping in his tracks, turns around in the direction of the truck.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You left your watch, your comb, your change...

</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
We STAY on the DRIVER as BACKPACK speaks:
</DIRECTION>
<BACKPACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BACKPACK>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want your money. And I already have a watch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<BACKPACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you don't take it, I'm gonna throw it away. I don't want to know what time it is, what day it is, or where I am. I don't want to see anybody. None of that matters.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The driver reaches behind the seat of the truck, pulls out an old pair of rubber work boots.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
(handing him the boots)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take em.

There is a pause as Backpack considers accepting the boots.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you make it out alive, give me a call, and I'll tell you how to get the boots back to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
We can feel over Backpack's shoulder that he has taken the boots and is putting them on but we STAY on the driver.
</DIRECTION>
<BACKPACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, do me a favor, will ya? Take a picture of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BACKPACK>
<DIRECTION>
Backpack hands him an Instamatic camera and starts walking backwards. We PULL BACK with him. And he maintains his back to us. When he stops, we CONTINUE until he is FULL-FRAME, head-to-toe from behind, posing.

	You gonna be alright?

</DRIVER>
<BACKPACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be better than that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(I'll be who I am.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Backpack exits the frame, we SLOWLY ZOOM past the concerned face of the driver onto the loose change, the comb, and the watch on the dash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Throughout the ZOOM, the SOUND of FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING THE SNOW, FADE into the distance.

BACK TO:

<DIRECTION>
ORIGINAL WIDE-SHOT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the small form of the truck and the smaller form of the Backpacker walking away from the truck until the Backpacker has exited the frame. The truck takes a BEAT, turns around in the snow, and accelerates back into the direction from which it came. As the truck exits frame, we -

EXT. COMMENCEMENT GROUNDS, EMORY UNIVERSITY, ATLANTA - DAY

SUPER: May 1990
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd of family and friends, and of course, students. Assembled on fold-out chairs. The broad lawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT: CHRIS MCCANDLESS. We don't see his face, just feet pounding the pavement at an increasing pace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One by one the names of graduates announced. Their bright young faces, capped heads, and gowns, glide up to the podium to accept their diplomas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT: Chris, on his run, sweatshirt hood over head. Amongst assembled crowd and family we find: THE MCCANDLESS': BILLIE, mid to late forties with dark striking eyes; WALT, a taciturn man, early fifties; and CARINE, eighteen, pretty with her mother's eyes and waist length brown hair, a gold crucifix dangles from her neck. They look around, looking for Chris, he's nowhere in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT: Chris, in a shower (PHOTO-SONICS) He TURNS INTO CAMERA, the water streaming down his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the announcement podium comes the name of their son and brother, CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS. The McCandless family increasingly panicked over Chris' absence, when almost magically, he appears in full cap and gown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Disregarding the steps that lead up to the podium platform, the small-framed but athletic CHRIS MCCANDLESS leaps jubilantly onto the stage in a single bound, frightening Billie, a little wince from Walt, and Carine "That's our Chris." And just as quickly as Chris has been handed his diploma, he civilly descends the platform steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLO-MO: A ballet of graduation caps float upward into a frame of blue sky. We HEAR Chris' voice OVER this image as we intermittently cut away from the caps against the sky to focus on his parents.

(HIGH ANGLE: floating caps in FOREGROUND, Walt and Billie delight upon the caps.) An outer glee in sharp contrast to voice over:

	<DIALOGUE>
	I see them standing at the formal gates of their colleges, I see my father strolling out under the ochre sandstone arch, the red tiles glinting like bent plates of blood behind his head, I see my mother with a few light books at her hip standing at the pillar made of tiny bricks with the wrought-iron gate still open behind her, its sword-tips black in the May air, they are about to graduate, they are about to get married, they are kids, they are dumb, all they know is they are innocent, they would never hurt anybody. I want to go up to them and say Stop, don't do it--she's the wrong woman, he's the wrong man, you are going to do things you cannot imagine you would ever do, you are going to do bad things to children, you are going to suffer in ways you never heard of, you are going to want to die. I want to go up to them there in the late May sunlight and say it, her hungry pretty blank face turning to me, her pitiful beautiful untouched body, his arrogant handsome blind face turning to me, his pitiful beautiful untouched body, but I don't do it. I want to live. I take them up like the male and female paper dolls and bang them together at the hips like chips of flint as if to strike sparks from them, I say...

<DIRECTION>
OVER Chris' shoulder, he frisbees his graduation cap from the upstairs window to his parents parting Cadillac on the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they wave goodbye, Carine catches the cap from the backseat window. And with a parting smile to her brother, she poses with it on her own head. Chris smiles and waves goodbye.

As the Cadillac drifts away, his smile disappears into something other than sadness.

In a warm ambient light, we SEE a black and white poster on a barren wall: Poncho-clad Clint Eastwood from "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We TILT DOWN a stack of books sitting on the floor - Tolstoy, Stegner, Thoreau, Jack London, and Pasternak. Beside them, a camper's backpack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris sits in introspection at his desk by candlelight. The room is spare, supporting his monkish lifestyle. But on the desk before him, he counts out $500.68 from a bank envelope. He pockets those bills and change, then removes a check for $24,000 made out to OXFAM America from the same bank envelope. He scribbles a note: These are all my savings. Feed someone with it. Signed, Chris McCandless. He then slides the note and the check into a pre-addressed Oxford Famine Relief Fund (in Boston) envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls his wallet from his back pocket. Pulls all the cards and pictures from its sleeves. Considering each, he flicks them into a trash bin, one by one. Finally coming to his social security card, he holds it to the candles flame. As the flame burns bright we - DISSOLVE TO:

A 1982 DATSUN B210 emerges from the rising sun as the car heads west out of Atlanta. (HIGHWAY 20 TO 78 TO 40)

PRESENTATION TITLES and MUSIC carry OVER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE: We travel with Chris and his Datsun through the towns and open highways, landscapes and landmarks, days and nights, that lead to the Mojave desert in the West.
</DIRECTION>

(In contrast to his introspection of the previous night, Chris is buoyant throughout this sequence.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT, SOMEWHERE BETWEEN KINGMAN, ARIZONA AND LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(CRANE SHOT) We see Chris stop the Datsun in the middle of the desert road. We (CRANE?) DOWN to a close-up through the windshield. Chris looks left. Then, right. Into the rearview mirror, and suddenly turns the wheel, veering the Datsun off the paved highway into the vast desert.

As we CRANE back UP, the Datsun moves into the horizon.

END PRESENTATION TITLES. FADE MUSIC

EXT. DETRITAL WASH - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE: WEST-FACING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Datsun sits in the magical pastel twilight just before darkness slides over the desert. It is positioned at the foot of a wash wall that edges the soup bowl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE: EAST-FACING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Datsun, a yellow speck in the frame. Coyotes yap at the moon. Other than that, no sound on the desert floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, voluptuous cumulonimbus clouds boil upward catching the last rosy glow of the west-setting sun over the rim of the upper Detrital watershed. We see strobe bursts of lightning followed by muffled thunder illuminating the thunder clouds from within. Short SERIES OF ANGLES as we MOVE IN on the distant gullies and ravines, starting to run with copious amounts of water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DATSUN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris McCandless, in the same clothes he had been in back in the rooming house, sleeps in the back seat of the Datsun. His head supported by his backpack. We begin to HEAR a rumble. But this rumble is not thunder. It rapidly builds into an alarming ROAR. The roar grows to a deafening level. Chris awakens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he peeks up from the backseat looking forward through the windshield, he just barely catches sight of the leading edge of a flash flood. A four-foot high wall of water, mud and debris makes impact with the Datsun, momentarily enveloping it in water. Suddenly the car is SLAMMED against the cliff. CRACK! Chris sits upright, disoriented.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV: As far as the eye can see in the desert moonlight, water has taken over the desert with a flash flood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
However, there's no panic in Chris' face as we observe him past a new crack in the wet windshield. The water, while violent seems to have topped off just above the wheels. Chris gets a slight smile on his face, as the car settles into its new position below the cliff. He returns to sleep.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

What remains of Chris' travelling money burns in a pile beside the Datsun on the sun-lit but muddy desert floor.

We follow a very long set of footprints (CAMERA TRACKING/TRUE VERTICAL) away from the burning cash through the mud, finally tilting up to the footprint maker, Chris. Slogging toward high ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE-SHOT: We see the abandoned Datsun nearly a mile behind Chris as he walks toward us wearing his backpack. He comes very close to camera (only a day or two's stubble on his face) and as we PAN him 180, we see as much wilderness before us as we did behind. REPRISE MUSIC OVER MAIN TITLE:

	<DIALOGUE>
	When we were little, Chris was very to himself. He wasn't anti-social, he always had friends, and everybody liked him - but he could go off and entertain himself for hours, he didn't seem to need toys or friends. He could be alone without being lonely. The secrets our parents kept, though unknown to Chris and I, led to bouts of rage and even violence between them that we had been forced to witness since we were very young. It seemed like they never fought without us. I remember the first family meeting to let Chris and me in on their plans for getting a divorce. They wanted us to choose which of them we'd live with. I cried my eyes out. But the divorce never happened, though the threats and meetings never stopped. It wasn't long before Chris and I shut off -- we would tell mom and dad to go ahead and get the divorce. Chris and I just wanted to get away from their fights and mom kept promising to get out and take us with her as soon as their company made enough money. Dad had been the young genius [that] NASA enlisted to do [crucial] designs for the American satellite radar systems that would be our answer to the Russian Sputnik. And mom and he later started up a consulting firm combining her get-up- and-go resourcefulness with his wealth of knowledge. By the time the company actually made its first million, the careerism and money seemed to erase her memory of the promise she'd made us. I think this is when Chris began to see "careers" as a diseased invention of the twentieth century and to resent money and the useless priority people made of it in their lives. He'd begun planning to "slay the beast"...to make himself free.

	If Chris were trying to disappear, it would have been a pretty uncharacteristic lapse for him to give the police his real place of residence. Though my parents had already contacted the Annandale police with their initial concerns, this ticket arriving from California made them frantic. My father called one of his old government friends who put him in touch with a private investigator, someone who'd done work with the DIA and the CIA. Using the Willow Creek ticket as a starting point, the investigator began chasing down leads. Most of them led far afield -- to Europe and South Africa. Ultimately turning up nothing. What my dad couldn't believe was that he'd given up his car. He seemed to love that Datsun so much. It sounded just like Chris to me, though. He was very much of the school that you should own nothing except what you could carry on your back at a dead run.

OS we HEAR a ZIPPING SOUND. It's Rainey. We see him from Chris' POV coming out of his tent deep in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he moves to the glowing embers of what remains of the campfire, Rainey's face goes out of frame and all Chris can see are his booted feet, tapping bits of glowing wood into the center of the fire. The tapping is slow and thoughtful. Micro-embers float upward into the night.

We see Chris foraging for firewood in the bluffs above the beach. He's got it tied to his back and his front. If we didn't know better, we'd think he was camouflaging himself.
</DIRECTION>

Chris' POV: The rocks beside the water's edge. We see Rainey sitting beside the water, staring out to sea. We follow Chris' gaze to Jan, some fifty yards down the beach, walking melancholically in the opposite direction of Rainey. ANGLE: Rainey at the water's edge. Chris appears beside him.

And with that, Chris runs down the beach toward Jan. Rainey watches Chris and Jan chat briefly. Then they strip down to their underwear and jump into the ocean, splashing and laughing.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE: Chris and Jan swimming in the chilly water, having a ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jan increasingly indulges herself a motherly closeness and joy with Chris. And Chris allows it. She pushes the stringy hairs from his eyes, worries when he descends below the surface for too many seconds, and smiles and laughs in tender relief when from below surface one of her toes is pulled on by the big fish Chris. As he re- surfaces, she gives him a splash right in the face.

There were no signs that Chris had intended to return to it. But there wasn't any evidence of struggle. The police said they thought Chris had chosen to leave it behind and not that it had been taken from him. Nonetheless, the initial comfort that gave mom and dad, quickly turned to their realization that Chris was actually trying not to be found.

	The day after the party, Chris left on his trip and ended up staying away most of the summer. It was nearly three months before he walked back into our house in Annandale. He had a scruffy beard, his hair was long and tangled, and he was rail thin. As soon as I heard he was home, I ran into his room to talk to him. In California, he'd looked up some old family friends who still lived there. He'd found out that long after he had been born, our dad had continued a relationship with his first wife Marcia in secret.

	Dad's arrogance made him conveniently oblivious to the pain he caused. And mom, in the shame and embarrassment of a young mistress, became his accomplice. She and my dad had decided to bend the truth about this other child saying that dad wasn't the father and they maintained that their fraudulent marriage was real. Chris was quiet when he told me this. He said it made his "entire childhood seem like a fiction"; that "the truth had been dying everyday." If something bothered Chris, he'd usually keep it to himself. And he made me promise to do the same. He never did tell mom and dad that he knew. But Chris measured himself and those around him by an impossibly rigorous moral code. He loathed what he considered mom and dad's hypocrisy and resented what they considered guidance. Chris submitted to dad's authority through college but I knew he raged inwardly the whole time. It was inevitable that Chris would rebel. And when he did, he did it with characteristic immoderation.

This kid's never kayaked before, certainly never on rapids. But it's that immortal stage of life, no care, no helmet, no life-jacket, pure adrenaline. He can hardly believe he's surviving it as he goes but there's no looking back now. And with every thump of the music, we share his rush. His pure unadulterated exhilaration.

	But why he didn't send a letter, maybe through a friend. I got mad. But I told myself it was good. It made me remember that there was something more than rebellion, more than anger that was driving him. Chris had always been driven, had always been an adventurer. When he was four years old...

FADE OUT/IN:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRAIN TRACKS OUTSIDE LOS ANGELES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris' train barrels along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris goes into his pack, grabs his canteen and drinks some water. Mid-sip, the train begins to make a surprising stop. Screeching wheels on track. Chris is alarmed. As he moves to peer out the door, even before he has a chance to see what's coming -- WHAM! He's smashed in the head with a baton. A BULL jumps into the car with him.
</DIRECTION>
<BULL_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lay down on your stomach, spread eagle!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BULL_2>
<DIRECTION>
Chris turns to reason with the man. And that's all it takes -- six straight blows to the ribs, legs, and arms. We hear it more than we see it. Chris is in agony.
</DIRECTION>
<BULL_2>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me see your face.

</BULL_2>

The bull shines a flashlight into Chris' eyes.

<BULL_2>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never, ever, ever forget a face. If I see yours again, I won't arrest you. I'll kill you. This is the god-damned railroad. And we will do whatever we have to, to keep you freeloaders from violating our liability.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BULL_2>
<DIRECTION>
Chris is trying to understand what the man is saying.
</DIRECTION>
<BULL_2>

	If one of you people gets hurt on our train, we are liable. Do you understand that?

<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris is pushed off the train, his pack thrown out after him. The bull jumps down beside the track as well and walks down track away from Chris, signalling an "all clear" with his flashlight to some unseen engineer.
</DIRECTION>
<BULL_2>
<DIRECTION>
(to Chris over his shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last time, my friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BULL_2>
<DIRECTION>
Chris stumbles to his feet. The pain of the beating is real. He bleeds from the back of his ear. But he can walk. And he does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris sits on his pack on the roadside, hitchhiking and eating from a can of beans he opened with his pocketknife. The odd car passes but doesn't stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARIZONA INTERSTATE OVERPASS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris hops out of a Camaro that gave him a ride. The lighting is anonymous and so is the driver.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks very much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He closes the door and the car drives off. We follow Chris as he goes to the overpass edge. He drops his pack over the side. Chris climbs down the edge of the overpass, grabs his pack, and scurries into the UNDERPASS below. (We suddenly recognize this as his pre-river run campsite)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He digs up his buried belongings, returning them to his pack. Last to come out of the ground, Chris' copy of Jack London's Call of the Wild. He pulls off a temp wrapping and dusts it off. Chris lights his candle lantern and begins to read. O.S. VOICES from the PAST:

INT. MCCANDLESS HOME, ANNANDALE (PAST)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELEVEN-YEAR OLD CARINE sits in the stairwell leading to her parent's room where an argument ensues. Carine's head in her hands, a delicate tear moistens the webs between her small fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIFTEEN-YEAR OLD CHRIS enters from O.S. He leans against the stairwell and looks up the stairs. Our focus remains on Carine. In the B.G. SOFT FOCUS, Walt is pinning Billie down onto the bed. She flails at him but he holds down her shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<WALT>

	LOOK WHAT YOUR MOTHER IS MAKING ME DO!

As they both laugh we DISSOLVE BACK to Chris (PRESENT) reading beside his candle lantern.
</DIRECTION>
<CARINE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the nine months since Chris' disappearance, my parents went through enormous changes. Guilt was giving way to pain. And pain seemed to bring them closer. My father had humbled dramatically. And what had always been a sort of curt arrogance, the kind of man who actually thought he could cancel Christmas, had given way to the vulnerability of a father's heart. Even their faces had changed. It made me sad that I couldn't share with Chris the new closeness I felt toward our parents.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARINE>
<DIRECTION>
The image of Chris reading begins a SLOW DISSOLVE INTO...

INT. FREIGHT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<CARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I close my eyes at night sometimes and imagine where Chris might be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARINE>
<DIRECTION>
Suspicious, ghostly faces briefly appear in the strobing lights that hit the train car from outside. They're toothless and tattooed. Aged and young. Punks and piercings. They're train tramps. We see Chris observing them. Warmly he speaks but we DO NOT HEAR, "I'm Alex."

	Was there beauty around him? Was he hurt? Was he alone?

We see Chris sharing camp with the train tramps in the outskirts of Las Vegas. DISSOLVE...

We see Chris working as a waiter in a Las Vegas restaurant. DISSOLVE...

<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<CARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could he feel the changes here at home? By some kind of supernatural osmosis? Chris once wrote to me from college saying he wanted to talk to me about all the problems he had with mom and dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARINE>

We see what may be Chris' POV from a train car snaking through a mountain pass.

HIGH ANGLE CU: We see Chris walking the streets of Seattle. As we WIDEN OUT, he becomes a dot in the Seattle landscape.
</DIRECTION>
<CARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In those silent moments, with my eyes closed trying to picture where Chris might be at that very moment, probably climbing some scary mountain, I want to reach into that picture and bring him back to see what mom and dad, what our family might become.
	</DIALOGUE>

LONG LENS: Chris disappears over the rise into the Seattle marketplace overlooking Puget Sound (per location photography.)

EXT. ANNANDALE SUPERMARKET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<CARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But instead when I open my eyes, what I see is my mother, sitting at the dining room table, sifting through photo albums and pictures of Chris. It's all she can do to examine the snapshots. And, though she breaks down from time to time, she studies them with a sort of hungry intensity - like looking at food you can't eat, or into a window at a family around a table that you were once a part of and can be no more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARINE>
<DIRECTION>
We see Billie driving out of the Annandale supermarket onto the boulevard. She sees a hitchhiker roadside. She cranes her head - is it Chris? It's not.
</DIRECTION>
<CARINE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She convinces herself it's Chris; that it's her son, whenever she passes a stray. And I fear for the mother in her...

<DIRECTION>
We see Chris hitchhiking in a barren desert.
</DIRECTION>
<CARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Instincts that seem to sense the threat of a loss so huge and irreparable that the mind balks at taking its measure - I begin to wonder if I do understand what Chris is saying any longer. But I catch myself in doubt and remember that these are not the parents he grew up with. That in the forced reflection that comes with loss, indeed everything Chris is saying, has to be said. And I trust for him that everything he is doing has to be done. This is our life.

Chris is in the passenger seat of a Mac truck cab. Both Chris and the TRUCKER look outward as though to find an address or landmark.
</DIRECTION>
<TRUCKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know where to drop you. Bullhead's kinda haphazard - there's no "center." You sure you don't want to be in Laughlin? It's casinos versus chiropractors.

</TRUCKER>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, no. This is good. Right here.

	Okay.

But then just continues on at his leisurely daydreaming pace. Lori is about to say something but by now she knows there's no getting through to him. She looks down to the floor where we see that Chris wears no socks.
</DIRECTION>
<LORI>
<DIRECTION>
(extending patience)
</DIRECTION>

Chris pedals up a dirt path to find many of his belongings strewn about. And in particular, some food supplies have been torn into. A coyote yips in the distance as Chris finds his old straw hat torn to shreds. Across the desert, scurrying away beyond the tumbleweed, three young coyotes head for the hills. Chris picks up his tattered hat and smiles.

This is the vista of former barracks foundations Rainey and Jan Burres had told Chris about. Hundreds of people in tents and trailers, a quarter inch to the right of a Rainbow Gathering as hillbillies and renegades mix with the hippies. There are canvas-covered booths set up for swap and trade. Even a few makeshift food stands.

	Sunni! Come here boy.

	You have to tell us everything.

(Note: This scene should largely be improvised. They all know their characters, their history. Jan and Rainey are doing great. And while Chris is intermittently aware that the eyes of a pretty 16-year old girl are upon him, Chris lays out his travels and his PLAN FOR ALASKA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jan remarks, "I guess if you can figure out how to paddle a canoe down to Mexico, hop freight trains, and score beds at inner-city missions, you can figure out Alaska too.")
</DIRECTION>

At this point, the PRETTY 16-YEAR OLD GIRL who had had her eyes on Chris, takes the stage with an acoustic guitar, introduces herself as TRACY, then SINGS an innocent love song of her own composition, stealing seductive glances at Chris throughout the performance.

When the sun gets a little lower tonight, I'm going to start a calisthenics routine. I think after the check comes in, I'll try to find some mountains I can climb everyday till spring comes. I gotta see how far the money's gonna go. I'm going to have to pick up a lot of supplies before spring. So, I might take another job or I might be okay.

Chris looks up from his book to the wide open 16-year old smile of Tracy. Rainey laughs aloud. Chris smiles back, and against his better instincts, gives her a little wave- over with the paperback. Tracy jumps off her step, putting her guitar inside the rig, and trots like a little wood nymph to Chris.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't much older than Tracy when I got pregnant. And I thought my husband and I were going to invent peace on earth and stay together forever. But it didn't work out that way. He left. History. Now ancient history. And that was the end of that. So, I raised Reno by myself - that's my son. Then I met Rainey. And that was really good for a while. But Reno was already a teenager and was becoming a man in his own way. And then, I don't know. He kinda followed in his father's footsteps - out the door and gone. And I really don't know where he is. I haven't heard from him in two years.

	I spent most of my life in the army. On New Year's Eve 1957, I was stationed over in Okinawa. My wife and son were here in the States, just driving down the road when a fellow who'd had too much to drink plowed right into them. Killed them both. Anyway, you might think that the last thing in the world I'd do, is go to the whiskey, but at the time, it felt like the only thing I could do. And I did it hard. But pretty soon, I figured I wasn't doing my wife and son any good, mourning them with a bottle. So, I pulled myself together and quit drinking, cold turkey. And then...

	I had an idea. You know my mother was an only child. So was my father. And I was their only child. Now, with my own boy gone, I'm the end of the line. When I'm gone, my family will be finished. What do you say, you let me adopt you. I could be, say, your grandfather.

Chris' POV: Through the trees and fireweed, he sees something metallic and rusty. Chris moves up through the underbrush and the snow into the narrow tree line and on into the clearing, where before him:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DERELICT SCHOOL BUS. It is a vintage International Harvester from the 1940's.

He climbs a tree, swings from its branch, doing a flip in the air, landing on his feet, but then slipping on the snow and onto his butt and then onto his back. He grabs a handful of snow, shoves it in his mouth, melts it into water, and swallows it.

EXT. TEKLANIKA RIVER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the trees beside the river, we find Chris. The river is not yet in sight but Chris starts to HEAR it: A building rumble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Chris exits the treeline, there she is: The Teklanika at full flood. Seventy-five foot wide banks, replacing the narrow ice canal of four months earlier. Snowmelt from glaciers high in the Alaska range, its opaque glacial sediment the color of wet concrete. And what had been a distant rumble in the woods, now had the volume and power of a freight train, a seventy-five foot wide one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris grabs a hold of a riverside branch and takes one slow, careful step into the river. Without mercy, WHAM! the river kicks his feet out from under him! The branch he holds SNAPS! By some miracle, his hands move like lightening and he grabs a lower, sturdier branch below, saving himself from a certain death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE the broken branch catapulted down river and into a rocky shoot below. He pulls himself back onto the bank, drops his pack at riverside, and eases to a sitting position beside it.

Chris then grabs Tanaina Plantlore, the flora and fauna book he had gotten from the library in Fairbanks. And it takes him out of the bus like a divining rod. His nose in the book, he follows it.

INT./EXT. BUS - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The open bag of seeds beside Chris' sleeping body. We drift over to Chris' face, his lips de-hydrated, and skin parched. He breathes heavily. He awakens. He tries to sit up. It's a terrible struggle. Barely makes it to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris stumbles to the door of the bus, looking up at the hot sun. He has to sit back down on the small bus steps. From his position on the step, he leans back into the bus and is able to grab his water jug. He pours it into his mouth but nothing seems to satiate or hydrate him. He drinks it all. It spills over his face and chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We observe Chris for a moment as the wheels turn inside his haunted eyes. And a curiosity seems to overtake him. He crawls back to his copy of Tanaina Plantlore, flipping the pages one by one until he arrives at the photograph identifying the wild potato root and the word "edible" beside it. He reads the page to its conclusion and as almost an afterthought, turns the page to see if there might be more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The word - POISON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
jumps off the page at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The book describes the tiny green seeds of the potato root and warns that those with: lateral veins, such as those invisible on the leaflets of wild sweet peas are poisonous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The words - ...leading to partial motor paralysis...

A big moon shines above and we find on a tree branch, the squirrel Chris had clipped in the tail earlier in the day. On the last legs of bleeding to death, it falls from the tree. The moon becomes the sun and we pass a couple of days through visions of the nature about in varying light. CUT TO:

EXT. SUSHANA RIVER - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Chris labors up the riverbank with his water jug full. He is shirtless and absolutely emaciated. Frightening. He pauses at the river's edge to take air into his lungs. It's all he can do just to breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE ANGLE TABLEAU (CONTINUOUS): Chris standing at the river's edge catching his breath framed against the background of the 3000 foot butte that he'd so recently climbed with ease.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, maintaining this tableau, something moves from near CAMERA RIGHT into frame. Bit by bit we'll realize it's a LARGE BEAR ENTERING FRAME and moving away from camera toward Chris. It lumbers to within feet of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU OVER BEAR onto Chris: Chris, passive to the bear's presence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE: The bear, just as passive towards Chris, as though he didn't represent enough of anything to eat.

INT. BUS - DAY The diary/log: DAY 100 - MADE IT. BUT IN WEAKEST CONDITION OF LIFE. TOO WEAK TO WALK OUT. HAVE LITERALLY BECOME TRAPPED IN THE WILD - NO GAME IN SIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SUBTLE DRUM (HEART)BEAT BEGINS OVER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris plops himself down into the middle of the bus. He shakes his head as if trying to say something, and then considers his rifle and abundant ammunition. But taking his own life to avoid the agony of starvation is not an option for him. "No, no, no, don't do this to me." The frustration builds enough adrenaline in him to scream out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He does, but with a low, gurgled animal sound. He shakes it off and looks to his copy of Doctor Zhivago for distraction. Thumbing through the pages he focuses his eyes on the page -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE: The page: what he reads:
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.0)(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that an unshared happiness is not happiness...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Chris steals his pencil from within the pages of the book, scribbling across the page:
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)(O.C.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HAPPINESS ONLY REAL WHEN SHARED.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He flips backwards a couple of pages to where he had written the quote:
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)(O.C.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CALL EVERYTHING BY ITS RIGHT NAME.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He tears the back cover off the book and scratching the pencil across its blank side, writing these words quickly, as if in panic:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I HAVE HAD A HAPPY LIFE AND THANK THE LORD. GOODBYE AND MAY GOD BLESS ALL!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now, these words arrive slowly as we HEAR Chris repeating:
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.) (CONT'D) (with a weak voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call everything by its right name.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The drumbeat increases as he signs the note:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move from the page back up to Chris. We see that he has put on his eyeglasses to strengthen the vision of his weakening sight. He removes them, folds them, and lays them by his side. His body begins to tremble. His eyes dance wildly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The drumming intensifies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris takes one last look out the window. The sun is covered by a well-defined and puffy cloud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His arm nearing spasm reaches up to the bunk, grasping at the blue sleeping bag made by his mother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With great suffering and shattering trembles, he forces his body to defy its agony and pushes it into the sleeping bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SKYWARD, the cloud obscuring the sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drumbeats ESCALATE - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! We TIGHTEN on Chris' anguished face. (Director's note: These CU's on Chris' face, combine both static and hand-held CUs, upside down and right-side up moving, zooms, and push-ins. Straight, side, and dutch angles. Perhaps some intermittent distortion.)

</DIRECTION>

A SUDDEN CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
INT. BUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOTAL SILENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris looking at the sky, a cathartic tear falls from his left eye. Another from his right as the obscuring cloud clears the sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris: The LAST, AIRY EXPULSION OF HIS BREATH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His open face as the clearing light of the sun shines in his eyes. It is a face of peace, love, a face of true, deep serenity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The eyes joyously open and the corners of his mouth ease into the subtle smile of euphoric wisdom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That's the way he settles to stillness, looking directly into our camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And he died alive. He made it. He lived. He loved.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cat Stevens' Miles from Nowhere plays OVER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we PULL AWAY from Chris' face through the bus window and up into the sky -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We drift further and further away, above the stunted trees and the shimmering roof of the bus like a tiny white gleam in a wild green sea grows smaller and smaller.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REPRISE IMAGE of truck driver taking picture of Chris in scene #1.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then it's him:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The smiling STILL IMAGE we saw taken in the first scene from behind, but now we are seeing it from the front and it is the image of the real Christopher McCandless on the edge of the Stampede Trail. As it takes over the screen, we ZOOM SLOWLY into his smiling face. And then, these words appear superimposed over it: Dedicated to the memory of Christopher Johnson McCandless February 12, 1968 - August 18th, 1992
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As those words dissolve, these words appear: On September 19, 1992, Carine McCandless flew with her brother's ashes from Alaska home to the eastern seaboard. She carried them with her on the plane...in her backpack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
