</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some years from this exact moment...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DARKNESS - NOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beautiful CHIMING SOUNDS OF SPACE TRAVEL through the COSMOS... DOTS OF LIGHT whiz past our face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They could be stars at lightspeed, or... SUBWAY LIGHTS FLICKER ON - in a flash we see PALE, SULLEN FACES, riding into a bleak future, and hear the INDUSTRIAL CLATTER. It's dark, claustrophobic, obscure... the rhythmic beat of track and wheel-clicks engulf us. The lights flicker back on and hold as we see a half dozen SOLDIERS in BROWN CAMO, steel- eyed, prepared for whatever may be at the end of the TUNNEL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZERO IN on TWO: KABLE, 30-something, roughneck... focused, determined; eyes burning with internalized emotion...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and SANDRA, late 20s, undeniably hot but tough as hell - both are in shackles & cuffs, being roughly transported through underground tunnels, knocked and shoved around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Uniformed GUARDS roam the train, looking pissed off - their swagger seems to mask FEAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE is meditating, or exhausted - hard to tell. The GIRL makes eye contact w/ him.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sandra.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE says nothing, just stares at her, stoic.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Sandra.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut the fuck up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
Because he can, the GUARD takes a swing at KABLE'S head with a BILLY CLUB... CRACK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE'S skull snaps back into the window. The GUARD swings again, this time nailing KABLE square in the stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
(to the GUARD, a snarl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Putcher dick away...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get some.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
CRACKK!! CRACK!! CRACKK!! ... CRACK!! SANDRA is buckled over, awkwardly, hands behind her back tethered to the seat, head dripping blood. KABLE jerks against his restraints, every inch of him wanting to RIP THE MOTHERFUCKER APART... He uses his elbow to help her back up, but SANDRA fights through it, sits back up and spits blood - she can handle herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA holds TIGHT on KABLE and SANDRA... KABLE lets a glob of blood dangle from his mouth, biting his lip, bearing it... we hear the CRUNCHING SOUND of the CLUB working on the others... and the METALLIC RUMBLE and CLATTER of the TRAIN - growing louder, POUNDING, slamming into our brains, blotting out all thought... until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL #1 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV: we are RUNNING, ragged, full sprint, down a TUNNEL towards dirty white DAYLIGHT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NO MUSIC - just heavy breath, KABLE'S HEARTBEAT and the sound of his boots bouncing off the concrete...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Others are running with us - SOLDIERS with weapons... at the tunnel's end: vaguely defined shapes of buildings, smoke, sky...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our POV WHITES OUT as we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPAWN POINT #1 - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... smash into the DAYLIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smoke plumes hang from a recent skirmish. KABLE climbs over burning debris, gun raised, as SANDRA and the other soldiers disappear into the grey mist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE emerges from the smoke into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... a DESTROYED CITY - PHILLY? DETROIT? NY? Seemingly out of character, he LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR SLO-MO and lands in an OVERDRAMATIC, ROCKSTAR POSE (Nine Inch Nails, Coachella 2005).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In sequence, multicolored LEDs on his weapon COME TO LIFE - accompanied by a low frequency hum that seems to pierce somewhere below human hearing. The MULTIPLE TURRETS spin, then snap into place. GO TIME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OTHER SPAWN POINTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Other BROWN SOLDIERS emerge like SNAKES out of DIRT HOLES and INTO THE LIGHT. They crouch and spread out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What appear like BUZZING FLIES swarm thru the grey air - at a closer look, they are like tiny BALL BEARINGS that move like hummingbirds, magnetically controlled. The swarm splits apart - each FLY connects with a different SOLDIER - they hover one foot above and two feet behind the SOLDIER'S head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - COVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE slides behind a shredded telephone pole and TAKES COVER. The sound of trains, weapons, soldiers all fade away... until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOTHING. DEAD QUIET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY - A BULLET WHIZZES by KABLE's face - a pause - THEN we hear a GUNSHOT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another BULLET WHIRS by his leg and another by his shoulder - after the bullets pass, we hear the GUNSHOTS. See the lightning, wait for the thunder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the peripheral a SOLDIER in DEEP BLUE CAMO runs from behind an old car to a brick staircase. Then another BLUE runs the opposite way, closer in the foreground. BROWNS VS. BLUES?? The SILENCE is crawling, deafening, and then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. Suddenly we are in IRAQ TIMES TEN... KABLE'S eyes glance down at his WEAPON - the turrets quickly shift and rotate - he whips it up in a flash and RETURNS FIRE into the mist:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THOOM! THOOM! The shells puncture air and connect distantly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The air ripples all around him, his world closing in... he breaks free and runs toward an open street - THE TURRETS READJUST - he efficiently wastes two BLUES with automatic fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - OPEN STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A couple of PEDESTRIANS walk across the street, totally IGNORING THE VIOLENCE. KABLE makes a perfect 90 degree cut and wraps around a street-lamp and into the alley. A BUM holds out a can with a couple of coins and SHAKES it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From an aerial POV we see the area swarming with BROWN & BLUE combatants and a dozen CIVILIANS. In the top right corner of our frame we see the DULL REFLECTION of a FACE, somewhat transparent, watching the battle, tungsten red (similar to your own reflection on a TV).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SNAP BACK to the ground - the whole area is a BATTLEZONE. KABLE lines up another BLUE climbing the fire-escape to the third floor window - and then, coming from the REAR SURROUND SPEAKERS, behind us:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A VOICE - almost a whisper, too clean and distinct to be outdoors in this environment... and TOO YOUNG to possibly belong to KABLE.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (clean, disconnected)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eat shit please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
THWIPPP!! The BLUE drops like a sack. KABLE perfectly cuts back another 90 degrees and runs for an old store front. Inside a CLERK "air" bags groceries for an empty store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BROWN SOLDIER sets up a TRIPOD MACHINE GUN and aims for a bunker a hundred yards north. The distant BLUE targets seem almost robotically unaware. The BROWN SOLDIER plants his left hand on the ground for stability, right hand twisting the grip-lock - and squeezing the trigger: TAT TAT TAT TAT TAT TAT!!!! TATATATATATATATATA TAT!! The BLUES fall, some clumsily colliding into each other before they crash to the ground, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another team of BLUES rock their heads around to focus on him. Uh oh...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOOOOSH!!!! The BROWN TRIPOD GUNNER is vaporized from the knees up... the FOREARM that supported him is standing straight up, cleanly severed at the elbow. It slowly wobbles over and connects with the TWO LEGS severed at the knees. The THREE LIMBS fall into each other, forming a flesh and bone TRIPOD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VROOOOOOSH!!! CHUKUNK, CHUKUNK!! A SNOWPLOW BARRELS THROUGH THE DESTRUCTION, pushing the bodies and debris out of the way and clearing a path, one streaked with crimson red and burnt flesh. It moves fast and vanishes into the smoke clouds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down the road, KABLE saves an EAST-INDIAN WOMAN from getting obliterated by shoving her out of the way of the blazing truck. As KABLE turns to waste another BLUE, the EAST-INDIAN WOMAN gets right back up... walking into and getting obliterated by another TRUCK. It's creepy - robotic, but violent and too real - like a programmed suicide.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't say I didn't try...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
We sense emotion in KABLE'S cold eyes - then they flicker to the peripheral.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - 2ND FLOOR BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tracking along a row of blown out windows a BLUE is taking aim; we SNAP ZOOM in...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSED OVER THE IMAGE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The transparent GHOST OF A FACE, as though projected on glass. The LIPS MOVE in sync with:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit! Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE spins, TOO LATE -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUT: from the level directly below the SNIPER - through an open doorway - we see a BROWN SOLDIER, BLASTING STRAIGHT UP THROUGH THE CEILING! The BLUE is BLOWN TO CHUNKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BROWN runs out and hits the curb; CONCRETE AND MEAT collapse on the spot where she stood... it's SANDRA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE gives her covering fire as she heads his way. They bolt for a corner - KABLE reaches protection first. He stops to let SANDRA catch up, and in that instant -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER BRAINS GET BLOWN TO JELL-O. Blood and particles splatter over KABLE's gear.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suckage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Without hesitation KABLE turns and wastes two more BLUES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead HE SEES IT: an OCTAGON STEEL SHED with small GLOWING EMERALD GREEN WINDOWS. He makes for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The little FLY following him is picked out of the air by a stray shot - PLINK!
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... what the...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Bullets and shells chop up everything around KABLE, but he's QUICK...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHELL smacks his shoulder HARD, almost knocking him off his feet - shredding the BROWN CAMO and revealing the FLEXIBLE BODY ARMOR UNDERNEATH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He scrambles to the octagon's entrance and BAILS IN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAVE POINT #1
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE steps into the middle of the vacant steel room. The second he breaks the GREEN LASER, FLOOD LIGHTS blast on all around the BATTLEFIELD. A SUBMARINE ALARM sounds from loudspeakers everywhere, echoing through the streets, CYCLING DOWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The battle is over - session complete.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAVE POINT #1
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE steps out. The LEDS on his weapon blink off in sequence...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARMED GUARDS are EVERYWHERE, rounding up the I-Con's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
[I-CONs (I-Convicts) are the combatants -- death row inmates/lifers, of which there are never a shortage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENERI-CON's (Generic Convicts) are the street traffic that lend unpredictability and realism to the battlefield... they are computer controlled NPCs (non player characters)... petty thiefs and criminals who are risking their lives by participating to commute their sentences]
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DOZEN GUARDS collect weapons - TWO approach KABLE. His eyes are pure MURDER; SANDRA'S brain matter still drips from him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE WHIPS UP THE WEAPON, POINTS IT AT A GUARD'S HEAD AND PULLS THE TRIGGER -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOTHING. The GUARD doesn't even flinch. The WEAPON is DEAD, dormant; they all knew it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GUARDS have a good LAUGH... KABLE is CLUBBED from behind - we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN - LATER

Back on the rattling TRAIN, where we started. The SURVIVING SOLDIERS - both BROWN and BLUE - are shackled to the rail - wounded, exhausted, hollow eyed.

A spartan, underground LAB.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PLAIN-CLOTHES TECH sits on a stool holding a simple REMOTE; on the table next to him is a SMALL METAL DISH. In front of him, floating in the air, is one of the little metallic FLIES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pokes at it - it instantly jukes left; again - it jukes right... almost faster than the eye can follow. No way he could ever touch it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Semi-satisfied, he holds out the metal dish and clicks the remote. The FLY drops into the dish - CLINK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP: the little gunmetal ball is black and dented on one side - probably the one we saw get knocked out of the air. There is a PINHOLE GLASS LENS on the other end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TECH picks it up with thumb and forefinger and holds the lens up to his eyes. Switch to:

	It begins with a single nano-cell planted in the motor cortex of the brain -- this cell can replicate, replacing the cells `round it with perfect copies...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
We see a cartoon image of a tiny nano-cell - labeled with a bold, block letter N. The nano-cell approaches a normal cell next to it... there is a flash; now the cell next to it has turned into an exact copy of the nano. This continues, multiplying exponentially, until we zoom back to reveal that the entire brain has been converted to nano-cells.
</DIRECTION>
<KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... these copied cells contain remote access functionality. Therefore, nano plus cortex equals the nanex.

The graphic zooms back further to show a pair of hands working a retro ATARI-style joystick... animated waves indicate a wireless transmission from the joystick to the Slayer, who unfreezes and flies into action.

CASTLE waves in his PERSONAL SECURITY:

<DIRECTION>
A half dozen GEEKS in BLACK JEANS, BLACK T-SHIRTS w/ WHITE SOCKS and SNEAKERS; BACKPACKS... yes, even FANNY PACKS. A full range of GEEK VARIATIONS: beard/mustache combos, thick glasses, pony tails, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One GEEK brings out the CUTEST, SOFTEST little SPANIEL PUPPY in the world and places it in CASTLE'S LAP.

Underneath is the CLASSIC ILLUSTRATION showing the progression from primitive EARLY MAN to the erect MODERN HUMAN.

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PRISONER - shirtless, his upper body smeared with WHITE POWDER, screaming, SLAMS HIS FIST DOWN INTO FACE. Blood sprays on white.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see that he is beating down a uniformed GUARD. The GUARD wears a black gas mask, shattered and pouring blood. Other prisoners, shackled together, stand by watching, forming a half circle around the fight. They are shirtless, covered in the same white powder - they look like tribesmen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the prisoners, very distinctive, nods grimly, clearly enjoying the show.
</DIRECTION>
<DISTINCTIVE_PRISONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck him up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DISTINCTIVE_PRISONER>
<DIRECTION>
The prison yard is a vast expanse of white - it could be a chalk mine, or the surface of a strange planet. Distant towers mark the perimeter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Other groups of shackled prisoners can be seen in the distance, trotting along in lines. Trails of thick magenta smoke snake across the yard, sucked by the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ROGUE PRISONER stomps down on the GUARD'S face one last time - his shoes are made of cloth. CRUNCH. The GUARD stops moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PRISONER starts to run for it across the white terrain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of GUARDS appear to round up the remaining prisoners. They club them down with the butts of rifles but pay no mind to the fleeing ROGUE... they merely watch him go, impassive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a moment, we see why - when the ROGUE PRISONER crosses between the two distant towers he is jerked to the ground by an invisible field. Sound? Light? Magnetism? His body goes into spasms; blood foams from his ears, mouth, eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRISON REC AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fingers run through white powder, making patterns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A black shadow crosses the frame, accompanied by a low hum; some sort of aircraft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE looks up as the shadow tracks across him; we never see the craft. He looks out across the yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE is sitting in what seems to be a minimal REC AREA cut out of the white terrain. He sits by himself wearing a white cloth hoodie, eyes dark, head down, silent. Across the yard a group of prisoners are playing basketball; EVERY SINGLE PLAYER is SKYING for dunks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We focus in on KABLE'S TATTOO: I Am Right Here With You...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the yard a CRIPPLE, his two legs stiff with braces, walks ROBOTICALLY along on crutches. KABLE watches him, expressionless. It triggers a memory...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUN-SOAKED EXTERIOR

</DIRECTION>

We see that KABLE has drawn the pattern in his tattoo with his finger in the white powder; at the sound of the voice he runs his hand through it, wiping it away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wiry, jittery dude of indeterminate age is sitting next to KABLE. KABLE doesn't even turn to look.
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>

Twenty seven battles and three to go... no one ever got that close before, no one even done ten games without gettin they brains shot... but Kable, Kable, Kable, he just sittin, lookin, like he got a plan, he already somewhere else, he on a mission, nothin' get in his way, never break, never snap, never say shit, just take care of his business, niggaz get spooked by that shit. You spooky.

A prisoner sings Metallica off key, but balls to the walls:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Master! Master! Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings - Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRISONER>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE is alone in his cell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the base of the single door is a SLIDING COMPARTMENT to push food through - it opens. But instead of a tray, someone pushes through a wrinkled photograph.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE picks it up and looks - a WOMAN, just a blur of golden hair, laughing, and a LITTLE GIRL... the same one in KABLE'S vision.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to get back to them.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all you think about. It's the only thing that keeps you alive.

Her words are like hammer blows to his guts; he wants to weep but he's too strong, too internalized. He steels himself.
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's talking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes through a white NOTECARD and PEN.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sign it... please, Tillman. My son David is your biggest fan. He prays for you.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
This takes KABLE by surprise; he reluctantly takes the pen and card. He writes something on it and sticks it back through the slider.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PFFHHT. The WOMAN stabs KABLE'S hand with a LANCET - she draws out a little blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE yanks his hand back out.

	Wait.

(he holds the wrinkled photo to the window)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you get this picture? Have you seen them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<DIRECTION>
He peers through the little window at the top of the door, but she's GONE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instead, a group of PRISONERS are being led down the corridor to their NEW CELLS. We recognize grim, battered faces from the yard - these are the men that stood by as the GUARD was being beaten down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISTINCTIVE PRISONER - hands cuffed behind his back, makes eye contact with KABLE as he walks by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRISON RUNNING TRACK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A desolate white RUNNING TRACK; a guard TOWER overlooks... the field is empty but for ONE MAN: KABLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's busting ass around the track, pouring sweat. We're right there with him, CLOSE-UP - profile, full speed... we hear the HARD BREATHING, the feet pounding dirt, like we're INSIDE HIS HEAD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. URBAN DOWNTOWN #1 - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>

KABLE, running - we're even CLOSER NOW... he's pushing himself beyond exhaustion, pure focus...

Different city, same story - KABLE, a towering BILLBOARD PROJECTION... endless lanes of FREEWAY GRIDLOCK sprawling beneath...

<DIRECTION>
KABLE finally flames out... he breaks down to a jog, then doubles over, hands on his knees, gasping for breath.

CUT OUT WIDE: KABLE is ant-size and insignificant on the long, barren field, under a vast grey sky... ALONE.

Hold for a long beat, and...

FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #2 - DAY
</DIRECTION>

SHOCK CUT into the HEAT OF BATTLE.

CHAOS, CONFUSION... KABLE blasts through a cloud of exploding debris... A BROWN to his left is BLOWN IN HALF - the LEGS KEEP RUNNING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SLAYER BATTLEGROUND #2 - STREET

<DIRECTION>
TED NUGENT, in BROWN camo, lines up a BLUE SNIPER in a 3rd story window with a CROSS-BOW. He releases the arrow and pins the BLUE's HEAD to the window sill.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another five BLUE SOLDIERS are taken out. Their bodies drop to the ground, gruesome goodness. The FIVE BALL BEARING CAMERAS quickly flock together and check out each body as a swarming unit.

We can see the tension in KABLE'S FACE - he's helpless, trying to fight it, willing his player to take notice.

	What'd he say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A trickle of sweat runs down into KABLE'S EYE. The SOUND is more distinct now, CLOSER... he's practically shaking from the struggle to overcome the control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV: someone has reached the top of the stairs... KABLE, seen from behind, comes into view crouched by the blown out window.

	<DIALOGUE>
	D'oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE SPINS - FAST. The TURRET is ALREADY REVOLVING when he squeezes the trigger...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ARMOR-PIERCING SHELL takes SNEAKY BLUE by surprise, blowing him out the back of the building...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BLUES in the street take notice. It's a matter of seconds...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE makes a run for it as the floor starts to DISINTEGRATE behind him in a shitstorm of bullets. SHRAPNEL drills his back, absorbed by the BODY ARMOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #2
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hits daylight and turns a corner in time to see a group of BROWNS scattering... a live ARTILLERY SHELL skitters across the pavement, belching smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE is running... he looks to his right - A FROZEN MOMENT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SAVE POINT up ahead on the SPINNING RAILROAD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MOMENT passes; KABLE looks back over his shoulder - a rush of ROARING FLAME is COMING - FAST... at the moment of IMPACT we -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH TO BLACK
</DIRECTION>

INT. THE TRAIN - TIME INDETERMINATE

Two fat slices of WHOLE GRAIN BREAD, check.

Big sloppy spoonfuls of lumpy green ORGANIC PISTACHIO BUTTER, spread on SLICE A, check.

<DIRECTION>
Combine; CONSUME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SIMON'S HOUSE - HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIMON - 18, pale and lanky, unkempt shaggy hair; wearing a vintage Guns `n' Roses T-shirt from the Appetite For Destruction Tour - walks down a long, high ceilinged crystal hall with marble floors, macking on the sandwich... passes through a glass tunnel running through the interior of a massive, exotic aquarium - he's alone in what appears to be a vast, cold mansion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SIMON'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIMON'S ROOM is simple - FOUR WALLS and a CEILING, each one a 3-D, corner-to-corner VIDEO SCREEN. The HD level of the screens is virtually ABSOLUTE - the flesh and blood SIMON himself is just another element in a HIGH-DOLLAR/HIGH-TECH SPACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FLOOR is ALL BED. SIMON PADS IN, takes a spinning STUNT JUMP and ROLLS onto his back in a big ass pile of pillows, sandwich intact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SCREENS are a jumble of floating frames, competing for prominence in the 3-D space... muted VID CHATS, STOCK TICKERS, SPORTS SCORES, ultraviolent SLAYERS playback, etc. Everything dynamic, everything moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One whole wall is apparently a REAL TIME monitor of the SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND, with updated statistics... POINTS LEADER, FRAG COUNT - we notice that KABLE leads these categories; a video loop of KABLE in action beside his name illustrates the point.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the FOREFRONT of SIMON'S attention:
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	KABLE EARNS 800 UPGRADE POINTS
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A set of dynamic frames allow him to scroll through a series of revolving images - WEAPONS, EQUIPMENT, BODY ARMOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIMON interacts with the 3-D environment using HAND GESTURES - he can SLIDE, SQUEEZE, PULL AND SCROLL the images just by moving his fingers in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He flips past various TRANSFORMERS-looking SUPER GUNS...
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gay... gay... gay... super gay... hm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
He stops on an animated graphic. A SEXY FEMALE VOICE breaks it all down for us:
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swarmers. The latest innovation from Browning, this self detonating cartridge offers the widest and deadliest spray available from a full tracking, cornering ordnance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A VIDEO DEMO shows the fired cartridge SPLIT into two-dozen smaller shells that FLASH OUT like a swarm of bees, wind around a corner and utterly SHRED a TEST DUMMY.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy like...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
An ANNOYING GIRL'S VOICE pops in, along with a VID CHAT SCREEN that takes over the MAIN WALL. She looks about 16 - skinny, skanky, kind of hot.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOYING_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Simon!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOYING_GIRL>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fan-girl, stop hacking. If I want you unmuted I'll unmute you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<ANNOYING_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You suck, Simon - you're going to get my boyfriend killed before he can get out of jail and fill me up with his hot seed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOYING_GIRL>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
Another GIRL - 17, cute, stoned - chimes in.
</DIRECTION>
<CUTE_STONED_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Simon, I just wanna play you. Forget about that star-fucker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUTE_STONED_GIRL>
<ANNOYING_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOYING_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
SIMON casually waves his hand at the frame, like flicking at a fly; ANNOYING GIRL is wiped away, bringing CUTE STONED GIRL to the forefront.
</DIRECTION>
<CUTE_STONED_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks baby. When can I meet you for like reals?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUTE_STONED_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
SIMON notices a metallic sparkle from the GIRL'S TONGUE.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(like a dentist)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaaa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches out and "pinches" the screen, ZOOMING IN close as she sticks out her tongue - it fills the wall... a dozen wicked looking BLACK TONGUE RINGS stud the wet pink flesh, TEN FEET HIGH.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Woah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
He quickly unsqueezes, zooming back out. The GIRL'S eyes are rolled back in her head, euphoric; she's WASTED.
</DIRECTION>
<CUTE_STONED_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUTE_STONED_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
A THIRD GIRL pops in, filling the opposite wall.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's up, loser?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELLY>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey sissy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
This is SIMON'S SISTER, SHELLY, 14. Frosted up lips, eyes and hair like a Tokyo hooker.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom says - let me see, go to college, move the fuck out, and... oh yeah, you're a sick retard, you're pathetic, and you smell like Jeffrey Dahmer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELLY>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wanna make out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<SHELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wish. I can't wait til they cut you off, Simian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELLY>
<DIRECTION>
With a wave of his hand he wipes her image off the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO MORE video chats pop up - TWIN 21-YEAR OLD GIRLS, stupidly hot.
</DIRECTION>
<TWINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Simon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWINS>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>

<TWINS>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my god, it's really you!!!

Suddenly all of SIMON's screens are filled with the TWINS.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice.

</SIMON>
<TWINS>
<DIRECTION>

</TWINS>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
They lift their shirts, GIRLS GONE WILD style. Perfect perky C's with silver-dollar nipples.
</DIRECTION>
<TWIN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmmm, now that we have your attention, here's another offer you can't refuse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWIN_1>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
When TWIN 2 speaks, it is with a MAN'S VOICE. The accent is EASTERN EUROPEAN.
</DIRECTION>
<TWIN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifty million euros for control of Kable, instant transfer to the account of your choice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWIN_2>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Question: do I look like I need the money? We've discussed this before - Kable is not for sale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<TWIN_1>
<DIRECTION>
(feeling herself up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby... make it a hundred.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWIN_1>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
SIMON snaps his fingers; all the windows close simultaneously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIMON makes a clicking sound with his tongue in the new silence. Peace at last.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BY THEMSELVES, the screens come BACK TO LIFE.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	D'oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
The instant chat boxes are gone, replaced by a soundless, GRAINY VIDEO LOOP - there is something sinister about the lo- fi image... it looks like the feed from an old SURVEILLANCE CAM:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two men are sitting in a room... it's silent, but one of them seems to be SCREAMING - he lifts a gun...
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuh...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
... waits a beat... and SHOOTS THE OTHER MAN IN THE HEAD. Black blood pools. This is REAL. The loop repeats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the SHOOTER turns his face toward the camera, SIMON freezes the frame with a gesture and ZOOMS IN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's KABLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MESSAGE is typed across the screen one letter at a time - we may recognize the retro chicago font from the HUMANZ video prank earlier:
</DIRECTION>
<want_to_talk_to_him>
<DIRECTION>
Then, blinking, lo-fi in the lower right corner of the wall:
</DIRECTION>
<WALKIETALKIE_exe SIMON>

MUSIC: Bloodhound Gang, The Bad Touch:

<DIRECTION>
Ha-ha, well now, we call this the act of mating But there are several other very important differences Between human beings and animals That you should know about...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAVEMENT flies by... sun SLAMS rainbow flares into the lens... ROLLER SKATES break frame, outpacing us...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're cruising along with a group of YOUNG, BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, skating like ROBOTS through a CITY PARK... Roller-Dolly follows HOT GIRLS in DAISY DUKES, knee socks and tube tops, belly rings and tatoos in the small of their backs... ATHLETIC DUDES, shirtless, gun racks and six packs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They SWING THEIR ARMS mechanically, identically... synced with each other and the beat of the soundtrack... each face plastered with an absurd, exaggerated GRIN... let's FUCKING PARTY!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are in a super-saturated world... NOT virtual/animated, but absolutely real - yet the color and immediacy of it is heightened, off-kilter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the GRASS, a gang of TOKYO POP PUNK ROCKERS are having a WATER BATTLE, blasting and soaking each other with big plastic WATER CANNONS like something out of SLAYERS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A REDHEAD, soaking wet, is FEELING UP HER OWN BREASTS, totally OBLIVIOUS to her surroundings... One of the SKATERS, out of control, PLOWS RIGHT INTO HER at full speed... The SKATER takes a ride on concrete, grinding flesh off her bare legs... she wobbles to her feet, EYES STREAMING TEARS but STILL GRINNING ecstatically...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A guy in a PRIEST OUTFIT holding brightly colored helium balloons looks on impassively; then spots something of interest and breaks off SPRINTING FULL SPEED...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People are DANCING - the corniest moves ever... MAKING OUT on the ground... and in the middle of it all...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SOCIETY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP: a SPARROW is pecking at a hunk of orange and yellow CANDY CORN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POP OUT WIDE to reveal that the BIRD is EATING OUT OF A GIRL'S HAND...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is ANGIE: 25, BLONDE/black roots... micro mini skirt, fishnets, boots... green-eyes, haunted, with sadness behind them; pretty - the clothes don't quite match her; it's like someone dressed her up as a hooker.... She doesn't seem to notice the little bird munching away; she stands in the middle of the PARK, looking around, lost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She spots a GUY standing by himself near a giant sculpture. She walks over to him; the BIRD flutters away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GUY is young and attractive, dressed in casual business attire. He is wearing a PLASTIC PIG SNOUT on his face, tied with an elastic band.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>

He smiles like a Driver's License photo.

ANGIE strikes an exaggeratedly DEMURE, FLIRTATIOUS POSE - then immediately snaps back to NEUTRALITY.

She strikes the same FLIRTY POSE for the second time.
</DIRECTION>
<DALE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are somewhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DALE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He WINKS; reaches out and puts a hand on her WAIST. They start to make out like TEENAGERS at the PROM. DALE/GUY LIFTS UP HER SKIRT with one hand and SQUEEZES A BOOB with the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns her around and presses ANGIE'S back up against the base of the sculpture, ROUGH, hands all over her/inside her; SLOBBERING down her neck and shoulders...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGIE just looks straight ahead... her EYES move to a nearby building - the side is an ANIMATED BILLBOARD that has switched to a promo for SLAYERS, with KABLE featured prominently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She watches KABLE'S face move... she lets out an involuntary MOAN that is more like a whimper...

INT. GORGE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

We get our first wider view of the room. Much more cramped than SIMON'S ROOM... like SIMON'S, the room is dominated by a GIANT VIDEO SCREEN, but just the front wall... there are other - smaller, paper thin - screens mounted in various spots and leaning against walls; GARBAGE and TECH GEAR all over the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORGE - late 30s, MORBIDLY OBESE - is contained by a massive automated rolling chair, like the Escalade of Rascals.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The HUMANZ message has taken over his screen and he's GOING FUCKING BALLISTIC, throwing shit at it and gesturing crazily to the wall-mounted MOTION SENSORS with his hands, trying to get the image back. It's NOT HAPPENING.

The TV REPORT continues on screen, where a NEWS HOST is backed by a graphic showing the "society is rape" screen with footage of exaggeratedly CONFUSED, FRUSTRATED PLAYERS - they're like the actors in INFOMERCIALS who can't manage to peel a potato without losing their shit.
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_NEWS_HOST>

	All contact between Society City and an estimated quarter of a million players was shut down for over three hours while Castle techs worked to remove what they described as a "Satellite Infection"...

<DIRECTION>
CASTLE is cruising downhill in a 360 degree THREE-DIMENSIONAL ENVIRONMENT that looks ABSOLUTELY REAL - except that he is on a STATIONARY BIKE, and the NEWS REPORT is floating in the air as a 3D WINDOW. He is wearing skintight Tour de France-style gear and SLURPING A SMOOTHIE, one hand on the handlebar, the other holding the cup.

	GET IT OUT OF ME...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASIAN_PRISONER>
<DIRECTION>
He rips into his BRAIN STEM with a tiny piece of busted RAZOR, hoping to pull out a chip, a wire, anything. He pulls out something, and drops like a sack of potatoes to the floor - FRIED POTATOES. He lands on a couple of dumbbells, his head smashing into the weight bench, spinal cord SEVERED.

KABLE looks on, impassive, emotion internalized. GUARDS push through.

<DIRECTION>
Across the room KABLE notices a NEW GUY - a mean-looking sunofabitch... in fact, if murder were personified it would look exactly like HACKMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HACKMAN stares straight at KABLE. There is something in his ghost of a smile that says he'd be more than happy to eviscerate you... it's off-putting to say the least.

KABLE and the GUARD are ANT-SIZED in what looks like a massive driving range. VIRTUAL TARGETS are holographically projected in mid-air at various heights and distances. Other PRISONERS are there too, a ways off; well out of earshot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE looks over a Swarmer cartridge, slams it into his weapon; switches turrets, takes a bead on a VIRTUAL TARGET...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see him intentionally PAN THE SIGHT OFF to the left of target; he pulls the trigger - CLICK. The TARGET - and several others close by - turns RED, BLINKS - a HIT. This thing doesn't just take out individuals; it takes out VICINITIES.

<HISPANIC_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who aims... the slayer? Or the player?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HISPANIC_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE narrows his eyes, focuses across the field, where other PRISONERS are being briefed and UPGRADED... he spots HACKMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not much to aiming... it's just hand/eye coordination. I'm the hand... someone, somewhere else is the eye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<HISPANIC_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's tripped.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HISPANIC_GUARD>

KABLE glances at the GUARD... he struggles - part of him feels like he's talking too much; but he can't help being grateful for the human interaction.
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>

	Sometimes... they take over - you know, completely. They move you. Like a robot.

	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a delay...
	</DIALOGUE>

<HISPANIC_GUARD>

KABLE gets a bead for a headshot on HACKMAN.

<KABLE>

He pulls the trigger: a meaty CLICK.

INT. PRISON LOCKER ROOM, NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE is ALONE, toweling off - privilege of being a TOP SLAYER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see now the DAMAGE his body has taken - he is covered in dark, ugly BRUISES from BULLET HITS the body armor has absorbed - including a flinch-inducing cluster of BLACK, BLUE AND YELLOW from the most recent session.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From down the row of lockers, a WHISPER:
</DIRECTION>
<HACKMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Kable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HACKMAN>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE turns to look. HACKMAN'S head is POKED OUT sideways from around the corner; he's maybe 20 feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not interested.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<HACKMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Wait. Look.

</HACKMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He brings his HANDS out where KABLE can see them - they are SLICK WITH FRESH BLOOD.
</DIRECTION>
<HACKMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just deleted someone.

<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the blood. Look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HACKMAN>
<DIRECTION>
HACKMAN rubs his SLIPPERY HANDS together, relishing it; he nods his head toward the area behind the lockers... to call the situation CREEPY would be a serious understatement.
</DIRECTION>
<HACKMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's back here. Want to see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HACKMAN>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your head ain't on straight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<DIRECTION>
HACKMAN cracks his neck. Maybe not. KABLE pulls on his PRISON GREYS quickly, refusing to make EYE CONTACT.
</DIRECTION>
<HACKMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to delete you too. On Sunday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HACKMAN>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why they put me here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HACKMAN>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE'S eyes narrow - What?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HACKMAN disappears; he starts to move along an ADJACENT ROW OF LOCKERS, slamming the doors - SINGING fucking PINOCCHIO:
</DIRECTION>
<HACKMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got no strings... So I have fun... I'm not tied up to anyone... They've got strings But you can see There are no strings on me...

	On the outside... oh, I'm sorry - I meant your pretty girls... You want to get back to them but I'm going to visit them first...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HACKMAN>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE is instantly ALL BUSINESS - he's going to make HACKMAN disappear RIGHT THE FUCK NOW...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He JAMS around the corner but HACKMAN is NOWHERE TO BE SEEN... past another row of lockers - NOTHING... another... another... WHERE THE HELL IS HE?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOWHERE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE SLAMS a FIST into a locker, BUSTING it off it's hinges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRANSITION TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE ESTATE - TIME INDETERMINATE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA ANGLE on HACKMAN begins to switch perspectives and spin around, as though someone is manipulating it in three dimensions.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's so perfect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
Snap out to reveal CASTLE in a dark lounge; the walls and ceiling are pure black, making it impossible to tell the dimensions of the room. Minimalist, expensive looking furniture is scattered around. THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN THE ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CASTLE is standing, bare feet on white shag carpet. He is manipulating the image of HACKMAN in the air by pulling, squeezing, twisting with his hands - the interface is similar to the one in SIMON'S room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CASTLE is as pumped as a kid on Christmas morning. Then, from behind him:
</DIRECTION>
<CASTLE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's scary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTLE_2>
<DIRECTION>
We see that a perfect double of CASTLE himself has appeared in the room behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
He changes the angle on HACKMAN'S mug to give a better view - then turns to face his DOUBLE...
</DIRECTION>
<CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (proudly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The new face of Slayers. Pure crystallized horror, two stories tall and covered in bloody red...

	He's so what they want.
	</DIALOGUE>

Another CASTLE appears to CASTLE'S left.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTLE_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTLE_3>
<DIRECTION>
CASTLE faces them.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
(unaffected)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They do now. But when my boy kills their hero right there in front of their eyeballs, so vivid it's like you can reach out and feel the wet flesh - Trust me, they'll change their point of view.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTLE>
<CASTLE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you be sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTLE_2>
<CASTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's human nature. They'll be seduced by the power, the violence... the dominance...

</CASTLE>
<CASTLE_3>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess we never figured on Kable blowing up as big as he did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTLE_3>
<CASTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bigger than the game? No. Then again, who ever would've imagined a player could last over a dozen sessions with the same I-con...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTLE>
<CASTLE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tillman is a perfect soldier, a tactical killing computer - you dropped him in with common murderers. What did you expect?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTLE_2>
<CASTLE_3>
<DIRECTION>
(musing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His instincts give him an edge.

<CASTLE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And in the hands of a talented player...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTLE_2>
<CASTLE_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course we can never let him out. Not after what we did to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTLE_3>
<CASTLE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me again why we don't just get rid of the problem...

<DIRECTION>
(makes a throat slashing motion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, off camera?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTLE_2>
<DIRECTION>
CASTLE pokes a finger at CASTLE 2.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU - lack a flair for marketing. The people would never accept that. They need to SEE their gladiators brought down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTLE>
<CASTLE_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One thing I know is what makes people tick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTLE_3>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the room has gone dead silent. We swing the camera around to reveal that CASTLE 3 is all alone in the room. He stares into the void, calm and utterly in control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA moves past his head into PURE BLACK...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL #2 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black of the underground tunnel... the TUNNEL LIGHTS streak past like vanishing stars... TRAIN TRACKS blur by...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL #2 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE is SPRINTING down the TUNNEL towards DAYLIGHT. The VOICE comes from the rear surrounds:

<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kable, dude. It's me.

EXT. SPAWN POINT #3 - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are in the OVER-THE-SHOULDER POV of the FLY CAM as KABLE breaks daylight and slides down the hillside... superimposed over the IMAGE: SIMON'S REFLECTED FACE... the CAMERA pans, centers and FOCUSES IN on the REFLECTION...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SNIPER BULLETS whistle by; KABLE DUCKS, ROLLS... the CAMERA PULLS BACK... OUT OF THE SCREEN...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SIMON'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... past the flesh and blood SIMON into an OVER-THE-SHOULDER - SIMON controlling KABLE, PLAYING HIM - as...

KABLE LANDS in the ROCKSTAR POSE. SIMON mirrors him in front of the GIANT SCREEN - whatever SIMON does, KABLE echoes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BATTLEGROUND #3/COVER - CONTINUOUS

KABLE makes it to cover, HEART SLAMMING. We hear the distant THUMPS of MORTARS LAUNCHING.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BATTLEGROUND #3/COVER - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE finishes the POP-LOCK - it's goofy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHELL impacts the dirt nearby and BLOWS A MASSIVE CRATER in the firma; KABLE shields himself from the raining DEBRIS and scrambles for better cover.
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Pay attention to the game.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<DIRECTION>
They spot another BROWN advancing toward a group of BUILDINGS; SIMON moves KABLE to join him. Just as KABLE gets there a BLUE KICKS OUT A DOOR and opens up with an ASSAULT SHOTGUN, shredding the BROWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two more BLUES POP OUT of a DITCH on the OPPOSITE SIDE, TRIANGULATING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE ROLLS - BIG AMMO displacing the air just inches above his head and BLOWING OUT the windows/tires of an ABANDONED CAR behind him - switches TURRETS and comes up FIRING... armor-piercing shells: BOOM. BOOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A 180 spin... BOOM. MINUS three BLUES.

INT. SIMON'S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

In QUICK CUTS we see SIMON striking BADASS poses; on the 3D screen KABLE ECHOES THEM - it's like a SYNCHRONIZED DANCE.

KABLE keeps moving - he passes a BLUE, on his knees in the mud; The BLUE has completely LOST HIS SHIT.

</BLUE_SOLDIER_4>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE doesn't bother to shoot him; he's UNARMED. But...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHHHTUNK. A 50 CALIBER SHELL connects from somewhere distant and the BLUE is VAPORIZED, a smear on the pavement.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cause I'm a badass motherfucker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE doesn't even register this. His darting eyes pick up a familiar face in the chaos: FREEK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREEK has apparently volunteered as a generi-con - he is dressed as a postman, pulling a cart of mail behind him as he walks across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<FREEK>
<DIRECTION>
(mumbling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotta keep my holes down... keep `em down. Freek's gonna make it, gonna cut, gonna scatter... gonna burn this joint...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREEK>
<DIRECTION>
It all happens too quickly: A BROWN scrambles behind FREEK and ducks down, using him as a moving human shield; squeezes off a few shots - FREEK is chopped up by incoming gunfire - the BROWN keeps running... there's nothing KABLE can do.

An explosion nearby pushes them forward.

INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING - STAIRWELL

But there's still juice feeding the dim FLUORESCENTS... KABLE makes his way DOWN. A distant voyeur's POV - maybe a sniper's telescopic sight? - observes KABLE disappearing underground.

EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #3/NEAR RESTRICTED AREA - MOMENTS LATER

KABLE emerges several blocks from where he started, on a narrow block that seems distant from the heat of combat. Buildings shelter the street on either side... several blocks down a LOW WALL BLOCKS THE ROAD - marked with RED DIAGONAL STRIPES and a warning: RESTRICTED.

KABLE just grunts; his eyes steal a last look down the block. They head the other way...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THOOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE RANGE: a big ass armor piercing MORTAR SHELL PASSES IN FRONT OF KABLE'S FACE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Time STOPS; KABLE sees the shell moving through the air an inch from his nose in ULTRA SLO-MO... his cheeks ripple from the displaced air...

then, REAL TIME - we whip around to follow the mortar as it whistles into concrete and BLOWS OUT the front of a building.

He rolls behind a CRUSHED RIOT VAN and OPENS UP in the direction the shell came from, ash and debris from the impact still raining down... and then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From behind, he's NAILED IN THE BACK by a SWUNG length of IRON PIPE. He half crumples, spins - HACKMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HACKMAN SWINGS AGAIN, knocking the WEAPON out of KABLE'S hand; it skitters across the concrete.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIMON is completely freaked - it's happening too fast, no time to react... he tries to engage HAND-TO-HAND but every move pings a step late...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE swings a fist; HACKMAN dodges easily. HACKMAN is moving too naturally - as if he's under his own control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HACKMAN slams the pipe off the side of KABLE'S head, DROPPING HIM - then tosses the pipe away... and pulls out a nasty, high tech-looking SHOTGUN. He stands over KABLE and points the barrel at his FACE.

<DIRECTION>
KABLE cups a hand over his mouth, conspiratorially, and speaks directly into SIMON'S ear:
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me. I don't know who's behind it, or why, but I was supposed to die today. They're gunning for us. I can beat them, but not with you controlling me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
This is unthinkable, dangerous talk.
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn me loose, kid. You want to win, turn me loose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But-
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Find a way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<DIRECTION>
A GUARD grabs KABLE and the LINK BREAKS - we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH TO BLACK:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANGIE'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A drab brownstone apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shades block out the oppressive nicotine sunlight; the interior is mute, faded - claustrophobic. KABLE has his cell; even though ANGIE is on the outside, and free, her environment seems to parallel his.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A worn-out photo is taped to the fridge: the same little girl in KABLE'S picture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANGIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stands in front of a closet mirror in the bedroom, looking herself over. She's FULLY DRESSED... but not like we saw her in society. Conservative. Pretty. NORMAL. She rehearses a friendly smile, but has difficulty not breaking into tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANIMATED, COLORED LIGHT leaks in from outside through the dark window blinds behind her - some sort of projected advertising?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANGIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: same room, later. ANGIE sits on the unmade bed. She searches through her purse for a PILL JAR, rattles a few into her hand... she DRY SWALLOWS them... leans forward, eyes shut, struggling NOT TO PASS OUT... she has to pull herself together somehow... the CAMERA pushes past her, toward the window, where the ANIMATED COLORS play 24-7...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANGIE'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... the CAMERA pulls away, continuing the motion: we are on a wide view of the outside of the building, a rundown brownstone on a rundown street - animated advertising covers half the side of the structure...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ad for slayers is running - KABLE, in cinematic slo-mo, and superimposed in wall-height block letters:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREE. And then: ORDER NOW!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SOCIAL SERVICES INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGIE sits uncomfortably in a hard plastic chair; the light is flat, fluorescent... in front of her, behind a desk, is a no-nonsense Social Services CASEWORKER, late 30s, CUBAN.
</DIRECTION>
<CASEWORKER>
<DIRECTION>
(looks over her paperwork)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... Miss Roth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEWORKER>
<DIRECTION>
ANGIE delivers the smile we saw her rehearse with all the warmth she can muster; it's not convincing.
</DIRECTION>
<CASEWORKER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are we here today... says you'd like to apply for custody of your child-
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEWORKER>
<ANGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Delia. Her name is Delia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGIE>
<DIRECTION>
The CASEWORKER looks over the paperwork while ANGIE shifts in her seat... torture.
</DIRECTION>
<CASEWORKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spouse incarcerated, life without possibility of parole. You use your maiden name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEWORKER>
<ANGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My husband - he... it's not entirely true, regarding his sentence. In fact, he's due to be released soon...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGIE>
<DIRECTION>
She makes brief eye contact with ANGIE.
</DIRECTION>
<CASEWORKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your husband was charged and convicted of first degree murder, Miss Roth. I can hardly consider his release, if it was to occur, to be a positive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEWORKER>
<DIRECTION>
This is not going well. ANGIE holds her tongue with all of her will, not wanting to make it worse. The CASEWORKER holds all the cards.
</DIRECTION>
<CASEWORKER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (changes subject, back at the paperwork)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're... an actor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEWORKER>
<DIRECTION>
ANGIE nods.
</DIRECTION>
<CASEWORKER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not sure if I've seen you in anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEWORKER>
<ANGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I work in society.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGIE>
<CASEWORKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Acting, is that what they call it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEWORKER>
<ANGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGIE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGIE is hanging on... be pleasant, be friendly, breathe... but INSIDE she wants to cry, to scream, to fucking EXPLODE.
</DIRECTION>
<CASEWORKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Roth. Your child has been... exceedingly well placed. The new family is very wealthy. She'll never want for anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(leans in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand you love your little girl, but... do you really think she'd be better off with people like you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEWORKER>
<ANGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I do. I'm her mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGIE>
<DIRECTION>
The CASEWORKER presses a buzzer, unlocking the door behind ANGIE.
</DIRECTION>
<CASEWORKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We will give your application all the consideration that it merits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEWORKER>
<DIRECTION>
The words burn into ANGIE like battery acid, but there's not a thing she can say.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SIMON'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIMON is lying on his bed, staring at the ceiling - a GIANT VIDEO SCREEN playing back key moments of that day's Slayers session in an endless loop. SIMON holds his fingers up in front of his face, zooming and rewinding the video with little fluid movements of his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the screen GLITCHES OUT, goes dead for a second - and when it comes back the battle images are replaced by a GIANT FACE, surrounded by black, STARING DOWN AT HIM:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HUMANZ BROTHER, early 30's; a savvy leader with an unforgettable presence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His style is a throwback to another era; like a 70s Black Panther Soul Brother transplanted into the high tech future.
</DIRECTION>
<HUMANZ_BROTHER>

<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To what, um, brotha do you refer... brotha?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<HUMANZ_BROTHER>

	Kable wants the freedom to ass- kick. Do shit his way. You gonna give it to him?

<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were listening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<HUMANZ_BROTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We see and hear everything that goes on inside the so-called game.

<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(considering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kable said we got lucky - that they were gunning for us - what was that all about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<HUMANZ_BROTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kable got a past... he knows things. Things he don't even know he know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUMANZ_BROTHER>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh? What things?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<HUMANZ_BROTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Things Castle's afraid of. As long as your boy stay on the inside Castle know he can keep him quiet - but if ever got out...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh uh. Castle will never let that happen.

</HUMANZ_BROTHER>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One battle left, I think I can handle my bidness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
HUMANZ BROTHER just shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<HUMANZ_BROTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not hearing me - this is not something you can control. They gonna kill his ass, Simon. In the eyes of the world. And then what? You just another poor little rich honky. No Kable, no pussy, no shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUMANZ_BROTHER>
<DIRECTION>
SIMON can't deal.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is, come on... too heavy... I don't know what the hell you're talking about... I just play games, man. Games.
	</DIALOGUE>

<HUMANZ_BROTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm hm. That's right, it's a game.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to win it, don't you?

</HUMANZ_BROTHER>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, dude, I intend to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<HUMANZ_BROTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you need to cutcho strings, puppet-massa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUMANZ_BROTHER>
<DIRECTION>
HUMANZ BROTHER slowly ZOOMS HIMSELF IN.
</DIRECTION>
<HUMANZ_BROTHER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Imagine a slayer that don't got to wait to be told what to do. No ping, you dig? A trained killing machine... operating in real time, on pure instinct.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUMANZ_BROTHER>
<DIRECTION>
SIMON can't help but consider it, mind reeling. It's obvious KABLE would royally fucking dominate, but... SIMON shakes it off.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That... would be cheating.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<HUMANZ_BROTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A mod, that's all. Like that guidance system you hacked on three weeks ago lets you track motherfuckers around corners and shit.

(nervous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do. I do feel you.

<HUMANZ_BROTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then let's rock, baby.

<DIRECTION>
[MUSIC: TWISTED SISTER, "I WANNA ROCK" kicks in]

A WINDOW pops up on the screen:

CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
INT. PRISON - HACKMAN'S CELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
[ "I WANNA ROCK" continues...]
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One light... HACKMAN'S FACE, glistening with sweat, is the only thing partially visible in the inky black... the CAMERA slowly ZOOMS into his EYES... twin pools of MADNESS... of MURDER...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRISON, KABLE'S CELL - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP of the FADED PHOTO... gold hair, innocent laughter... KABLE runs his thumb across it tenderly, caressing the lines...
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tillman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE looks up. It's the SAME VOICE as before - the one that gave him the photo.
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You.

</KABLE>
<WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>

</KABLE>
<WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>

</WOMAN>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know something else: whether or not he's controlling you, you will never reach the save point. Castle won't allow it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Listen to me, Tillman - the game is unwinnable - they will not let you live. If you're want to get out and see the people in the picture you'll have to find another way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE doesn't answer; he absorbs her words, wondering if he can believe them... finally:
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need you to get me something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, Kable... what can I get you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE stares into the DARK, turning it over in his head, then looks up at the WINDOW in the door, a simple black rectangle - and on the other side, his only LIFELINE.
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drunk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAGING ROOM - TIME INDETERMINATE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Overhead fluorescents shock and hum to life, revealing a CLAUSTROPHOBIC ROOM - four walls, metal grating underfoot - and A LOCKER. KABLE is in his COMBAT BROWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He PRINT ACTIVATES the locker. The WEAPON is there... and something else: a wrinkled BROWN PAPER BAG. What the hell? He takes it out, trying not to glance too obviously at the overhead SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO the POV from the CAM: KABLE is opening the bag...
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's he got there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
BACK in the room. Inside the brown bag is a FIFTH OF VODKA. KABLE quickly slips it into his side cargo-pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kable, what the hell is that?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Behind KABLE a DOOR SLIDES OPEN automatically, revealing a CONCRETE TUNNEL, like the PLAYERS' entrance to a FOOTBALL STADIUM... the WHITE LIGHT is BLINKING ON and OFF... SOLDIERS sprint for the daylight, trying to escape the TORTURE... it's CHAOS.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck-face - remove the `molotov' from your pants and discard into the recycle bin, now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE grabs the bottle from his pocket, struggling to maintain as the LIGHT slams into his brain, AGONY.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PUT IT DOWN!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
ALL SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS POINT AT KABLE. KABLE - no choice - makes the decision, twists the cap, tilts his head back, and SLAMS THE ENTIRE BOTTLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wails the BOTTLE at one of the CAMERAS, shattering it - and joins the others rushing into combat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPAWN POINT #4 - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE breaks the DAYLIGHT - but without a smooth LEAP AND ROLL, and no ROCKSTAR POSE - instead, he TRIPS and tumbles ASS OVER END down an embankment, landing in a heap at the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can see turning you loose was a great idea.

	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU happened, jackass. You wanted control, you got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE tests his hands, clenching and unclenching - THE KID WASN'T LYING ... while starting to trip hard on the VODKA, which is kicking in INSTANTLY...
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that's right. So please don't fuck up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE DIRT just a few feet away, BLINDING, DEAFENING - and KABLE shifts into ANOTHER WORLD...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's MOVING FAST... SOUND is just an idea, disconnected from reality... BODIES AND BULLETS drift by without gravity... his vision doubles and bleeds...
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter with you Kable? Kill something!
	</DIALOGUE>

BLUES. Lots of them. KABLE starts shooting wildly - HITTING NOTHING.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is unbelievable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE is running erratically at least... hard to HIT... but definitely HEADED SOMEWHERE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHELL SMACKS KABLE'S shoulder, knocking him off his feet; the armor absorbs it, but he's out of time... he's shooting air...
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (frustrated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
We see SIMON'S fingers glide, dial up the SWARMER...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE is still firing randomly as the turret shifts - the SWARMER goes STRAIGHT UP, then locks on BLUE and swerves down on them like HELL FROM THE SKY, turning skulls to swiss cheese.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Too close.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (cont'd) (the voice of reason)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kable. Listen: it's the last game. You're going to be dead and I'm going to look like a total asshole if you don't pull your balls together!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blow me.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
He scrambles to his feet and charges for the entrance to the UNDERGROUND GARAGE.

	Dammit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LEVEL - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE slams open a door marked P4 and stumbles into the CAR GRAVEYARD...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reality is ROARING, SPINNING... KABLE slams into the side of a parked car, legs rubber... he looks it over - TIRES FLAT, NO GOOD... he stumbles to the next, then another... another... his head hits a passenger side window, SPIDERWEBBING IT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FINALLY, the ONE: A FORD F-250 SUPER CHIEF... GUN METAL GREY, PRISTINE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Note: the F-250 is a CONCEPT TRUCK - a future design for FORD'S F-line. In our world this is a 2009 factory model, which makes it old, but not antique. The truck is about as BADASS as you could want, with dark, narrow windows, big ass wheels and a FRONT END that looks like it could PUNCH THROUGH A BUILDING OR TWO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE gets to the FUEL CAP DOOR and pries it open... ENGRAVED under the cap is a prominent WARNING:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethanol Only.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kable. Dude. What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE unscrews the cap and sticks his finger down his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dry heave. He does it again - this time puts his mouth on the hole and PUKES PURE LIQUID INTO THE TANK.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
He stops, doubled over, gasping for breath... then the feeling hits him again - and he heaves another fountain down the hole. A BLUE shows up in the opposite stairwell - KABLE brings his WEAPON up to hip level and BLOWS HIM AWAY WITHOUT LOOKING. His head is clearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE looks around, unzips his pants and PISSES INTO THE TANK. SIMON is slack-jawed, speechless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE shakes out his head; we can see in his eyes that he's regaining his senses; focusing in. He busts out the DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW, gets in; tears open the steering column - A BLUE SLAYER shows up in the mirror - fuck! - He CRANKS THE IGNITION... VRUUUUMM, KACHUNK, KACHUNK...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOOM! A 50mm SHATTERS the back window and punches a hole into the dashboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE checks what's left of the mirror. HACKMAN and six other BLUE SLAYERS are coming fast.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (cont'd)

	<DIALOGUE>
	GO, GO, GO!

	Yeah? Anything else ya fuckin cheerleader?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<DIRECTION>
VRUUUUUM, VRUUUM... KABLE hammers on the pedal again, knocking out the old ghosts - VRROOOOOOMM!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He SLAMS it into gear and PEELS OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HACKMAN leaps onto the side of the moving truck and points 50mm directly at the side of KABLE'S head. In a split instant KABLE grabs the nose of the weapon and points it up -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM! A close range shell blows through the roof of the truck. KABLE slams the brakes, spinning the truck, and launches HACKMAN into a row of parked cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HACKMAN gets in one last shot as KABLE punches it out of the garage, disintegrating a concrete column.
</DIRECTION>
<HACKMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuuuuck!!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HACKMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He slams his head into the windshield of a parked car, caving it in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4/F250 (DRIVING) - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE DRIFTS the F-250 onto the street, sideways, tires shrieking... wiping out two unlucky BLUES... pops it and TAKES OFF...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is headed STRAIGHT INTO THE RESTRICTED AREA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4/F250 (DRIVING)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FLY CAM is right there, taking the hot turn right on the truck's tail, giving SIMON the POV of a classic 3D DRIVING GAME. He activates DYNAMIC CAMERA CONTROL with a gesture - now he can manually choose his view... he pushes the CAMERA forward, next to the driver's window...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA looks to the side at KABLE, driving like he's on a mission to HELL. SIMON barks in his head.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITHOUT WARNING: a SNOWPLOW comes blasting out of nowhere going 80, trying to ram the driver's side... it's a tick late, clipping the back end instead, sending KABLE into a SPIN... KABLE is knocked around in the cab and PUKES all over the passenger seat. He recovers, straightens out and keeps going.

KABLE spots them in the REAR VIEW MIRROR.

He SLAMS HIS HEAD against the steering wheel to clear it - despite the purge he's still pretty FUCKED UP.

A LOW CONCRETE WALL surrounds the perimeter, and it's COMING UP FAST; beyond it: more abandoned urban wasteland.

<DIRECTION>
KABLE has got too much speed at this point to do anything but slam the thing SIDEWAYS into a SICK POWER SLIDE - the TRUCK hits the barrier and FLIPS OVER IT, CORKSCREWING four times before GRINDING TO A STOP on it's hood. The AIRBAGS DEPLOY, smashing KABLE into his seat...

The news broadcast continues, fed over video monitors that line the ceiling of the train. The passengers' eyes are glued to the screens...

KABLE is standing across the street from a BEAT DOWN BROWNSTONE, watching the second floor window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A funky OFF-ROAD MOTOCROSS BIKE buzzes by him and up onto the sidewalk, FARTING SMOKE. KABLE IGNORES the RIDER, who parks, gets off, loses the brain bucket and steps up to his side.

TRACE REVS up the bike - and as they pass the tunnel, she POPS IT. They're GONE.

INT. HUMANZ HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DARK, underground VIDEO ARCADE... low ceilings, concrete; OLD SCHOOL - sort of a graveyard of lost games... the classics of the 80s - MISSILE COMMAND, DEFENDER, ROBOTRON, CRANK, etc. The dimensions of the room are impossible to determine. A dozen or so PEOPLE - just BLACK SILHOUETTES in the CATHODE RAY GLOW - are scattered around, banging buttons, giving it body english, racking up scores.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACE leads KABLE through, toward the one BRIGHTLY LIT SPOT: at the center of the arcade, an AIR HOCKEY table is blasted with WHITE LIGHT from above. HUMANZ BROTHER, who we recognize from SIMON'S vid screen, and HUMANZ DUDE - mid 20s, long hair - are playing: CLACKCLACK, CLICK, CLACKCLUNK, CLACK...

They are so wrapped up in their game that they don't appear to notice KABLE.

The door clicks open and SEVERAL MEN enter. One SITS. We only see them from behind, not their faces; SIMON nods waddup.

INT. ANGIE'S BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGIE EXITS the ELEVATOR on the 3rd floor - a modern, minimalist building... RICK RAPE is with her, close behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They come to an apartment door; RICK RAPE pushes her, from behind, up against the door - VIOLENT... her right hand SLAPS a PALM IDENTIFICATION SENSOR alongside the door and it WHISPERS OPEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGIE snaps a heel; they stumble in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANGIE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGIE'S place is some kind of overdecorated, SCHITZOPHRENIC blend of GIRLIE/GEEKY/PORN. Shafts of NICOTINE SUNLIGHT filter through patterned curtains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She crawls along a plush WHITE FUR RUG... RICK RAPE follows... he licks his lips - an automatic gesture - and begins to UNBUTTON HIS PANTS. ANGIE, on her hands and knees, back to him, doesn't even bother to look, until...
</DIRECTION>
<RICK_RAPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Urkk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK_RAPE>
<DIRECTION>
She TURNS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE has RICK RAPE up in the air, holding him like a BARBELL - with one hand CRUSHING HIS THROAT, the other his BALLS. He brings him down over his knee, SNAPPING HIM like a BROKEN BAT - KKRRUNCH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGIE'S FACE is passive, neutral... but her EYES are NUCLEAR with EMOTION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE tosses RICK RAPE'S broken body into the bedroom... then falls to his knees in front of ANGIE and takes her face in his palms, gently - EYES LOCKED INTO HERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORGE is paralyzed.
</DIRECTION>
<GORGE_ANGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't kill me.

ANGIE says the words, but they don't match her eyes. KABLE just shakes his head, trying to grasp the situation.

<DIRECTION>
INT. ANGIE'S BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE pulls ANGIE out the door and down the hall, in tactical mode, WEAPON ready... he heads to the ELEVATOR, punches up a ride. No sign of trouble.
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>
<DIRECTION>
(quiet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to take you someplace where they can turn it off... the program...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<DIRECTION>
GORGE/ANGIE says NOTHING. The ELEVATOR DOOR whispers open -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HACKMAN is standing there with an ASSAULT SHOTGUN.
</DIRECTION>
<HACKMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(friendly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Kable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HACKMAN>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE TAKES IT IN THE CHEST; he's BLOWN OFF HIS FEET, through a wall and into an apartment opposite the ELEVATOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HACKMAN grabs ANGIE'S wrist, drags her onto the ELEVATOR and waits a BEAT, smiling pleasantly. The ELEVATOR DOOR CLOSES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE is ON HIS BACK in rubble. His chest is a BLACK, SMOKING HOLE... but as the smoke clears we see that his BODY ARMOR has ABSORBED THE BLAST. He's groggy, in excruciating pain, wind knocked out of him - but ALIVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO GUYS in GAS MASKS and RUBBER SUITS are watching him from the next room as he attempts to STRUGGLE TO HIS KNEES; KABLE has obviously interrupted something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HACKMAN and ANGIE are having a pleasant ride down, HACKMAN'S hands folded in front of him, patiently; the SHOTGUN - still smoking - shoulder strapped.
</DIRECTION>
<HACKMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to ANGIE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anybody in there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HACKMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The ELEVATOR stops and picks up TWO PASSENGERS: a GIGGLING, NECKING COUPLE. The doors CLOSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HACKMAN gives GORGE/ANGIE a wink and flashes a NINE INCH BOWIE KNIFE, carbon steel, nasty. ANGIE'S eyes go wide with TERROR. The COUPLE is oblivious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORGE can't hold back, the SICK FUCK; he squirms in his chair, sweating buckets, feeling himself up. And when he speaks, ANGIE echoes:
</DIRECTION>
<GORGE_ANGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on... do it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORGE_ANGIE>
<DIRECTION>
HACKMAN raises his eyebrows - he wasn't expecting that one... but he OBLIGES. A flex of his shoulder; the NECKING GIRL'S legs buckle under her and she goes down without a peep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GUY is confused - where'd she go? He looks to ANGIE. HACKMAN headlocks him from behind, and slowly - making eye contact with GORGE/ANGIE the entire time - SNAPS HIS NECK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGIE'S eyes stream tears; GORGE is in ECSTASY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HACKMAN lets the second body DROP, chuckling, as the ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE is waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANGIE'S BUILDING, LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE grabs HACKMAN with both hands, RIPS HIM OUT OF THE ELEVATOR and SLAMS HIM into a WALL. A BRUTAL HEAD-BUTT to the FACE, smashing bone... ANOTHER. HACKMAN'S FACE erupts with BLOOD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HACKMAN SWINGS BLIND with the BOWIE KNIFE, once, twice - the blade misses KABLE, backpedaling, by fractions of inches; displacing some SERIOUS AIR... HACKMAN lets it FLY. The BOWIE whistles past KABLE'S FACE and THUNKS into the wall behind him, four inches deep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HACKMAN smears the BLOOD from his eyes and brings up the SHOTGUN, but KABLE is quick - instead of trying to move away, HE STEPS IN, pushing the barrel STRAIGHT DOWN as HACKMAN FIRES. The BIG HIT puts a CRATER in the floor and takes out a set of HACKMAN'S toes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE kicks the SHOTGUN from HACKMAN'S hands and brings up his own WEAPON to close the deal...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... as the GLASS WALLS of the LOBBY EXPLODE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORE SLAYERS are MOVING IN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE releases a barrage of cover fire, grabs ANGIE and breaks for the BACK EXIT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SOCIETY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE and ANGIE hit WHITE HOT DAYLIGHT. A BLUE SLAYER breaks the corner of the building and KABLE FRAGS HIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE grabs ANGIE by the shoulders and yells directly at GORGE:
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU! WHERE THE HELL DO WE GO?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<DIRECTION>
CONTINUOUS SHOT: GORGE/ANGIE starts running across the street, leading the way;
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE takes out another BLUE at a distance, following close behind her. They run into a GENERIC, UNMARKED BUILDING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SOCIETY BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... the SHOT CONTINUES, across the LOBBY, through an anonymous grey door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRS/PINK CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and down a FLIGHT OF STAIRS... MUFFLED MUSIC is THUMPING, getting LOUDER... down a PINK CORRIDOR and into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND RAVE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... a 24 HOUR UNDERGROUND RAVE, in full effect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This thing is FUCKING HUGE... in the DARK it's impossible to tell just how big... hundreds of writhing SOCIETY DUDES, CHICKS and OTHER... DAY-GLO, moving spotlights, strobes... the BUBBLE GIRLS from CRANK make an appearance... along with the DISCOVERY CHANNEL SKATERS from the PARK, now in GOTHED-UP GEAR...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE gathers it all... he takes ANGIE'S arm and begins to wade through the CHAOS... the BLOOD SPATTERS on his face POP in sharp, inverse DAY-GLO, like HARTIGAN'S SCAR in SIN CITY...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SKATER GIRL takes a hold of the glowing, smoking barrel of KABLE'S WEAPON and starts to SKATE CIRCLES around him, ring- around-the-rosie... he wrenches it hard, sending her flying into a crowd that goes down like BOWLING PINS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They continue MOVING... KABLE happens to notice RED LASERS moving through the DARK... probing... RAVE LIGHTS? No...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THOOM. THOOM THOOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIGHTNING FLASHES, EXPLOSIONS... a RAVER nearby disintegrates, BLOOD and GUTS a DAY GLO VOLCANO. DANCERS slip and FALL ON THEIR ASSES in the viscera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SLAYERS are moving thru the RAVE, hunting. Everyone but KABLE and ANGIE are so out of it they don't even notice.
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>
<DIRECTION>
(to GORGE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You. Run.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGIE runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE goes COMMANDO, evading the HUNTERS, ducking under EXPLODING SHIT... he moves to FLANK them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the DJ is DECAPITATED by a stray 50 caliber round but the GROOVE DON'T STOP...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIGHTNING STRIKES FREEZE the ACTION as KABLE engages the BLUES, one by one... he takes out THREE of them with CLOSE RANGE BLASTS and another HAND-TO-HAND-TO-HEADSNAP - then notices more BLUES moving in... too many...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He catches up to ANGIE and they make for an EXIT, any EXIT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RAVE - LOUNGE AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They find CURTAINS, run past freaky CHILL LOUNGES and SMOKE OUT ROOMS... KABLE blows a hole in a locked maintenance door and they duck out of RAVE WORLD into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RAVE - INDUSTRIAL CONCRETE CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...an industrial CONCRETE CORRIDOR... MUFFLED BLASTS, SCREAMING in the REAR SURROUNDS tell KABLE the BLUES are close behind... up more stairs, they SLAM through a SERVICE DOOR and back into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SOCIETY - DAY, CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>

A SCOOBY DOO-looking VAN pulls up to the CURB in front of them; the back doors SWING OPEN.

Not much choice. KABLE and ANGIE climb in. The ELECTRIC VAN drives quietly away, attracting no attention.
</DIRECTION>

INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

KABLE slumps against the wall of the VAN, cradling ANGIE in his arms - exhausted. ANGIE'S eyes are POST-TRAUMATIC, searching.

A BEAT. SCOTCH is suddenly conscious of the SURVEILLANCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE'S eyes flicker away from SCOTCH'S. He calmly removes his military issue .45 from it's holster and lets it rest on the table between them. He stares at it intensely, emotion starting to seep through the icy lines of his face.

<DIRECTION>
KABLE starts to shake; the gun rattles on the table top. A bead of sweat creeps down his forehead. It's apparent that he is locked in a paralyzing internal struggle...

A low hum in the room starts to swell and throb, numbing, disorienting...

KABLE is slumped against concrete, on his knees... RELIVING THE MURDER has knocked the hell out of him, but he's DEALING WITH IT.

A pair of SKINNY LEGS walk up and kneel next to him: ANGIE.

He touches her face, looks deep into her EYES - they are wet with emotion.

JUST THEN: matching BLACK SUVs pull up to the curb just TEN FEET from where she stands.

<DIRECTION>
CASTLE'S GEEK SQUAD piles out... GINA sees them, recognizes them from the interview with CASTLE; she TURNS AWAY just in time to avoid being recognized by a GEEK as he scans the crowd.

But they're not after her... they head straight for the ALLEY.

INT. CELL - TIME INDETERMINATE

BLACK. A door opens, a switch is thrown... and SIMON is blinded by harsh fluorescent light. He sits up on a cot, wearing a white T-shirt and pajama pants; fucked up hair, groggy. He BELCHES.

INT. SIMON'S ROOM - TIME INDETERMINATE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIMON slides open the door to his room, peaks inside hesitantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's TRASHED. The FLOOR is littered with busted up electronics and garbage. The wall-sized screens are all running the same thing - a SINGLE WORD, repeated in columns, by the thousands - scrolling fast, a digital waterfall of words, white on black:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHEATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIMON sits down in the middle of the detritus, in a state of mild SHOCK - he's LOST EVERYTHING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gestures at the screen and closes out the SCROLLING LOOP... then once again, attempting to activate SLAYERS control; the screen shows the same nebulous TEST PATTERN we last saw on GORGE'S screen.

EXT. CASTLE ESTATE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CASTLE'S ESTATE is like a DESERTED CITY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Balconies, underlit DOMES, lush landscaping, abstract statues, waterfalls... tiny cameras everywhere... and not a soul in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE drops over a wall and onto grass. Wind in the leaves, cricket music - otherwise DEAD SILENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He keeps to the trees, making his way toward the central MANSION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEN: the sound of DOGS... they come in a PACK, loping across the lawn - grey, more like WOLVES...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE readies his gun to take them out - but the DOGS run RIGHT PAST HIM. They round a corner and DISAPPEAR. Weird.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE looks up, spots a CAMERA... and another, and another... stands to reason he's been MARKED already.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks out INTO THE OPEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE'S MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GIANT FRONT DOORS of the MANSION are OPEN. KABLE walks right in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The interior is HUGE... and EMPTY. NO FURNITURE, no art; no people of course. Could anyone possibly live here?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He explores...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE'S MANSION - EMPTY HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND THEN - at the FAR END of a large, empty HALL:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LITTLE GIRL, 5 - is sitting on the floor by herself, playing with DOLLS, making them walk and talk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE'S eyes go wide. He starts to walk toward her, slowly at first...
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Delia...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<DIRECTION>
... and finally breaking into a run - until:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He SLAMS into what seems to be an INVISIBLE WALL, crumpling to the ground. The GIRL doesn't react. KABLE pounds on the glass...

<KABLE>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>

KABLE wants to EXPLODE - but he contains himself. He's playing CASTLE'S GAME, and the RULES are still UNDEFINED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then - MUSIC: The SOUND of a SWINGIN' HI-HAT from down a long corridor -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
t - t - tssss, t - t - tssss, t - t - tsss...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE walks toward the source; a bass and piano pick up the groove.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE'S MANSION, BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes to a BALLROOM - empty, like everything else; shiny hardwood floor for DANCING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SPOTLIGHT pops on from above, illuminating KEN CASTLE. He's wearing a T-SHIRT and JEANS. Every instinct tells KABLE to go after him - but he holds back. Who knows if it's even real? And then CASTLE starts to SING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... or more precisely, LIP SYNC - the VOICE is SINATRA, I've Got You Under My Skin... CASTLE is doing a spot-on KARAOKE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I've got you under my skin
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I've got you deep in the heart of me So deep in my heart, that you're really a part of me I've got you under my skin...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's snapping his fingers, putting on the moves... THEN - from behind curtains - a half dozen SLAYERS appear. We RECOGNIZE THE SCARRED, BATTLE-TOUGH FACES from the prison, the game, the pursuit... only instead of BLUE, they are wearing TUXEDOES with BLUE BOW-TIES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE grips his weapon, but the men are UNARMED; instead, they fall in on the beat and go into a CHOREOGRAPHED DANCE behind CASTLE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I'd sacrifice anything come what might For the sake of having you near In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night And repeats, and repeats in my ear...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE notices SHADOWY FIGURES around the perimeter of the room... glasses, beards, pony tails - silently, the GEEK SQUAD has moved in and taken position. They move their hands in rhythm, synchronized... each one seems to control a DANCER: they TWIRL A FINGER and the SLAYER SPINS... kick with TWO FINGERS FOR LEGS and the SLAYER KICKS like a ROCKETTE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, ON A MUSICAL HIT, everyone - CASTLE, the GEEKS, the SLAYERS - points dramatically up at the wall, where a VIDEO SCREEN BEGINS TO PLAY: it is footage of the GEEK SQUAD busting into humanz headquarters and EFFICIENTLY KILLING EVERYONE. ANGIE is tasered unconscious and dragged away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Don't you know, little fool, you never can win? Use your mentality, wake up to reality... But each time I do just the thought of you makes me STOP - before I give in Cause I've got you, under my skin...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE hits his breaking point. He brings up his WEAPON to open up on the SLAYERS... CLICK. It's DEAD. The GEEKS have taken care of that.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE tosses it aside and sprints for CASTLE, but the SLAYERS break off from the choreography to ENGAGE HIM; turns out they're flesh and blood after all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CASTLE backs away, whistling the melody, and continues his SOFTSHOE to the music as KABLE wades into brutal hand-to-hand combat... breaking necks, snapping arms, smashing faces... it's a full-on BALLET OF DEATH... finally, THE MUSIC ENDS, right on cue: KABLE is finishing off the last of the men, blood on his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CASTLE applauds; the GEEKS follow suit.
</DIRECTION>

INT. CASTLE'S MANSION, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Tracking along the hallway, MEDIUM CLOSE, profile:

CASTLE walks along, confidently, KABLE following. The background is a black, glittering STARSCAPE.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got to thank you for leading me to them, by the by - the human- zuzz that is...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
Snap out WIDE: the hallway seems to run along the SURFACE OF THE MOON - another 3-D projection, no doubt. CRATERS and LUNAR DEBRIS stretch to the horizon. The GEEK SQUAD walks along behind CASTLE and KABLE at a distance... they are all tiny MOON ANTS in the vast lunar panorama... the PLANET EARTH rising majestically in the dark heavens.

INT. CASTLE'S COURT - CONTINUOUS

<DIRECTION>
They leave the hallway and step on to an indoor, NBA regulation BASKETBALL COURT; electronic scoreboard, bleachers, the whole nine. It's dark, moody - only one bank of OVERHEAD FLOODS is turned on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the FAR END of the COURT, HACKMAN is in WARM-UPS, shooting baskets. ONE leg - the one with the ABBREVIATED TOES - is in a FLEX BRACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GEEK SQUAD grabs seats in the BLEACHERS.

	Very nice, Castle. So you've got an army of psychotics and deviants to dance around for you.

CASTLE narrows his eyes, amusement edging out irritation; he walks over to a bin of GRIP POWDER.

	You're thinking small, Kable. But not as small as me.

KEN CASTLE(cont'd)

	<DIALOGUE>
	For instance.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE hears HACKMAN at the last second, spins and ABSORBS THE TACKLE. The men GO TO THE GROUND, grappling, UFC-style. KABLE has HACKMAN'S KNIFE HAND by the wrist, stopping it - but leaving his face UNPROTECTED...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HACKMAN brings his free ELBOW down on KABLE'S face, connecting and opening a CUT under his eye; then AGAIN - this time KABLE catches the elbow with his own free hand and WRENCHES IT IN SIDEWAYS, dislocating HACKMAN'S shoulder with a sickening POP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE works around HACKMAN, gets him in a HEADLOCK and SQUEEZES... still gripping the knife hand, immobilizing it... HACKMAN is choking, BEAT RED... for long, brutal seconds the life drains out of him... finally, HACKMAN'S eyes roll back; he GOES LIMP. KABLE takes the BOWIE KNIFE from HACKMAN'S dead fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He struggles to his feet, dripping sweat and blood.

	<DIALOGUE>

KABLE comes at CASTLE FAST, bringing the KNIFE around to open his throat like a PEZ DISPENSER...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His arm FREEZES IN MID AIR, the BLADE inches from contact.

<KEN_CASTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neglected to mention: my smart boys reversed that hack those fellas worked for you - easy breezy, once we had access to their drives...

INT. SIMON'S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIMON is sitting on the floor, head hung low, in front of the dead wall... a glitch, a flicker... the screen comes to life:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's KABLE'S POV of KEN CASTLE. CASTLE is stripping off his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
(on SCREEN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, lets boogie woogie rock and roll.
	</DIALOGUE>

<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ummm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE'S COURT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CASTLE throws a funky KARATE KICK and nails KABLE in the jaw... then a haymaker to the GUT, doubling KABLE over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lets KABLE swing the KNIFE just short of his face as he backs away.
</DIRECTION>
<KEN_CASTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Biggest, baddest Slayer in the game... don't seem like much, does he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
CASTLE is enjoying the hell out of himself. He uppercuts KABLE, snapping his head back... then shakes out his knuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oww!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE swings his OPEN HAND around - CASTLE choreographs it perfectly: KABLE'S nails rake across CASTLE'S STOMACH, MARKING HIM UP like BRUCE LEE in Enter The Dragon. CASTLE strikes a pose to match.
</DIRECTION>
<KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucky shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(grins)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, not really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
He brings a passable REVERSE CRESCENT KICK that drops KABLE to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need an audience, boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
A DOOR OPENS at the far end of the court; KABLE looks up slowly, afraid of what he knows he'll see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGIE and DELIA are led into the room. ANGIE presses herself close to DELIA, holding her shoulders protectively.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She keeps her distance from the GEEK SQUAD escorts and tries to block DELIA from them - there is raw fear and anger in her eyes; the GEEK SQUAD are not overtly violent or menacing, but ANGIE seems acutely aware that they are lethal. DELIA seems oddly neutral and unaffected by the entire situation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CASTLE kicks KABLE across the floor, toward them.
</DIRECTION>
<KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, you crawl on your belly like a toad...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he looks to the GEEK SQUAD, sheepish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this bad? I'm really bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
He gives KABLE a last kick; KABLE collapses in front of his DAUGHTER... she looks down at him, curiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up at DELIA, eyes soaked with emotion... then to ANGIE. They share a moment of intense eye contact - we feel that ANGIE wants desperately to go to him but is unsure of what is the best action to take strategically; she is looking to KABLE for a clue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE'S eyes go back to DELIA; he tries to reach up and gently touch her face...
</DIRECTION>
<KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's sweet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
CASTLE steps on KABLE'S hand, pinning it to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright boys, you ready? A true test.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
He steels his eyes on KABLE and concentrates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE slowly brings up the KNIFE toward DELIA'S THROAT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGIE moves to pull DELIA away - CASTLE merely glances up at her and she FREEZES, paralyzed. We can see her body strain against invisible control, raw panic in her eyes...
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>
<DIRECTION>
(desperate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<KEN_CASTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like last time. Remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE is FIGHTING IT with all his will, his whole body shaking...
</DIRECTION>
<KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're stronger now... a little more fight in you... but I think the end result will be about the same...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN_CASTLE>
<KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
The GEEKS look on, impassive. The BLADE is inches away... He looks into ANGIE'S eyes - she and KABLE are like one; he seems to draw strength from her... finally, KABLE WILLS EVERYTHING HE HAS and STABS THE KNIFE INTO THE FLOORBOARDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE's head SNAPS around, his eyes confused... and in one quick, smooth movement, KABLE YANKS THE KNIFE out of the floor, RISES TO HIS FEET AND SPINS ON CASTLE. He claps a hand around CASTLE'S neck and tries to jam the knife up into his GUT - but CASTLE is able to FREEZE HIM just short...
</DIRECTION>
<KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (freaked)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
The GEEKS break out tiny devices and start quickly scanning. Not even KABLE understands this.
</DIRECTION>
<PONYTAIL_GEEK>

<DIRECTION>
INT. SIMON'S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIMON is on his feet, in full BADASS GAMER MODE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His body is positioned exactly like KABLE'S - right hand gripping the virtual blade for an underhand thrust; left hand clutching CASTLE'S THROAT... he FORCES HIS RIGHT HAND FORWARD...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE'S COURT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... KABLE'S KNIFE HAND begins to inch forward. Now CASTLE is the one struggling for control; he claws weakly at KABLE'S hand, trying to loosen it off his neck...
</DIRECTION>
<KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
(panicking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	JAM THE SIGNAL YOU GOD DAMN RETARDS!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN_CASTLE>
<GEEK>
<DIRECTION>
(irritated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Working on it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEEK>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE'S eyes are locked in on CASTLE'S... straining with everything he has... his strength and will overpowering CASTLE, but-
</DIRECTION>
<KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
(like he's explaining the obvious to a child)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE, succumbing to CASTLE'S control, begins to move the knife away from CASTLE'S belly.
</DIRECTION>
<KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You... fucking... do it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN_CASTLE>
<DIRECTION>
CASTLE delivers a CRUNCHING HEADBUTT to his NOSE, KABLE loses his footing, sweat pouring down his face, bloody, drained... CASTLE pushes the KNIFE back towards KABLE. He fights back - every muscle in his arm fighting against another like Yin & Yang, veins rising in his neck...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then KABLE senses an opportunity:
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at this knife... imagine me sticking it into your gut... think about it... make it real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<DIRECTION>
CASTLE laughs... BUT HIS EYES FLICKER TO THE KNIFE - of course he can't help but picture it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and in that instant KABLE JAMS IN THE BLADE...
</DIRECTION>
<GEEK_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
(blank)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oops.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEEK_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
... CASTLE focuses, trying to pull it back out, but KABLE shoves it in deeper - CASTLE'S EYES BULGE. Finally KABLE TWISTS the KNIFE and lifts CASTLE OFF THE GROUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The paralysis breaks from ANGIE - she lunges forward to throw her arms around her daughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SIMON'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
(triumphant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
He drops down into the badass, ROCKSTAR pose...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE'S COURT - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and KABLE does the same.
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it, kid...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<DIRECTION>
CASTLE collapses to his knees in front of KABLE, glass-eyed, draining life... they are FACE to FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... is the fuckin pose really necessary?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<DIRECTION>
CASTLE face-plants on the COURT.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE'S body relaxes; he tosses the knife across the floor... then turns to face his family.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When DELIA finally speaks there is a trace of CASTLE'S Georgia peach accent.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you my Daddy Tillman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
He gathers DELIA in his arms and lifts her off her feet, squeezing her close; she SQUEEZES BACK. KABLE grabs ANGIE with his other arm and pulls her in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GEEKS look at one another - realize that their employment contract with CASTLE has just been terminated... shrug; pocket their shit, zip up their backpacks and fanny packs, get up and start to file out.
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<DIRECTION>
GEEK LEADER stops.

GEEK LEADER shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<GEEK_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True dat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEEK_LEADER>

He nods to PONYTAIL GEEK: do it.

<DIRECTION>
The GEEK LEADER betrays a ghost of a smile.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well played, Kable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEEK_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE doesn't answer; but his eyes say: how was any of this a fucking game?
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mommy. Why did Daddy Tillman hurt Daddy Ken?

INT. BATHROOM - TIME INDETERMINATE

A VIDEO PLAYER WINDOW POPS UP:

It's TRACE, filming herself.
</DIRECTION>
<TRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is for you, you dumb bitch. I hope you do the right thing with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRACE>
<DIRECTION>
The IMAGE switches to the CAPTURED FOOTAGE of KABLE in the military facility... leading up to SCOTCH'S murder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light from the screen reflects on GINA PARKER SMITH'S face - she's wide-eyed, stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<GINA_PARKER_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, baby...

</GINA_PARKER_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.

INT. KABLE'S CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOOTING STARS fly past us in the dark... the SAME IMAGE WE STARTED WITH... only instead of an underground train carrying SOLDIERS to battle...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TUNNEL ENDS; we break from the side of a mountain into BLUE SKY AND SUNLIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE is driving on the open highway... ANGIE is in the passenger seat, asleep, head pressed up against the window glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE checks the rear view window; makes eye contact with DELIA, who is suspended in a lightweight car seat in the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<KABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You good, sweetheart?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KABLE>
<DIRECTION>
DELIA nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLE allows himself a smile, puts his eyes back on the road. ANGIE slowly reaches for KABLE'S hand, she rubs her thumb on his tattoo - "I am right here with you" - and falls back asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA tilts up, stares out the front window and moves into the giant sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
