OPENING TITLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"ALTHOUGH THIS MOTION PICTURE IS INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY, CERTAIN CHARACTERS AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPER: 'SEPTEMBER 1973'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A phone rings in the dark. A little light falls from the open window, illuminating an old bakelite telephone. It sits on a small table alongside a large amount of empty bottles and a couple of overflowing ashtrays. EXT. PHIL'S TRIKE. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A three wheeled motorcycle is being driven through the night at great speed. The trike is moving very quickly, its headlights cutting through the darkness, its wheels sending a spray of sand flying towards us, as the driver fights to keep it on the road. This is PHIL KAUFMAN, and he's in a hurry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two figures are struggling on the floor. The male is naked. The woman sits astride him, her movements urgent, her breath fast. They appear to be having sex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRIKE. DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Trike cuts through the night, and we pull back to show desert, more desert, and then... a giant bright, flickering neon sign: 'Welcome to the Joshua Tree Inn'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That phone - still ringing; shrill, insistent. There is a bed next to the table. It is covered in clothes, but there is also a man's shape, which now moves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A little more light, and it now appears as if our man and woman are struggling. There is fear on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still that insistent ringing, and the covers suddenly fly off the bed. We see the man from behind as he shakes the sleep away and looks for the damn phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman is screaming now, and banging on the man's chest with her fists. He is motionless underneath her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTSIDE JOSHUA TREE INN. DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Trike skids to a halt amid a cloud of dust and the driver leaps off. He runs at the door, throwing it open in one movement, disappearing into the room. A broken striped 'No Entry - Police' band flutters to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man finally answers the phone. At last the ringing stops.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTSIDE JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door bounces back open, and we can see the Phil walking quickly through the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he searches, we hear:
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God please help me! I found your number in his pocket and I don't know... I don't know what to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<PHIL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, what... who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's dead... he's dead... and I'm... just... I don't know what to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The man glances into the bathroom and opens some drawers.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on. Tell me who's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL_S_VOICE>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Parsons. Gram Parsons. We met in a bar and we had a lot to drink and he just...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<PHIL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure he's dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks under the beds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CONTINUE D:
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. He's really dead. He just...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<PHIL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen. Call an ambulance. Where are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL_S_VOICE>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joshua Tree. Joshua Tree Inn. Room eight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
He checks on top of the wardrobe.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you got a car?
	</DIALOGUE>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL_S_VOICE>
<PHIL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call an ambulance. Then get out of there. Okay? Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL_S_VOICE>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, okay. I'm goin'...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up a sheet of paper from the bedside table and glances at it. He turns and walks past us to the car and for the first time we see Phil Kaufman's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOSHUA TREE HOSPITAL. MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Trike skids to a halt outside the small white hospital. There are a couple of press vehicles parked outside, and a reporter is recording a piece to camera in the background. Phil sits for a moment, and then opens the door and walks to the entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOSHUA TREE HOSPITAL. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move through the reception area up to the nurses' station. Phil is in conversation with a large woman in a nurse's uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna run that by me again, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. I'd like to see Gram Parsons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
They stare at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to see Gram Parsons?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Alone, if possible. And would you have a gurney standing by in case I need to move him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
She looks carefully at the pyjamas which peek out from under the shabby overcoat. His hair is on end. He is wearing biker boots and is holding an unlit but half-smoked cigar.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you are.... his physician? Or perhaps a close relative?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Phil clears his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I'm his road manager.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
The big nurse smiles mirthlessly.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're not his physician or a close relative?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister Parsons is awaiting a post mortem. He will then be delivered to his family. I suggest you speak to them if you wish to pick through his personal effects. Sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now listen here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you listen here. Mister Parsons is dead and no longer appears to need a road manager. Which makes two of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
The nurse turns and marches down the corridor. Phil waits until she's gone and then walks through a door marked 'Admittance only to Authorized Hospital Staff'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL LOCKER ROOM. MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phil slips off his overcoat and stuffs it into the trash. He tosses away the unlit cigar, grabs a white coat from a hook and puts it on. He walks out through another door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phil wanders down the corridor, glancing into rooms and checking signs. He pushes open a door marked 'Pathology'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL PATHOLOGY LAB. MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is empty, except for a couple of covered bodies on trolleys. Phil checks under the first sheet, and recoils at whatever it is which lies beneath.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheesh!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over to the next gurney and lifts the sheet. He stares down at the body, visibly moved.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello buddy. How you been?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
He stands for a moment, gripping the gurney and looking down at his friend. Then he snaps out of it.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I can't stand around here chatting with you all day. Things to do...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
He wheels the gurney towards the door. INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phil wheels the gurney down the corridor towards the exit. A doctor in green scrubs approaches and glances down at a clipboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naw, I'm cool thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
The doctor reads the tag on the body's toe.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just taking some stiff down to neurology.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't have a neurology department.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Urology.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
The doctor grabs the end of the gurney. Phil tugs and the doctor tugs back. After a moment, Phil sighs and shakes his head in frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Just hold your horses - I'll go check the paperwork.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
The doctor holds up his clipboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have the paperwork.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You have your paperwork. I need to go check my paperwork.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
He slips through the exit. The doctor waits awkwardly for a few seconds, and then pushes open the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Hello...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He glances around in surprise, but there is no-one in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT. MORNING Phil's trike accelerates as it approaches a T junction. To the right the sign points to 'Joshua Tree Town', to the left 'Los Angeles'. The trike doesn't even slow as it skids left, sending a spray of sand and gravel flying across the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NB. There will be several shots of Phil driving through the desert, set to music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PHIL'S STREET. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Trike pulls up outside a rambling old house. Two enormous plaster eagles flank the front door, a giant Harley Davidson sign hangs from the roof, and there's a six foot flashing neon star in the front window. Phil gets out, walks up to the door and pulls some keys out of his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phil walks into the room and pours himself a drink. He slumps onto the couch, takes a sip and closes his eyes. We see movement behind him, as an attractive girl slips through a door and approaches Phil from behind. This is SUSIE, and she puts her hands over his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin Luther King.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try again...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Susie leans over the back of the chair and gives Phil a long slow kiss. She jumps over the couch and resumes kissing, this time more passionately. Phil tries to pull away with little success.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This.... ...isn't.... ...the best time... ...Baby....
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
Susie continues regardless, Phil is now finding it hard to resist. He eventually gives in, and they begin to kiss passionately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHIL'S KITCHEN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phil and Susie are sitting at the kitchen table. He takes a drag from her cigarette and passes it back.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God damn! I'm so sorry, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, out of a job again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would never have happened if you were there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know I wasn't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you were, you wouldn't have let him die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was still 'on staff'. He was still my responsibility.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
They sit quietly for a moment. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So where have you been, anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
She sighs, and stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long this time? Two weeks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, let's have this conversation again. Like you haven't just done six weeks on the road...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but I usually leave a note. And there's a paycheck involved.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Susie disappears through the door. Phil's shoulders sag and he slumps against the wall. Then Susie reappears with a bottle of Jack Daniels and a couple of glasses. She pours out two generous measures and hands one to Phil.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, he gets up and follows her out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susie guides Phil to a chair and sits him down.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a remembrance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
She crosses to a record player and turns it on, pausing to let down the blind on the way back. 'In My Hour of Darkness'(or similar music) fills the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF SHOTS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A) PHIL TAKES A DRINK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B) GIRL IN TEARS TO CAM OUTSIDE THE JOSHUA TREE MOTEL:
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(Earnestly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was so beautiful, and he understood what my heart was feeling. I'll...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(MOR E)
</DIRECTION>
<GIR_L>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	never laugh again. My inner joy has gone. It evaporated when Gram departed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIR_L>
<DIRECTION>
C) MUSIC 'EXPERT' ON CHAT SHOW
</DIRECTION>
<EXPERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He sang country music in a way that it had never been sung before. It was 'country rock', if you like. And it was kinda catchy. At least, the young people seemed to lap it up. It's fair to say that when Gram Parsons died, he died a star.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXPERT>
<DIRECTION>
D) PHIL TAKES ANOTHER DRINK. HE MAY BE CRYING. E) HIPPIE TO CAM FROM A STREET IN LA:
</DIRECTION>
<HIPPIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's like... I can't... It was real, kinda... I... Oh, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HIPPIE>
<DIRECTION>
F) PHIL SLEEPS, AND THE GLASS SLIPS FROM HIS HAND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
G) REPORTER TO CAM FROM OUTSIDE JOSHUA TREE HOSPITAL:
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And another light burns out in the desert. Gram Parsons - the standard bearer of the new country music movement - is dead, following an overdose of drugs. While many of America's young people are today in mourning, their parents will view this as another example of how today's drug culture can so easily claim a life. We'll leave you tonight with the young man's own words. Gram Parsons wrote a song called 'In My Hour of Darkness', which contains these words: 'In my hour of darkness...'
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
We are back in Phil's sitting room. Fade up on the music, to match the reporter's words, as Gram's voice fills the room: (or similar music).
</DIRECTION>
<GRAM_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my hour of darkness, in my time of need, Oh Lord grant me vision, Oh Lord grant me speed. Oh Lord grant me vision, Oh Lord grant me speed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAM_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Susie tenderly throws a blanket over the sleeping Phil as the record ends. She turns the light off and the room goes dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susie walks in with a coffee. She sits beside Phil and strokes his head until he wakes. She kisses him and passes him the cup.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He sits up and stretches. She leans over to kiss him, then stands and starts to tidy. He watches her. She picks up some clothing from near his chair and moves away. He drops another piece of clothing on the same spot. She says nothing and picks it up. He takes a sock off and drops it. It has stopped being a game and started being a statement. She picks the sock up and drops it in his lap. He pushes it back onto the floor. She opens her arms and everything falls to the floor. She walks out of the room and into the kitchen. He follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHIL'S KITCHEN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susie leans on the table, staring out of the window. Phil walks up behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you're here, I spend my time wondering when you're going. And when you're back, I wonder where you've been.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and walks round to face him.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Phil, you give me laughs and a great time. But I'm not sure if that's enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean there's more than that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, there's more than that! There's dependable, responsible, reliable...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's dull, boring, normal. You should hook up with someone who works in a bank. I know a guy, actually. He has fish for dinner every Friday, cleans his shoes twice a week and buys his ties in bulk because it works out cheaper that way. I'll put you in touch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mind loving a crazy bastard, Phil. But you've got to be for something and not just against everything. You have to choose something to represent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I represent the combined forces of charm, enchantment and exuberance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your job is to arrange other people's lives. Maybe it's time to put a little thought into your own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Susie walks out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A suburban street of small, neat bungalows. We move down the street, past house and identical house, until we rest outside another that is identical to the rest. The front door opens, and a nondescript man emerges, carrying a small overnight bag. He carefully locks the door and walks down the path to where a cab waits. We can clearly see 'New Orleans Taxi' marked on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Airport, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
This is STANLEY PARSONS, Gram's father.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a loud banging on the front door. Phil glances out of the window, and looks momentarily puzzled. He opens the door, and a beautiful woman stands on the step.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Long time, no see, Barbara.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't try and schmooze me, Kaufman, you repellent slimeball.

She notices Susie standing behind Phil.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The latest victim?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara walks past them into the kitchen. Susie looks quizzically at Phil.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Meet Barbara.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara calls out from the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a lot tidier than I remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Susie raises an eyebrow at Phil.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the hell is she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gram's ex-girlfriend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>

Phil points at his temple as if to say she's nuts.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Girlfriend? Isn't he married?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara walks back into the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to the seventies.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want, Barbara?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara lights a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here to fulfill Gram's wishes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
She waits for him to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's nice. I have no idea what you're talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
She holds up an old piece of writing paper.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know what this is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Phil reaches for it, but Barbara snatches it away.

<BARBARA>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>

Phil looks surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he write that with joined up writing or was it before he knew how?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara gives a wry smile.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still the jester Kaufman, and still very unfunny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not a will Barbara, and you know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's better than a will, actually. It's a signed promise from Gram to leave me all his assets and belongings. And anyway, it's really none of your business what this is. I've come for the guitar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
Phil shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guitar?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Gram's guitar. He always kept it here.

	I don't believe you, Kaufman.

Barbara pushes past Phil who gives no resistance. She walks straight over to the couch and starts pulling up the cushions. Susie moves to stop her, but Phil holds her back and lets Barbara carry on.

INT. PHIL'S LOUNGE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phil and Susie sit on the sofa, an island of calm in a sea of chaos. Around them, the floor is covered with papers, clothing, empty record covers, torn open cushions and books. A broken drawer is propped against the table. A lampshade hangs crazily from its bearings, throwing strange shadows around the room. Suddenly, Susie gets up and kicks a cushion across the room.

Without a word, Susie gets up and walks into the house. Phil lies still. After a moment, she reappears with her bag. She flounces theatrically past him and opens the car door. Phil gets out of the back.

<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what this madness is, but I'm not getting involved.

INT. LARRY OSTERBERG'S HOME. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man is sitting cross-legged on the floor. A joss stick burns beside him, and sitar music plays in the background. This is LARRY OSTERBERG, and he is meditating. There is a loud hammering on the door. Larry shows no sign of having heard anything. More hammering at the door, but still no response. Then the letter box creaks open and an eye appears in the slot. After a moment, the eye disappears and Phil's face appears momentarily at the window. The window seems to be slightly higher than Phil, so his face appears every time he jumps up to peer into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Anyone there?
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	There you are. I'm looking for Larry Osterberg.

</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The door is unlocked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Phil barrels in and closes the door behind him. He turns to take a look around the room.

	</DIALOGUE>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Welcome to my house.

<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Well, okay. Is it two hundred dollars worth of surprise?

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's more of a fifty dollar surprise.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTSIDE LARRY OSTERBERG'S GARAGE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The garage doors swing open and a hearse drives out into the sun. It is bright yellow and covered in painted flowers. One of the side windows is broken and a headlight hangs out. Phil's jaw drops open. Larry gets out of the driving seat and pats the roof, proudly.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>

	Bernice is a Cadillac Superior Royale Tiara Limousine Funeral Coach. We've got a Seven gallon V8 engine offering three hundred and forty bhp at four thousand six hundred revolutions per minute.

Bernice weighs over six thousand pounds.

</LARRY>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That might be my point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how is a yellow hearse covered with flowers less of a surprise than a black hearse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I paid you two hundred dollars for a black hearse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(patiently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you paid me a hundred and eighty dollars for a hearse, and a hearse is what you've got. If you take a long, hard look at Bernice, you'll see that she's one of a kind. She's big, she's fast, she's comfortable, and she's beautiful. But she's not black.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
They stare at each other for a moment. Then Phil sighs deeply.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Well, let's boogie.

Larry pulls a screwdriver out of the glove compartment and jigs it about in the ignition until the engine catches.

Then he turns the keys and pull up and down to undo the steering lock. Phil watches curiously.

<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wait till morning. I'm going home.

A door swings open, and Barbara appears. She is looking quite stunning, with a tight black suit doing equal justice to her womanly curves and her duties as a mourner. She strides down the sidewalk, and as a group of schoolchildren appears around the corner Barbara scatters left and right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she cuts across the road, and a delivery van skids to a halt inches away, horn blaring. The driver leans out of the window, furious.

INT. PLANE - LAX. MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley takes a swig from a hip flask and looks out of the window. A very overweight, red-faced man squeezes into the next seat. He bangs Stanley with his knee as he sits, but Stanley doesn't move. He peers at Stanley and shuffles in his seat, but there is still no reaction. Next, a deep sigh is forced out between his fat wet lips - he is plainly keen to start a conversation. Stanley keeps looking out of the window. He is watching the cargo being loaded.
</DIRECTION>
<P_J_GAMBRELL>

	Well, you'd better tell them that we've got rules.

Phil is wheeling a casket on a gurney down the middle of the hangar. He can see Larry peering through the window at him. He can also see a uniformed policeman approaching Larry from the other side of the street. As he speeds up to try and reach Larry first, the clerk calls out from his desk.
</DIRECTION>

We are with a short-order cook. He expertly flips a burger from a hotplate and adds it to a plate overflowing with bacon, sausage and fries. He slips this plate onto a tray on which there is a second plate containing two pieces of plain bread and some lettuce. He dings a bell and a waiter enters and picks up the tray. We move with the tray as he carries it from the kitchen and into the dining area. He stops at the bar to load three foaming glasses of beer and a glass of water onto the tray, and delivers it to Phil and Larry, who are sitting in a window booth. Larry has his head resting on the table. He lifts it as soon as the food arrives.

Phil stares out of the window.

<PHIL>

	That's what I hate about people like you. Everything's 'within reason'. There are always boundaries, provisos. You only operate with a safety net.

Larry is confused.

<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've missed the point. See, it doesn't matter what he would do, or what you and your tie-dyed friends think is the correct way to behave. To me, it only matters what I do. Where you have boundaries and limits and thresholds - I only have right and wrong. If I make a promise, I keep it - that's right. If I break that promise - that's wrong.

</LARRY>

Phil rubs his eyes, tired. Suddenly, Larry smashes Phil across the head with a bottle of Jack Daniels. Phil slumps back in the seat and Larry, dropping the bloodied weapon, reaches across to grab the wheel and slow the hearse.

Phil is motionless, and Larry peers out into the darkness as the car limps on, lit only from the light of the moon. Larry sees a glow in the distance ahead, and drives towards a neon sign; 'Welcome to the Joshua Tree Inn'.

He stops by the entrance to the inn and stares at Stanley's car parked in the bay outside room 8. He glances across at Phil, turns the car around and drives in.

EXT. HIGHWAY/CAR PARK - JOSHUA TREE INN. NIGHT A car drives past the inn and then brakes sharply and skids across the road. It reverses and pulls in, parking next to the hearse.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You people are supposed to be on the lookout for a hearse. A hearse is a big long car. You can usually tell which ones are the hearses, because they have coffins in the back. The one we're looking for is painted yellow. Does this look like a yellow hearse to you, asshole?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>

Long pause. Barbara realizes that she might have gone too far. He starts to write a ticket.

Phil opens the back of the hearse and slides the casket out of the car. He notices that Larry has made no move to help. Susie sits on a rock and watches.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna give me a hand here?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Larry walks over and grabs the other end of the casket. They walk it away from the car and lay it down. As they lower it, the coffin slips out of Phil's hands and bangs down in the sand.

They all stare at the casket. Phil wipes a tear away and tucks a can of beer into the coffin.

He rests Gram's guitar against the casket, takes big puffs on his cigar to get the flame up, then tosses it into the coffin. They wait. Nothing happens. Phil edges nearer and looks inside. Then the coffin explodes into flames. All three of them are thrown backwards by the blast.

EXT. DESERT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phil, Larry and Susie pick themselves up. They stare at the pyre. Phil is close to tears, and Susie puts her arm around him. For a moment, Phil thinks he sees the flames morph into the shape of an angel over the burning coffin. The image disappears when Larry speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe too much fuel.

	We're in the desert. It is dark. If you want to catch someone in the dark, it's best not to turn on big flashing lights and make a loud noise with a siren.

	Do you want to know what I think, ma'am?

INT. HEARSE. DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phil is fast asleep and snoring in Bernice's passenger seat. He wakes slowly and shields his eyes from the bright sunshine that pours through the windscreen. He pulls a flask out of the glove compartment and takes a long gargle, spitting the result out of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he glances in the rear view mirror and sees the man sitting in the casket bay.

EXT. HIGHWAY. DAY

<DIRECTION>
We hear Gram's: 'Return Of The Grievous Angel' or some similar music.

He leans across to hug Phil, who looks awkward and pats him on the shoulder instead.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Singed my damn mustache, that's for sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
Phil pulls a cigar out of his pocket and lights it. The handcuff dangles from his wrist and bangs against the dash. He stares at the match as it burns.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, shall we?

Phil blows the match out.

	Get out of here. Finish it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Phil pats Bernice's battered wing as he walks away and over to where Larry is waiting. They cross the road and walk into a building through heavy wooden doors. Pull back to reveal a sign: 'Los Angeles Police Department'. FADE UP ON SUPER: Phil Kaufman and Larry Osterberg appeared in West L.A. Municipal Court on November 5, 1973 - Gram Parsons's 27th birthday. Since a corpse has no intrinsic value, the two were charged with misdemeanor theft for stealing the coffin and given a token punishment: $708 in damages for the coffin, and a $300 fine for each of the bodysnatchers.
