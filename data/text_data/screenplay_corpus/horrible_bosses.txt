INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

The alarm clock now reads "4:59 AM." It switches to "5:00" and a BLARING BUZZER goes off. Nick sits up in bed, shuts off the buzzer and painfully forces himself out of bed. He hurries out of the bedroom, passing the saddest, deadest houseplant in history.

INT. NICK'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Nick opens his fridge to reveal a wasteland of moldy leftover containers and crusty condiments. The orange juice container he grabs is empty.

<NICK>

	Damn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the freezer. It contains nothing but multiple boxes of "Jimmy Dean's Breakfast Bowl -- with Bacon!" He pops one in the microwave, then glances over at a framed photo of a slightly younger Nick kissing a smiling OLD WOMAN on the cheek. The frame reads: "I Y Grandma!" Nick sighs sadly.

</DIRECTION>
<HARKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's my concern, Nick. You're a punctual guy. You understand the importance of getting to work on time. So that leaves me to wonder if there isn't something wrong with the internal clock in our security system. What do you think?

</HARKEN>
<NICK>

	I don't know, Mr. Harken. I might have been a minute late.

</NICK>
<HARKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two minutes according to this. So either you're a liar -- which I know you're not -- or our system is off by a full minute. And if that's the case, I have no choice but to dismiss Thomas, our longtime security coordinator.

He sits, then immediately stands again.

	Look, Julia, this is ridiculous --

</DALE>
<JULIA>
<DIRECTION>
(holding up hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you're going to say and that's exactly what I want to talk to you about. Yes, I like to joke around at work. And sometimes I might cross the line a bit. But the last thing I want to do is make you uncomfortable. That's unprofessional and I pride myself on being a professional.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIA>
<DIRECTION>
She leans back in her chair and puts her hands behind her head revealing even more of her body.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So from now on, I want you to tell me when and if I cross the line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIA>
<DALE>

<DALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're naked, Julia!

</DALE>
<JULIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not naked. You can't even see my pussy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIA>
<DALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, right there! Just saying 'pussy' to me. That's over the line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DALE>
<JULIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's over the line? You're starting to sound like a little faggot, Dale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIA>
<DALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Again! Naked, 'pussy,' 'faggot.' All over the line. And probably ILLEGAL --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DALE>
<JULIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, let's not start talking about illegal, Mr. Pees-on-Young- Boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIA>
<DALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was an empty playground! In the middle of the night!

</DALE>
<JULIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even worse. That little boy must have been terrified.

</JULIA>
<DIRECTION>
Julia stands and moves uncomfortably close to Dale. He tries not to stare at her breasts.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's cut to the chase. You're engaged now. And I respect the institution of marriage too much to violate it. That's why you need to fuck me well before the wedding. Because the closer it gets, the less ladylike I'm going to feel about this whole thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIA>
<DALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to sleep with you, Julia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DALE>
<JULIA>

Nick, Dale and Kurt sit miserably over their drinks. They've all had a few.

	Why don't you guys quit? It's not like you're sex offenders.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DALE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's true. I mean, I'm young. I could go back to school, change fields.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
In the b.g., a GUY has noticed them. He heads over.
</DIRECTION>
<KURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Why should I care about protecting Pellit's name when his own son doesn't? There's a million jobs out there.

	The world is your oyster.

	</DIALOGUE>
</KURT>
<KENNY>

	Don't you read the papers? They shut us down. I've been looking for work for the last two years. It's crazy out here. I can't even get a job waiting tables.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You? Waiting tables? You were voted Most Likely to Succeed. Everyone thought you were set.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy, Kenny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DALE>
<KENNY>

The three guys exchange uncomfortable looks as they reach for their wallets.
</DIRECTION>
<DALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, sure. Here's a few bucks, Kenny.

</DALE>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, y'know that's not really gonna do it for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking around, LEANING IN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you what? What if I give you guys handjobs? Forty bucks. We can do it in the bathroom right here. I'll do the three of you for a hundred.

They look skeptical.

	I'm the opposite of gay!

They guys look at each other with eyebrows raised. Nick mouths "opposite."

The three guys are walking home, all mildly buzzed.

</KURT>
<DALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DALE>
<KURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What options do we have? We can quit our jobs and turn into Kenny. Or keep our jobs and turn into sad, ball-less losers who spend their days dreaming of ways to kill their bosses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURT>
<DIRECTION>
There's a beat as Nick regards Kurt.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do that too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. Everyone does. It's the only thing that keeps us from going totally bat-shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The other day I imagined shoving one of those jugs from the water cooler in Harken's mouth and making him drink until his bladder explodes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeez.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DALE>
<KURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's so funny. I had the same idea for Pellit. Only using gasoline instead of water. And his ass instead of his mouth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURT>
<DALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys are sick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DALE>
<KURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's sick about it? It's just a way to let off steam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, Dale. It's not like we're actually going to kill our bosses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
They continue walking. After a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<KURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to admit though, our lives would be a lot better if our bosses were dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, of course. It's the one thing that keeps me from being happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.

</DALE>
<DIRECTION>
There's another beat.

<KURT>

	Let's just consider this, for one second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURT>
<DALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Consider what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DALE>
<KURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Killing our bosses. I'm just being hypothetical here.

<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very funny.

</NICK>
<KURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's not like they're gonna live forever. These pieces of shit are going to die someday. We'd just be accelerating that natural process.

</KURT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up, Kurt.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frankly, I don't see any reason not to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURT>
<DALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, first of all, killing someone is illegal and immoral --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DALE>
<KURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It may be illegal but I'm not sure it's immoral. Sometimes one evil person has to die for the greater good of the community. If Bobby Pellit has his way, hundreds, maybe thousands of innocent Bolivians will suffer. It would actually be immoral not to kill him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick begins to warm to the idea.

<NICK>

	I didn't get to say goodbye to Gam Gam because of Harken.

	Exactly! Who knows how many other Gam Gams have died alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURT>
<DALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe you guys are actually talking about this. I don't care how bad our bosses are. We're not murderers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DALE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we're not, Dale. We're just trying to live our lives. But what are we supposed to do when someone makes it impossible for us to live our lives? Do we just bend over and take it up the ass forever?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we do not!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURT>
<DALE>

</NICK>
<KURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah!

</KURT>
<DALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's not ruining my life. If anything's ruining my life it's you guys and your drunk bullshit.

</DALE>
<KURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it's bullshit, Dale, then how come we all want to do it so much?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURT>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the corner where they part ways.
</DIRECTION>
<DALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to do it. And when you sober up neither will you. We're not killing anyone.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Nick at his desk at work. He looks over his cubicle wall and his eyes narrow as he sees Harken directing a WORKMAN who stencils the words "Senior Vice President of Sales" below where it already says "President." Another WORKMAN uses a sledgehammer on the wall of the office. Nick grins malevolently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Kurt is at his desk in the chemical company. He looks up to see Bobby Pellit open his office door and lead out two obvious HOOKERS. Pellit has white powder around his nostrils. He spots Kurt watching him and he sneers back. Kurt smiles devilishly.

Julia eases the whole banana into her mouth. Then she picks up a hot dog.

</KURT>
<DIRECTION>
Both Dale and Nick shoot daggers at him.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harken's car PLOWS into the rear of Kurt's, forcing it into the back of a parked car. Even if the engine was working, there'd be nowhere to go now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dazed from the impact, the guys look back to see Harken slowly approaching on foot, holding a gun in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DALE>

	Shit, shit, shit...

Harken taps on Kurt's window with the barrel of the gun. Kurt lowers the window.

</NICK>
<HARKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut the fuck up! I've got six bullets in here. So if I want to, I can shoot each of you twice, just like I did that bastard, Pellit. But if I do that, I'll have to spend the rest of my life running from the law or rotting in jail.

As his leg bleeds, Harken wipes the gun off with his shirt, then suddenly tosses it to Dale.
</DIRECTION>
<HARKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Catch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARKEN>
<DIRECTION>
Startled, Dale catches the pistol with shaking hands.
</DIRECTION>
<HARKEN>

	Now I can tell the cops that when I discovered you three killed Pellit, you tried to kill me to shut me up.

<DIRECTION>
Down the street, two squad cars turn the corner and speed toward them. Dale looks down at the gun in his hand and drops it.
</DIRECTION>
<HARKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it? Because I don't see a shred of evidence proving that I killed Pellit. It's like I've always told you, Nick. Life is a marathon and you can't win a marathon without putting a few Band-Aids on your nipples.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARKEN>

Nick deflates. The three guys realize Harken's won. Then, from the car's open window they hear:
</DIRECTION>
<ON_STAR_REP>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I mention that this conversation is being recorded?

</DIRECTION>
<HARKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't -- this isn't --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARKEN>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, Harken BOLTS AWAY as fast as his injured leg will take him. It's not very fast. The guys watch him for a beat as they share a joyful, exhausted moment together.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think this is gonna work out okay for us.

Nick sprints off after his hobbling boss and in SLOW MOTION, violently TACKLES Harken to the pavement. Harken goes down hard, his face SLAMMING against the asphalt.

As the COPS hurry toward them, Nick kneels on the back of Harken's neck, pinning him.

	Kurt, I know you were a favorite of Jack's. He was willing to overlook your inappropriate behavior with female clients and service people. But you should be aware, I'm not Jack. And I have very little tolerance for the mistreatment of women. So consider this your first strike.
