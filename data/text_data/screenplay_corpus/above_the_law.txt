FADE IN: TITLES SEQUENCE - MONTAGE WITH SCORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHOTOGRAPHIC STILLS show us NICOLA TOSCANI as a city boy in various growing-up SHOTS, circa 1950's -- with street chums wearing a Wyatt Earp T-shirt, in a communion suit. Then: in his first qi, a youngster studying the martial arts; he grows, we see news clippings of him winning trophies, his name on contest posters, SHOTS of him in action. Then: Japan. Nico now in his teens, studying with real masters, being dumped on his butt, posing smiling beside Japanese martial artists, then himself as an instructor. Now: a few military uniforms enter the picture, we see security clearance documents with Nico's picture and name on them. Then Nico near draft age with an American friend NELSON FOX on some kind of training base. TITLES END.

DISSOLVE TO: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Blowing through the roof of a dense jungle straight AT CAMERA, HELICOPTER ROTORS RISE to a DEAFENING PITCH. SUPER: Viet - Cambodian Border, 1972. Jungle foliage whips in the fierce downdraft as -- "HUEY" GUNSHIP with US Army markings becomes discernible. The chopper lowers toward a crude landing zone hacked out of the wilderness. We GLIMPSE Cambodian troops and several machine gun positions around the LZ. EXT. JUNGLE - TWO ARMED AMERICANS - DAY watch from the edge of the landing zone. We recognize Nico and Fox, now in their twenties, dressed in the nonmilitary jungle attire that usually marks a CIA "spook."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HELICOPTER touches down. THREE OLDER AMERICANS -- rough-looking, in their mid-thirties, all carrying some kind of medical bags -- disembark into the HOWLING ROTOR BLAST. They hit the ground nimbly, as if they've done it many times before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LEADER OF THREE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
wears a khaki cowboy hat and packs a pearl-handled .45. NICO AND FOX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
don't know whether to react with laughter or uneasiness.
</DIRECTION>
<FOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ever see chemical interrogation before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOX>
<DIRECTION>
Nico's eyes stay on the approaching "cowboy," KURT ZAGON, for whom he plainly feels an instant animosity.
</DIRECTION>
<NICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These assholes are agency?

<DIRECTION>
NICO'S POV FOLLOWS the medical bag in the cowboy's hand.

BACK TO FOX AND NICO
</DIRECTION>
<FOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're all C.I.A. But these guys are from a page that ain't on the map.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JUNGLE - LATE AFTERNOON Nico in the point, leading Fox and the three CIT (Chemical Interrogation Team) men down an unmarked, twisting trail. We see from Nico's gait that he is athletic, a born leader and totally at home in the jungle. TRAIL - LATE AFTERNOON snakes along a ridge line, high enough to give us a view and let us know these guys are way out in the boonies.
</DIRECTION>
<ZAGON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long till we're across the border?
	</DIALOGUE>
<NICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been over for the past hour.

The group continues along the ridge.

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sky glows from nearby bomb attacks. NICO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
listening hard -- and even sniffing the air -- glances back at Zagon, who stands impatiently, drawing on a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<ZAGON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you looking at, hotshot?
	</DIALOGUE>
<NICO>
<DIRECTION>
(indicates cigarette glow)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you light a bonfire?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICO>
<DIRECTION>
Irritably, Zagon ditches his smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<ZAGON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just drive the taxi, ace.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As the party moves out, Fox flashes Nico a look as if to say, "Don't fuck with these guys."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMBODIAN BASE CAMP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pocket-fortified position. Armed Cambodian lookouts, several hooches, radio equipment. Nico leads the party in through the perimeter. Zagon eyes the layout like he's seen 100 of them. Fox indicates a hooch.
</DIRECTION>
<FOX>
<DIRECTION>
(to Zagon)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The three CIT men start for the hooch. Nico casts a concerned glance around at the base camp troops, looking sloppy as hell.
</DIRECTION>
<NICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't trust these yo-yo's.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - BASE CAMP We see Nico moving like a shadow from one defensive position to another, checking the perimeter. We can vaguely hear him ROUSTING the Cambodian lookouts, speaking in dialect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEFENSIVE POSITION - NICO hears a SOUND, looks back toward the hooch. NICO'S POV - HOOCH Two Asian prisoners, stripped to the waist, babbling in- coherently, are dragged out the back by a pair of Cambodian guards and hustled off into the darkness. VOICES can be heard inside the hooch. A single lantern glowing inside gives the hut a creepy, frightening aspect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO NICO He's extremely uneasy about what's about to happen inside the hooch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOOCH - CLOSE ON RICKETY CARD TABLE - NIGHT on which are spread a terrifying array of syringes, drug vials and surgical instruments. Zagon's hand picks up a hypodermic, squirt-tests it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO ASIAN PRISONERS are on their knees, shirtless, handcuffed with heavy nylon tape to a stake driven into the ground in the center of the hooch. One of the subordinate CIT men moves in, grabs the first prisoner by the shoulders. Zagon injects the first prisoner. Instantly the man begins shivering, convulsing. Zagon watches with professional satisfaction.
</DIRECTION>
<ZAGON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the nice thing about modern technology. You don't have to wait for results.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZAGON>
<DIRECTION>
He moves close to the first prisoner.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is it, Charley? You got six tons of our shit --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The prisoner tries to speak, but he's in such torment all that comes out is a blood-curdling wail -- EXT. BAST CAMP - NICO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hears this horrifying cry. He starts swiftly toward the hooch -- INT. HOOCH - INTERPRETER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has moved as close to Zagon and the first prisoner as a fight referee to two boxers. The prisoner is convulsing wildly. Zagon grabs him fiercely by the hair.
</DIRECTION>
<ZAGON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you die on me, fucker --
	</DIALOGUE>
<FOX>
<DIRECTION>
(from the side)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ZAGON>
<DIRECTION>
(throws the prisoner down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This pussy can't hold his liquor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The first prisoner is plainly in a death spasm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICO enters at this point. He takes in the scene quickly, moves to a spot beside the entrance. Zagon doesn't look at Nico, but it's plain he is aware of Nico's presence. It is as if he wants to prove something to this muscular kid -- and prove it to the others, too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIRST PRISONER dies in agony on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SECOND PRISONER watches with eyes like flint. He is in his mid-forties, scarred, missing several fingers. Probably a colonel or higher, he looks like he's been fighting these round-eyes since the French in the 50's. He is plainly one tough customer. The second prisoner meets Zagon's eyes, as if daring him to use the drugs on him, too. Zagon eyes the prisoner with barely contained hatred. The prisoner doesn't back down an inch.
</DIRECTION>
<ZAGON>
<DIRECTION>
(to second prisoner)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So my little doctor bag doesn't scare you, eh? Well I don't need it to open your yap.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Zagon reaches to a scabbard on his Western belt, pulls out a fearsome serrated blade -- a cross between a bowie knife and a scalpel. He steps toward the prisoner, displaying the blade in the lantern light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICO watches impassively.
</DIRECTION>
<ZAGON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (to prisoner)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's our load, you sack of slime? What did you do with my shit? --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ZAGON punches the prisoner full in the face, holding the knife handle in his fist to double the force of the blow and to terrify him with the proximity of the blade. The prisoner crashes sideways, face bloody --
</DIRECTION>
<ZAGON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna teach you good. I'm gonna teach you never to fuck with my opium --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
FOX AND TWO CIT MEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
seem to know exactly what this is about. NICO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
didn't know, but the new kid on the block is catching on fast. Nico has difficulty containing his emotion. Zagon stands over the prisoner, as if daring him to get back up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
prisoner gets back to his knees, bloody eyes meeting with defiance --
</DIRECTION>
<ZAGON>
<DIRECTION>
(to prisoner)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a hard nigger, aren't you, boy? You took it from the Chinks... you took it from the French. You'll be fucked if some Yankee peckerwood's gonna start your gums flapping --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
watches Zagon move the knife blade closer to the prisoner.
</DIRECTION>
<ZAGON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Well, you're gonna chirp for me, tough guy. You're gonna sing like a choir --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZAGON>
<DIRECTION>
takes a step toward Zagon.
</DIRECTION>
<NICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck does this have to do with military intelligence?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ZAGON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your orders are 'assist and observe' cherry --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
turns to face Nico --
</DIRECTION>
<FOX>
<DIRECTION>
(to Nico)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back off, partner --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
turns from Nico. He moves close to the second prisoner, as a lover, displaying the blade in the lamplight.
</DIRECTION>
<ZAGON>
<DIRECTION>
(to second prisoner)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna start carving at your ankles. We'll throw your feet in that box right over there. Then I'm gonna take off your arms --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
of the CIT men yanks the prisoner's leg forward, clamping to the ground with his hands. The prisoner still hasn't He seems as locked into this dance of death as Zagon.

	</DIALOGUE>
</FOX>
<ZAGON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can disappear as easy as this slope, kid --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZAGON>
<DIRECTION>
Zagon starts for the prisoner. Here comes the blade. Suddenly -- Nico grabs Zagon's shoulder. Zagon spins with terrifying quickness, cocking the blade to slash at Nico. Before Zagon's blow even starts, Nico slams him with a ferocious elbow shot right under the jaw. Zagon literally comes off the ground, Nico's blow is so terrific. Zagon drops in an unconscious heap. In a flash the two other CIT men move to jump Nico. Smash! The second CIT man is swallowing his teeth. Fox leaps in the way of the third, shoves Nico out of the hooch -- EXT. HOOCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fox wrestles Nico away from the hooch --
</DIRECTION>
<FOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you crazy?!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Nico jerks free)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck's the matter with you?!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nico is shaking with rage and fear. He takes several steps away from the hooch, then draws up abruptly. Nico pulls his .45 from his holster, pops the safety, starts back for the hooch --
</DIRECTION>
<FOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nico!
	</DIALOGUE>
<NICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't cap him now, he's gonna do me later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOX>
<DIRECTION>
The last CIT man appears, gun drawn, in the hooch doorway. Fox grabs Nico, hauls him back again --
</DIRECTION>
<FOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll cover this. Get back to the L.Z. --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Nico resists)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I'll fix it! Get out! Get the fuck outa here!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The CIT man calls out to the Cambodian troops, in dialect, pointing at Nico. The soldiers start toward Nico, as if to seize him. Fox, too, starts yelling to the troops in dialect, apparently countermanding the orders of the CIT men. The troops, confused, hold up for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<FOX>
<DIRECTION>
(to Nico)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll call for a chopper... get outa here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOX>
<DIRECTION>
Nico gives a last look, turns and takes off down the jungle trail. Fox seems abandoned. The DISTANT BOMBING CONTINUES. Nico disappears into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK. FADE IN ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHURCH STEEPLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TILT DOWN to reveal St. Elizabeth's, a huge parish church in an Italian/Latino neighborhood in Chicago. The church looks festive, we see a few formally-dressed people hurrying in, then a squad car pulls up. The cops run upstairs as if they're late -- INT. ST. MARY'S - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A baptism in progress. Nico -- 15 years older than when we last saw him, is standing beside SARA, his lovely wife -- watching a 60-ish priest, FATHER GENARRO, finish the final ritual on Nico's infant son Julian. The priest straightens the baby's baptismal garment, tugging the cloth around the little fellow's crotch. Smiles from friends and relatives clustered proudly around. Several cops, some in uniform are amongst them. Nico grabs his son from Genarro with a theatrical protective motion, tugs up the little boy's garment, kisses him smack on the bare butt. Laughter from all as Nico holds the lad high and proud. He puts his arm around Sara.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY Huge trays of Italian delicacies are carried out into the sunlight by several "old country"-type women. Wine is poured from generous carafes. Friends and relatives are everywhere, laughing and enjoying themselves; apparently the party has come here straight from the church. Presents for the new baby are being opened by Nico's wife, Sara, and Nico's mother, ROSA.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mama, look at this -- all done by hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sara lifts a cute baby outfit.

Assorted uncles and aunts watch with amusement as Nico tries awkwardly to deal with the problem.
</DIRECTION>
<NICO>
<DIRECTION>
(to all)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what you get for not marrying a Sicilian.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sara lets Nico struggle a moment, then takes over.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My brave husband. He's not afraid of thieves and muggers, but he's terrified when his son poops in his pants.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Toscani relatives look on with approval at the happy couple and their baby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER PART OF BACK YARD Three Chicago cops, LUKICH and HENDERSON in plain clothes and LIEUTENANT STROZAH in uniform wolf some Italian goodies while eying the group of celebrating relatives.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKICH>
<DIRECTION>
(indicates Nico across the patio)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Toscani holds the record... for havin' more relatives under federal indictment than any other cop in Chicago.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
TWO OF NICO'S UNCLES BRANCA and LUIGI, who look like they have been on the other side of a cop's work, are in turn eying Lukich and Henderson -- plus a cluster of other cops in civvies hovering around the buffet table like vultures.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at these stiff dicks. A free meal and they come out like flies.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
STREET OUTSIDE NICO'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An unmarked police car pulls up. DOLORES JACKSON ("Jax"), another undercover cop, tall, black, and elegant, enters the driveway leading to Nico's back yard --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK YARD Jackson enters. She's impeccably dressed and radiates intelligence. She's greeted warmly by Lukich, Henderson, Strozah, and a couple of other cops.
</DIRECTION>
<STROZAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't do nothing, Counselor. I'm clean.

Luigi indicates Jackson as she crosses the patio.
</DIRECTION>
<LUIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now this cop. She can bust me any day.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
NICK, SARA AND ROSA (NICO'S MOTHER) Jackson comes up, makes a theatrical appreciation of Nico's stylish attire, kisses Sara and greets Nico's mom warmly. She starts oohing and ahhing over the baby. VARIOUS SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young kids playing on the lawn, more guests arriving, Father Genarro dancing with an elderly matron. We see that Nico's friends are an electric mix. Cops, art-y types, people of varied ages and professions. BACK TO JACKSON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding the baby.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at this little bundle. What a cupcake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKSON>

	You give up being the D.A. and hurry up and find the right fella, Jax. You might have time for one of these yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICO>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nico, will you let the woman catch her breath?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
JAPANESE WOMAN (DR. WATANABE) moves in shyly on the fringe of the cluster. While Jackson and Sara continue their "mom" talk, Nico edges off toward Watanabe, shaking her hand with real pleasure.
</DIRECTION>
<NICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watanabe! Say hey, Doc.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICO>
<DIRECTION>
They begin jabbering in Japanese. We will meet Watanabe again later. She's a brainy-looking woman -- reserved, a bit mysterious -- who talks quietly and intensely in Japanese with Nico like they're old friends who go back a long way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOSCANI FRONT PORCH - LATER Branca, Luigi and several other Toscani patriarchs smoke cigars and sip beer in a cluster. Nico holds Julian.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a father now. Are you gonna take me up on my offer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANCA>
<NICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm happy, Branca. I like what I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Branca glances seriously to the other uncles, then, with a smile, pats Nico's cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at this face! Six-foot-four, pretty as the statue of David. And he's a cop!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Branca laughs. From a distance, Watanabe watches, missing nothing. Across the porch, Lukich and several other cops observe and try to listen.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This face should be sticking up from a white shirt. It should be a banker, a businessman, someone who earns a decent living for his family!
	</DIALOGUE>
<NICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LUIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nickels and dimes. Your wife's a woman with class. What did she run -- a ballet school...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<NICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An art gallery.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BRANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Same thing. She wants a husband who carries a briefcase, not a shoulder holster.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jackson watches Nico trying to keep his good humor. This is serious stuff, despite the light tone. Branca's eyes meet Nico's.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanted to get shot, you got shot. You wanted to get knifed, you got knifed. You've had your fun. Basta! Enough!
	</DIALOGUE>
<UNCLE_GUISEPPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let your family help you, Nico.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANCA>
<NICO>
<DIRECTION>
(lightly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uncle Gio, that kind of help I don't need. I'd rather get shot by someone I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jackson and Lukich crack up. The others follow. For the moment, the tension is dispelled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NICO'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY Nico comes out of the bedroom, adjusting his shoulder holster, tugging his jacket over it. He sees his mother standing near the head of the stairs, just outside another bedroom door. Concern on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<NICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing in here, Mama? Go join the party...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nico comes down the hall, tucking in his shirt -- stops to give his mother a squeeze. O.S. from the bedroom: the sound of QUIET SOBBING. Nico glances in. INT. NURSERY - DAY Sara and another woman sit on the bed, comforting a 60-ish grandmother Zingaro, who is crying. Nico comes in. He kneels before MRS. ZINGARO, concerned.

The poor woman can't meet Nico's eyes.

	It's Lucy. She's gone again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nico glances from Sara to Rosa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Zingaro shakes her head, choked with pain. Nico holds her, looking over her shoulder toward Sara.
</DIRECTION>
<NICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's that kid from the bar on Damen? The one with the drugs?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sara doesn't know. Nico does. He comforts Mrs. Zingaro another moment, then stands.
</DIRECTION>
<NICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me, Mrs. Z. Are you listening?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as the woman nods miserably)
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</NICO>
<DIRECTION>
Nico kisses Mrs. Z. He takes Sara's hand in goodbye, starts for the door. EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - DAY Festivities still in progress.

INT. UNMARKED CAR as it parks. Jackson gives Nico a look: "What are we stopping at this dive for"?
</DIRECTION>
<NICO>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</NICO>
<DIRECTION>
He gets out of the car, starts for the bar. INT. BUCKSHOT'S LIQUORS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dim, smoke-choked, dangerous characters at the bar. Nico enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His silk shirt and sport coat clash with the druggy, working- class attire of the bar's denizens. Hard faces check him out subtly, ignore him. Nico approaches the bartender, shows a photograph. The bartender (BAD DUDE) shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<BAD_DUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why the fuck don't you assholes leave me alone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAD_DUDE>

He continues mouthing off to Nico. Nico moves to one stool, then another; the same exchange is repeated. FAVOR ONE PARTICULARLY TOUGH CUSTOMER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hulking bruiser with an earring. He watches as -- NICO

approaches him. Three ARMY JACKETS look up sullenly. Beefy arms, tattoos, greasy mustaches.

Nico at the wheel has just pulled away from the bakery. Jackson, in the passenger seat, studies her partner for a few moments, shaking her head at the contradictions in this man. Educated, classy, an elegant dresser -- yet underneath an out-and-out wild man.

Some of the chocolates tumble onto the lockup floor, the detainees snap them up, start munching. The girl con- tinues to spit curses at Nico, gesturing with her hands with Latin flamboyance. Nico grabs her by the elbow, as a jailer opens the lockup door. More curses are being flung at Nico from various females in the cage. Nico heaves Carla in among them. Carla flops down on a bench next to a tall black hooker. MOVE IN ON the black hooker. It's Nico's partner, Jackson, dolled up like a street- walker, playing her undercover role to the hilt.

Jackson has been waiting, sipping some coffee. Nico emerges from the bank, signaling to his partner to follow him. Abandano and the woman exit from the bank's revol- ving doors and immediately jump into a cab. Nico and Jackson look at each other and step in front of another cab. Nico opens the cab door, flips his badge open, then asks the occupant to leave. Jackson gets in the front seat next to the protesting cabbie. EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - DAY Abandano and the woman are crossing the plaza as Nico and Jackson run up the block. Near the entrance to the Federal Building, a small but vocal group of protestors are gathered, carrying signs and chanting slogans. The frus- trated cabbie watches them in the background.

BOOTH NEAR BACK HALLWAY The owner's table. Stacks of dining checks, a cashbox and calculator, full ashtrays, wine glasses. BAUTISTA SALVANO, a heavyset, swarthy Venezuelan dressed in a tux with the collar open, glowers across the table at a mus- cular, scar-faced Latin busboy -- the kind who looks like he does more for his boss than clean up the tables. The busboy (NARDO) is nervous, apologetic --

One SHOT between the eyes and Nardo CRASHES backward into the WINE RACK, eyes wide with shock and bewilderment. Chi Chi SHOOTS him AGAIN; Nardo drops like a stone. Coolly, professionally, Chi Chi pumps FOUR more SHOTS into the prone busboy's head. Chi Chi ejects the clip into his palm, unscrews the silencer, holsters the gun. Salvano appears at the top of the stairs. Two busboys are behind him. One of them is the young pimp. The busboys hurry down, the pimp -- scared shitless but playing it macho-cool. Salvano comes down the stairs. Chi Chi stands over his work.

Nico's eyes never leave Chi Chi. REAR DINING ROOM From the back hallway Salvano emerges -- in his tux, looking prosperous. He sits down beside Chi Chi and Abandano. A waitress brings two drinks. After a few words, Chi Chi removes the scrap of paper from his pocket, hands it to Salvano.

Lieutenant Strozah surveys the street traffic. NICO, JACKSON AND LUKICH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two men, dressed as meat processors in hard hats and bloody white coats, rake cattle guts under the eave of a packing plant. Jackson, dressed like a USDA Inspector and carrying a clipboard, inspects a few hanging carcasses.

Luke casts an impatient glance across the street to a lot with four parked meat trucks. We glimpse two "truckers" keeping low in the shadows of one cab. Down the block a seemingly empty pickup truck is parked in an alley.

We realize Nico, Jackson and Lukich are wired, with mikes out of sight under their coats. Nico glances to the pick- up, near to which three men can be spotted in the alley. Apparently one of them is the walkie-talkie voice.

NICO, LUKICH AND JACKSON Bored, pissed off, tired. Suddenly:

BATTERED VAN WITH TWO MEN

emerges from a corner, two blocks down. It starts slowly this way.

	All right. Everyone get their heads outa their ass.

The meat truck men duck down out of sight, the pickup men back into the shadows. Nico and Lukich keep raking cow guts. The van passes slowly, checking out the area.

As soon as the two vehicles pass out of sight, Nico and Lukich ditch their rakes, dart into the packing plant. The meat truck men START their TRUCK.

<DIRECTION>
The pickup men board their vehicle -- Jackson follows Nico and Luke -- but at a safe distance.

INT. PACKING PLANT - DAY

Nico and Lukich sprint in a crouch past the blood runoffs, meat cutting tables --

THROUGH the windows at the rear of the plant, we see the station wagon and the van, pulling up swiftly beside one another, men getting out --

QUICK CUTS - VAN AND STATION WAGON MEN grab for their weapons --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COPS IN MEAT TRUCK AND PICKUP come highballing around both sides of the packing plant --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VAN AND STATION WAGON MEN OPEN FIRE. There is confusion and mayhem; it's not clear who's a cop and who's a criminal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICO AND LUKICH dive for cover, RETURNING FIRE. The DEA men in one truck also OPEN UP. One of the van men is hit between the eyes. MACHINE GUN FIRE rakes the DEA truck; it spins out of control; flips. Lukich SHOOTS the machine-gunner.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICO steps in front of the accelerating Lincoln, raises his .45.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LINCOLN - DAY Salvano and Chi Chi dive below the dash and continue forward. Salvano, in the passenger seat, raises his GUN; FIRES blindly -- trying to hit Nico. EXT. LINCOLN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nico UNLOADS his .45 into the windshield and the firewall. The Lincoln keeps coming down the narrow alley. NICO brazenly steps up onto the hood and dives, grabbing onto the roof. INT. LINCOLN - DAY Salvano can't believe it. He screams something in Spanish. He FIRES again, this time through the roof. EXT. LINCOLN - ROOF - DAY Bullet holes appear. Nico narrowly misses being hit. ANOTHER ANGLE - LINCOLN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nico reaches over the side of the car and SMASHES the pas- senger WINDOW with his fist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - NICO'S HAND Salvano's face is bashed. Nico's huge hand grabs Salvano's throat; he won't let go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - NICO He hangs on with one hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - SALVANO Nico's fingers now dig into Salvano's larynx; he may never talk again. He's gagging. Salvano now points the gun at Chi Chi. Chi Chi makes the decision to stop the car in order to save his boss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICO leaps off the roof pulling Salvano past the broken glass, out of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEVERAL POLICE VEHICLES SCREECH into the lot. Officers pour out, guns drawn, surrounding the Lincoln and the other vehicles. Jackson joins them, weapon in hand. NICO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
drags Salvano by the neck across the lot to the van, slamming the drug dealer up against the van's side. Lukich, Jackson and Strozah are there, with the DEA cops, all covering the other men.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many kilos you got in there, Skivuzo?

Salvano couldn't answer if he wanted to. The other cops look at Nico with awe. Lukich whips the van door open, yanks a tarp off the cargo. INT. VAN The engine block sits in a wooden shipping frame, wrapped with industrial plastic. Nico climbs into the van, rips the plastic sheeting off, grabs the wood slats of the shipping frame, tears them off. In the background, ambulances are arriving to care for the wounded cops and criminals.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - ENGINE BLOCK From the cylinder heads emerges a full load, not of drugs, but of plastique tubes labeled U.S. ARMY C-4 HIGH EXPLOSIVE. LUKICH, JACKSON AND OTHER COPS

Salvano knows what the call is about. He straightens the tie beneath his bruised neck, assuming the attitude of a respectable citizen who has been unjustly wronged.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- count on it, sir. Right. You'll have our full cooperation.

INT. PRECINCT CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - MORNING OPENING ON Agent Neeley's face. Composed, clean-cut, but intense, wearing a light-colored business suit. PAN TO Agent Halloran -- the same upright, clean-shaven bureau look. The two men are seated to one side of LIEUTENANT FRED STROZAH. NICO, JACKSON, LUKICH AND DEA AND ATF MEN

</DIRECTION>
<LIEUTENANT_STROZAH>

(to Nico, DEA & AIF)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- This is no reflection on the work you officers have done. I feel, and the whole department feels, extremely proud of your initiative and gallantry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
That "spare me the horseshit" look on Nico's face. He's fuming. Strozah sees Nico's bitter expression. It's on the others' faces too.
</DIRECTION>
<LIEUTENANT_STROZAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As all of you are well aware, possession of these explosives is a federal offense and under jurisdiction of the F.B.I.

Nico's eyes meet Lieutenant Strozah's. There's respect between the two, but it's plainly under a helluva strain.

	Sir. With all respect to our brothers in the Bureau --

<DIRECTION>
(biting sarcasm; turns to Neeley)

Nico stifles his outrage. The other cops exchange glances -- upset and angry. Agent Neeley clears his throat.

BACK TO AGENT NEELEY

	What's the story on your partner, Jackson? Did he learn this style or was he born with a brick up his ass?

Jackson checks Halloran out. He's black too and, despite herself, there's a certain rapport.

Halloran's look asks why not?

	What... you kept his tape, too?

Salvano's Caddy pulls up outside the same church where we saw Nico's son get baptized. Salvano and Chi Chi get out, look both ways up and down the street. Salvano, holding flowers, makes eye contact with a car down the block. EXT. STREET UP BLOCK FROM CHURCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nico's car backs out of sight around the corner. SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF CHURCH Salvano and Chi Chi, seeing nothing, enter the church. INT. CHURCH - DAY A smattering of older women and men praying. Salvano and Chi Chi stop at the head of the aisle, genuflect to the altar, move in, take seats toward the front. BACK OF CHURCH

SALVANO AND CHI CHI After a few moments, the pair rises. They cross them- selves, start out for the front door. As they walk, they continue to look for something. INT. CHURCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Nico and Jackson emerge into a courtyard which reveals a day care center and a rectory. They head toward the front of the building. Jackson, planning on picking up their tail on Salvano, is stoped by Nico. He wants to stay and look around.

The priest begins leading Nico and Jackson. Jackson keeps glancing back out the alley to see Salvano's car slowly driving by. INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is an old building. The dark corridors resemble an underground bunker. Old trophies and furniture are stored along the walls. The two cops and the priest walk. Another priest emerges from a door, nods, passes. Nico and Jackson glance in through the door as they walk. They reach a door with a broken handle. It looks like a break-in has taken place.

A largish room, no exposed windows, everything boarded up. Newly-constructed makeshift toilet and shower in one corner, various cots. A number of LATIN REFUGEES -- families mostly -- react shyly as Father Genarro introduces Nico and Jackson. Sister Bonifacia is there, and a youthful priest, FATHER TOMASSINO. We will see both of them again.

DISSOLVE TO: SAME CHURCH - POV FROM WINDOW - EARLY MORNING (SUNDAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH ANGLE FROM ACROSS the street: neighborhood people dressed in their Sunday best fill the sidewalk, filing in for Mass. We hear an ORGAN from inside the church.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS ANGLES - CONGREGATION An Italian neighborhood becoming more Hispanic. As the churchgoers file in, we see families -- women, kids, babies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICO, SARA, ROSA AND JULIAN are among the crowd, exchanging pleasantries with friends and neighbors -- in English, Italian and Spanish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHURCH - SIDE AISLE Sara, holding Julian, slips into a pew. As Nico and Rosa follow, Father Genarro passes, heading for the front.

<DIRECTION>
QUICK DISSOLVE TO: VARIOUS SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A) THE CHOIR building to the finish of a hymn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B) NICO'S WIFE (SARA) also singing, balancing baby Julian and a hymnbook. C) NICO AND HIS MOTHER ROSA sing with full gusto.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D) THE CHOIR MASTER makes the sign to be seated. E) CONGREGATION sits. We notice a young, intellectual-looking man (Alan Singletary) wearing wire-rim glasses, sitting in the front row. We will see his face again later. He looks out of place and glances around, surprised as... F) FATHER GENARRO moves into the pulpit, opens his Bible.

<FATHER_GENARRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In nomine patris, filius et spiritu sancti...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(etc) SARA AND JULIAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The little one starts to CRY; she comforts him. Nico reaches over to try to help. The BABY continues FUSSING. Nico looks toward the priest and the front of the church. He notices a woman in a black shawl rise from the front of the church and turn, heading down one of the side aisles.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(examines Julian's diaper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Way to go, Julian -- perfect timing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She cynically smiles at Nico. Nico sees the woman in black pass toward the exit of the church.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - WOMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is the same woman Nico and Jackson were following with Abandano, the lawyer!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - LARGE SHOPPING BAG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman has left it in front of the votive candles directly before the priest's pulpit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - NICO His head spins from the shopping bag to the doorway --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICO'S POV - DOORWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman is hastily sneaking out. BACK TO NICO Instantly he pushes his family to the floor, covering them with his body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - NICO - SECOND LATER BOOM!!! A POWERFUL EXPLOSION erupts between the priest and his congregation. Fragments of plaster, wood, and marble come blasting past Nico and his family! Churchgoers in the first rows are blown off their feet by the shock wave of the blast. Pews overturn, smoke everywhere -- CHOIR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is shrieking hysterically. Stone and plaster dust rain down on them from the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CONGREGATION is in total pandemonium. Screams, cries, panic --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULPIT has been blown to oblivion. Where Father Genarro had been standing is now nothing but smoke and rubble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICO Prone, covering Sara and the baby, groping frantically to protect his mother as well.

CUT TO: STATUE OF JESUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Splattered with real blood.

<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO: ANGLE ON CONGREGATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is down, reeling from the concussion, dust and smoke. Nico rises alone from this scene.
</DIRECTION>
<NICO>
<DIRECTION>
(forcefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help each other move outside. Be calm.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDE OF CHURCH - MORNING From a doorway and a shattered window smoke pours forth. We hear SCREAMS from inside. INT. CHURCH Nico on his feet, plainly the leader in this moment of terror. Worshippers, shattered and bleeding, pour past him toward the door. Nico grabs a stout-looking church- goer.

Nico starts for the altar where the damage is worst.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT OF CHURCH - MORNING The congregation streams out in terror-stricken disarray. We see Nico's family -- they're all right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICO appears from the church, carrying a young choir girl. He hands the child over to two older women, races back into the church.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT - STREET OUTSIDE CHURCH The first paramedic van comes speeding around the corner, SIREN BLARING. Police cars appear right behind --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHURCH Nico appears through the backlit smoke and kneels over the bloodied body of Father Genarro. He desperately tries to maintain the priest's life. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL/ICU WARD - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The aftermath of the blast. Doctors and nurses have the scene more of less under control, but there's still plenty of pain and misery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - AFTERNOON Nico stands, his back to the wall -- a scary, blank look on his face. A doctor and several nurses are pulling the plugs on the terribly mutilated body of Father Genarro. A nun is crying; a fellow priest is blessing the Father. JACKSON arrives. Nico talks to her, aside.
</DIRECTION>
<NICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want a list of everyone that's been treated here today. Everyone.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NICO'S MOTHER (ROSA) - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sits on a bench with a bandage over one eye. Sara and Julian are sleeping beside her. Nico kneels beside his mother, deeply concerned. Nico takes his mother's arm, helps her to her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara wakes and picks up Julian. Mama knows Father Genarro has died. She begins sobbing softly. Other members of the congregation are in the hallway, mourning. Nico, with his family, takes several steps toward the exit. Suddenly, Nico stops. He sees Agent Neeley entering (the FBI man who ordered him off the case) accompanied by Lieutenant Strozah and two uniformed officers.
</DIRECTION>
<NICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sara... go down to the car; I'll be with you in a minute.

	Salvano never came near that C-4. It's in federal holding now! Besides, why would he blow up a church?
	</DIALOGUE>
<NICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tailed Salvano. Two days ago. Him and one of his apes were in that church -- and they weren't taking communion. I saw some broad saw who was with his lawyer plant the bomb. Now I want some goddamn answers.

MONTAGE WITH SCORE A) EXT. "BOGOTA" (SALVANO'S RESTAURANT) - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nico's unmarked car whips in front. Nico storms toward the front door of the restaurant. B) INT. RESTAURANT - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nico storms through toward the restaurant rear. The employees are getting ready for the evening crowd. He flashes his badge, checks the kitchen, Salvano's office. The man is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C) INT. MORGUE - LATE AFTERNOON Jackson has her list from the hospital. A coroner and his assitant show her a body on a slab. The body is that of Alan Singletary, the man we saw in the front row of the church. Jackson takes notes. The dead man is definitely not the ethnic type you'd expect in St. Mary's congregation. D) EXT. BODY AND FENDER SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON The same place where Nico and Jackson wire-tapped Chi Chi. Nico interrogates the shop boss, several workers. All shake their head, gesture emphatically. Salvano not here. E) CUT BACK TO MORGUE - JACKSON

takes Polaroids of the dead man's I.D. and personal effects.

Nico comes storming out. A Maid and a bodyguard follow after him screaming. The door slams. We see it is missing a panel.

<MAID>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>

EXT. ST. ELIZABETH'S CHURCH - LATE AFTERNOON Jackson at the blast scene. Police tapes rope the area off while a TV news crew photographs the damage. Jackson talks with neighborhood people, asking questions. EXT. BICEK'S BAR - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nico in the alley, grilling several tough guys we saw be- fore when he raided this bar. The answers are all zero; Nico's disgusted, worn out, frustrated. He starts out the alley -- At the edge of the street, a battered van pulls in. A jacketed LATINO MAN leans against it, an unlit ciga- rette in his mouth. As Nico approaches, turning toward his car --
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_LATINO>
<DIRECTION>
(polite, casual)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cuse me, sir. Can I bum a light?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nico slows, eyeing the guy dubiously. As he reaches to his jacket -- The side door of the van flashes open. A .38 is leveled straight at Nico's head. Instantly three other Latino hoods leap to the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_LATINO>
<DIRECTION>
(machete under jacket)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't even think about it, motherfucker.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Machete Man (First Latino) snatches Nico's gun from its shoulder holster. Two hoods shove Nico back into the alley. Nico checks out his assailants quickly. Four of them. Machete, CROWBAR, BALL BAT, GUN.
</DIRECTION>
<MACHETE_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(FIRST LATINO)

	<DIALOGUE>
	You come to our streets... fuck with our people. Now our people gonna fuck with you.

<PIPE_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We ain't gonna shoot you, man. We gonna beat you to death. You gonna learn what it means to 'get down.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK CUTS A) Nico is trapped. The hoods advancing. Nico has a moment of stillness, as if all senses are clicking out of normal gear and into some hyper-combat readi- ness. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B) Gun and Machete Man are side by side. As Machete Man starts to move, Nico spins in beside him, seizes his wrist, twists it violently, wrenching the machete away, keeping Machete Man between him and Gun Man so Gun Man can't shoot. In a flash, Nico swings the machete, slicing over the top of Machete Man, half-severing the wrist of Gun Man. Gun Man falls, clutching his wrist in agony; the gun skitters away beneath a chain link fence, out of reach. Nico flips Machete Man (who has Nico's gun in his pocket) sending him crash- ing, half-unconscious. C) Instantly, Pipe Man aims a home run shot at Nico's head. Nico uses the machete, matches the angle of the oncoming blow, slides under and, in the same arc, blocks the blow and turns it into a strike, slashing Pipe Man's tendons behind the knee. Pipe Man goes down on one knee, writhing, hamstrung, crying out in pain. D) Now Ball Bat attacks. Nico intercepts the blow, flips Bat Man ass over teakettle, sending him sail- ing -- feet first -- through the side window of the van. Bat Man CRASHES THROUGH the GLASS, hung up with just his head and shoulders dangling free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
E) Nico is spread out, feet wide, in a crouch. Crowbar Man sees his chance. He is the fiercest of the four, and the savviest fighter. He throws three consecu- tive vicious blows at Nico's head; Nico drops to one knee, dodges the blows, then intercepts the third, machete in hand, matches the arc of interception and whips the blade up -- straight into the crotch of Crowbar Man. Crowbar Man can't believe it. He re- mains frozen a moment, staring at Nico, then down at his own groin. F) Machete Man, the first to be flipped, struggles des- perately to regain his senses. He tries to get Nico's gun from his own pocket, but Nico bats it a- way. Machete Man scrambles to his feet, in terror, bolts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
G) Nico snatches his gun from the sidewalk, glances to Bat Man who is still half-dangling from the van window. Nico gives Bat Man one parting punch to the head, then tears off after Machete Man --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY Shrieks from passersby as Machete Man hurtles past, straight into the street. A car nearly hits him, he vaults its hood. Here comes Nico, in hot pursuit. He too leaps the car, whose owner is staring, cursing -- ANGLE DOWN BLOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An all-out foot face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machete Man is a speedster; he hurdles a row of trash cans. TWO YOUNG GIRLS, on a stoop, whistle as he passes.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machete Man highballs off the sidewalk, straight into a Mom and Pop groceria. Customers scatter in shock as the hood blasts past them, out the back door. Here comes Nico. Patrons curse in Spanish as he barrels past --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. YARD BEHIND BODEGA - DAY Machete Man bolts from the bodega into a small patio with tables and chairs. He leaps the fence into the next yard, which belongs to a funeral home. He hurdles the headstone inventory, clambers up the fence on the far side -- BACK TO NICCO pursuing along the same route. MACHETE MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
claws his way to the top of the fence and onto a frame- work of two-by-fours which form an arbor-like canopy a- bove the third back yard. Plastic sheeting is tacked between the beams. Machete Man glances back at Nico, starts out -- tightrope-style -- across the two-by-fours. Nico reaches the fence behind the hood, starts also onto the two-by-fours. We hear FEMALE SCREAMS from below as the rickety structure starts to wobble precariously. Machete Man reaches the far side. A fire escape is ad- jacent; he grabs for it, starts up. Nico catches him by the ankle. The two crash together back onto the two-by- fours, which give way, sending them plunging into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACKYARD OF FLOWER SHOP - DAY Four young Oriental women, potting plants, react with terror as the two bodies CRASH through. Machete Man scrambles away from Nico but is trapped in the corner next to the rear shop door. The flower girls can't move either; Nico and the hood are too near the door. The girls retreat to the far corner, squealing in fright.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up!
	</DIALOGUE>

girls instantly go silent in terror. Nico turns back Machete Man, spins him violently face-down, jacking punk's right arm straight out behind him. We see Nico can break his elbow with one blow.

EXT. INTERSECTION - MORNING Nico's car pulls up at a stop light. He looks around without really seeing. An old lady pulls a shopping cart while a crossing guard takes some kids across the street.

The fourth obeys. Nico moves to the pay phone on the wall, covering the men with his .45. He grabs the re- ceiver in his free hand; tries to dial. Adrenaline makes his hand shake; the dials spin wrong -- One of the men sees Nico's dilemma. To hit 911, Nico has to take his eye momentarily off his captives. As Nico turns again to the dial -- A free-standing sales display hurtles toward him, crashing into his gun hand. One of the men has lunged into the display; now he dives atop Nico a second later. The whole human pile crashes, thundering into a glass freezer. Somehow Nico gets to his feet. One of the men grabs Nico's gun; Nico swings one of the freezer doors -- Wham! -- smack into the man's face. The GLASS SHATTERS; the man drops like a rock. Now it's three against one -- prime odds for Nico. He wades into his attackers. A coffee stand goes flying. A body sails into a makeup display. One fool is lucky enough to land a blow that bloodies Nico's nose; he pays with a shattered forearm and a head-first heave into an ice cream locker --

<DIRECTION>
PRIEST'S POV INTO FRAME moves Kurt Zagon! We see clearly the 15 years of aging since SE Asia. His face is even scarier than when he performed similar atrocities in those days. Zagon prepares a syringe, tests it, shooting a clear liquid skyward.

	You're our backup. If we come out running, then you can shoot.

Nico's eyes meet his partner's. It's plain he'll break her leg if he has to, to keep her safe by the car. Jackson accepts this reluctantly.

EXT. TENEMENT - NIGHT Nico and Lukich exit the vehicle. Nico indicates an adjacent building; he and Lukich start for it.

EXT. ADJACENT BUILDING - ROOF OF TENEMENT Nico and Lukich emerge from the roof door, guns drawn. The roof is empty. Antennas, skylights, clotheslines. The pair creep soundlessly onto the next roof. They cross toward the roof door like infantrymen, moving one at a time from cover to cover, covering each other. They reach the door that leads down into the building. Nico checks the far side of the enclosure, nods to Lukich. Lukich cracks the roof door open -- STAIRWELL FROM ROOF - NICO AND LUKICH

Nico and Lukich creep down the stairs from the roof. Nico opens the door leading to the top (third) floor. INT. APARTMENT

Nico and Lukich pad in.

Quickly Lukich checks the stairs leading down. Nico crosses silently past the first apartment door, checks the far end of the hallway. Nico comes back toward the apartment door. Lukich approaches from the opposite side. They take up positions flanking the door, guns drawn. The LOUD MUSIC CONTINUES from inside. INSIDE APARTMENT

Salvano and Chi Chi look on, revulsed. Whatever is happening to Father Tomassino is enough to make even cruel men ill.

	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Tell me the truth, Father --

<DIRECTION>
NICO AND LUKICH IN HALLWAY O.S. we hear another ELEVATED TRAIN APPROACHING outside. Nico kicks the apartment door in! He and Lukich burst in, guns clutched two-handed. QUICK CUTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first goon reacts, raises his pistol. Lukich SHOOTS him. Nico NAILS the second goon, just as Chi Chi aims his sawed- off pistol-grip shotgun at Nico. Nico has a split second to dive behind a heavy upholstered chair. Chi Chi's DOUBLE- BARREL BLAST blows the chair into powder. Almost instan- taneously Nico sees the priest -- just as Zagon slashes the priest's throat! Salvano SHOOTS Lukich point blank, in the shoulder, sending Lukich's gun sailing. Nico, FIRING, grabs Lukich, dives out the door with him -- HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zagon and Salvano OPEN FIRE from the apartment full-tilt. BULLETS RIP through the WALL, BLASTING WOOD and PLASTER everywhere. Nico shoves Lukich toward the stairwell --

<NICO>

	Go! Go!

	Get him! Finish him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZAGON>
<DIRECTION>
Nico is slamming a fresh clip in, Lukich is stumbling away toward the stairwell. Salvano and Chi Chi appear in the apartment doorway. Chi Chi levels his fierce "hogleg" at Nico's head. At that instant -- A broadside of BULLETS slam into the wall around Chi Chi. It's Jackson -- on the stairs! Chi Chi is hit, but spins, FIRES. His shotgun blast catches Jackson square in the chest, blowing her back like a doll, down the stairwell, out of sight. Nico reacts with agony, twists on the floor, SHOOTS Chi Chi in the face. Nico pulls the trigger as fast as he can, sending a HAIL of FIRE through the doorway, through the walls. Salvano clutches his hench- man, using his dead body as a shield; Nico's BULLETS blow Chi Chi apart. Zagon FIRES back, hits Nico in the side by the ribs! Nico tries to fire back; he's empty!
</DIRECTION>
<ZAGON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now!

Nico bolts for the stairwell to the roof, clawing for a new clip as he goes. Salvano and Zagon burst into the hallway, SHOOTING at Nico. INTERCUT - ELEVATED TRAIN THUNDERING along the tracks adjacent to the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOF - NIGHT Nico highballs from the stairwell as the tarpaper roof erupts all around him with GUNFIRE from the floor below! He dives sideways, rolling to avoid the fire -- He recovers his footing in time to see Salvano and Zagon burst onto the roof from the stairwell. Nico's BULLETS miss them; they separate, taking cover behind two walls at the roof's margins. Nico is trapped -- in the open. ZAGON AND SALVANO

EXT. EL STATION - STAIRWAY TO STREET - NIGHT A cleaner, more upscale neighborhood. Nico labors down the steps, clutching his jacket to his ribs.

INT. JACKSON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT Nico over the sink, shirt off, WATER RUNNING -- applying a makeshift bandage to his bloody ribs.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Nico at Jackson's desk, its surface spread with the notes and papers she got from Senator Harrison's aide's place. We glimpse them: photos of Central American atrocities, dead bodies, etc. He tries to study them, quickly, but his attention shifts --

Nico glances around the apartment: more law books, Jackson's degree on the wall, her rowing machine on the floor, several framed photos beside him on her desk. Nico turns several toward him.

<DIRECTION>
The old man never looks directly at Nico, yet we sense keenly that he is taking the younger man's measure.

<FREDERICO_LARUSSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am only an old man. An old man with a cancer.

	I don't have much time, Uncle. So I must speak plainly.

Larusso listens. Nico waits for a beat. Then:

<NICO>

(this is very painful for him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Larusso takes this in without a flicker.

Nico holds himself, trembling with intensity. At that moment -- O.S. from the garage entrance ramp: the SQUEAL of APPROACHING TIRES. Nico and Fox turn to see -- 4-17-87. THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE (SCENES 371 - 401) WILL BE MODIFIED TO CONFORM TO LOCATION. DO NOT BUILD OR PURCHASE WITHOUT CHECKING WITH STUNT COORDINATOR AND ASSISTANT DIRECTORS. STORYBOARDS AND NEW PAGES WILL BE AVAILABLE NEXT WEEK. A BIG CAR SCREECHES to a halt in front of them. Five men dismount swiftly. Salvano, Bad Dude, and two agent types from the tenement... and Zagon! Zagon and his men are forty feet from Nico and Fox, playing it cool so as not to alarm any innocent bystanders, but the bulk under their jackets is unmistakably guns.

Fox looks shaky, unnerved: Nico's words have hit too close to home. Now Nico backs away a step, ready for anything. One of Zagon's agents holds their car's rear door open.

Zagon waves Nico and Fox toward his car. Zagon and Salvano start forward. Fox glances, torn, to Nico, who has backed away another half-step. Will Nico attack? Run for it?

<DIRECTION>
He FIRES -- at Salvano! In the same instant, Salvano pulls his own trigger! Salvano's MACHINE GUN BURST cuts Fox down, a milli-second before Fox's .45 SLUG BLOWS Salvano off his feet! Pandemonium. Fox, dying, slings his .45 to Nico, who snatches it from the ground just as a HAIL of MACHINE GUN FIRE THUNDERS around him. Nico dives headlong behind a concrete column, which is instantly chewed to shreds by GUNFIRE. Zagon FIRES his MAC-10 on full automatic. A second agent hurries forward to outflank Nico. Nico pops from behind the column, DRILLS the agent broadside behind the ear, blowing the whole side of his head off! Guests and valets are shrieking in terror, hitting the deck in clusters, clawing and scrambling over each other for safety.

Nico springs from cover, FIRING, trying to bolt down the garage ramp, toward the lower levels. His path puts the first agent directly in Zagon's line of fire. Zagon doesn't hesitate; he OPENS UP on Nico, cutting down his own man -- Salvano has gotten to his feet, wounded, but still handling his gun. He joins Zagon, rushing forward --

RAMP TO LOWER LEVELS A valet rounds a corner, unsuspecting, bringing up a car. Nico is on him like a cat, tearing the poor boy from behind the wheel, leaping in --

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
appears in the torturer's hand. It slashes Nico, right a- cross his already wounded ribs! Nico cries in agony -- ZAGON scampers free. Nico gets to his feet, bleeding. Nico is between Zagon and Zagon's machine gun on the ground. Zagon bolts for his car. Nico dives for the gun --

<DIRECTION>
CAR Zagon floors it into a SCORCHING 360, BLASTS up the exit ramp, out of Nico's line of fire --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICO leaps into the other, half-destroyed car. Its two front tires are flat, windshield blown out, RADIATOR POURING STEAM. Nico does the only thing he can do: puts the pedal to the metal in reverse, BLASTS across the ramp divider, takes off after Zagon in reverse --

ZAGON'S CAR is trapped by the traffic. Zagon looks around wildly, then floors the accelerator. Zagon's car bucks straight up the pedestrian steps, onto the plaza! Strollers scream and scatter as it fishtails wildly, careening toward the huge stone fountain --

ZAGON leaps free, sprints toward the hotel alley. Nico takes off after him on foot --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - REAR OF HOTEL - NIGHT Zagon races down the darkest of alleys, rounds a corner -- NICO hurtles after him, gaining. Nico whips around the alley corner, straight into: FOUR ARMED AGENTS waiting beside a plain grey TV remote van. Nico skitters to a stop as a shotgun, an M-16 and two pistols cover him. Shotgun Agent raises his weapon to fire --

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Noose agent jerks his cable tight, making Nico gag and choke. Zagon motions to slacken off. He stops at a small table before Nico -- unrolls a well-worn felt pouch. Zagon watches Nico's reaction as the tools of the inter- rogator's trade come into view -- drug vials, syringes, scalpels, surgical tools.

Zagon punches Nico square in the face, so hard the chair reels backward, spinning out from under Nico --
</DIRECTION>
<ZAGON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold him up!

<DIRECTION>
Pistol agent and Bad Dude lift Nico. Zagon slams him again. Again. Nico's cheekbone is broken; blood drains from his nose. Zagon aims a two-handed blow; backhands Nico, crushing the other side of his face! Zagon backs off, chest heaving. Pistol agent and Bad Dude plop Nico back in the chair, gagging, choked by the noose. Nico looks like the Viet prisoner -- the one we saw in the opening sequence. Like the prisoner, Nico takes his beating -- still conscious, still meeting Zagon's eyes with defiance.
</DIRECTION>
<ZAGON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is where you came in, Toscani. Only, now it's where you're gonna check out.

He takes off his glove, grabs the syringe. Pistol agent and Bad Dude clamp Nico's right arm down tight. Zagon injects Nico.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICO reacts instantly to the hypo -- cursing, sputtering under the choking noose. He twists wildly trying to free him- self, but the agents' powerful arms hold him.
</DIRECTION>

<ZAGON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my boy. That's what I was waiting for --

Zagon produces his famous knife. He motions Pistol agent and Bad Dude to release Nico's arms. Noose agent slackens his grip on the choke cable. Zagon moves in closer, gloating, cooing --

</ZAGON>
<DIRECTION>
The blade moves to Nico's throat. Suddenly: Nico springs to life (catching Noose man by surprise and jerking the cable from his grip) -- grabbing Zagon with his taped hands by the throat, lifting him bodily, slamming him ferociously into the wall! Zagon drops to the floor, half-conscious. Nico spins instantly to find: the Shot- gun agent right behind him, raising his weapon to Nico's face, about to pull the trigger. Nico sidesteps, grabbing the man's wrist. The SHOTGUN GOES OFF, missing Nico by inches, blasting a huge chunk out of the concrete wall. The Noose agent draws his weapon from his shoulder holster. Nico snaps the Shotgun agent's wrist, flipping him through the air, simultaneously grabbing the weapon, spinning behind the Noose agent, then using the shotgun barrel like a club to smash the back of his head in! Another swing wipes out Pistol agent. Bad Dude, now with a clear shot, aims his M-16. Nico blows him away with a double-barreled SHOTGUN BLAST. In a flash, Nico has spun to Zagon's surgical tool table, lifted a rzor-sharp scalpel and slashed the tape, freeing his hands. He yanks the choke cable off his neck --

ZAGON - AGAINST WALL On his feet again. He reaches swiftly to the floor, snatches up his famous knife. Nico confronts him -- face battered, bloody -- shaking, battling internal spasms.

	Can you feel the chemicals, cherry? You can't fight 'em much longer --
	</DIALOGUE>
<NICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Long enough to finish you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sweating, half-spitting, Zagon slashes at Nico like an animal -- Nico traps the knife, and enters, smashes Zagon in the face with one lightning blow. We see Zagon's nose and face completely cave in. Nico comes under Zagon's elbow, the arm that still holds the knife clamping it in a vise-like grip and bending it backwards, slowly, against the joint -- which now starts to rip in half. Zagon is screaming and cursing, writhing in agony -- The drugs have hit Nico full force now. He's weakening, his eyes are starting to roll. Zagon tries one last surge of strength to save himself; it almost seems he'll wriggle free when: the elbow JOINT SNAPS in half with a sicken- ing sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the joint hangs, dangling grotesquely, Nico reaches up around Zagon's neck, still holding the dangling limb with one arm. He begins to now do to Zagon's neck what he did to his arm. We hear a terminal CRACK. Zagon's body crumples to the floor. Nico, in delirium, staggers toward the door -- INT. HOTEL LOBBY - REAR STAIRWELL - NIGHT

A woman at a pay phone. She turns, drops the receiver in shock as -- NICO

bursts, delirious, from the stairwell door! MAIN LOBBY - FRONT ENTRANCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A commotion as Lukich, Agent Neeley and Jackson, arm in a sling, race in from their car. MAIN LOBBY - REAR - NICO weaves wildly forward. He drops to his knees. Guests react in astonishment and horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACKSON is the first to spot Nico. She runs up to him as he collapses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICO looks at Jackson. LUKICH AND NEELEY reach Nico and Jackson.

<DIRECTION>
NICO passes out in Jackson's arms. Behind them we see a banner, announcing Senator Harrison's address. From the ballroom we hear CHEERS and APPLAUSE. A fiery address is being finished inside. The senator is now leaving. FULL SHOT - LOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Total confusion. Guests staring everywhere. From a side office, a man with a medical bag comes running. The senator sees the group around Nico.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT. FADE IN ON:

EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Press vans outside; a crush of cars, reporters, neighbors. Newsmen are trying to gain access to the house, held back by several cops and some of Nico's more strapping relatives.

BUICK STATION WAGON escorted by two police motorcycles, pulls in. The press surrounds it as Lukich, Neeley, Lieutenant Strozah and Jackson, her arm in a sling, disembark from the car. SECOND CAR

pulls up. Neeley walks over and opens the door as a court stenographer, carrying her transcription machine case, steps out -- followed by a federal judge, CLAYTON ALSPAUGH and SENATOR ERNEST HARRISON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REPORTERS shove mikes and cameras at the senator and the judge, shouting questions. Lukich, Neeley and Strozah clear a path for them.

INT. NICO'S HOUSE - DAY Nico, propped up on the couch, looking like hell, but de- finitely conscious and in full command of his faculties. Sara, Jackson, and Rosa beside him. TV

NICO looks up as the real Senator Harrison, Judge Alspaugh and the others enter the room. TV SOUND DOWN. Harrison stops before Nico, taking a moment to look with respect and ad- miration at the man propped up on the pillows.
</DIRECTION>
<SENATOR_HARRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Detective Toscani. I wanted to personally thank you. You are making it possible for a sliver of truth to finally come out.

He holds out his hand. Nico takes it. The senator gestures to Judge Alspauch.

	Your Honor.

The Judge nods to his stenographer, who swiftly sets up her equipment, takes a seat. Rosa makes a face at Branca, who rises, clearing a seat for the Judge. Sara moves in tight beside Nico.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE_ALSPAUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure you're feeling well enough?
