EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT - (2003)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The night is stillborn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without sound or movement and nothing is in definition. All we see are degrees of blackness in this unlit world. The vague impressions of an African village in the void... a ragged line of tukuls (straw huts)... a bicycle propped against a mud wall... a soccer ball in the dirt...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUKUL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we find a Sudanese family asleep on reed mats. A mother, father and their two boys. The younger boy we'll come to know as "WILLIAM" (9). His older brother "CHRISTOPHER" (12) curled next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And slowly the blackness begins to shift... an otherworldly light seeping in from someplace far off... shadows contorting in a ghostly orange flicker... images emerging... the silhouettes of men coming into this village carrying flaming torches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUKUL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The family still sound asleep, oblivious to the torch glow coming from outside, and suddenly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCREAMING! -- GUNSHOTS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The family bolts awake, moving to their feet as the door to their tukul SLAMS open -- THREE soldiers from the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) coming in carrying AK47's -- shouting in Arabic -- "Get up! Get up!" -- the FATHER stepping forward -- holding up his hands -- "Don't shoot!" --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAK! KAK! KAK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And he's gunned down in cold blood. The soldiers grab the mother and boys and begin to drag them out of the tukul -- but WILLIAM breaks free -- scrambles deeper into the room --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SOLDIER going after him -- WILLIAM darting behind a stack of storage boxes knocking them to the ground -- frantically burrowing into the corner -- trying to get away but it's useless -- THE SOLDIER grabs his feet and begins to pull him out -- WILLIAM KICKING WILDLY -- digging his nails into the dirt -- and as he's dragged out of the corner he reaches out... inadvertently grabs a FADED PHOTOGRAPH which has fallen on the ground...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHAOS! -- PANDEMONIUM! -- the black sky ablaze in apocalyptic fire --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
families yanked out of their burning tukuls by LRA rebels -- the adult males of this village shot dead or bludgeoned to death -- the women and children forced into the center of the village -- huddled together and weeping --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and now we see WILLIAM hauled out -- his captor shouting to another soldier -- pointing to WILLIAM'S mother and she's pulled from the group and forced onto her knees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and WILLIAM is brought in front of her -- his captor saying something in Arabic as he hands him a club -- "Kill her!" -- WILLIAM shaking his head `no' -- tossing the club in the dirt and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRACKKK! -- WILLIAM is hit with the butt of a rifle -- goes down -- blood streaming down his face as he's pulled back up to his feet -- crying -- shaking with fear...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and then he sees his mother staring up at him... and despite the hell unfolding around them we see a moment here between mother and son... something calm and reassuring in the way she's looking at him now... her eyes full of love... and pity... for her child in this terrible moment... and before we see how this ends we --
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - RURAL PENNSYLVANIA - DAY - (AUGUST/1998)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we see SAM CHILDERS coming down a corridor toward us, dressed in jailhouse orange and flanked by a guard. He's stocky, 32 years old, with a biker's handlebar moustache. On the surface he appears good- looking... even handsome if the light is right... but his face is tricky... always changing... behind the quick smile, around his dark eyes, in the taut muscles of his neck we see violence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRISON RECEIVING AND RELEASING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a CLERK handing Sam a prison issue tub full of his personal affects. He takes out his clothes, digs out a leather wallet, a watch, some silver rings and a lighter.

Sam and the biker chick crammed into this dirty stall, Skynard pounding through the walls.

Snow piled up on the windowsills and it's cold as shit outside. Sam passed out on the couch and this guy looks like hell.

Thinner than the last time we saw him, skin sallow and drawn tight over his face. He stirs awake, sees Paige playing by herself on the floor next to him. She sees that he's awake, picks up her doll, and quietly goes outside without saying a word.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM SUDDENLY JUMPS IN THE BACKSEAT -- wrestling with the drifter -- fighting wild -- elbowing him in the face and somehow the blade is in his hand now -- and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick!

He stabs him six times in the gut. The drifter HOWLING in pain.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

Donnie's car skidding off the shoulder of the road, back door popping open and the Drifter's body dumped into the dirt. The car PEELS OUT, accelerates, tail lights disappearing into the dark.

Lynn moving down the hall... toward a sliver of light coming from under the closed bathroom door... gently pushing it open to see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam standing at the sink... covered in blood... frantically trying to clean himself up... trying to wash the sin from his skin and clothes but it's useless... and the sense we get is that we're staring at a man at the edge of an abyss... set to swallow him whole... terrified... shaking...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</PASTOR_KRAUSE>
<DIRECTION>
Three or four people moving to their feet, making their way up to the altar. Lynn turns to Sam, their eyes meet. He looks hesitant, unsure. She gives him a reserved little smile, nods her head slightly as if saying "you can do this"...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And in her look he finds strength, gets up, slowly makes his way to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRONT ALTAR

And now we see Sam on his knees in the baptismal tank. The water almost up to his waist. Pastor Krause kneeling behind him.

It's late and we see Lynn sitting at the kitchen table alone. Sam has not come home and she is clearly worried. And then we hear a car pulling up outside, door opening and closing, and Sam coming into the trailer.

<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry I'm late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn staring at him, trying to read this man's face but he's not looking at her. Avoiding her gaze. Did he use? Is he high? And then she sees a PINPRICK OF DRIED BLOOD on his shirtsleeve. Her face contorting almost imperceptibly. Her worst fear realized. Relapse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And she moves to him without saying a word... lifts up his arm and unbuttons the cuff of his shirt... slowly pushing up his shirtsleeve to discover a NEEDLE PRICK in his arm...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and then he pulls out a $20 bill and hands it to her.

INT. CHURCH - DAY - (AUGUST/2002)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two years later and we're watching a congregation finish a Sunday hymn. Sam, Lynn, Daisy, and Paige (10) in the crowd listening to Pastor Krause.
</DIRECTION>
<PASTOR_KRAUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Today we are blessed with a special guest. It's my pleasure to welcome Pastor Relling from the Kilangire Christian Ministry in Uganda, Africa. Pastor...

</PASTOR_KRAUSE>
<DIRECTION>
Polite applause as a tall, white South African man named PAUL RELLING steps up to the pulpit, and in a deep Afrikaner accent he BEGINS --
</DIRECTION>
<RELLING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you Pastor Krause, and thank you brothers and sisters for inviting me into this house of the Lord.

And we see Sam in this sea of faces, listening.

<DIRECTION>
INT. FOYER - CHURCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parishioners slowly filing out of the church after service. Lynn, Paige, and a few other women chatting by the entrance.

And now Lynn looks over her shoulder and sees Sam talking with Paul Relling off to the side, just the two of them in a corner, deep in discussion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHILDERS HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first thing we notice is the relative "opulence" of this place... deep shag, new color TV, matching sectional sofa... the rural idea of making it. Sam, Lynn, Daisy and Paige at the dinner table eating. Sam in his own world, oblivious to the MINOR CONVERSATION until --

<DIRECTION>
Two weeks later and we're in the rural countryside outside Kampala, Uganda. Sam on the roof of a bombed out school building with other white VOLUNTEERS, working.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam looks below to see a dozen black men dressed in the ragged fatigues of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA). Each is carrying an AK 47 and standing guard at various points around this compound. The lead soldier is a man named DENG. ANGLE three others we'll come to know as "NINETEEN", "MARCO" and "A.J."

There is a certain reserved nobility in this man, in the way he carries himself and speaks. An unwavering strength and self-reliance born from a lifetime of war and struggle.

INT. DORM - MISSION - NIGHT

Fifteen or twenty volunteers lounging on cots in this dorm, playing cards, talking, smoking. And we find Sam off from the group, on his bunk, reading The Bible...

EXT. DIRT ROAD - RURAL UGANDA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dirt road cutting through grassy plain stretching in every direction... and we see a BRIGHT YELLOW BUS speeding toward us in the distance, kicking a rooster tail of dust high into the air... and as it gets closer we see 15 or 20 men piled onto the roof, hanging on for dear life as this bus bounces over the road...

<DIRECTION>
INT. BUS - DRIVING - RURAL UGANDA - SAME

<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They always drive this fast?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DENG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Traveling is the most dangerous time in Sudan. If the rebels find you on the open road it would be very bad.

</DENG>
<DIRECTION>
An awkward silence as Deng stares out the window. Sam wanting to connect here, but Deng is reticent.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got kids, Deng?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DENG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I have no children.

</DENG>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DENG>

</DENG>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's where your family is?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Unyama is about two hours from here. We will stop there for lunch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENG>
<DIRECTION>
Deng turns and looks out the window again, silent, quietly watching the land blur past. And Sam says nothing more, intuitively feeling this man's need to be alone in the moment. A great, lost giant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNYAMA REFUGEE CAMP, UGANDA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dense sea of people. 20,000 displaced refugees living on top of each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Life is lived out in the open here... women bent over brightly colored washtubs sloshing clothes in soapy water... smoke from giant cooking pots drifting into the air... semi-clothed children, some with even younger children on their hips, running everywhere. The poverty and hopelessness is overwhelming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we see Sam and Deng walking through the camp...
</DIRECTION>
<DENG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Muslim North has tried to kill the Christian South for 30 years. Two million have lost their lives...

EXT. MEDICAL AREA - UNYAMA REFUGEE CAMP, UGANDA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A row of wood sheds and worn nylon tents marks the hospital area. Each enclosure jammed with the desperately sick. Battle-weary AID WORKERS move among them, doing what they can, caring for the ones who are most desperately ill.
</DIRECTION>
<DENG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cholera and Malaria are everywhere, there is little food and not enough UN soldiers to protect everyone. Even here they worry the LRA will attack at night.

And another SPLA soldier comes up to Deng --

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Sam... I'll be five minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENG>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Course, do what you gotta do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Deng leaves and now Sam is completely alone, taking in this mire of humanity all around him. And suddenly there's COMMOTION! -- two aid workers coming into this tent carrying a WOMAN on a stretcher. One of the aid workers looking around -- a white woman -- mid 30's -- her name is AGNETE CLOSSON, Regional Director of Doctors Without Borders. She sees Sam across the tent.
</DIRECTION>
<AGNETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. You. Can you help please?

Sam moving to her --

<AGNETE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One, two, three...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGNETE>
<DIRECTION>
And they swing the woman over to a cot... but as they do the sheer piece of blood-stained muslin that was covering her face falls away... and we see that she has been mutilated... her lips cut off of her face...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and now a DOCTOR sweeps into the tent and begins to work on her. Sam and Agnete pushed back, away from the action. Sam still shocked by what he's seen.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to her face?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<AGNETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The rebels cut off her lips because she argued. These are Kony's orders.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGNETE>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's Kony?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Agnete, suddenly suspicious, takes an appraising look of Sam.

<SAM>

EXT. NIMULE, SUDAN - DUSK

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHT

Sam has no response... and Deng lights his cigarette... and suddenly we hear voices... through the open window... children's voices... Sam peering into the darkness but seeing nothing... only empty streets... and then one-by-one... out of the darkness like apparitions... we see children coming up the street carrying bedrolls... some of them singing spiritual hymns as they walk... laughing as children do... at first just a dozen or so... and then more... fifty... a hundred...

<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

</SAM>
<DENG>

Sam, Deng, and a few other SPLA SOLDIERS jammed into the flatbed of this truck, carrying heavy weapons, bouncing fast over this open dirt road... featureless savanna FADING into sporadic mud huts... the outskirts of a VILLAGE in the distance... and thin columns of black smoke twisting into the air...

Complete devastation. 30 or 40 bodies mutilated and stacked outside smoking tukuls. Some children already here, on their knees, weeping next to the corpses of their parents. If you could smell the air it would smell of burnt flesh and death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam silent, aghast, just staring at the horror all around him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and now we see GREEN SHORTS and his sister arriving at the village... moving to their family's tukul and discovering their mother and father piled outside. Naked and burned alive. And the sister falls onto her mother's corpse and begins to wail as GREEN SHORTS stands there -- frozen -- staring down at his dead parents -- and suddenly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVEMENT! -- from inside the tukul... a small dog... a family pet... darting into the open... running across the dirt... GREEN SHORTS going after it, yelling his name...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam watching the boy chasing after his dog, rounding a corner out of sight...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... for a moment...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... just the boy's voice calling after his dog... and then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOOOM!

<DIRECTION>
A muffled burst -- in the distance -- Sam, Deng, and the other soldiers running out of the village toward the explosion...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DIRT ROAD - YEI, SUDAN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Sam, Deng, and the others arriving at the source of the explosion. And we see GREEN SHORTS laying on the side of the road... cut in half by a land mine... his dead eyes wide open with surprise...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and Sam drops to his knees... lifting what's left of the boy into his arms and rocking him back and forth... and we watch as a terrible sadness overtakes him... something happening here... a fierce and overwhelming burden dropping into this man as he holds this dead boy... in the dirt... in the middle of this savage world...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and as Sam puts it, his "life changed forever" in this moment... and we see him looking up to the heavens...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
tears streaming down his face... saying something we can't hear, but it's a promise... to God...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To save the children of Sudan.

INT. PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bright, fluorescent corridor filled with garish advertising and harried travelers rushing to make planes... and we find Sam coming down this concourse, carrying his duffle bag, his face expressionless. He reaches a revolving door but stops... doesn't pass through... sees Lynn, Paige, and his mother waiting for him on the other side... their happy, expectant faces...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But they don't see him yet... and he just stays here... hidden... watching them through the glass... and as Sam puts it, at this moment he realized he would never look at his own family the same way again... in some way lost to them forever after what he saw on the side of road in Yei...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and finally he forces a smile, pushes through the revolving door and we watch, from this side of the glass, as Paige leaps into his arms... Lynn and Daisy moving to him too, embracing him, welcoming him home.

Quiet. Just Sam on this porch all alone, been here for some time, eyes far off, images in his mind he can't seem to shake.

And he steps into the yard... walking along the side of the house... just moving... trying to shed this feeling like snakeskin...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and he comes to something on the ground which stops him dead in his tracks... something we don't see yet... and slowly he reaches down and picks up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LITTLE DOLL. One of Paige's toys. Soiled and faded and left in the dirt. And we watch him holding this forgotten doll... and what we see on his face ain't pretty... his world collapsing out from under him... trying to keep rein on his emotions... a battle he's losing.

EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANGE - SUDAN - DAY - THREE MONTHS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What we're looking at is the modest beginning of The Angels of East Africa Children's Orphanage. A cluster of tukuls and 2 or 3 rudimentary wood buildings built on the dirt Sam first let trickle between his fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we see life already finding it's place within these bamboo walls. Acholi WORKERS laying brick on what will eventually become a schoolhouse and chapel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we find Sam with two or three small CHILDREN who are crying for no apparent reason. He's on his knees, trying his best to soothe them but he is way out of his depth here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now we see Deng in the b.g. approaching with a powerfully built Ugandan woman in her late 40's.
</DIRECTION>

<SAM>

	Good to meet you Betty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Betty, no reaction. Just the incessant crying of the children in the b.g.
</DIRECTION>
<DENG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is knowing that you need someone to run the orphanage.

</DENG>
<SAM>

Betty hears this, turns to the crying children and softly says --

And we see a handful of SPLA soldiers stationed around the perimeter of the compound, standing guard. Sam and Deng sitting next to a lantern by the front gate.

And Deng smiles brightly. Sam realizing he's been played. And Deng starts to LAUGH. A deep, guttural, infectious laugh. Sam joining him, and we sense that at this moment these two have become friends. And gradually their laughter subsides, and it's quiet again.
</DIRECTION>

INT. SUV - DRIVING - DEEP IN THE BUSH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bombing down this rutted, red dirt road. The engine at full tilt. Sam, Deng, Nineteen, Marco, and A.J. jammed into this truck riding in dead silence... AK47's bouncing between their knees... only the sound of the WAR SONG playing as we watch these men... a grave stillness on their faces... thinking of what men do just before their own death.

EXT. DIRT ROAD - DEEP IN THE BUSH - DAY

With two ADULT REBELS in this Jeep as they drive down this road past bombed-out vehicles... and in the distance we see the smoldering wreckage of a transport truck on the side of the road... the thick smoke hanging over the road like a black curtain... blocking out vision of the road ahead...

SAM -- standing in the middle of the road ahead of us shouldering a RPG -- the ADULT REBELS see him just as --

EXT. BUSH - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Sam, Deng, A.J. and the others hustling through the smoke and finding cover. From Sam's vantage point he sees rebels hiding behind the disabled truck for cover -- shooting back -- a withering firefight -- the big .30 cal ROARING offscreen but the truck is protecting the rebels -- no clear shot --

William and the other child soldiers here with two ADULT REBELS -- crouched behind the truck for cover -- the ADULT REBELS returning fire, but the children aren't moving, scared shitless.

Marco laying down suppression fire as Sam sprints across the road -- advancing on the transport truck -- firing his AK from the hip -- bullets zinging past him -- he dives behind a berm and finds himself next to Deng. Neither man says a word as they jam fresh mags into their AK's, gunfire erupting all around them.

The adult rebels continue fighting -- alternately popping up from behind the truck and returning fire. The ADULT REBEL realizing that William and the other boys still aren't fighting --

RPG streaking directly at him -- hitting the ground short --

<DIRECTION>
BA-WHOOOM! --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND OUR VISION EXPLODES TO WHITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a long beat... only silence... and then slowly the white begins to fade... and we see Sam flat on his back... eyes blinking open... shell-shocked... staring up at blue sky... and then a shadow coming over him... someone stepping into his POV...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
it's William, hands held open in surrender, staring curiously at this strange white man laying in the dirt... and now Deng and Marco appear next to Sam and help him to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we see the battle is over. The remaining child soldiers slowly emerging from behind the LRA truck... laying down their weapons and walking toward Sam... joining William... staring at this white man in front of them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... William reaches into his pocket and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

INT. CHILDERS HOUSE - DAY

EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we see Sam with a group of men working in the sweltering heat... laying brick... adding another room to the children's dorm...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and he squints into the distance, sees a cloud of dust on the horizon, cars coming closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAIN GATE - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seven or eight heavily armed vehicles coming through the gate. Maybe 20 or 30 SPLA soldiers guarding a black SUBURBAN in the middle of this motorcade. Nineteen waving his hand, yelling as the cars pass --

<NINETEEN>
<DIRECTION>
(ARABIC)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Garang! -- It's Garang! --
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINETEEN>
<DIRECTION>
Palpable excitement ripples through the compound... Sam's soldiers grabbing their weapons and forming a ragged line near the Suburban as it stops...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... the back door to the Suburban opens and a black man, dressed in shirtsleeves and slacks, steps out. The same man we saw giving the fiery speech on the little outdoor TV in Nimule earlier -- JOHN GARANG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam turns to Deng --
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's this guy?

EXT. COMPOUND - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam and Garang walking through the middle of camp, trailed by a squad of SPLA bodyguards and camp children...
</DIRECTION>
<GARANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They call you Preacher. Is this what I should call you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARANG>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam is fine.

</SAM>
<GARANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hear what you have done for the SPLA and I am grateful.

</GARANG>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can thank God for his blessins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<GARANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, we can. How many children do you look after, Sam?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARANG>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Couple hundred with us here. Feed another thousand a day from nearby villages. Anyone who shows up hungry gets a meal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
And they continue through the camp. A few of the children running up to Garang, touching the cuff of his shirt, then sprinting away...
</DIRECTION>
<GARANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you are doing is noble, but too dangerous. I must advise you to stop risking your life in our struggle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARANG>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until someone starts fightin for these children, I'm the one that's gonna do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<GARANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are stubborn, aren't you?

</GARANG>
<SAM>

	As a mule.

</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Garang smiling, an instant affinity for this man.
</DIRECTION>
<GARANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You and I come from very different worlds, but we are not so dissimilar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARANG>
<DIRECTION>
And another child runs up to Garang, touching him, and then sprints away giggling...
</DIRECTION>
<GARANG>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I founded the SPLA in order to fight for the future of Sudan because nobody else would. We fight for freedom from the government in Khartoum, for the right to vote, and for the right to worship any god one may choose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARANG>
<DIRECTION>
More children running up... Garang touching their heads...
</DIRECTION>
<GARANG>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But most important to me is our struggle for the children. Their laughter has been lost to this country for far too long.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are Peace Talks scheduled for the end of August in Naivashu. I'd like you to come as my guest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARANG>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talkin bout peace in a room somewhere is a waste of time. You gotta go out and make it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<GARANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are correct, but we must fight them at every level. Part of my battle is waged in those rooms. We must talk of peace, but keep our rifles ready for war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARANG>
<DIRECTION>
Sam turning to him, coming to an understanding here. Realizing that both of them are warriors in the same fight.
</DIRECTION>
<GARANG>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe together you and I can make Sudan free once again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARANG>
<DIRECTION>
And now we see they have arrived at the brick chapel in the middle of the compound. Garang turning to him, eyes suddenly becoming dark...
</DIRECTION>
<GARANG>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is a cost for freedom, Sam. A price for the future of these people. Some pay with their lives, others pay in different ways.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My only hope is that your cost is not too great.
	</DIALOGUE>

EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY

</BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
And we see a hundred little eyes popping open, staring at something off screen, confused for a split second at what they're looking at.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE to see a PLAYGROUND: two or three battered swingsets, a few see-saws, and a jungle gym soldered out of metal pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the kids SPRINTING for it, climbing all over the jungle gym like ants... hitting the swing-sets... and then we hear it... something we realize we haven't heard in this place before... the sound of laughter... children losing themselves in play. Innocence flooding back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now we see Nineteen, A.J. and two other SPLA soldiers standing around a BUNNY BOUNCER... staring at it quizzically... talking in Arabic, trying to decide what this thing is... and then A.J., the bravest, slings his AK onto his back and carefully straddles the bouncer... pulling up his long legs and resting his feet on the pegs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And he begins to bob back and forth... holding onto the bunny's ears with his big hands... the other soldiers starting to laugh as he bobs faster... and then we see A.J's smile... a million watt smile on this guy... the first time he's played like this since he was a boy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DORM - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY - LATER

<DIRECTION>
Hours later and we see Sam pushing a couple of the smaller children on the swingset. Deng approaches...

<DENG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some of the child soldiers say there is a bounty on your life. That Kony is offering money for your nose and ears.

Sam, no reaction, just keeps swinging the children...

</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Deng clearly worried for his friend, but doesn't press the issue. And now Sam notices William off from the group, sitting on the ground by himself, not playing.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said anything yet?

William, no response.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know sometimes it helps to tell somebody what you got locked up inside, know what I mean?

<DIRECTION>
William, no reaction whatsoever. Something dawning on Sam in this moment...
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have no idea what I'm sayin, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
William just stares back at him and Sam realizes he doesn't speak English. And they both just sit here for a moment, silent, staring at the children playing on the playground. And then Sam, feeling the need to unburden himself, begins to talk...
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I done a lotta things I ain't proud of. Hurt a lotta people. Truth is, helpin you kids is about the only good thing I ever done in this life.

</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
William watching him quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm scared. Scared one day I'll close my eyes to all this and make it somebody else's problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like everybody else in this world.

And he stops and it's silent between them again. William just sitting there quietly. And Sam looks up to the sky... feeling his life washing over him... his burden... this fear.

EXT. RAVINE RIDGE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
We're at the top of the ravine now and we see Sam and the others moving toward the location of the SNIPER...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

EXT. NIMULE - SUDAN, AFRICA - DAY - DAYS LATER
</DIRECTION>

We're hit by a crush of people, a thousand black faces moving past us and all the noise and confusion of this busy border town. And we find Sam, Deng, and Nineteen here loading supplies into the back of the SUV.
</DIRECTION>

Sam turning to find Agnete, the aid worker, approaching him.
</DIRECTION>
<AGNETE>

	I'm just tryin to help these people. Same as you.

</SAM>
<AGNETE>

	War upon war does not fix what is broken here. The history of this country is filled with righteous killers. That is how it always begins, with men thinking they are killing for the right reasons.

	I got a 200 kids who are gonna sleep safe tonight and wake up tomorrow mornin to a bowl of hot food. Right or not, that's all the reason I need.

Sam looking at her and there's a warning in what she says next... about violence corrupting men... consuming them...

EXT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam sitting outside his tukul alone, tearing open an airmail package and pulling out another VIDEOCASSETTE, slides it into his videocamera, hits play --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE SMALL SCREEN we see a school production... children dressed in costumes shuffling across the stage... lines being spoken by rote...and then the awkward entrance of Paige speaking her lines... but instead of finding joy in this sweet moment he finds heartache... the distance from his family... from their innocence... simply too great to bear in this moment...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and then he hears giggling... and he realizes two young orphan BOYS have snuck up behind him and are looking at the screen over his shoulder... and Sam holds it up so they can see better and now more children gather around -- maybe 10 or 15 kids -- pointing at the small screen... giggling and chatting in Arabic...

Deng behind the wheel driving -- Sam in the passenger seat -- Marco, Nineteen, and a third SPLA SOLDIER jammed in the back --
</DIRECTION>
<DENG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENG>
<DIRECTION>
Far ahead we see three sets of HEADLIGHTS coming towards us on the road -- just bouncing white dots on the horizon -- and silently they begin to check their mags and weapons -- preparing for battle --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and the headlights get closer -- Deng not slowing down -- and we realize we are on a collision course with this convoy -- and finally we see MUZZLE FLASHES in the distance -- and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUNK!, THUNK!, THUNK!

<DIRECTION>
Machine gun strafe hitting the front and side of the truck --

Sam and Nineteen leaning through the open windows as Deng drives -- leveling their AK's and firing --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRAKAKAKAKAK! KRAKAKAKAKAK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now the approaching convoy LIGHTS UP with RETURN FIRE! -- Sam and Nineteen hanging out the windows blasting back -- Deng stepping on the gas, accelerating toward the convoy like some hellish game of "chicken"(reminiscent of Sam and Donnie's wild ride with the Drifter in scene #29) --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and we watch as the headlights barrel towards us at full bore -- BULLETS POPPING across the windshield of the truck -- SAM AND NINETEEN IN CONSTANT FIRE MODE -- THE SOUND DEAFENING -- headlights blown out on both trucks and now we're plunged into total blackness - - only the wild-strobe of machine gun fire lighting up the night as these trucks slam towards each other -- and finally --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LRA CONVOY CAREENS OFF THE ROAD AND BOTTOMS OUT IN A DITCH

Deng skidding to a stop as Sam, Nineteen, and the third SPLA SOLDIER pile out of the truck -- firing and advancing on the caravan by foot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DITCH - SIDE OF DIRT ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rebels jumping out of their disabled trucks -- Sam and his men flanking them -- blasting one of the trucks until the engine bursts into flames -- cutting down the rebels before they even knew what hit them. And then there's a great stillness. The quiet of death...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Sam coming out of the blackness with his AK leveled... moving toward the flaming wreckage of the caravan... Deng, Nineteen, and Marco moving to each rebel body... making sure they're dead.
</DIRECTION>

Marco hustling up with a spotlight -- Sam switching it on as Deng rips the canvas back and we see --

And Sam moves to the first child in the group -- a little girl -- reaching out to her but she pulls back.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DENG>
<DIRECTION>
And slowly the little girl steps forward... and Sam gently unbuttons her shirt and begins to examine her little body... turning her around in the harsh light of the SUV's headlamps... and he finds five infected gashes on her back... whip wounds... already turning gangrene... and he gently pushes her toward Deng...
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put her in the truck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
And Sam continues with the group... assessing each child's health... tenderly running his hands over their broken, starved bodies... somehow calculating which ones are worse off and pulling them out of line...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and he reaches the last child and we see that the SUV is now PACKED with children... huddled into every available corner... 10 children in total. There's no more room.

EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A red sun breaking the horizon. It's ONE HOUR LATER and we see the SUV blasting through the front gate of the compound and skidding to a stop -- DOORS POPPING OPEN -- SOLDIERS JUMPING OFF THE ROOF -- Betty and the other camp women already pulling the children out of the truck... ushering them into the infirmary...

Two hours into this return trip and it's silent in this cab. Deng checking a handheld GPS, clocking their position, and then they see it -- through the windshield -- in the distance --

Rising in a thin column a half-mile away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD - DEEP IN SUDAN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scene of the ambush the night before. Burned out pickup trucks and dead LRA rebels strewn in the dirt. Sam's SUV arriving and he's the first one out... whistling for the children but they're nowhere to be seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now we realize that the column of smoke isn't coming from the bombed-out LRA trucks -- it's coming from behind them. Sam moving around the back of the TRANSPORT TRUCK to see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THIRTEEN LITTLE BODIES STACKED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The children Sam left behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burned alive by the LRA an hour earlier.

Sam just standing here, staring at this smoldering pile of children. Starting to go someplace very dark. And as he puts it, most of him died in the bush this morning too.

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

INT. PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - NIGHT - (JUNE/2005)

And we see a line of American TRAVELERS waiting to be checked through customs... BUSINESS MEN in their rumpled suits carrying briefcases, PARENTS with their tired children returning from vacation... and Sam standing in this line with his duffel bag, somehow cut-off from the life all around him. And the CUSTOMS OFFICER waves him forward... Sam handing him his passport...

<DIRECTION>
EXT. PASSENGER PICK-UP - PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's raining and we see Sam sitting on a bench waiting, staring o.s. at a SKYCAB TROLLEY. Two men working through a pile of BLACK GOLF BAGS, heaped on top of each other like bodies, tossing them one-by- one into the back of the trolley...

30 or 40 adults and children here eating the last meal of the day. And we see Sam in a corner, off from the rest of the group. And maybe it's just the lighting in here, but there's a darkness around him -- literally as if the space surrounding this man is devoid of light.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAK! KAK! KAK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His chest EXPLODES! -- three bursts from behind -- the other rebels spinning toward the gunshots as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRATAKRATAKRATAKRAK!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A firestorm of lead -- Sam, Deng, and the rest of his team coming onto the bridge shooting -- rebels scrambling for cover but it's too late -- dropping as they try and sprint away -- and in an instant it's all over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Agnete sees Sam, rushes toward him, but when he looks at her she freezes. He is completely unrecognizable to her in this moment -- a killer's thousand-yard stare -- barely human -- more like a machine than a man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And he moves past her down the bridge, to the LRA LEADER on the ground who is still alive. And he puts the barrel of his rifle against the rebel's head and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOOOM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's dead. Just like that. And he continues walking up the bridge. And we see Agnete, Deng and the other soldiers having just witnessed this.

INT. INFIRMARY - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
The Rebel looks at the photograph but says nothing, just shakes his head... and he looks off, his thousand yard stare inscrutable...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And William simply folds the photograph back up and slips it into his pocket... but he doesn't leave... he sits here a moment longer... quietly... thinking... and then...

And we see something happening in this hardened rebel... his eyes filling with a distant memory... a sadness... and slowly he nods his head again.

<DIRECTION>
And we stay here with these two lost souls sitting next to each other... silent... connected by a shared history and anguish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY - LATER

Sam sitting alone, lost to the world around him. Deng approaches. Neither one acknowledging the other for a long beat until...

INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

And we see Sam here in the dark... moonlight filtering in through the thatched roof... like shards of glass cutting through the blackness... and he doesn't look right here... soul worn thin... eyes hollow... starting to go someplace very bad...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... IMAGES FLASHING IN HIS HEAD... babies burned and screaming... Donnie in his coffin... and we realize we're watching something here... his world starting to cave in on him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and he drops against his cot... distraught... tears in his eyes and this man is breaking... and suddenly we see a gun in his hand... finger curling around the trigger as he puts it to his head... eyes closing against the world... and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE HEAR A KNOCK AT HIS DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam frozen... still holding the gun... and slowly the door pushes open and we hear soft footsteps shuffling into this dark room...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and William steps into the light, sees Sam here on the ground with the gun in his hand... and slowly he moves next to him, sitting on the cot without saying a word... just the two of them here for a moment... and then slowly he begins in perfect English...
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>

	I remember my parents when I sleep. I see them in my dreams sometimes.

	My father was big like you. They shot him. We were so scared. Then the rebels gave me a club and told me if I didn't kill my mother they would shoot my brother and me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
And William pauses in his story... lost in this memory... his face becoming a mask of pain... but no tears... there are no more tears in this young man left to be shed... and so he continues...
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I refused, but my mother told me to swing hard... that I must make her proud...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so I did. I made her proud.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
And now William looks down at Sam... staring at this man on the ground... and he reaches out and gently touches Sam's head... a moment of tenderness for both of them... an act of love.... these two broken souls finding each another here... and William says...
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we allow ourselves to become full of hate then they've won. We must not let them take our hearts. This is the most important thing.

And Sam sets the gun down and reaches out to William, pulls him into an embrace... holding him close... and we know that without a doubt this boy has saved this man's life.

EXT. COMPOUND - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANGE - NEXT DAY

<DIRECTION>
And we see the soldiers at their posts... Betty and the other Camp Women cleaning clothes and preparing food... and we see most of the children loitering around a tree in the shade, sullen, not playing on the playground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then we see Sam coming into the courtyard kicking a soccer ball... some of the children see him and point... and slowly the entire camp begins to notice Sam kicking the soccer ball awkwardly by himself out in the open... Betty and the other women stopping their chores and watching him, speaking to one another in Arabic...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deng and the other soldiers staring as Sam pops the ball into the air and bounces it off his head...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and now a couple of the smaller kids sprint for him and he kicks them the ball... and slowly the rest of the children join in the fun... kicking the ball back and forth... an impromptu soccer game... and then we hear LAUGHTER again... joy flooding back into this place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deng watching with a big smile as this white man dances around these little children... a Pied Piper of joy... playing in the dirt.

We see a line of women along the riverbank in their colorful dresses... scrubbing pans and washing clothes... singing an ancient African spiritual as they work... the sun dropping pale red on the horizon...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we see Sam here too... alone with himself... sitting at the river's edge, watching the water rolling gently past... listening to the soft serenade of the women... the beauty of it all...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and then he gets up and walks into the river... and he kneels down so that water reaches his waist (reminiscent of his first baptism in scene #35)... and now the women on the riverbank stop their work, watching him as he closes his eyes and gently leans back... submitting to the water... and when he comes up again we see in his eyes that his soul has been saved in this simple act.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the women begin to shout their praise from the riverbank as we go...

AND THEN THE SOUND OF MEN

<DIRECTION>
A squad of LRA rebels coming through the scrub... William hiding under a bush, terrified... the men coming closer... no idea if they saw him or not... his mind racing... voices getting louder... starting to hyper-ventilate from the fear -- and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILLIAM BOLTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sprinting through the bush -- running for his life -- rebels see him -- yelling for him to stop -- chasing him down -- shooting their rifles into the air and he hits the ground in the fetal position -- too terrified to continue -- eyes clamped shut as 4 or 5 rebels surround him -- guns pointed at his head -- caught.

EXT. LRA CAMP - DEEP IN THE BUSH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William shoved through the bush... moving deeper into this rebel encampment... dark and otherworldly... figures moving around camp fires... laughing... men with little girls... their child wives... with pregnant bellies... and incongruously the sound of American rap music coming from a jambox somewhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The overriding sense we get from this place is one of `insanity.'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And William is dragged to a clearing next to a grouping of tents and he's kicked to the dirt... two other soldiers pinning him to the ground as a third grabs his feet and pulls off his shoes... William YELLING and now a handful of other LRA soldiers start to gather around... most of them only a few years older than him... watching as his ankles are bound together and placed on a wooden block...

<DIRECTION>
TWO ROOSTER-TAILS OF DUST COMING AT US

From different angles -- converging on the LRA convoy -- the Rebels see them and point -- they know what's coming and they begin to prepare for war --

THE ROOSTER-TAILS

Getting closer -- and then we see them --

SAM'S TWO TRUCKS

Bouncing over the terrain towards us -- coming fast -- and then --

<DIRECTION>
WOOOOSH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An RPG streaks toward the lead LRA truck and -- KABOOOM! -- the truck is blown off it's axles -- the other LRA trucks pulling off the road -- and suddenly we're in a withering firefight -- the roar of heavy weapons at full-tilt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM AND HIS MEN

Jumping out of their trucks and flanking the LRA convoy -- triangulating fire -- shredding the rebels -- blowing them back off their feet.

Sprinting through the bush -- edging around the LRA trucks -- finding a position on their weak side and locking an RPG into a launcher -- shouldering it -- aiming -- WOOOOSH! -- the missile streaking toward the second LRA jeep and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABOOOM!
</DIRECTION>

It's blasted into the air -- onto it's side -- rebels scurrying away from the wreckage -- still firing -- an absolute hail of lead -- AK's barking in every direction --

And we see Deng coming out of the bush to his right -- and then Nineteen to his left -- and they charge on the remaining rebels -- Sam providing covering fire -- a curtain of lead cutting through the enemy -- and just like that it's over -- Sam waving behind him --

<SAM>

"To this day, Sam Childers fights for the children of Sudan and Northern Uganda."

THE END
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LEGENDS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joseph Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army continue their reign of terror in Sudan and Northern Uganda.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amnesty International estimates that Kony and the LRA are responsible for over 400,000 murders and more than 40,000 child abductions. These children are tortured, raped, sold into sex slavery, and forced to take part in ritualized killing by LRA commanders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Islamic Government of Sudan continues to provide weapons and safe haven to Kony and the LRA as part of a deal to wage a proxy war against the predominately Christian South.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without pressure from the United States, this support will continue and more innocent children will be slaughtered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now you know.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As of 2011, Sam Childers has rescued over 800 children from the LRA. His `Angels of East Africa Orphanage' is home to more than 300 orphans, and feeds over 1200 meals a day to neighboring villagers in need.
