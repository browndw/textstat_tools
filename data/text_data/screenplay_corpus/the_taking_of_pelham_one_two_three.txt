:SC: EXT. NEW YORK CITY - BLOOMINGDALE'S - DAY

<DIRECTION>
The busy block between 59th and 60th-Streets in the middle of a weekday afternoon. Buses, taxis, trucks; shoppers, messengers, teenagers. In one corner of the screen the time is SUPERIMPOSED:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"1:52" Now a man (GREEN) is ZOOMED IN on -- little of his actual face is visible because of his thick white hair, large bushy white mustache, dark glasses and slouch hat. The rest of him is encased in a knee-length raincoat. He wears gloves and is carrying a large, brown-paper-covered package by a wooden handle attached to the twine securing it. The box has been addressed in black felt marker -- "Everest Printing Corp., 826. Lafayette St." -- and appears quite heavy. But Green has the gait of a man. younger than he appears. As he turns and heads down a flight of stairs, CAMERA ZOOMS IN even more to the single word on a sign:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"SUBWAY."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SUBWAY - 59TH ST. CHANGE BOOTH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A level above the locals, two above the express trains. Green appears and joins the line waiting to buy tokens. Wordlessly he shoves two coins under the grille, receives his token, moves on, drops it into the slot, pushes through the turnstile and heads for one of the descending stairways. CAMERA HOLDS on a sign identifying his choice:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"IRT. LEX. AVE. LOCAL. DOWNTOWN.."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - 59TH ST. DOWNTOWN LOCAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Green comes off the stairs and arrives on a line with a placard that hangs over the edge of the platform bearing the number "10", black on a white ground, indicating the point where the front of a ten-car train stops. Now the sound of a distant rumbling, growing louder, makes Green turn,.cross to the platform's edge, lean out over the track and peer into the darkness of the tunnel beyond the far end of the platform.

<DIRECTION>
SUBWAY TUNNEL - GREEN'S POV as the four lights -- amber and white markers over white sealed-beam headlights -- come into view and the train roars and clatters into the station. CAMERA PANS with the head car as it stops, its breaks sighing, and a pair of doors in EXTREME FOREGROUND, rattles open. CAMERA now MOVES forward, into the car, then TURNS and through the still-open door, focuses on the T.A. Cop, still standing on the platform, regarding Green (CAMERA).

The train stops, the doors open and Matson steps out, colliding with a very large man (BROW^?PN) who is in a hurry to get aboard. His face is adorned with a large, white, bushy mustache, dark glasses, a lot of white hair, a slouch hat and, covering the rest of him, a raincoat. He carries an outsized florist's box, big enough for several dozen- long-stemmed roses, under his. arm, and wears gloves.

Leaning back against the storm door. Now he picks up his valise, turns and looks through the door, across the platform between the cars, into the fifth car, and catches sight of Brown who nods, almost imperceptively. Grey makes no sign of recognition at all. He turns and starts forward through the car, heading for the third car. At the far end a MAN is standing in front of the door, leaning down to talk to a seated GIRL. Grey stops and waits a moment. Finally:

WIDER ANGLE Blue stands at the downtown end of the platform, near the number 10 placard, carrying a bulging canvas valpac in one hazed and a trombone case in the other. A rumbling sound is heard, building, until a train roars through on the northbound express track, its lights flashing between the pillars. In a moment it is gone and the sound dies. Now a young black,.dressed in the latest extravagant PIMP's fashions -- flaring double-knit trousers, three- inch heels, wide-lapeled jacket and white, extra-wide- brimmed hat, swaggers, loose-jointed, to a spot near Blue and waits, cool and relaxed.

WENTWORTH'S POV SHOOTING THROUGH the windshield (as the SUPERIMPOSED time continues to run: "3:12.26-27-28-29--") The tail-lights of the cycles are twinkling red'as they begin braking -- a tractor-trailer is stretched across the street, lining up its rear-end with the narrow opening of a loading bay, in preparation for backing into it.

to a stop but it is clear that the truck doesn't intend to as it bumps up onto the sidewalk, and starts for the opening. But it is now too narrow. The screeching brakes of the truck are heard as it starts to skid around, the panorama flashing by sickeningly and, perhaps, a crash and, perhaps, the scene flopping over as the truck, perhaps, rolls over onto one side.

	Bring charges against that nigger cop.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He waves and starts off, across the large room. The others watch him go.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAINMASTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With that mouth he eats?

The time is SUPERIMPOSED:

<DIRECTION>
"8:21"

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIPPIE'S POV - BLURRED Then coming into FOCUS -- a group of men (the Mayor, the Commissioner, Warren LaSalle and a DOCTOR) are standing looking down at the Hippie (CAMERA) lying in bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe he's awake now --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE including the Hippie in bed and a NEWS CAMERMAN standing by. The Mayor is wrapped. in a heavy overcoat, a woolen muffler and a fur hat with ear-muffs.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulations, Patrolman -- UH --

</MAYOR>
<COMMISSIONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Berry -- Robert G.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMMISSIONER>
<MAYOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Patrolman Berry -- all right if I call you Bob? You performed an act of extraordinary valor, Bob -- the people of the city of New York are in your debt.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(HE SNEEZES)
</DIRECTION>
<WARREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shake his hand, Nate --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Mayor reaches out to shake hands, but the Hippie is too weak to lift his -- so the Mayor picks it up from atop the covers and pumps it. A flashbulb pops from the Photo- grapher's camera. Then the Mayor sneezes again.
</DIRECTION>
<COMMISSIONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Splendid work, Berry -- the Department's very proud of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
I've already put you in for pro- motion.
</DIRECTION>
<HIPPIE>
<DIRECTION>
(WEAKLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, sir -- I only did what any other man on the force would've --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HIPPIE>
<MAYOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So long now, Bob -- hurry up and get well, will you, fella? And congratulations again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOR>
<HIPPIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, sir -- I only did what any other man on the force
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
But they're already moving toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He looks better than I do -- probably feels better, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Hippie's eyes slowly close as he goes back to sleep. The time is SUPERIMPOSED:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"9:03."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. TRANSIT AUTHORITY BLDG. - J AY ST. - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Prescott comes down the front steps, alone, wearing a raincoat against the night's chill. He starts off down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. FULTON ST. - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Most of the stores closed, their iron grills drawn, as Pres- cott walks along. He stops at a corner newsstand that's just being boarded up by an OLD WOMAN. He spots the Daily News headline -- "I.R.T. TRAIN HIJACKED!" -- and buys one.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know what's gonna go next? The Empire State Building.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_WOMAN>
<PRESCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(SMILING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't be surprised.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts off down the street again, having folded back the front page and now reading the third page. Suddenly he crumples the paper into a ball between his two hands, fakes dribbling it along the sidewalk, makes a good move, fakes one man, spins away from another and, hooking a high arching shot at a wire mesh trash basket, watches it hit the rim and bounce away, onto the pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(SOFTLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He keeps on walking as the time is SUPERIMPOSED: "10:14."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
