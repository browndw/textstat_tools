	It's silly, really. I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.

	I was in Atlantic City with my family. Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier. I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.

At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his. And I knew.

And he says no as a matter of fact I don't, and I am saying, bravo! Right on! Don't talk to her, it's none of her business --

One of Sam's partners, BOB LANGMAN, is walking with him,

	Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around. Does that sound great or what?

his face.

A MAILMAN with a sack of mail is standing outside the

front door of the houseboat. Jonah is signing a receipt

	Look at this, Dad. They're all for you --

Sam picks up an envelop and looks at it. It's
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
addressed to Sleepless in Seattle c/o Dr. Marcia
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fieldstone, Radio Station KWRS in Chicago. He's
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stunned. As he signs the receipt:
</DIRECTION>
<MAILMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're having trouble sleeping, you might want to try drinking a glass of water from the other side.

</MAILMAN>
<JONAH>

	I thought that was for hiccups.

</JONAH>
<MAILMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does it work for hiccups?

</MAILMAN>
<JONAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For hiccups, a spoonful of sugar, you hold it in your mouth for a minute.

</JONAH>
<MAILMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?

<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?

	How did they get our phone number?

	<DIALOGUE>
	English muffin. How do you do it?

	-- a slice of pizza --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONAH>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.

And another: Before you're cold?

And Annie continues to run, and now we see she's running

<DIRECTION>
across a map of the United States -- it's a little like

<DIRECTION>
the one we saw in the beginning of the movie -- it's

like the famous map of the United States by Saul

<DIRECTION>
Steinberg, but instead of being about New York, this one

is about Seattle.

In the distance, at the very edge of the map, we see two

	I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married. So we get married.

	But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?

</ANNIE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously. So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.

As Sam watches her go, Jonah looks at him, sticks his
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
finger in his mouth and pretends to gag.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(impatiently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jonah, this isn't fair. You don't know Victoria. I hardly know her myself. She is, in fact, a mystery to me. She tosses her hair a lot. Why does she do this? I have no idea. Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her. That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her. Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit. But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<JONAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was Mom an adjustment?

</JONAH>
<SAM>

At that moment, Annie emerges from the jetway right next

	There's no such thing as a perf --

Sam sees Annie immediately, and is instantly struck by
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
her looks, her fluidity, her poise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Annie walks right toward Sam, right past him, inches
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
from him, not noticing him as she looks for the exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam continues to stare at her.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>

Sam and Jonah start toward the exit, Sam trying not to

lose sight of Annie.

<DIRECTION>
Sam is preoccupied with Annie. She takes a turn that he
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
doesn't expect. He's having trouble keeping up, because
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
he has to wait for Jonah.
</DIRECTION>
<JONAH>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Jessica says you and Annie never got together in that life, and your hearts are like puzzles with parts out of them and when you get together the puzzle's complete.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONAH>

He's lost Annie in the crowd. She's nowhere in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God dammit.

<DIRECTION>
A beat, then Sam heads off to the exit. Jonah follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they walk into the distance --
</DIRECTION>
<JONAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.

Annie walks toward Sam's houseboat. Nervously. Goes up

feinting. Sam tackles him and they tumble together on

SUZY

who we remember from eighteen months ago, appearing at

the gate to the marina -- waving, smiling a mile wide --

<DIRECTION>
are overjoyed to see her. Jonah breaks into a run,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
nearly leaping into Suzy's waiting arms -- as Sam brings
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
up the rear, picking up Jonah's sodas which he dropped
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
when he started running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ANNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She comes to a standstill, in the middle of the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In shock. The scene in front of her is too horrible to
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
bear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANNIE'S POV - GATE TO MARINA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam catches up. Suzy -- no less beautiful and vivacious

than she was before -- tousles Jonah's hair, kisses Sam
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and hugs them both.

ANNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is such apparent warmth, and joy, and love about
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
this homecoming that she forget where she is -- in the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
middle of the street. A car HORN blares at her... all
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
she can do is stare at the nightmare that has unfolded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to back away -- and that's when she sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TAXICAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
coming right at her, horn BLARING, tires SQUEALING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Annie starts to jump to the other lane but there's a van
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
bearing down from the opposite direction. She steps
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
back to the middle line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cab goes into a skid. Annie freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam heard the noise and turns to see what's going on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cab comes SCREECHING right at the CAMERA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Annie screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cab stops inches from her body. The van in the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
other oncoming lane fishtails to a stop as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
responding. He runs from the gate toward the near-

accident.

Annie, still in shock from her brush with disaster,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hears the Cabbie but doesn't respond. Stunned, she
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
turns to see Sam on the other side of the street. Their
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
eyes meet. Sam stops, realizing it's the woman he saw
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in the airport.

that's happened, bolts for her car.

<DIRECTION>
Sam wants to run after her -- but there's traffic is
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
coming past and he can't cross the street. Annie gets
</DIRECTION>

into her car, starts and pulls away. Sam stands there,

deflated.

	Not really.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Annie, I love you. Let's leave that out of it. I don't want to be someone you're settling for. I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool. There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring. If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Annie is nodding. She wipes a tear from her face.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Walter. I don't deserve you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think that's what I'm saying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, gingerly, Annie slips the engagement ring off
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
her finger and hands it to Walter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No bitterness here. Both of them trying to be gentle
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
with each other.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
This breaks the tension. Both of them smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Walter turns to look over his shoulder at what Annie
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LIGHTS HAVE JUST GONE ON ON THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALENTINE LIGHTS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge pink and white heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter turns back to Annie.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
And as Annie's heart leaps and she's about to bolt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WEST 50TH STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Annie comes out to the street and hails a cab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it screeches off toward Fifth Ave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights are on all over the city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd has thinned out considerably. Jonah and Sam
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
are among the last people left. They gaze out at the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
twinkling lights and the ever-darkening sky.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEVATOR_OPERATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last call. Closing time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEVATOR_OPERATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Jonah looks at Sam.
</DIRECTION>
<JONAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is pretty dumb, wasn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONAH>
<DIRECTION>
Sam shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<JONAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONAH>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<JONAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONAH>
<DIRECTION>
Sam puts his arm around him, they start toward the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIFTH AVE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Annie's cab stuck in traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Annie gets out of the cab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's breaking into a hard run toward the Empire State
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Annie sprints in and over to Information Booth.
</DIRECTION>
<INFORMATION_BOOTH_PERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, ma'am, but the elevators are closed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INFORMATION_BOOTH_PERSON>
<ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(out of breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Please. I really need to get up there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<INFORMATION_BOOTH_PERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're closing up. No more runs tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INFORMATION_BOOTH_PERSON>
<DIRECTION>
Annie takes a deep breath. She's hit the end of the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
road. She turns to go but then turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(out of breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, can I just take a look? Maybe... maybe... There's someone I was supposed to meet... He's probably not there, but if I don't at least look I'll always wonder about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
The Information Booth Person looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<INFORMATION_BOOTH_PERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cary Grant, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INFORMATION_BOOTH_PERSON>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know that movie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<INFORMATION_BOOTH_PERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of my wife's favorites.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INFORMATION_BOOTH_PERSON>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a few beat the elevator door opens on a very
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
empty platform.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEVATOR_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, ma'am. Empty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEVATOR_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Annie slowly walks out.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I take a minute?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<ELEVATOR_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEVATOR_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
She sighs. Heads for the telescopes. Looks out at the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
twinkling lights below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She casually turns the telescope and suddenly sees
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
something on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonah's Seattle Mariners backpack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She picks it up. She realizes that it might be...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
could be... and opens it. Inside is a toothbrush and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonah's teddy bear. As she takes out the bear the other
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
elevator DINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Annie looks up as Jonah and Sam exit the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<JONAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I left it near the...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONAH>
<DIRECTION>
And they stop. There she is. There they are. Sam
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
can't believe it. It's the mystery woman.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The one in the street. I chased after you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<JONAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you Annie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONAH>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're Annie too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles awkwardly.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating the backpack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jonah walks over to her. He puts his hand out. She
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shakes it solemnly.
</DIRECTION>
<JONAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Jonah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding back to Sam)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my dad. His name is Sam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONAH>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Jonah. Sam.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating the teddy bear)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And who is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<JONAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Howard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONAH>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Howard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Sam nods. Smiling. Starting to put it all together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Annie smiles. Still nervous. No one knows what to do
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
next. Just then, one of the elevator operators CLEARS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS THROAT.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We better go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Annie nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam holds out his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Annie slips her hand into his. It feels comfortable,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
natural, right.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's nice to meet you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
On Annie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On Sam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On Jonah. He makes a triumphant little double-fist
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gesture to himself as the elevator doors close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE THE BUILDING from above, all lit up, a romantic
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
confection, the world's largest Valentine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see the United States
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
spread out before us, with lights twinkling everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
