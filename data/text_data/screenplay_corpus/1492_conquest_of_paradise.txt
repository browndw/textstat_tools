INT. AUDIENCE ROOM - GRANADA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We start on a man's elegant slipper. He is seated in a splendid chair. Moving up the stocking leg, we pass the garter of Castile, coming to rest on a pair of delicate hands. His fore finger impatiently plays with a large topaz ring. Over this, we hear distant footsteps, echoing on marble floors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Castilian face: aquilaine profile, olive complexion, dark eyebrows and meticulously sculpted beard. This is TREASURER SANCHEZ.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A door slams somewhere, the footsteps getting closer. We can now here a subdued conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TREASURER SANCHEZ stands up as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens at the far end of the large gilded room. A WOMEN, magnificent in somber taffeta, enters. QUEEN ISABEL OF SPAIN moves towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He bows slightly as she sits at the end of the large table. She is followed by a PRIEST, BROTHER BUYL, and three dignitaries of Church and State.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All sit beside her. TREASURER SANCHEZ takes a document and starts to read aloud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On screen the words: GRANADA - SPAIN - 1500
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Majesty would wish to know the true facts concerning the island of Hispanola, our first settlement in the New World, and the activities there of your servant, Christopher Columbus, Admiral of the Ocean Sea, Governor of that Island. You will remember with what hopes and promises he beguiled us -- the truth is that he now presides over a state of chaos, degradation and madness beyond imagining.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
SANCHEZ punctuates each word carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From the beginning, Columbus proved himself incapable of managing the affairs of the island. He appointed his brothers to important positions, at once injuring the pride and dignity of the nobles who had gone with him. He promised to build a city, the City of Isabel, named after Your Majesty. What he actually built was nothing but a collection of huts, and that in the wrong place, for all of it was easily swept away by rain and mud. Is that not so, Brother Buyl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
The PRIEST nods.
</DIRECTION>
<BROTHER_BUYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Your Honor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROTHER_BUYL>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He promised gold. Not finding the easy quantities he promised, Columbus commanded each Indian to pay an annual tribute. Most being unable to, they were barbarously punished, against the express wish of Your Christian Majesties...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
ISABEL lowers her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since provocation and injustice never ceases, many of the Indians have fled to the forests, or have begun to slay the Christians.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
ISABEL looks over at BROTHER BUYL.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could it be so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<BROTHER_BUYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Your Majesty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROTHER_BUYL>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But there is worse. From the beginning, he forced the nobles to undergo physical labor, treating them equally with the Indians, all of them reduced to slavery. When the nobleman Adrian de Moxica protested against such treatment...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he pauses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... he was executed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that not true also, Brother Buyl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<BROTHER_BUYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Your Honor. It is all true. All of it. I saw it with my own eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROTHER_BUYL>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has lost control. His great arrogance has led him into depravity. He encourages our soldiers to marry the native women. He promised a paradise, but he has made a hell full of all its horrors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?

INT. HUT - ISLAND - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON the FACE: COLUMBUS is stretched on a bed, sweating heavily in fever, clearly delirious. Insects crawl over his face, he makes no effort to swat them away. There is a dripping sound of water.
</DIRECTION>
<FERNANDO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of all the words my Father wrote and there were many, I remember these the most. "Nothing that results from human progress is achieved with unanimous consent..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERNANDO>
<DIRECTION>
Rain is falling into the room over documents spread on a table. COLUMBUS stands up and moves to the table. Some of the walls have been blackened with smoke and flames. A lizard scuttles into the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<FERNANDO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"And those who are enlightened before the others are condemned to purse that light in spite of others..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERNANDO>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS stares down at the documents, moving them away from the rain drips. He stares out by the window, and we see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A devastated landscape. Flooded roads, half-destroyed huts, broken trees... A dog picks its way through the mud.
</DIRECTION>
<FERNANDO>
<DIRECTION>

	There was a time when the New World didn't exist...

EXT. OCEAN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vast stretch of ocean. It fills the screen. Unbroken, infinite, luminous, mysterious -- it stretches away, meeting and blending with the sky in pale ribbons of pearl and misty light.
</DIRECTION>
<FERNANDO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... The sun set in the west on an ocean where no man had dared to venture. And beyond that, infinity...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERNANDO>
<DIRECTION>
Pulling back, we discover:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY and a strongly built man in his middle thirties, are riding a mule. The MAN'S weather-beaten face frames unusually bright eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the screen these words: ANDALUSIA, 1491
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS AND HIS SON are following a windthrashed path at the top of the hill. COLUMBUS hums a song, and FERNANDO looks up at him in adoration.
</DIRECTION>
<FERNANDO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Once I asked my Father where he wanted to go. And he replied: "I want to travel all over the seas. I want to get behind the weather..."

FERNANDO laughs. He then starts to hum along with his FATHER.

EXT. HILLSIDE APPROACH TO LA RABIDA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rugged landscape, remote and steep, with lines of stone walls and thousands of sheep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FERNANDO, rushes down a slope, barking like a dog, chasing the sheep who fan out in droves in front of him. High- spirited and wild, FERNANDO laughs and tumbles over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS rides his mule along the narrow track, watching his SON'S antics with amusement. In the distance, the solitary figure of A MONK SHEPHERD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS calls out to his son:
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fernando!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
FERNANDO runs over. COLUMBUS lifts him up onto the mule.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they move along the track we now see, perched on a distant hill, isolated and austere, the Monastery of La Rabida, their destination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they dismount and walk into the quiet cloisters, FERNANDO suddenly spots a familiar FIGURE, standing under the ROMAN arches.
</DIRECTION>
<FERNANDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Diego!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERNANDO>
<DIRECTION>
He rushes over, full of joy, to kiss his BROTHER -- an adolescent dressed in the novice-robe, with a solemn, delicate face. DIEGO'S response is constrained.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Diego! Aren't you going to kiss your brother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
DIEGO smiles a little, and kisses FERNANDO -- who is immediately distracted by a procession of hooded MONKS, hurrying to the refectory, as a bell begins to chime.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MONKS all turn to greet ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a white- haired, elderly man -- and a monk cosmographer. MARCHENA'S gesture is broad and elegant as he opens his arms to greet COLUMBUS. He pats FERNANDO'S head and turns to DIEGO.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Diego, take Fernando to the dining hall. He must be hungry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHENA>
<DIEGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIEGO>
<DIRECTION>
Both CHILDREN leave under the arched roof. COLUMBUS and MARCHENA begin to walk across the cloister.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon. Even brothers from different mothers...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHENA>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him. And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
MARCHENA laughs at the compliment.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just be careful you don't lose him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHENA>
<DIRECTION>
They have crossed the cloister. MARCHENA pushes open a door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A HUGE LIBRARY - LA RABIDA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hundreds of books lined up on the shelves, displaying the miracle of printing, a recent German discovery. Several MONKS, perched on high stools behind lecterns, are busily "ILLUMINATING" some of these massive volumes, delicately painting around the letters in bright colors and gold leaf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rays of light fall diagonally through high openings, projecting geometric patterns on the tiled floor. As MARCHENA and COLUMBUS move forward their conversation is punctuated by light and shadow.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCHENA>
<DIRECTION>
(fumbles in a pocket under his robe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have something for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHENA>
<DIRECTION>
Almost casually, he hands COLUMBUS a letter.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will be heard at the University of Salamanca...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHENA>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS stops dead in his tracks. Almost frantically he tears open the letter, hardly able to believe his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God... That's in a week!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what it says.

</MARCHENA>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you manage it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<MARCHENA>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With some difficulty. I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHENA>
<DIRECTION>
MARCHENA pushes open a second door, hidden behind a wooden panel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STUDY - LA RABIDA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCHENA is not a tidy man. Books are piled up on the floor, the desk, on every shelf, along with maps, instruments of astronomy... the visible evidence of an inquiring mind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With practiced familiarity, as if they had done this a hundred times -- which indeed they have -- MARCHENA sits behind his desk, and COLUMBUS opposite him. MARCHENA lights a candle and considers the mess. Then methodically, he slowly sweeps it from in front of him with his sleeve, exposing a large map underneath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he looks up again, there is a new severity in his expression. He turns over an hourglass.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you wish to sail west?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHENA>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To open a new route to Asia. At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
He leans forward, and points to the map spread out on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By sea, sailing around the African Continent -- the journey takes a year...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
His finger traces the journey, from west to east.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or by land...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
We are CLOSE now on the map, as we watch his finger tracing a line between Europe and the Far East.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... But the Turks have closed this route to all Christians. Trading with the Orient has become arduous, if not dangerous.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he pauses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is a third way...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
We notice that the outline of the European continent is familiar. But we also notice that, in that great expanse of ocean, the whole American continent is missing.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By sailing West across the Ocean Sea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MARCHENA'S FACE, touched by the mystery.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you be so certain? The Ocean is said to be infinite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHENA>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ignorance! I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you be so certain?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHENA>
<COLUMBUS>

	So was Christ!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
MARCHENA throws his quill in the air in frustration. He glances at the hourglass:
</DIRECTION>
<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two minutes... and already you're a dead man. Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHENA>
<COLUMBUS>

(mockingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll try to remember that, Marchena...

	Father Marchena!

EXT. COURTYARD - LA RABIDA - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DIEGO and FERNANDO wait in the courtyard. COLUMBUS appears and lifts FERNANDO onto the mule. DIEGO turns to go.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Diego.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS walks over to him, squats down so their eyes meet. He looks at his SON for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like to come and stay with us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
Uncomfortable with the proposition, DIEGO cannot find an answer.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do whatever makes you happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIEGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am happy, Father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIEGO>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS reaches out -- and touches his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs up behind FERNANDO, who waves back to his BROTHER as they ride off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CADIZ - STREETS AND CATHEDRAL SQUARE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS leads the mule, carrying the sleeping FERNANDO, through narrow streets. There's a clamorous noise in the air. Suddenly a large group of YOUNG MEN, shouting with excitement, run up the street and brush past them. Then more people. FERNANDO sits up straight. The noise grows, rowdy, rumbling, sharp with excitement and violence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Huge CROWDS have thronged the massive old square outside the cathedral. Holding the mule by its reins, COLUMBUS tries to push his way through... Suddenly, as a gap opens in the crowd, we see the cause of the excitement: in the center of the square stand three pyres, already alit. HOODED EXECUTIONERS are busy around the fires.
</DIRECTION>
<FERNANDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Father!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERNANDO>
<DIRECTION>
Before COLUMBUS can stop him, FERNANDO has slipped off the mule and into the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fernando!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
But the BOY has been swallowed into the mass of people. COLUMBUS tries to follow him. Flames leap into the night sky with a terrible crackling, lighting up the square with a lurid glow. Prayers are being chanted somewhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FERNANDO has elbowed his way to the front of the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PRIEST brandishes a crucifix in front of the face of a MAN bound to a post. The heretic wears the "sambenito", a robe made of coarse fabric on which his sins have been crudely illustrated -- we see cabalistic signs, indicating that the man is Jewish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MAN'S eyes are mad with fear. But he refuses to kiss the crucifix, as a sign of his repentance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FERNANDO is transfixed by the scene, but still doesn't realize what is happening. He is too close to the platform to see what is in the flames of the other pyres.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fernando!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
He motions to his son, takes the BOY'S hand, and drags him away from the scene. But FERNANDO looks back. The distance now allows him to see inside the flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HALF-CHARRED FIGURE -- THE MAN'S face is distorted in a silent scream... The neck snaps like burning wood, and the head falls on one shoulder. Then the whole body collapses into the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEATRIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY AND STABLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS and FERNANDO lead the mule into the white-washed, stone-floored hallway of the modest house. FERNANDO is mute, shocked by what he just witnessed. COLUMBUS takes the mule into its stall, and as he does so, his mother, BEATRIX, appears from the kitchen to greet them. She is a beautiful woman in her twenties, a calm, strong, domestic personality. COLUMBUS tousles the BOY'S hair. FERNANDO glances at his MOTHER but looks subdued and doesn't say anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS joins BEATRIX in the kitchen, where a MAID is cooking. He explains Fernando's subdued manner.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Executions. In the square.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
BEATRIX nods. He goes to the stone butt and pours water on his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've agreed to see me in a week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
BEATRIX puts the candle on the table. Her face lights up with a smile. He walks to her, and kisses her.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could be gone for years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<BEATRIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.

<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't given you much of a life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<BEATRIX>

(amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... that's true. I have a child by a man who won't marry me! Who's always leaving...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRIX>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are we going to argue?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<BEATRIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd love to argue with you sometimes. But you're never here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRIX>
<DIRECTION>
They laugh and kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>

(still kissing him)

	I find that hard to believe.

<DIRECTION>
INT. BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are eating around the table, and FERNANDO is unusually silent and thoughtful. COLUMBUS pours a little wine into FERNANDO'S water, to distract him. FERNANDO looks up at him, surprised. COLUMBUS smiles, then looks over at BEATRIX.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fernando, don't you think we are lucky to live with such a beautiful woman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
He winks at FERNANDO. BEATRIX smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEATRIX'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is dark. As COLUMBUS approached the bed with a candle, it illuminates the naked body of BEATRIX. BEATRIX looks up at him intently. A drop of wax falls on her skin. She flinches, murmurs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They make love.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SALAMANCA UNIVERSITY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A medieval "campus". Students-novices are playing "pelote", with basket-gloves and a hard ball. They run with their robes tucked around their waist, revealing white legs. Others are studying, reading, hurrying to their class.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We find COLUMBUS watching the game from the steps above the court. Others are waiting with him. A MONK comes from a door, and looks around the group.
</DIRECTION>
<MONK>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Christopher Columbus?

</MONK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AUDIENCE ROOM - UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An El Greco painting. A tableau of twenty MEN sitting on dark, sculpted seats. Candles throw a gloomy light on their faces. Some are Churchmen, others are dressed in bourgeois outfits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only one of them is richly dressed in the grand Spanish fashion -- he is SANCHEZ, Treasurer of the House of Aragon. A MONK (Don AROJAZ) holds a stick with an ivory claw at the top. Languidly, he scratches his back -- his off-hand manner only makes him more impressive than his peers.
</DIRECTION>
<AROJAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AROJAZ>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, your Eminence. The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<AROJAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle? Erathostene? Ptolemeus?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AROJAZ>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am, Your Eminence
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<AROJAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he leans forward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	22,000 leagues or more. Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AROJAZ>
<DIRECTION>
He leans back, satisfied, and pauses for effect.
</DIRECTION>
<AROJAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you may have found new evidence proving that these men of knowledge are totally mistaken!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AROJAZ>
<DIRECTION>
A ripple of mirthless laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Excellencies are aware of the statements of Marin de Tyr?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<HERNANDO_DE_TALAVERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERNANDO_DE_TALAVERA>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you are also aware that his theories contradict Ptolemeus... De Tyr believes the Ocean to be only 750 leagues...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
A murmur of protest spreads among the members of the Commission. But Columbus is determined to press his theories.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Florentine Toscanelli and the French Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly both think that Marin de Tyr is accurate in his calculations. And therefore, that the ocean can be crossed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
Indignant and amused murmurs. DIEGO DE DEZA raises his voice to quiet the assembly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIEGO_DE_DEZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, let us suppose Marin de Tyr is right...

	In your opinion, how long would the voyage be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIEGO_DE_DEZA>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven weeks. Six, during the summer months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
The murmur increases.
</DIRECTION>
<AROJAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marin de Tyr is wrong -- and has been corrected many times over the centuries by the finest geographers. Your voyage, Don Colon, would take a year!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AROJAZ>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN of simple bearing, that COLUMBUS identifies as being a seaman, interrupts.
</DIRECTION>
<VICUNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How would the crew survive without being able to land for fresh water? Water is undrinkable after six weeks! You'd never be able to turn back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICUNA>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We wouldn't have to turn back! We would find land at this point!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<AROJAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew. I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AROJAZ>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellency, you are right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly, the protests stop.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am a seaman, not a scholar... But as a simple man craving for knowledge, I have read all the work of these renowned geographers and discovered that none of them could agree on the exact width of this ocean...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses, and starts walking in front of the experts, as a lawyer before a grand jury.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Therefore, as a modest man, I wonder: who is right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
The experts listen. CLOSE ON SANCHEZ'S FACE, impressed by the boldness.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is right? This question remains unanswered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
He walks and stops before TALAVERA, and catches the look of SANCHEZ, sitting just behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter. And that is to make the journey.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the assembly, with passion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<AROJAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your life, and that of others!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AROJAZ>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If they agree to follow me, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suppose you cross this ocean. Suppose you reach Asia. What would Spain do there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
Conscious of a friendlier voice, COLUMBUS sees the Treasurer SANCHEZ, an imposing man in his fifties.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trade, Your Excellency. According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<AROJAZ>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that all that interests you? Gold?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AROJAZ>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people. I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
THE MONK smiles thinly.
</DIRECTION>
<AROJAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christopher -- Christo Ferens -- the Bearer of the Cross!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AROJAZ>
<MONK>
<DIRECTION>
(ironic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Colon -- the one who populates!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONK>
<DIRECTION>
Another small rill of laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<AROJAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AROJAZ>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
A hum of interest. CLOSE ON SANCHEZ -- watching COLUMBUS intently, a hint of an admiring smile on his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<AROJAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you consider yourself the chosen one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AROJAZ>
<DIRECTION>
A pause.
</DIRECTION>
<AROJAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AROJAZ>
<COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
(calmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
The murmur turns to an audible gasp. AROJAZ gets to his feet and leans forward, threateningly, the flame of a candle only inches from his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is absolute silence. COLUMBUS meets the MONK'S gaze unflinchingly.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<AROJAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AROJAZ>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TERRACE - UNIVERSITY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The JURY is alone to deliberate. Food and wine has been laid out on tables. In the distance, students' cries carry over the conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SANCHEZ approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<AROJAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Treasurer of Spain honors us with his presence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AROJAZ>
<DIRECTION>
SANCHEZ bows slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<AROJAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Judgment is ours!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AROJAZ>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naturally. But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
SANCHEZ helps himself to some grapes, looks round at the other members of the committee, who pretend not to be listening.
</DIRECTION>
<AROJAZ>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is a mercenary! Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AROJAZ>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed. The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(casually)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
AROJAZ understands the hint, and stops smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<AROJAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You would use your influence to assist this... intriguer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AROJAZ>
<DIRECTION>
SANCHEZ reaches for a decanter of sherry.
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Your Eminence, the fascinating thing about power, is that what can be given so effortlessly...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
He offers the decanter to AROJAZ, who automatically lifts his glass. But instead, SANCHEZ pulls back the decanter, pours himself a drink, and replaces it on the table, leaving AROJAZ staring at his own empty glass.
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... can so easily be taken away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
And he drinks with a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LA RABIDA - MARCHENA'S STUDY - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCHENA reads aloud the Commission's letter.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and therefore nothing could justify the participation of Your Highnesses in the venture that relies upon such feeble assumptions, and which any man of knowledge would take to be impractical... if not impossible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHENA>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head, puts the letter down. COLUMBUS looks appalled; devastated.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They didn't listen. They didn't want to listen!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
He paces about the book-lined room.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHENA>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! I've waited seven years already! How much longer do you want me to wait?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If God intends you to go, then you will go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHENA>
<COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
(angrily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
MARCHENA is shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colon!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHENA>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn all of you! You all set up theories based on what? You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out! Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
He seizes a beautiful book from MARCHENA'S desk.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These don't mean anything! They're full of assumptions! Out of the heads of old men who've never been past the end of their gardens!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
He hurls the book across the room. MARCHENA is horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...! My books...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHENA>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS seizes more books from the shelves, just sweeping them to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All of them! Just lies!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colon! Don't!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHENA>
<DIRECTION>
MARCHENA tries to stop him. In his fury, COLUMBUS accidentally knocks the poor old MAN to the ground. His cries bring three MONKS rushing into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As COLUMBUS continues to rage and scatter books everywhere, they try to stop him, struggling with this big, powerful man -- to almost comical effect. Finally, a short, muscular MONK delivers a quick punch that sends COLUMBUS crashing to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHAPEL OF LA RABIDA - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS lies face down on the stone floor. He is dressed in a homespun robe. His arms are stretched out in penance. FERNANDO and DIEGO look down at him.
</DIRECTION>
<FERNANDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERNANDO>
<DIEGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sssshhhh...! One can't speak to a man doing penance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIEGO>
<FERNANDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERNANDO>
<DIEGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. That's the point, Fernando.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIEGO>
<DIRECTION>
A pause -- and then FERNANDO lies face down on the floor beside his FATHER, and stretches out his arms in the same way. DIEGO is left looking on, unable to bring himself to join them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Along the cloister, maps are drying, hanging like laundry in the light breeze. COLUMBUS pins up a new addition. Another MONK works nearby, in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Senor Colon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS turns, to see a small, stocky MAN approaching: a middle-class gentleman. He nods.
</DIRECTION>
<PINZON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, thank God! I've been looking all over Seville for you! Never expected to find a sailor in a monastery, eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs. COLUMBUS smiles, but doesn't say anything. PINZON is clearly a little surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<PINZON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Name's Pinzon, by the way. Martin Alonzo Pinzon. I'm a ship owner from Palos...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS glances around cautiously, and walks a little way down the cloister, away from the other MONK, gesturing for PINZON to follow him. PINZON is yet more surprised by this strange behavior.
</DIRECTION>
<PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating the monk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he a spy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS shakes his head. PINZON stares at him, perplexed.
</DIRECTION>
<PINZON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it? Are you a Trappist?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS shakes his head again.
</DIRECTION>
<PINZON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vow of silence...? Penance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS nods vigorously.
</DIRECTION>
<PINZON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus! Just my luck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
He takes off his hat, wiping his forehead with a silk cloth.
</DIRECTION>
<PINZON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen. I'll do the talking for both of us. You just nod. Agreed? Just as I do with the wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS nods.
</DIRECTION>
<PINZON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that the Commission turned you down, right? What do you expect? You're a foreigner... But I want to help you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS gives him a glance like one throws a question in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<PINZON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wonder why I believe in you? Hey, I am a seaman. And we don't like to be told where to go, and where not to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS looks at him, and bursts out laughing. The other MONK looks round severely. COLUMBUS ducks behind a map, PINZON following him. PINZON lowers his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<PINZON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't look like it, but I have friends at the Court. The Treasurer of Aragon, for example. He finances me. His name's Santangel. Ever heard of him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS shakes his head, but looks increasingly interested by what he's hearing.
</DIRECTION>
<PINZON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He can get you an audience with the Queen! You know why...? She owes him money. That's how it is. You -- me -- the Queen -- the world and his mistress -- agreed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS nods.
</DIRECTION>
<PINZON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. What do you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS looks around, catches the disapproving face of the MONK, crosses himself, then speaks:
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where can I meet this man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating with a nod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Immediately.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS turns and sees an elegant Lord in his fifties, examining the maps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREETS OF GRANADA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge Islamic Crescent being pulled down from the minaret of a mosque. SOLDIERS are holding back a crowd at the foot of the tower. To the ecstatic cries of the crowd, a Cross is hoisted up in its place... Astride horses, COLUMBUS and the Treasurer SANTANGEL are watching the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They push through an extraordinary scene. The city of Granada has just been reclaimed from the moors after several years of siege. All around them, SPANISH SOLDIERS are herding, bedraggled columns of the defeated MOORS, bearing only a few possessions. Ragged, half-starved men, women and children.
</DIRECTION>
<SANTANGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These people built Granada... Centuries ago! It is a great victory over the Moors, Don Colon -- and yet what a tragedy it is!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTANGEL>
<DIRECTION>
The THREE HORSEMEN pass a procession of grateful PENITENTS, who are crawling on their knees, chanting psalms and flagellating themselves. At the head of the procession, HOODED PRIESTS carry a statue of the Virgin Mary swathed in silk and lace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gates of the Alhambra Palace are in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this a good time to meet her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<SANTANGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It couldn't be better. Victors can't say no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTANGEL>
<DIRECTION>
Bells are pealing triumphantly. The noise is tumultuous. They ride towards the magnificent palace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALHAMBRA PALACE - GARDENS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fabulous Moorish gardens: ponds filled with golden carp; exotic bird cages hang from lemon trees... The distant sounds of victory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SANTANGEL and COLUMBUS walk through the gardens, escorted by HALBERDIERS. SOLDIERS pass by, carrying coffers or piles of documents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they approach the inner sanctum, however, there are fewer people. They stop by the Lion's Fountain, where several DIGNITARIES are waiting patiently for an audience.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SANCHEZ appears. They bow. SANTANGEL approaches to murmur a compliment.
</DIRECTION>
<SANTANGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Excellency... truly grateful... your help... as ever...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTANGEL>
<DIRECTION>
SANCHEZ protests softly, and looks over at COLUMBUS, a half-smile forming on his lips. Then a DUENA appears, and motions for COLUMBUS to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALHAMBRA PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ornate Moorish door is pushed open by the DUENA'S hand. We enter the Throne Room -- sculptured colonnades, mosaics... At the far end, windows open onto a view of Granada's rooftops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Against this dazzling light, the delicate silhouette of QUEEN ISABEL OF SPAIN. The light in her blonde hair creates a halo around her head as she turns. COLUMBUS falls to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rise...! Come forward!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches the window, stopping close to her. ISABEL scrutinizes him quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no. But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
(bold)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
ISABEL smiles, enjoying the lack of obsequiousness.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The ocean is uncrossable?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did they say about Granada before today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That she was impregnable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
ISABEL smiles again.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Surely you can do anything you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
A direct challenge. She doesn't know what to make of this man.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How little you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
This little hint of vulnerability subtly reverses their positions for a moment. Now we sense COLUMBUS scrutinizing her.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I speak freely?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
(with a smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what I see. I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is. Who's not afraid. I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
(amused at his familiarity)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A woman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
A slight pause.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me... but you're the only Queen I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
She bursts out laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we are equal... since you are the only sailor I know!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How old are you, Senor Colon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
Once again taken off guard, ISABEL flushes, and turns away slightly to hide it.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirty eight...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
A pause.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will be informed of our decision.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS bows and goes to leave. As the DUENA opens the door for him, he turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I thought you were younger than me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
And he goes out, leaving her stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - TREE-LINED ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A chalk white road, lined with trees. Two liveried SERVANTS are walking down the road, one carrying a large silver tray, the other a smaller tray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are overtaken by an ADMINISTRATOR who hurries along the road, with documents under his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CLERK enters an imposing stable block.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the paddock, SANCHEZ is training a magnificent young horse, making it step sideways, bending it to his will. The ADMINISTRATOR watches him, unable to interrupt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him the two SERVANTS can be seen bringing in the silver trays, with covered dishes of food, a decanter of wine. They begin to lay them out on a table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SANCHEZ pours himself some wine, tucks into his his food, while the ADMINISTRATOR, clearly working himself up into a frenzy, reads from a document.
</DIRECTION>
<ADMINISTRATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and he demands... he DEMANDS to be made a Knight, with the right to bear the Golden Spurs! He will receive the title of Don Cristobal Colon -- which will be extended to his descendants for ever more...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADMINISTRATOR>
<DIRECTION>
The ADMINISTRATOR looks up. He is reading the contract that COLUMBUS has proposed. SANCHEZ, his mouth full, gestures for him to continue.
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<ADMINISTRATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He will be named Great Admiral of the Ocean Sea. Viceroy of the West Indies... Governor of all islands or lands discovered or as will be discovered with his help...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADMINISTRATOR>
<DIRECTION>
The ADMINISTRATOR looks up again.
</DIRECTION>
<ADMINISTRATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The highest titles of nobility, Your Excellency! To an immigrant sheltered by monks!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADMINISTRATOR>
<DIRECTION>
SANCHEZ gestures for the document. Wipes his mouth. Continues reading, calmly:
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Furthermore he will receive one eight of all wealth or monies, precious gems, pearls, metals, spices and other lucrative sources conquered within the boundaries of his admiralty...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles, hands the document back.
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's very underdone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<ADMINISTRATOR>
<DIRECTION>
(exploding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Underdone! It's monstrous, Excellency!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADMINISTRATOR>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, the pheasant. It's almost raw.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
And he carries on eating.
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You worry too much, Carvajal... The man will have to lower his demands. Believe me, he WILL!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALHAMBRA PALACE - A RECEPTION ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close up on COLUMBUS.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I WON'T!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
A WOMAN'S HAND quietly, carefully opens a cover of a spy hole in the wall. Two beautiful eyes peer through a grille, into the next room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What they see:

SANCHEZ and COLUMBUS together. COLUMBUS is visibly upset.
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
(calmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have considered your -- demands very carefully, Senor Colon... Your expectations are... excessive, in every way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS tightens his fists, tries to remain calm.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I am right, my requests are fair!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
SANCHEZ holds up a document.
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have prepared our own contract...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
He offers the document to COLUMBUS, who takes it, scans it quickly, shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO...! I have waited too long, fought too hard. Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit! No... I will not be your servant!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
The eyes behind the screen -- the mouth, forming a little smile.
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not bargaining!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
(steely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you are too ambitious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS leans over the table, faces him.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And were you never ambitious, Excellency? Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
(abrupt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you can do that, Excellency -- I'll become a monk!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
He turns, strides towards the door. We hear a WOMAN'S muffled laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As COLUMBUS goes out, ISABEL appears through a secret door. SANCHEZ bows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ISABEL goes over to the window and looks out.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never, Your Majesty. Although...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
She turns, questioningly, towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>

(with a smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. It would be a pity, wouldn't it?

(turning to Sanchez)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call him back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Teeming life. COLUMBUS pushing his way through crowds. He is expressionless and distracted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around him, stops walking. And then, unexpectedly, shouts.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YEEEEEEES!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
All heads turn as if he were totally insane. He walks on as if nothing happened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS is sitting at the kitchen table, by himself, with a glass of wine. There is a movement behind him. BEATRIX is standing at the foot of the stairs, in a night-shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS turns and looks at her, almost sad.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She said yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<BEATRIX>
<DIRECTION>
(moved)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRIX>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles. But he seems to be unable to share her happiness.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I ever come back, I swear I will...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
She crosses to him quickly, placing her hand gently on his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<BEATRIX>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRIX>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want you to wait for me.

</COLUMBUS>
<BEATRIX>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's something you can't decide.

<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS kisses her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR - BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Strange, unearthly music... A flickering light in a dark tunnel. FERNANDO, holding a candle in front of him, walks slowly down the dark corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quietly opening a door, he walks into COLUMBUS' study.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COLUMBUS' STUDY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: A huge illustrated map of western Europe and Asia. FERNANDO'S candle moves slowly across the Atlantic Ocean, to the edge of the map. There, the illustrator's imagination has created monsters: terrifying demons; creatures half-human, half-animal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting at his desk, COLUMBUS is looking at the map.
</DIRECTION>
<FERNANDO>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't go there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERNANDO>
<DIRECTION>
Turning, COLUMBUS finds his son beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
FERNANDO points at the monsters. He pulls the boy to him.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There aren't any monsters, Fernando. The only monsters are in here...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he taps his own forehead)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a pen, and draws a smile on one of the terrible monsters, transforming it at once. FERNANDO laughs immediately.
</DIRECTION>
<FERNANDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to go with you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERNANDO>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There'll be a time.

<FERNANDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You promise?

<DIRECTION>
(Columbus nods his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERNANDO>
<DIRECTION>
FERNANDO pulls the chain with the St. Christopher medal from under COLUMBUS' shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<FERNANDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERNANDO>

<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
And he hugs his SON tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HILLSIDE AND GATE - PRE-DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A luminous procession passes through a Moorish stone gate, down to the harbor. We see the faces of the SAILORS and their FAMILIES -- COLUMBUS, PINZON AMONGST THEM -- We sense the fervor and apprehension of the departure. The procession is lead by MARCHENA and four young NOVICES carrying the Madonna. All hold long, burning tapers, saying the rosary. A SAILOR pushes through the crowd, and kisses the Madonna's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PALOS HARBOR - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hundreds of candles flicker in the pre-dawn light, held by the FAMILIES and FRIENDS of the SAILORS.

The SANTA MARIA the PINTA and the NINA nestle against the quayside. Dwarfed by the hulls, a flotilla of smaller fishing craft, returning from night fishing, accidentally witness this event.

<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you saying?

</MARCHENA>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I lied. The journey will be longer than I said.

</COLUMBUS>
<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long?

</MARCHENA>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.

</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
A pause.

<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May God forgive you...! You must tell them! You must tell your men!

	If I tell them, they won't follow me. You know that I am right, Father. You trust me...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Be good to your mother, Fernando. Do you promise?

</COLUMBUS>

FERNANDO nods, tears in his eyes. Then COLUMBUS embraces BEATRIX tightly. She whispers into his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<BEATRIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Speak to Diego.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRIX>
<DIRECTION>
But COLUMBUS and DIEGO are unable to find words, and instead they clumsily hug. Someone taps COLUMBUS' shoulder. He turns around to see SANTANGEL. Wordlessly, they hug.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Activity on the ships, orders are being shouted, ropes fore and aft are cast off, splashing into the water... Now the SHIPS are slowly moving parallel to the quayside. The CROWD starts walking abreast to the VESSELS. WOMEN holding up babies, blowing kisses, old PARENTS crying... BEATRIX, HER SONS, AND SANTANGEL are among them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS suddenly unties the chain around his neck, and throws it at DIEGO.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Diego! Here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
DIEGO catches it. Opening his hand he looks at the medallion. Then looks up at his FATHER, elated.

THE SANTA MARIA is now two meters from the QUAY. SANTANGEL is now opposite COLUMBUS.

They both laugh.

A FISHERMAN, standing in his shrimp-boat lets his hand slide gently along the gigantic hull. He stares up at the SAILORS leaning on the rail.

EXT. SHIPS AT SEA - WHALES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE SHIPS ON A BOUNDLESS OCEAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sea resembling a DORMANT MONSTER, holding its breath. A living being, all powerful, capable of unpredictable metamorphosis. Music reflects the loneliness, the anxiety of the crew, the fear of the unknown...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ENORMOUS WHALES moving slowly alongside, surging majestically through the waves. Sinking back, disappearing, their cries taking precedent over the music.
</DIRECTION>

A SHIP'S BOY is throwing buckets of water on the deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SAILOR is busy clearing the ropes around the mast.

A COOK is blowing life into a brazier, in preparation of the evening meal.

TEN MEN heaving on a heavy rope, raising the top sail, punctuating their efforts with a sailor's chant.

EXT. SANTA MARIA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crystalline north star -- as if seen through an instrument.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS' silhouette, by an oil lamp, standing at the prow. Holding a quadrant he is aiming at the stars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOME SAILORS are watching with curiosity. One of them is ALONSO, a rough, stocky Basque.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near COLUMBUS, on a tressel, various books and charts. He makes an entry in the log. Then goes back to his quadrant. He senses MENDEZ standing next to him.

</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
MENDEZ is hesitant. He nervously clears his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<MENDEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... It's the men, Sir. They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...

</MENDEZ>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come over here.

MENDEZ hesitates, then motions to COLUMBUS. The SAILORS are watching, and some approach to hear the conversation.

MENDEZ nods -- and loses equilibrium. The plumb line swings.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move! A mistake of one degree and we'll be off 6,000 leagues!

MENDEZ tries again.

<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Twenty eight.

MENDEZ turns to COLUMBUS.

	That's it. The twenty eighth parallel. And we'll follow it until we reach land.

ALONSO does not seem convinced.

	How do you know land is on the twenty eighth parallel?

EXT. SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A blazing sun. The ship is like a furnace, its brass fittings too hot to touch, the blistering heat making the air shimmer over the decks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Desperate for shade, sailors are sheltering under the sagging prow sail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SHIP'S BOY throws an empty bucket attached to a rope over the side and hauls it back up again, brimming with water. As he turns, we see his face, disfigured by a hair lip. He drenches himself... From the shade, ALONSO watches him.
</DIRECTION>
<ALONSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chicken-ass face!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALONSO>
<DIRECTION>
The others laugh. The BOY, ashamed, tries to ignore them. ALONSO'S hand accidentally touches a brass fitting; he reacts like he was burnt.
</DIRECTION>
<ALONSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALONSO>
<DIRECTION>
He sucks his blistered fingers.

	Ah, leave him alone. He's doing no harm.

We experience a sense of vertigo as we near the top of the main mast, high above the rolling deck.

The COOK starts laughing. They turn to him.

They all laugh. Alonso looks up at COLUMBUS standing on the poop deck, scrutinizing the horizon, waiting for the land to appear.

	And why does this one take to the sea? Nobody knows. Never says a word...

CLOSE UP ON AN HOUR-GLASS, nearly through its time.

The SHIP'S BOY throws an "ampoulette" over board. We follow the bulb attached to a rope, passing the full length of the hull. As it reaches the poop deck, another SAILOR shouts "MARK". A very primitive system of calculation for distance and speed.

Sitting near the SHIP'S BOY, COLUMBUS is making entries in a log-book, watching the hourglass.

CLOSE ON THE MEN, rowing, drenched with sweat.

FROM THE PROW, COLUMBUS is staring at the horizon.

ALONSO pulling at his oars stares at COLUMBUS' distant figure with hate and resentment.

ALONSO suddenly ships his oars, throwing the whole boat into disarray. Chaos.

He looks up and down the line, finishing on ALONSO. They stare at one another.

	We set sail for greed. God has abandoned us. The voyage is cursed. There are signs...

ALONSO glances towards the SHIP'S BOY, with his hair lip. The BOY lowers his eyes. COLUMBUS moves towards him, pulls him forward, stands him in front of ALONSO.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This boy has the voice of an angel. What comes out of his mouth is blessed, Alonso. What comes out of your is evil.

Some of the men laugh at this statement. ALONSO is ill at ease. COLUMBUS pauses, looks around at all the MEN.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me! Every man is afraid who does something for the first time. But those who overcome their fears, will find their rewards. I do not know if it is God's will that we cross this ocean -- but I am certain it is the devil who puts fears into our hearts...

The MEN are listening. We sense a subtle change of mood...

COLUMBUS points at the SHIP'S BOY.

<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You start first.

</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
The SHIP'S BOY rushes up the mast. As he climbs, the mainsail starts to fill with wind. The deck begins to move under their feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This movement under their feet seems to imperceptibly erase the fears and the angers.
</DIRECTION>
<MENDEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alonso! Jaime! Don't let this wind escape us.

CRIES from the other ships, as the sails snap taut, filling with wind. MEN rush to their posts. PINZON stares at COLUMBUS, shaking his head in disbelief.

COLUMBUS' head nods lower and lower to his chest. He is asleep. We become aware of a sharp buzzing sound. It becomes louder as we move closer to COLUMBUS' face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mosquito lands on his temple. COLUMBUS reflexively slaps it. He wakes up, and looks at his fingers -- a spot of blood, a crushed mosquito. He stares at it for a moment. Then slowly gets to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the luminous moonlight, COLUMBUS is standing, staring up at thousands of insects that wheel around the mast lantern. We hear the flutter of their wings and see the bats as they swoop and dive in a feeding frenzy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS turns, stares into the darkness, desperate to see the land that must be close.

He kneels by MENDEZ, wrapped in a blanket. He touches his shoulder.

An opaque dawn. COLUMBUS, riveted, staring forward as if to pierce the mist. The entire crew are clinging to the rail, and standing on the shrouds.

Suddenly, the SHIP BOY'S voice cracking with emotion.

<SHIP_S_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	TIERRA...! TIERRA!

COLUMBUS strains his eyes; he still can not see anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire CREW stand and stare, silent, holding their breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the sun begins to rise, the fog dissipates -- slowly, exquisitely, revealing a single palm, so close it seems almost as though they could touch it. Then a white slash of beach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near COLUMBUS, a SAILOR falls to his knees and burst into tears. Others laugh with joy. COLUMBUS watches this vision in disbelief, his mouth open as if it were difficult for him to breathe. Tears come to his eyes. He closes them. Then opens them again. The land is there -- a green paradise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On screen the words: OCTOBER 12, 1942. GUANAHAN ISLAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOATS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three row boats plunging through the surf towards the beach. COLUMBUS stands in the prow of the first boat. MENDEZ is in the second. PINZON the third. They stare entranced at the lushness of the foliage, and the blue clarity of the water...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the first boat beaches, COLUMBUS leaps out and wades ashore. Behind him the rest of the landing party splash through the sun-dazzled water, carrying the banner of Castille and Aragon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stand on the beach, almost in a dream. There is silence. The ROYAL NOTARY, ludicrously overdressed, now wet through, stumbles over to COLUMBUS and holds out his contract and a pen. COLUMBUS scrawls his name.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MEN stare at him, filled not only with new respect, but with something amounting to awe.

COLUMBUS turns to them, tries to speak.

	By the... by the Grace of... God...

He swallows. Tears have sprung to his eyes. He is so moved he cannot continue. Coming to his rescue -- THE SHIP'S BOY starts to roll the drum. He then stops.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>

(pulling himself together)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the name of their Gracious Majesties of Castille and Aragon, and by all the powers vested in me, I claim this island and name it San Salvador.

The MEN cheer as the flags are rammed into the sand, flapping in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS starts to walk towards the jungle, and in silence the rest follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JUNGLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Immediately they are met by an incredible wall of SOUND! The jungle is filled with NOISE. The impossibly-loud CRIES of EXOTIC BIRDS, the CHATTERING of MONKEYS. The SPANIARDS are overwhelmed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They move forward. Rays of sunlight pierce through the high canopy of leaves, like the roof of a magnificent cathedral. The sounds and smells intoxicate their senses. They are filled with wonder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then PINZON stops. He has seen something. Another stops, then a third, staring ahead of them...
</DIRECTION>
<MENDEZ>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering urgently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arquebuses!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENDEZ>
<DIRECTION>
Several of them raise their weapons to their shoulders, pointing them into the jungle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From COLUMBUS' POV we slowly scan the face of the thick jungle ahead. For a moment we don't see anything -- and then, with a shock, we see the first INDIAN. Naked, painted like an idol, carrying a hunting lance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As if they had materialized from nowhere: the rest of the HUNTING PARTY, with their bows and spears. Silent. Watchful. They stare back at us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SPANIARDS nervously finger their weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS slowly lifts his hand into the air: a clear signal not to fire. Then, removing his sword, he drops it on the ground, and starts to walk forward, fixing his gaze upon the first INDIAN he saw.
</DIRECTION>
<PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
(warningly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colon!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS ignores him, even though some of the INDIANS have raised their weapons. He stops in the no-man's land between them. The INDIANS don't move -- but something excites them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SHIP'S BOY, wearing COLUMBUS' embroidered jacket and the drum, has followed COLUMBUS and now stands close to him. He is the cause of their interest. COLUMBUS puts his arm around the BOY, and this gesture of affection seems to put the INDIANS at their ease. They start talking and pointing. They come forward slowly, start to tentatively touch the BOY'S jacket. Then, now laughing, they touch COLUMBUS, pulling at his beard. COLUMBUS laughs too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sensing their innocence, the rest of the MEN lower their weapons. Some of them laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An apparition: a beautiful young INDIAN GIRL, totally naked, walks out of the jungle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is pregnant and holds a child. We begin to hear Indian music, played on a flute.

EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large post is lifted from the ground by two SPANIARDS pulling on ropes. The post is fixed into position -- and then we see that it is a large wooden cross... The INDIAN VILLAGERS watch the ceremony with some interest and amusement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS looks over at the men and gestures at the INDIANS.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have come here in peace, and we will behave with honor. They are not savages and neither will you be. Treat these people as you would your own wives and your own children. Neither are you free to take what you will; for a seashell you give a bandana. You will respect their beliefs. Pillage will be punished by the whip. Rape by the sword.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VILLAGE - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The smoke from fires. Laughter. Music playing. The INDIANS have prepared food for the SPANIARDS, who are drinking and enjoying themselves in this strange world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS sits with MENDEZ, PINZON, the INDIAN CHIEF, ELDERS OF THE VILLAGE. Other INDIANS stand around, smiling, curious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The INDIANS talk among themselves. The ELDERS smoke primitive cigars -- and offer them, with good humor, to their guests. The SPANIARDS cough and choke at first... and laugh. In return, they offer the INDIANS wine...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dogs roam around the campfires. The WOMEN openly suckle their babies. The MEN are entranced.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PINZON draws out attention, for the first time, to a small gold ornament on the nose of one of the INDIANS. He points to it, indicates his interest in it.
</DIRECTION>
<PINZON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gold...! Gold!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
The INDIANS says the word in his own language, laughing. We see that some of the other INDIANS also have small gold ornaments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PINZON repeats the INDIAN word for gold. The INDIAN removes the ornament from his nose, gives it to PINZON, who indicates that he wants to have it. The INDIAN nods -- but points to PINZON'S dagger, indicating that he wants it in return. PINZON shakes his head, stops the INDIAN from taking it.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
(to Pinzon)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give it to him!
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
PINZON looks at him, about to argue -- but COLUMBUS insists. PINZON takes out the dagger and offers it to the INDIAN.
</DIRECTION>
<PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
(irritated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By God! That's the worst trade of my life!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINZON>
<DIRECTION>
His friends laugh. Innocently, the INDIAN has taken it by the blade. He yelps, looks down at the blood welling up... A moment of tension... Then MENDEZ laughs at his clumsiness, and the ELDERS laugh too... and the INDIAN laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just outside this circle, we see the first INDIAN we saw, squatting on his haunches, watching. This is UTAPAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TENT - DAWN

The first light outside -- the strange, wonderful sounds of the jungle all around. COLUMBUS writes in his journal.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	October 21st, 1492. I think we have returned to Eden. Surely this is how the world once was, before the beginning of time. I believe no man will ever see this land again as we do, for the first time...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up. UTAPAN is squatting in the doorway of the hut. He's been there all night. COLUMBUS takes more ink on his quill and begins to sketch UTAPAN'S face in the margin of his log-book. He draws well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and walks over to UTAPAN and shows him the drawing. It's an electrifying moment. UTAPAN is shocked and amazed. At first he is rather frightened of his own image... Then he is happy, and laughs... and COLUMBUS laughs with him and puts a hand on his shoulder in a gesture of friendship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UTAPAN gets up, and indicates that he too has something he wishes to offer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JUNGLE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UTAPAN expertly scampering through the jungle. COLUMBUS follows him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UTAPAN orders COLUMBUS to sit. COLUMBUS obeys. UTAPAN looks up at the tops of the trees. The sun is rising, and filters through the foliage. As if the time had come, UTAPAN stands up, and COLUMBUS does the same.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gap in the dense vegetation. Something is glittering. Gold. A mass of gold. As they approach, COLUMBUS discovers --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large pool of fresh water. The morning sunlight has turned the water into liquid gold. The surface ripples with the breeze. UTAPAN smiles. It the stranger satisfied? Isn't this what he came for?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS plunges into the pool. As he emerges, he fills his palms with liquid gold.

Wide shot -- A flotilla of canoes are going upstream.

INDIANS AND SPANIARDS are traveling together in the canoes. UTAPAN leads the expedition in COLUMBUS' craft. THE SHIP BOY'S cranium is shaved like UTAPAN'S, and we notice that some other crew members are beardless, some even wearing tribal patterns.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDIAN VILLAGERS confronting the SPANIARDS, UTAPAN talks to an ELDER MAN, watched by COLUMBUS, MENDEZ and PINZON.

UTAPAN repeats several times the word for GOLD, showing some artifacts. The OLD INDIAN shakes his head no, indicating another distant place.

EXT. THICK JUNGLE - CUBA - DAY

RESTING PLACE - ALONSO is seated under a tree. He takes off his boot, and grabs his foot, examining the blisters on his toes. As he puts his foot back into the boot, he jumps screaming in pain.

ALONSO yelps, grasping his ankle.
</DIRECTION>

CLOSE ON a snake sliding out of the empty boot.
</DIRECTION>

While his COMPANIONS rush to him, a SAILOR spots the snake, and decapitates it with his sword. UTAPAN glances at the dead snake. He then goes and kneels -- he sees the bite on ALONSO'S ankle.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help him!

</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
ALONSO is quiet and silent. His eyes are looking around at his companions. UTAPAN shakes his head. There is nothing he can do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALONSO is now leaning back, supported by one of his friends. He has grabbed the forearm of a SAILOR. His look is already far away. His companion shouts at UTAPAN.

EXT. RIVER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing in the stream up to his thighs, A SPANIARD (a gold expert) examines some stones. He then looks up at COLUMBUS and PINZON and just throws the stones back into the water without a word.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The group of SPANIARDS are resting, exhausted by the humidity. Some are drinking from the river, others soak bandanas, and tie them around their necks...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One after another, they stand up slowly -- they look discouraged, tired, and beaten.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOUNTAINOUS JUNGLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UTAPAN and the SPANIARDS are trekking in the hills. Fully armed, they are now suffering intensely from the heat and the vicious insect bites.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS doggedly keeps up with UTAPAN, who tirelessly trots forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, COLUMBUS turns around and sees... nobody. He calls out to UTAPAN.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Utapan! Wait!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
UTAPAN stops obediently, and rushes back to COLUMBUS with comical energy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On their way back, they find one SOLDIER sitting, leaning against a tree. He has removed his helmet. His hair sticking to his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As COLUMBUS and UTAPAN walk back, they find another SAILOR, then another, then the whole group gathered around PINZON. Ashen, he burns with fever. He attempts a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<PINZON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... You'll have to continue without me...

COLUMBUS looks around him -- what he sees: exhausted men and jungle, as far as one can see.

PINZON walks a few yards into the jungle -- starts to urinate. It is red. Suddenly dizzy, he reels and collapses.

EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
A line of SPANIARDS and INDIANS threading their way down a mountainside. PINZON is being carried on a makeshift stretcher. His eyes are closed, his face thick with sweat.

INT. CHIEF GUARIONEX'S HUT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the half-light, figures wreathed in smoke -- COLUMBUS, MENDEZ and UTAPAN watch the CHIEF GUARIONEX putting a Spanish helmet on his head. The helmet is too big, almost covering his eyes. The ELDERS appraise the gift with solemn wonder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In return, GUARIONEX hands COLUMBUS a parcel made of leaves. COLUMBUS unwraps them. Inside: a GOLD grimacing mask. The first real piece of gold. COLUMBUS is unable to conceal his excitement at this first real evidence of the metal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He waits for the CHIEF to speak, but the CHIEF only looks at him. On the ground, we see other presents offered by the SPANIARDS -- trinkets, and necklaces...

UTAPAN translates.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him we will return very soon. Many of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
UTAPAN translates. The CHIEF GUARIONEX asks a simple question.
</DIRECTION>
<UTAPAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chief says -- how many?
	</DIALOGUE>
</UTAPAN>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thousands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<UTAPAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</UTAPAN>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS doesn't seem to understand the question. For the first time he seems to be caught short.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To bring the word of God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<UTAPAN>

And the CHIEF gets up, awards COLUMBUS with a smile, and walks out of the hut, the ELDERS following, leaving COLUMBUS alone.

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a beginning...

EXT. SHORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watched from the shore by the INDIANS and by about forty of the SPANIARDS, who are staying behind, the boats pull out towards the two remaining ships.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PINZON is laid out in the bottom of the boat. COLUMBUS, UTAPAN, and four other INDIANS are in the same boat.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	March 1493... Thirty nine of my men volunteered to stay behind. God willing we will be back in less than a year...

The boats continue to pull away, the figures on the shore growing smaller.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COLUMBUS' CABIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: a golden mask... the lamp in the cabin swings violently back and forth, creating strange shadows, as if the mask was alive... COLUMBUS is writing with difficulty in his log-book.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Several men are ill. We did not find signs of civilization. No cities, no temples... Nothing that resembles Marco Polo's descriptions. My ships are not filled with the spices and the gold that Spain was hoping for. But this land intoxicates the senses like the strongest of perfumes... And all I can think of, is to return to these untamed lands...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the cabin seems to lurch over. Things fall from the table, smashing on the floor... COLUMBUS nearly falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SEA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are in the middle of a violent storm -- of terrifying proportions. The thunder is deafening. Light irradiates the darkness. We see the two caravels, dwarfed by the massive seas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DECK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Five MEN are struggling to lash down the tiller. The deck jumps and rolls. It rises five meters into the air then falls into space and hits the water with a terrible crack. Waves sweep over the decks. We hear desperate cries for mercy from the terrified crew, loud enough to be heard above the storm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS and MENDEZ are crawling towards the mast, along a lifeline.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming to the sailors)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get below! All of you! Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
The MEN start to scramble below decks.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
(to Mendez)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay with me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
The ship rolls again. COLUMBUS and MENDEZ crawl towards the mast. Another gigantic wave crashes over them, tons of water falling like cement. They reach the mast. The wood groans.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We may have to cut it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
MENDEZ nods... COLUMBUS grabs some rope. The ship rises into the air again, crashes down, the deck disappearing beneath them for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll stay here -- to decide if we cut it. Help me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
With MENDEZ'S help, COLUMBUS is tied to the mast: one rope under his arms, the other around his waist. MENDEZ hands him a horn.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
MENDEZ seems to hesitate. COLUMBUS screams at him again.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said -- below deck, Mendez!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
MENDEZ crawls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another huge wave washes over COLUMBUS. He emerges, almost suffocated. The storm rages, its eerie light making it seem at times like bright daylight. But as the lightning flashes, COLUMBUS begins to count:
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One... two... three... four...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
There's an enormous thunderclap on "four" -- it indicates how close they are to the eye of the storm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ship keels over again, dropping down and down, seeming never to rise... COLUMBUS lifts his head to the heavens, screams out:
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
As if in answer, another flash of lightning that illuminates the sky and the sea. COLUMBUS starts counting again.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One... two... three... four... five...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
Another terrible clap of thunder on "five" -- COLUMBUS starts laughing, knowing the storm is moving on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, in the strange light, something seems to move through the air towards him; it looks like some kind of projectile, a craft, with a trail of vapor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS stares up at it... amazed. We start to hear the "Te Deum", majestic and heavenly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CATHEDRAL OF CORDOBA - SPAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS looks up at the vast roof, to see an incense burner, swinging, gliding swiftly across the ceiling, trailing a think vapor of incense.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A magnificent "Te Deum" is being sung -- in honor of COLUMBUS' achievements and return. The whole cathedral is packed with nobles and dignitaries in their gorgeous robes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEATRIX, FERNANDO and DIEGO are staring in fascination at COLUMBUS' triumph -- somewhat separated by the grandeur of this occasion. COLUMBUS passes by, walking proudly down the long central alley, beside KING FERDINAND and QUEEN ISABEL and other GRANDEES. He turns to his family, keeping his eyes on BEATRIX until she is out of his vision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The procession is followed by UTAPAN, and other INDIANS in tribal regalia...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they move through the crowds, all eyes are upon COLUMBUS.

INT. ROOM - SEVILLE (PINZON'S DEATH) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a simple room, a PRIEST finishes giving the Last Rites and a sheet is pulled over the head of MARTIN PINZON. His WIFE and CHILDREN weep at the bedside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CATHEDRAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stool passes from hands to hands. It is placed at the Queen and King's side. COLUMBUS sits on it -- a supreme privilege.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To one side sit AROJAZ and SANCHEZ. AROJAZ leans over to whisper to him.
</DIRECTION>
<AROJAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AROJAZ>
<SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On the contrary, Your Eminence. It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.

</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALCAZAR'S PALACE IN SEVILLE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: the face of a young, SPANISH NOBLEMAN, ADRIAN DE MOXICA. Hesitantly, he brings a lighted cigar to his lips -- then pauses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We discover other people around the magnificent candle-lit table. NOBLE MEN and NOBLE WOMEN. SANCHEZ. COLUMBUS. QUEEN ISABEL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS takes the cigar from MOXICA. The rest watch him with rapt curiosity. COLUMBUS inhales deeply then, to their astonishment, blows out the smoke through his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must not inhale, but simply allow the palate to enjoy the flavor of the Tobacco...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
He hands the cigar back to MOXICA. With a casual air, MOXICA himself inhales deeply -- almost chokes to death. He gulps down a glass of wine... much to the amusement of the others.
</DIRECTION>
<MOXICA>
<DIRECTION>
(deeply embarrassed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you say this is an Indian vice? By God! I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOXICA>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do they have such thoughts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
ISABEL blushes slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't see sin in their nakedness. They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me, Don Colon. But what about gold?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS nods, turns and whispers something to a SERVANT standing just behind his chair. The SERVANT goes to open the door -- and in comes UTAPAN, dressed as a tribesman, carrying a casket. The WOMEN around the table fan themselves furiously at the sight. UTAPAN puts the casket down in front of the QUEEN, and steps back.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are gifts for Your Majesty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
ISABEL opens the casket, revealing the gleam of gold inside. She takes out some of the little golden ornaments... a bracelet and then the mask.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She holds it, somehow moved by its crude beauty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ISABEL raises the mask to her face, looking across at COLUMBUS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The image is somehow powerful enough to reduce even the ARISTOCRATS to silence. She speaks from behind the mask.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are more than gratified.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
The guests laugh obsequiously. COLUMBUS bows a little -- looks up and meets the eyes of SANCHEZ, who is staring at him, coldly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROTUNDA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SWORD MASTER advances towards us with determination, his sword flashing. He is fighting an adversary we do not see, and comments his movements.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Si! Si! Muy bien! Excellente!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Yes! Yes! Good! Excellent!)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We discover the SWORD MASTER is fencing with COLUMBUS. A dozen duellists are practicing in the magnificent rotunda, surrounded with a two-tiered colonnade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of breath, COLUMBUS stops the exercise, and removes his protective canvas padding. He bows at his teacher, who salutes him in return.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS walks to a tressel laden with food and beverages. SANCHEZ, in a fencing outfit and boots, is having a glass of wine. Upon seeing COLUMBUS approaching, he hands him a glass.
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You defend yourself admirably...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... for a commoner?

<DIRECTION>
SANCHEZ laughs and raises his glass.
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To your second expedition.

</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
They drink. A short, somewhat ugly man, with some kind of imposing energy, approach them.
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don Colon -- Don Alonso de Bobadilla. A man who knows our laws.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
BOBADILLA bows.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBADILLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands? Is it not so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBADILLA>
<COLUMBUS>

	Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.

	May I ask by whom?

</BOBADILLA>
<COLUMBUS>

	Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.

SANCHEZ looks at him in surprise. BOBADILLA reddens.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBADILLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I trust they are men of quality.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBADILLA>
<DIRECTION>
BOBADILLA glances at SANCHEZ.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
(amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.

</SANCHEZ>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good! We are also in need of judges. Except there are no thieves!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
A grin disfigures the face of BOBADILLA.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBADILLA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Sanchez)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see I was mistaken. Don Colon has no need for my services...

And he walks off. SANCHEZ fills his mouth with a slice of ham.

	You seem to have a special talent for making friends.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What...? Do I have so many already?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<SANCHEZ>

	<DIALOGUE>
	To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.

INT. ROOM - ADMINISTRATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS with two MEN: the oldest, around thirty, is a strong-looking man. The youngest, no more than twenty five, is thin and fit. There is obvious tension in the room. These are BARTOLOME and GIACOMO COLON, COLUMBUS' brothers. BARTOLOME is angry, and GIACOMO thoughtful.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTOLOME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You might have given us a choice!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTOLOME>
<GIACOMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bartolome is stronger, more capable than I will ever be...

</GIACOMO>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need both of you. What are you afraid of? We are living what we always dreamt of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<GIACOMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I never shared those dreams with you.

COLUMBUS looks at them with such pained surprise...

EXT. GALLERY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The large gallery courtyard is crowded with PEOPLE -- applicants for the voyage. As COLUMBUS appears, they all press forward, calling out his name, trying to get his attention, touching his sleeves as if he were a saint. They crowd around COLUMBUS and his BROTHERS. COLUMBUS nods, murmurs vaguely, here and there...
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course... Of course... We'll see to it... Yes... Thank you... Soon... Soon...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
Fighting their way through, the BOTHERS press their way, reaching the other side of the gallery. We get glimpses of the incredible activity down below. ADMINISTRATORS, MILITARIES, MERCHANTS are busy around tressels covered with documents, plans, maps... preparing the second expedition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS puts his arms around them.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating the applicants)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now -- you tell me. Who can I trust?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(almost amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're brothers! We must be a House. A bloodline! In this country one can't exist alone! I need you...! Both of you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
He walks then to the balustrade. The cries from the courtyard down below subside... some of the applicants begin to look up, aware of his presence.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is the Admiral? Has anyone seen the Admiral?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is here! What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
He leans over the balcony. In the middle of the overcrowded courtyard, the SOLDIER who was shouting is brandishing a document.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Admiral! The horses have arrived.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I saw them! Who did we hire today?

</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ASSISTANT raises his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ASSISTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirty blacksmiths, twenty eight halberdiers, twenty carpenters, a hundred farmers, twenty miners... and Doctor Chanca, the royal surgeon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSISTANT>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The royal surgeon? Then we can count on royal health!

The whole courtyard bursts out laughing.

EXT. ORANGERY - VICEROY'S HOUSE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
UTAPAN is lying in his hammock. FERNANDO turns him over. UTAPAN falls to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS walks beside BEATRIX.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>

(looking at his son)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's growing up!

BEATRIX smiles, nods. They walk on.

<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beatrix, I want to ask you something.

	You don't usually ask.

(after a pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.

BEATRIX stops in her tracks, looks at him.

<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is a great honor. We could not hope for anything better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
BEATRIX nods, but bites her lip, and looks back at FERNANDO.
</DIRECTION>
<BEATRIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For once I wish you weren't right.

COLUMBUS puts his arm around her waist, pulling her closer, they move away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FAR END OF THE ORANGERY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FERNANDO is now swinging expertly in the hammock. UTAPAN is pushing him gently. He slowly straightens up to watch COLUMBUS and BEATRIX disappear, somehow sensing there is a dilemma. FERNANDO noticing UTAPAN'S reaction, turns to his parents. The arbor is empty. FERNANDO becomes pensive.

We become aware of the rustling of the jungle.

EXT. BEACH AND EDGE OF JUNGLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEN spread along the beach, looking towards the jungle. COLUMBUS stands beside his BROTHERS, and MENDEZ, and UTAPAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOXICA, astride a magnificent black horse, prances back and forth across the sand. All are waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A signal cannon is fired from one of the ships. Birds scatter into the air from the jungle -- but then silence, complete and ominous. COLUMBUS stares into the jungle. Nothing. No one to greet them -- no welcoming party from the MEN they left behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS glances at MENDEZ.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MENDEZ looks at him, but can't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOXICA suddenly spurs on his horse, and guides it into the trees. The order is given for the rest to follow, fanning out as they do so, weapons at the ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CLEARING - JUNGLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ruins. The camp has been burned to ashes. A strange sight: arrows are stuck vertically into the ground, each with a moldering tuft of human hair attached to the flight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In silence the SOLDIERS pick their way through the devastation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ground is littered with coconuts. Kicking one over with his shoe, a SOLDIER discovers that his coconut is actually a human skull. The gaping mouth has been filled to the brim with gold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But of the living, there is no sign.
</DIRECTION>
<MOXICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this your new world, Don Colon?

COLUMBUS looks around in dismay. A YOUNG NOBLEMAN, HERNANDO DE GUEVARA, takes out his sword.
</DIRECTION>
<GUEVARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These animals should be shown what savagery can be!
	</DIALOGUE>

Other SPANIARDS join in, repeating this last word.

He walks among them.

	You want a war? Fine. We are a thousand. They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill? Which tribe?

</COLUMBUS>
<MOXICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't need to know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOXICA>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We came here to stay! To build! Not to start a crusade. In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days! So we will be brave and swallow our grief. And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.

EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOXICA mounted on his magnificent BLACK STALLION canters to the edge of the deserted village and enters the village. UTAPAN is terrorized by the absence of anything living.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All we can hear is the breathing of the horse. The animal, an impressive mass of muscle, prances nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UTAPAN calls out in dialect.
</DIRECTION>
<UTAPAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UTAPAN>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, they begin to appear, one after the other -- materializing from the jungle. Shy and scared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stare at this "Centaur" (the HORSE and the HORSEMAN seem to be one -- a God).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To impress them even more, MOXICA makes the beast move sideways and backwards, rearing, its front hoofs pawing the air. THE INDIANS retreat in terror, except for one, who stands his ground, brandishing his lance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UTAPAN encourages the YOUNG WARRIOR to approach the centaur. He places his hand onto the shoulder of the animal. The muscles shudder. THE INDIAN jumps back comically, accompanied by the rest of the tribe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without warning, MOXICA climbs down from the saddle. More INDIANS step back in fear and absolute astonishment. Now more have ventured from the jungle. The bravest of them approach MOXICA, daring to touch him, and the horse, retreating then touching until they fill the compound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At this moment, COLUMBUS and his SOLDIERS appear all around them, pointing their muskets, and their crossbows. A moment of tension.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS walks forward, towards the CHIEF (GUARIONEX) we meet before.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ask the Chief what happened to my men?

EXT. WATERMILL AND DAM UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is raining hard. COLUMBUS is floundering in the mud, supervising a mixed work-force of SPANISH and INDIANS. They are attempting to raise the huge wheel of a watermill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Despite COLUMBUS' shouts of encouragement, it's clear the wheel is far too heavy and the mud too deep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close by, on horseback, MOXICA watches the scene. COLUMBUS, plastered with wet mud, clambers out of the pit and approaches him.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don Moxica -- we need your horse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>

MOXICA looks down at the sodden, dirty figure.

	We can't raise the wheel without it.

He starts to turn away; COLUMBUS grabs hold of the reins.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me, Don Moxica. But it was your horse I was talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. MOXICA stares down at an equally determined COLUMBUS. Then, in front of everyone, MOXICA has to dismount, and suffer the disgrace of it.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Don Moxica.

Water thundering into the new canal. The huge wheel begins to turn. The MEN cheer and congratulate each other. MOXICA looks at his mud-splattered and foaming horse, his eyes full of hatred.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY OF ISABEL - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wide, high shot of the new "City", dominated by a huge wooden cross -- no more than a muddy main street bordered by a hundred bamboo and stone shanties, with candles burning in the doorways. A main square with the Governor's Mansion, and the foundations of a church.
</DIRECTION>

In the twilight, COLUMBUS and the other WORKERS returning, dirty and tired.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. VERANDA OF MOXICA'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT

MOXICA and GUEVARA sit out on the "veranda", watching the MEN return. MOXICA raises his glass in an ironic salute.
</DIRECTION>
<MOXICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To the Governor of the Mosquitoes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOXICA>
<DIRECTION>
They laugh. We see the smoke and flames from a fire. Four or five INDIANS are squatting on the earth nearby, cooking for them, talking quietly in their own language.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOXICA calls out something in their language, and a naked YOUNG INDIAN GIRL comes out of the house, bringing more wine. GUEVARA stares at her lasciviously. MOXICA, letting his hand casually brush against her flank, smiles at him.
</DIRECTION>
<MOXICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOXICA>
<DIRECTION>
He turns the GIRL round so that GUEVARA can admire her properly. GUEVARA nods. MOXICA lets the GIRL go with a peremptory order, and she disappears back inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUEVARA suddenly stands up -- unsteadily -- and sweeping his arm round in a broad gesture, says ironically:

INT. DINING ROOM - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In an already Spanish-colonel dining room, COLUMBUS is having dinner with his brothers, BARTOLOME and GIACOMO, served by an INDIAN WOMAN -- NIMA. GIACOMO eats with gusto.
</DIRECTION>
<GIACOMO>
<DIRECTION>
(as Nima pours the wine)

Seeing GIACOMO'S sudden blush and discomfort, as NIMA smiles at him, the other BROTHERS laugh.

To cover his embarrassment, GIACOMO returns to the topic of the food.

COLUMBUS eats a mouthful, glances at BARTOLOME.

A look of horror crosses GIACOMO'S face; he wretches slightly, puts down his fork, and gulps down some wine. The BROTHERS laugh again.

EXT. BALCONY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are drinking and smoking cigars. From the balcony they can see the dark mass of the jungle stretching away. GIACOMO is already dozing in his chair. BARTOLOME sees it, and elbows COLUMBUS. They both smile at their younger brother's exhaustion. Then COLUMBUS gets up and leans on the balustrade, looking down at the city, the jungle beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much gold have we found?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<BARTOLOME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not enough to justify a single shipment.

In the gloomy interior of the long hut, in the most primitive conditions, DOZENS OF SPANIARDS lie sick. On a segregated part of the room are the INDIANS, several coughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are attended by a doctor, DOCTOR CHANCA, BROTHER BUYL, and other NOVICES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A NOVICE attends to an INDIAN, gently lifting his head, helping him to drink -- there is so little they can do.

BROTHER BUYL looks down at the body of a SPANIARD, covered in open sores. The NOVICE joins him.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is in a ward full of patients, attended by a DOCTOR, SANCHEZ and other members of her court.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The patients are emaciated, their faces and bodies covered with virulent sores. NUNS move between the beds.

Excavations carved into a hillside.

It is a blisteringly hot day. At the foot of the hill, GIACOMO sits at a table beneath an awning, with MOXICA and several CLERKS. ONE HUNDRED FIFTY INDIANS standing in line at the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In turn, they hand over a small quantity of gold. The CLERK weighs it on a scale, and notes down each contribution.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOXICA impatiently gestures the INDIANS to move faster with a thonged crop. An INDIAN approaches the table. He is nervous. He doesn't produce anything. The INDIAN shakes his head, gesticulates, starts to speak rapidly.

THE FOUR INDIANS catch him, and force him to lay on the ground. THE MAN struggles, his eyes rolling in terror. TWO INDIANS force his mouth open. A THIRD ONE kneels and starts stuffing it with gold dust. THE SOLDIER chokes and suffocates.

THE WOMAN still stands half naked against the wall, terrified. AN INDIAN takes his knife from his leggings, slowly. She starts sobbing and imploring in her language. THE INDIAN slowly walks to her, and plants the knife in the lower part of her belly.

PAIRS of bloody red legs hanging still, high in the air.

A DOZEN SPANIARDS have been crucified on the scaffolding of the excavations. Some hands and noses have been removed.

UTAPAN is standing, uncomfortable among the SPANIARDS.

Watched by the other ARISTOCRATS, MOXICA sets fire to the parchment he has rolled up. He blows the flames from the torch onto the model. Fire races up and down the streets of the miniature, as if burning the city of Isabel.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS leads his party of SOLDIERS through the jungle, looking for the MUTINEERS.

They reach the river -- scan the far bank. Nothing. COLUMBUS nods. His MEN start to enter the river, led by a HALBERDIER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Others follow, wading across, their weapons held above their heads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A crossbow arrow pierces the HALBERDIER. Without a cry he falls forward into the water, and is carried away by the current.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two more MEN are hit. One cries out, thrashes around in the water, an arrow protruding from his side. The river stained with blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still no sign of the enemy. COLUMBUS' MEN nevertheless start to return fire from the bank, creating a shield... others continue to wade across the river. A MUTINEER is shot down from the branches of a tree...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first MEN come ashore. Musket fire. An exchange of arrows. COLUMBUS is now wading across. The MAN next to him is killed, and carried away by the current.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, on the far shore, the enemy have shown themselves. There is hand to hand fighting, with swords and other weapons. MOXICA kills one of COLUMBUS' men -- but his own are outnumbered and outmatched. Already, some are beginning to surrender.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the midst of the fighting, COLUMBUS, sword drawn, pulls himself out of the river: A MUTINEER lunges at him. COLUMBUS kills him with a thrust of his sword -- and walks forward into the jungle. He spots MOXICA at the foot of a cliff.

MOXICA bursts out of the undergrowth. He is at the edge of emptiness, swept by a violent offshore wind. He turns frantically, to see COLUMBUS coming up behind him.

CLOSE ON COLUMBUS' expressionless face.

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MUTINEER -- his face is white, he is crying and trembling. His arms are tied behind his back. He is held fast, a rope is put around his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS, sitting not far away beside his BROTHERS, gives a signal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drums begin to beat. BROTHER BUYL looks on impassive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A grimace suddenly transform THE YOUNG MAN'S face. He is being garroted -- his throat crushed with a rope. The YOUNG MAN'S feet dance frenziedly. We hear the choking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The drums cease. BROTHER BUYL crosses himself and murmurs a prayer, deeply distraught. GIACOMO has covered his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wider view shows the bodies of three other ARISTOCRATS from the rebellion, attached to chairs affixed to a pole, their heads straight, the rope still tight around their necks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Justice has been done. The members of the COUNCIL rise in silence, COLUMBUS stands up.

EXT. ISABEL - QUAYSIDE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON several large wooden cages. Inside we see the INDIANS that COLUMBUS captured. They are packed together. They stare out with vacant eyes. SOLDIERS guard them. A ship against the pier. BUYL at his side, COLUMBUS stares at the INDIANS.
</DIRECTION>
<BROTHER_BUYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish to go back with them, Don Colon. I have no desire to remain in this godless place.

	You may do as you please, Brother Buyl -- though your departure will not help me to make it more Godly.

<DIRECTION>
BROTHER BUYL looks at him, almost with astonishment.
</DIRECTION>
<BROTHER_BUYL>

	You treat Christians equally with heathen savages. You execute members of the nobility. And what do you offer in return?

Against the livid horizon, three black waterspouts join the sky to the sea. A gust of wind disturbs the roof of the jungle.

INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind grows stronger. Doors bang inside the building... a melancholy sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS sits on the balcony with his BROTHERS. They are silent. After a few moments, COLUMBUS begins to speak quietly, almost as if he were speaking to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps hope only exists in the journey. When it begins, everything is still possible -- every expectation; every dream...

The sky is dark and threatening, the wind even stronger. We find COLUMBUS where we left him, but now alone. He has sat here all night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shutters bang violently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up -- and sees a few yards from him: the naked FIGURE OF AN INDIAN, his face and body painted, staring at him. COLUMBUS realizes who it is...
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Utapan!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
UTAPAN is still and silent. A strange and mysterious figure now.

	Utapan, won't you speak to me? You used to know how to speak to me.

EXT. SQUARE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind is whipping the trees now, stronger and stronger. Groups of INDIANS look up at the sky. Then, above the sound of the wind, they hear another noise. Like a collective murmur, almost in one voice, the INDIANS repeat, over and over.

	Urracan... Urracan... Urracan... Urracan...

With a loud thunderclap, the storm suddenly breaks. In a few seconds it has risen to violent proportions, and the landscape is drenched in torrential rain. The wind doubles its strength... and all hell breaks loose...
</DIRECTION>

EXT. CITY OF ISABEL - DAY

Timbers creak and strain. COLUMBUS, BARTOLOME, MENDEZ and a DOZEN other MEN are trying to save the dam.

Suddenly, frighteningly, the dam begins to crash.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Let it go! Let it go!

COLUMBUS' face is covered in dried mud.

We are back to the first scene. In the vast, opulent, glittering room, ISABEL listens impassively to the voice of SANCHEZ. Also present, other GRANDEES, representatives of the church and state.

<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... But there is worse. He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...

	Yes, Your Majesty. It is all true. I saw it with my own eyes.

A pause. ISABEL seems to struggle inwardly with her emotions. SANCHEZ waits, expressionless, but on the point of victory.

<ISABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?

FIVE MEN on HORSEBACK, dressed in fashionable clothes, canter down what used to be the main street of Isabel. Through some has been rebuilt, the effects of the hurricane are still visible...

People look at them curiously. We see them stop near the Governor's mansion. The MEN dismount and walk into the Palace.
</DIRECTION>

One of the MEN in black clothes removes his hat and steps forward. We recognize him as ALONSO DE BOBADILLA, the man COLUMBUS humiliated at the rotunda.

COLUMBUS is sitting at his desk, studying plans with GIACOMO. Some other MEMBERS of the COUNCIL are with them.

All is dark. We can just make out COLUMBUS' face as he lies on the hard bed. He is sweating heavily; his beard is filthy and matted, like his hair. He looks feverish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A key turns in the lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The JAILER lets in two fashionably dressed YOUNG MEN. COLUMBUS, blinking in the light, turns his head to stare at them. His eyes are reddened with infection at the corners. The YOUNG MEN come forward into the light.

There's a new excitement in COLUMBUS' voice. He walks over to the table. The candlelight illuminates maps, charts, drawings, figures...

He drops to his knees before her. This time she walks towards him, clearly moved by his white-hair, and other signs of physical deterioration.

Her hand hovers over his head, as if it means to console him. Her hand is dying to comfort. But instead, she offers her hand for him to kiss.

	Rise... Please...

COLUMBUS starts to interrupt; she stops him with a gesture.

	I owe you everything, Santangel... but as you see, I can't repay you.
	</DIALOGUE>

COLUMBUS leans against the rail next to him, staring out at the darkness. Then looks at his SON again. FERNANDO won't give in to the sickness, but COLUMBUS knows he'd feel better if he did.

FERNANDO shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swallow a piece of pork fat on a string. It always worked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
At the thought of the pork fat, FERNANDO jerks his head over the side, and vomits copiously. COLUMBUS smiles, pats him on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHIP'S DECK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it plows through heavy seas. COLUMBUS, a coat wrapped around him, is sitting on a chair topside, directing operations despite an obvious fever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a cry from the mast head:
</DIRECTION>
<SAILOR>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tierra...! Tierra!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAILOR>
<DIRECTION>
SAILORS and FERNANDO rush to the side of the ship, peering through the spray. FERNANDO wipes his eyes, and then he sees it: there in the distance, a speck of land.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FERNANDO and his FATHER stand together, watching the low cloud formation sitting on the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The mainland...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
FERNANDO looks excited. Discreetly, COLUMBUS watches his SON, enjoying his happiness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PANAMA (SURREAL IMAGES) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A most wonderful and surreal image. A heavy mist lies over the forest. We move above it slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FIGURE emerges from the mist. At first only a silhouette -- then, slowly, a golden figure... an INDIAN, covered in gold... gold artifacts, golden paste on his body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GOLDEN FIGURE turns, and points, into an unknown distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TREEHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the INDIAN treehouse, COLUMBUS, FERNANDO, MENDEZ and several INDIANS are gazing west over a necklace of magnificent lakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The INDIANS point and talk gently. FERNANDO has never seen anything so fresh, so beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMP - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A magnificent sunset. A fire is burning, food cooking. COLUMBUS looks over his maps, trying to figure out where they are. We see the outline of the continent of Asia. An OLD INDIAN squats beside him, silent, also looking at the map. Then, slowly and very deliberately, he takes a piece of charcoal from the fire and begins to draw on the map. Ignoring the Asian continent, he sketches the Panamanian coastline -- an isthmus. MENDEZ and FERNANDO gather round. COLUMBUS watches the OLD INDIAN with initial puzzlement, then growing excitement.
</DIRECTION>
<MENDEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's he doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENDEZ>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<MENDEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENDEZ>
<DIRECTION>
FERNANDO is still confused. The OLD INDIAN continues to sketch, talking quietly all the time. An INDIAN TRANSLATOR listens.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me what he's saying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<TRANSLATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says -- water on the other side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANSLATOR>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ask him if he means a lake. A big lake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
The TRANSLATOR asks. The OLD INDIAN shakes his head, laughs, points to the west, way beyond the other lakes, emphatically.
</DIRECTION>
<TRANSLATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Says those are lakes. Water on other side big -- as wide as here. Above and below, much land.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANSLATOR>
<COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
(stunned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An ocean...? He's says it's an ocean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<FERNANDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERNANDO>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS is too stunned for a moment to explain. The INDIANS laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then COLUMBUS takes the charcoal, and begins to draw on the map, for his son.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here is Europe... and over here, the continent of Asia. But there's something in between! Another continent! We've found... another continent!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
FERNANDO stares west, then back at his FATHER. COLUMBUS looks very feverish, his face bathed with sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<FERNANDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERNANDO>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There must be a passage to that other ocean.

INT. SHIP - COLUMBUS' CABIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS, feverish, lies on the bunk. He shivers violently. FERNANDO anxiously watches over him, bathes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly THE TRANSLATOR enters.
</DIRECTION>
<TRANSLATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANSLATOR>
<DIRECTION>
A little reluctantly, FERNANDO lets him go to his FATHER. The INDIAN crouches over the bed, takes out a handful of leaves from a pouch. He chews the leaves himself for a moment, until they form a sticky pulp, then opens COLUMBUS' mouth and puts the pulp inside, encouraging COLUMBUS to chew with the motions of his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS chews, quickly falling asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOONLIT VISION OF VAST LAND MASS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see things from COLUMBUS' hallucination. We are plunging through layers of clouds, the speed accelerating, giving us a sickening sensation of falling to land, closer and closer...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS wakes up with a jolt. Everything is silent. COLUMBUS walks outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DECK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS' fever has subsided. He raises his head and stares at the mainland passing in the night. He smiles.

EXT. RIVER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two canoes going upstream, deeper and deeper into the jungle.

EXT. JUNGLE AND VILLAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smoke rises lazily above the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boats reaching the bank. THE FIRST HUTS of a village. THE SOLDIERS spread out into the empty village.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FERNANDO, COLUMBUS and MENDEZ preceded by TWO ARMED SOLDIERS enter one of the huts. The remains of a meal is still warm in bowls on the matted floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A famished SOLDIER dips his hand in one of the bowls and devours its contents: some kind of stew. Stepping back accidentally, FERNANDO bumps into a large earthen jar behind him. It rolls and crashes, revealing the remains of meat marinating in liquid. There is something disturbing about the appearance of the content.
</DIRECTION>
<FERNANDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERNANDO>
<DIRECTION>
The remains of human beings.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
(approaching)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at the remains, stunned. THE SOLDIER stops chewing. He drops the half-empty bowl he was still holding. He runs at the back door, rams his fingers deep in the back of his throat, and vomits.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Virgen Maria... Oh Madre de Dios...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Oh Virgin Mary... Oh Mother of God...)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But as he vomits and cries, he notices:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HEADLESS HUMAN TRUNK spread open, like a sheep carcass. Disturbed flies rise in clouds.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>

COLUMBUS and the SPANIARDS meet in the center of the village. All have made the same horrific discovery.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>

(urgently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out! Get out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
THE SPANIARDS back out of the village, crossbows pointed at the invisible enemy hidden in the jungle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are running through the dense forest for the river bank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CANNIBALS materialize among the trees, running alongside. Bounding, skipping, frightening FIGURES, their brutal faces painted in black. They release arrows at the running SOLDIERS. A SOLDIER stops, kneels to the ground, fires his crossbow and kills one of the CANNIBALS... but he is pierced by a spear. TWO CANNIBALS drag him and cut his throat to finish him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE -- CRIES AND CONFUSION, SPANIARDS and CANNIBALS moving in hand to hand combat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CANNIBAL comes sprinting at FERNANDO, brandishing his lance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS jumps on the man, and plants a knife in his abdomen. Blinded in sweat, he stabs the CANNIBAL, who collapses. Frenzied, COLUMBUS stabs over and over again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops and looks at his forearm -- soaked in blood. Shocked by his own fury, he raises his hand and stares at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GIANT BLACK BUTTERFLY alights gently on his bloody fingers, COLUMBUS staring fascinated at its palpitating wings. FERNANDO, screaming at his FATHER, drags him to his feet. They run...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SPANIARDS, COLUMBUS, MENDEZ, FERNANDO... all running hard to the boat. ARROWS whistle around them as they leap into the canoes, nearly capsizing them, launching them into the current.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOME CANNIBALS still follow them along the riverbank. But the canoes are faster, and soon, they are left behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHIP AT SEA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Endless seascape, the caravel plowing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHIP'S DECK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FERNANDO is crouched on the poop deck, wrapped in a blanket. He seems in a state of shock: he is pale and shaking. As COLUMBUS goes and sits near his son, he hands him a flask of alcohol.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
(kindly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it. Come on. Drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
As COLUMBUS insists, brandishing the flask, FERNANDO notices that his hands are shaking too. His FATHER'S forehead is dripping with sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FERNANDO drinks a gulp and grimaces. He drinks again and hands the flask back to his FATHER, who does the same. FERNANDO notices dried blood on his FATHER'S fingers. COLUMBUS immediately hides his hand and stands.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... I have to see Mendez.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
Then, with sudden anger.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your brother was right. I should have never taken you with me. I'll never forgive myself. Never!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
He walks a few steps, lurches, and has to lean against the rail. He raises his hand to his eyes, grimacing in pain, as if they were burning. FERNANDO scrambles to his feet and rushes to him. COLUMBUS' eyes are already fixed somewhere -- fever is eating him up.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you ever forgive me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
FERNANDO turns around for help.

COLUMBUS is lying on his couch. FERNANDO is bathing his eyes, sweeping off the pus that continuously forms in them. COLUMBUS is drenched in sweat.

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FERNANDO is writing under his FATHER'S dictation.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came to Your Highness with honest purpose and sincere zeal. I did not undertake these voyages for honor or wealth -- that is certain. After years of service to the Crown, I do not have a roof to put over my head... Your Majesty allowed me to explore the continent, believed to be Asia. I now believe that it is an new Land, of unknown proportions and wealth... Life has more imagination than we carry in our dreams...

<DUENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I should be judged as a Seaman who by Divine Will discovered a New World, and thereby placed it under the sovereignty of Your Majesties. I humbly beseech Your Majesties that if it pleases God to remove me hence, you will help the name of Columbus to be remembered with honor... Weep for me, whoever has charity, truth and justice."

An ivory-sculptured hand -- the end of the back scratcher belonging to AROJAZ -- indicates a line across a large globe: the route between Europe and America.

<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The sunset route to the new continent is now well-established...

</AROJAZ>
<DIRECTION>
We see a large amphitheater, filled with PEOPLE attending a lecture of "Nova Geographica" -- the new geography.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AROJAZ stands in front of the assembly. Facing him, enthroned, is KING FERDINAND, surrounded by COURTIERS, including SANCHEZ.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We slowly move across the arena, passing attentive faces.
</DIRECTION>
<AROJAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... West by south west for 750 leagues to Santo Domingo. From there, west north west, leaving San Juan to the north, reaching the island of Hispanola on the northern cape of San Raphael... Then onto the mainland, at the Cape called Gracias a Dios...

Around the KING, on horseback, surrounded by the KNIGHTS, a CROWD is kept back by SOLDIERS. AROJAZ is mounting his horse. SANCHEZ is waiting for him.

COLUMBUS stands among the students at the back of the CROWD.

ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a very old man now, is taking a siesta next to his grapes. He is sitting in a simple armchair, a rosary wrapped around his fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The presence of someone wakes him. After a moment, he recognizes COLUMBUS and smiles. Both MEN are very moved.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose we're both old men now.

</MARCHENA>

<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever forgiven me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
MARCHENA nods his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I forgave you a long time ago. You see, I was proud of you. You were like a willful child. You wouldn't accept what others told you. You had to find things out for yourself, hurting yourself -- and others -- in the process.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHENA>
<DIRECTION>
MARCHENA looks at his plants, sighs contentedly.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you remember when you said that people talk about the world, but never leave their gardens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHENA>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS nods.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCHENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More than ever I wonder what it is we do achieve by leaving our gardens... The world changes -- and yet it seems the same. We find new worlds, but fill them with the same people...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHENA>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses, looks across at COLUMBUS, smiles again gently. MARCHENA, tiring, leans back in his chair, and looks up towards the sun.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>

EXT. BEATRIX'S HOUSE BALCONY - EVENING

<DIRECTION>
FERNANDO is sitting in front of his FATHER, examining documents and letters. COLUMBUS has wrapped a shawl around his legs. He looks even older now, with his mass of pure white hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEATRIX comes out with a tray, carrying grapes and a decanter of water. She places it on a small table near COLUMBUS and touches his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she is ready to return inside the house, he holds her back.

FERNANDO looks up at them above his letters, amused and slightly embarrassed. COLUMBUS looks at him with a fake air of reproach.

<COLUMBUS>

</COLUMBUS>
<FERNANDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not listening, Father. But I can't help hearing.

FERNANDO opens a letter and reads it quickly.

<FERNANDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Diego... He is at the Court, with Santangel... He says they hope to get your privileges restored... And maybe the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERNANDO>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMBUS smiles and nods -- all this seems to be of very little importance to him now.
</DIRECTION>
<COLUMBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But how is he? And Dona Maria?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLUMBUS>
<DIRECTION>
FERNANDO continues to read.
</DIRECTION>
<FERNANDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine, it seems. Diego is thinking of starting a pearl trade, in Santo Domingo... He says he received many letters for you. Some of your men, mostly.

He opens one of them, glances at it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father. From the beginning. Everything.

COLUMBUS sighs, and leans back on his chair. His eyes are fixed somewhere, searching. Then, almost in a murmur.

We see the page. FERNANDO writes: ... I REMEMBER...

THE LONE SILHOUETTE of an INDIAN emerges from the dense foliage. He runs down the beach towards the surf. He stops and seems to be staring at us.

These words appear on the screen:
