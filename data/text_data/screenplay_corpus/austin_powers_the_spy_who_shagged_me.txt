<DR_EVIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's more of a nub, really. The spine just goes on a little longer than it should. Also, I've dabbled. I mean, perform fellatio once and you're a poet, twice and you're a homosexual. I remember once I was being fisted by Sebastian Cabot- but here's where the story gets interesting. He was lactose-intolerant. He could eat red meat all night long, but one sip of milk and it was gastric hell. And I remember we were caught in fragrance delicto by Henry Kissinger, and you can imagine my humiliation at having Hank hear me say, "Mr. French, no teeth." One of my greatest disappointments is that I never became a song and dance man. I could have been a quadruple threat, kind of like a despotic Ken Barry. Dancer, singer, actor, and I would possess nuclear weapons, the latter being the most threatening of the four. I once sat on a bus and tried to will myself a menstrual cycle. All I ended up with was a sense of failure and a mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth and perhaps a grudging respect for the weaker sex. I love toe cleavage. For the most part I distrust dogs. I slept in a horse once. It was quite roomy. On second thought, it was the Ritz. I named my left testicle 'piss' and my right testicle 'vinegar'. I wrote "It's Raining Men", or so the Christmas babies told me. Oh yes, I also made a Marzipan voodoo effigy of The Fonze while I was in coma after smoking some Peruvian prayer hash, but who at the end of the day can honestly say they haven't done that?

	So, Basil, if I travel back to 1969 and I was frozen in 1967, I could go look at my frozen self. But, if I'm still frozen in 1967, how could I have been unthawed in the 90's and traveled back to the Sixties?

FLASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - LONDON -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Beetle time machine appears out of nowhere and screeches to a stop. A London HIPPIE smoking a hukka watches. He throws the hukka down. Austin hops out.
</DIRECTION>
<AUSTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel better already, man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUSTIN>

Austin smiles and we see that his teeth are back to being TERRIBLE. He walks off as a crowd gathers around the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARK - LONDON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Austin enters the park in high spirits. We PULL BACK to see that Austin is being watched through binoculars by a big ARYAN ASSASSIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal a beautiful MYSTERIOUS WOMAN watching both of them. From this distance we can't tell who she is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sign reads "BE-IN FOR PEACE". HIPPIES, MODS, and FREAKS of all descriptions dance to the music of a PSYCHEDELIC BAND. The band's name is on the drum kit: "MING TEA."
</DIRECTION>
<AUSTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, baby, a swinging shin-dig!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUSTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Austin gets into the dancing, quickly becoming the center of the scene. The lead singer of the band invites him on stage and hands him the microphone as the band starts a new song: "SEXUAL REVOLUTION."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Austin begins singing and a choreographed musical number begins involving the outdoor crowd a la Bob Fosse's Sweet Charity or Hair.
</DIRECTION>
<AUSTIN>

	</DIALOGUE>
</AUSTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Three GROOVY CHICKS behind Austin suddenly have tambourines for the big finale. The assassin and the mysterious woman are both in the audience, keeping an eye on Austin. All we see of the woman are shots of her BOOTS, CLOTHES, and a FEMALE SYMBOL MEDALLION.
</DIRECTION>
<AUSTIN>

The SONG ENDS and all the dancers end up on one knee with their arms outstretched, panting. Austin breathes heavily and smiles smugly like Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are TIGHT ON Austin's ass. PULL BACK to see that it is the MYSTERIOUS WOMAN who is watching Austin's ass. She SMILES behind the binoculars hiding her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
37 EXT. CARNABY ST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Austin walks down the street looking at his new BEATLES ALBUM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting in a parked Citroen watching him is the ASSASSIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Aryan assassin nods to a SHOE-SHINE on the street.
</DIRECTION>

The shoe-shine boy nods to a BUSINESS MAN in a Homburg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The business man nods to a BOBBY.

<DIRECTION>
The mime nods to a BLIND BEGGAR with a tin cup.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blind beggar nods to a CARPENTER on a roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The carpenter FLASHES A LIGHT to an INDIAN CHIEF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Indian Chief gives a SMOKE SIGNAL to a TELEGRAPH OPERATOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The telegraph operator sends a signal to the BEEFEATER GUARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Beefeater salutes with his pike to a SEXY TICKET COLLECTOR on a double-decker bus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sexy ticket collector signals a TAXI DRIVER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The taxi driver nods back to the assassin as he drives by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CITROEN

<DIRECTION>
The assassin gets the signal and starts the car. The whole nodding sequence was a circular waste of time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - VARIOUS ANGLES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Austin walks along. Suddenly, he sees the Citroen coming at him. He dives out of the way and takes off running. He rounds a corner and pretends to be a COUPLE MAKING OUT against a wall by hugging himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The assassin sees him and slams on the brakes. He raises his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Austin turns as he hears a car HONK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Austin's BEETLE CONVERTIBLE. The mysterious woman steps out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see her in her entirety for the first time, and what a sight it is. She has long auburn hair and wears a tight racing suit, unzipped just enough to show the female symbol medallion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is FELICITY SHAGWELL.

Felicity lies on her stomach. Austin begins to massage her.

	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is the Guru Pitka. I am a spiritual teacher and I have combined many disparate disciplines into a unified movement of human potentiality and equipoise that I learned from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who died mysteriously of a disease that strangely had all the hallmarks of syphilis. He would say to me, Sparky, love is all, life is breath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GURU_PITKA>
<DISCIPLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahhhhhh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DISCIPLES>
<GURU_PITKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, perhaps you are wondering where I got the nickname Sparky. Well, when we were young we used to play a game called "Stinkmop". We would urinate into a bucket, dip a mop into it, and play tag. I did not care for "Stinkmop" and a very wise old man said to me 'oh lighten up, Sparky', and I don't know, the name kind of stuck.

<DISCIPLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahhhhhhhh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DISCIPLES>
<GURU_PITKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, the reason I am a spiritualist instead of a therapist is that 'therapist' often becomes 'the rapist' and that will not help us attain potentiality. Now what is potentiality? It is the ability to achieve those goals that we wish to achieve for ourselves. People often say to me that they feel "nowhere", and I am going to change that to "Now here."

Just then, Austin looks into her eyes and sees the REFLECTION OF AN ASSASSIN (Oedipus) about to throw a knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as he throws it, Austin spins Robin Swallows around and USES HER AS A SHIELD. She takes the knife squarely in the back.

Oedipus throws down his gun and charges Austin. Austin uses Robin's body to block Oedipus's head butt, but his momentum pushes all three of them through a PLATE GLASS WINDOW of his second story loft.

Felicity takes a homing device out of her purse, looks around for a place to plant it. She sees his enormous butt cleavage and realizes that there's only one place for the thing to go.

Everyone leaves and he walks over to a panel bearing his logo. He presses a button, the panel opens up to reveal... A SECRET SHRINE TO AUSTIN POWERS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In it we see a huge full-length photo of Austin Powers, and various magazine covers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He presses a button and an Austin wig descends from the ceiling landing perfectly on his bald head. A backless mockup of Austin's suit rises from the floor. He puts on a pair of glasses. He has become Austin Powers.

Dr. Evil cautiously tastes the mojo.

DR. EVIL ANIMATED SEQUENCE

A Yellow Submarine-like depiction of Dr. Evil. Zoom in on his head which explodes into 30 other small Dr. Evil heads which rain on a Peter Max-ian valley of flowers. The flowers sprout the word "EVIL'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A psychedelic flying Austin head with spirals in the glasses smashes the flowers, changing the words from "EVIL" to "VILE" and to "LIVE" and then to "LOVE".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turn-of-the-century fat cat capitalists on stilts with teeth coming out of their stomachs drop penis rockets that have the word "GREED" written on the shaft, smashing the "LOVE" flowers into "IRELO" which sprouts into "YELLOW" which turns into submarines, which becomes yellow penises of huge, goose- stepping Dr. Evils, each of them peeing, creating a rain of urine that falls on the Peter Max-ian valley of a hundred Austin Powers citizens. They each open an umbrella that says "LOVE TRIUMPHS OVER LUST". The urine turns into a stream that flows into the mouth of a huge head of Dr. Evil.

</FELICITY>
<AUSTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There've been a lot of advances in the Nineties, baby. The economy is stable, people take better care of their health concern for the environment is on the rise and, um, let's see, there's an entire television channel dedicated to golf.

	Sounds awful.

	You? Married? What about the sexual revolution?
