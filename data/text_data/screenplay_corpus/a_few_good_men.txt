EXT. A SENTRY TOWER --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Small beams of light coming from lamps attached to the tower cut through the ground mist. We HEAR all the unidentifiable sounds of night in the woods. We also HEAR, very, very faintly, a slow, deliberate drum cadence. And as this starts, we begin to MOVE SLOWLY UP THE TOWER, more becomes visible now:... the sandbags on the ground piled ten-high... the steel, fire escape-type stairway wrapping around the structure and leading to the lookout post, and finally... THE LOOKOUT POST, maybe forty feet off the ground.

Standing the post is the silhouette of A MARINE. He's holding a rifle and staring straight out.

where we see that the footsteps belong to DAWSON and DOWNEY, two young marines who we'll get to know later. They stop when they get to a certain door. The drum cadence is still growing. DAWSON puts his hand on the doorknob and turns it slowly. He opens's the door and they walk into

WILLY SANTIAGO, a young, very slight marine, lies asleep in his bunk.

DAWSON kneels down by the bed, puts his hand on SANTIAGO'S shoulder and shakes him gently. SANTIAGO opens his yes, looks at DAWSON, and for a moment there's nothing wrong --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and then SANTIAGO's eyes fill with terror. He lunges out of the bed -- but forget about it. In one flash DAWSON and DOWNEY grab him out of bed, and before the scream can come out, DOWNEY's shoved a piece of cloth into SANTIAGO's mouth.

The BAND is performing on the huge and lush parade grounds before a crowd made up mostly of TOURISTS and DAY-CAMPERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the TITLES ROLL, we watch the BAND do their thing from various angles. Incredible precision is the name of the game. Each polished black shoe hitting the ground as if they were all attached by a rod. Each drumstick raised to the same fraction of a centimeter before striking. A RIFLE DRILL TEAM that can't possibly be human. Flags, banners, the works.

THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB

His name is LIEUTENANT JUNIOR GRADE DANIEL ALLISTAIR KAFFEE, and it's almost impossible not to like him. At the moment he's hitting fungoes to about a dozen LAWYERS who are spread out on the softball field on a corner of the bass. The '27 Yankees they're not, but they could probably hold their own against a group of, say, Airforce dentists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAFFEE's in his late 20's, 15 months out of Harvard Law School, and a brilliant legal mind waiting for a courageous spirit to drive it. He is, at this point in his life, passionate about nothing... except maybe softball.

I am writing to inform you of my problems with my unit here in Cuba and to ask for your help. I've fallen out on runs before for several reasons such as feeling dizzy or nauseated, but on May 18th, I'd fallen back about 20 or 30 yards going down a rocky, unstable hill. My sergeant grabbed me and pushed me down the hill. Then I saw all black and the last thing I remember is hitting the deck. I was brought to the hospital where I was told I just had heat exhaustion and was explained to by the doctor that my body has trouble with the hot sun and I hyperventilate. I ask you to help me. Please sir. I just need to be transferred out of RSC. Sincerely. PFC William T. Santiago. U.S. Marine Corps."

He's talking to his two senior officers. CAPTAIN MARKINSON is in his late 40's. He's a career marine and a nice guy in a world where nice guys may not finish last, but they sure as shit don't finish first. Lt. JONATHAN JAMES KENDRICK is 26, from Georgia, and an Academy graduate.

Maybe we as officers have a responsibility to this country to see that the men and women charged with its security are trained professionals. Yes. I'm certain I once read that somewhere. And now I'm thinking that your suggestion of transferring Santiago, while expeditious, and certainly painless, might not be in a manner of speaking, the American way. Santiago stays where he is. We're gonna train the lad. You're in charge, Jon. Santiago doesn't make 4.1 on his next fitness report, I'm gonna blame you. Then I'm gonna kill you.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I do know you. Daniel AlliStair Kaffee, born June 8th, 1964 at Boston Mercy Hospital. Your father's Lionel Kaffee, former Navy Judge Advocate and Attorney General, of the United States, died 1985. You went to Harvard Law on a Navy scholarship, probably because that's what your father wanted you to do, and now you're just treading water for the three years you've gotta serve in the JAG Corps, just kinda layin' low til you can get out and get a real job. And if that's the situation, that's fine, I won't tell anyone. But my feeling is that if this case is handled in the same fast-food, slick-ass, Persian Bazaar manner with which you seem to handle everything else, something's gonna get missed. And I wouldn't be doing my job if I allowed Dawson and Downey to spend any more time in prison than absolutely necessary, because their attorney had pre- determined the path of least resistance.

	Take caution in your tone, Commander. I'm a fair guy, but this fuckin' heat's making me absolutely crazy. You want to know about code reds? On the record I tell you that I discourage the practice in accordance with the NIS directive. Off the record I tell you that it's an invaluable part of close infantry training, and if it happens to go on without my knowledge, so be it. I run my base how I run my base. You want to investigate me, roll the dice and take your chances. I eat breakfast 80 yards away from 4000 Cubans who are trained to kill me. So don't for one second think you're gonna come down here, flash a badge, and make me nervous.

	The facts of the case are this: At midnight on August 6th, the defendants went into the barracks room of their platoon-mate, PFC William Santiago. They woke him up, tied his arms and legs with rope, and forced a rag into his throat. A few minutes later, a chemical reaction in Santiago's body called lactic acidosis caused his lungs to begin bleeding. He drowned in his own blood and was pronounced dead at 32 minutes past midnight. These are the facts of the case. And they are undisputed. That's right. The story I just told you is the exact same story you're going to hear from Corporal Dawson, and it's the exact same story you're going to hear from Private Downey. Furthermore, the Government will also demonstrate that the defendants soaked the rag with poison, and entered Santiago's room with motive and intent to kill.

But it's gonna be entertaining.

	When Dawson and Downey went into Santiago's room that night, it wasn't because of vengeance or hatred, it wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't because they were looking for kicks on a Friday night. It's because it was what they were ordered to do.

	Bullshit! You could've gotten it by picking up the phone and calling any one of a dozen departments at the Pentagon. You didn't want the transfer order. You wanted to see Jessep's reaction when you asked for the transfer order. You had an instinct. And it was confirmed by Markinson. Now damnit, let's put Jessep on the stand and end this thing!

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to JESSEP)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Upon hearing the news that he was finally getting his transfer, Santiago was so excited, that do you know how many people he called? Zero. Nobody. Not one call to his parents saying he was coming home. Not one call to a friend saying can you pick me up at the airport. He was asleep in his bed at midnight, and according to you he was getting on a plane in six hours, yet everything he owned was hanging neatly in his closet and folded neatly in his footlocker. You were leaving for one day and you packed a bag and made three phone calls. Santiago was leaving for the rest of his life, and he hadn't called a soul and he hadn't packed a thing. Can you explain that? The fact is there was no transfer order. Santiago wasn't going anywhere, isn't that right, Colonel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFFEE>
<ROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Object. Your Honor, it's obvious that Lt. Kaffee's intention this morning is to smear a high ranking marine officer in the desperate hope that the mere appearance of impropriety will win him points with the jury. It's my recommendation, sir, that Lt. Kaffee receive an official reprimand from the bench, and that the witness be excused with the Court's deepest apologies.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have an answer?

</KAFFEE>
<JESSEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely. My answer is I don't have the first damn clue. Maybe he was an early morning riser and he liked to pack in the nq. And maybe he didn't have any friends. I'm an educated man, but I'm afraid I can't speak intelligently about the travel habits of William Santiago. What I do know is that he was set to leave the base at 0600. Now are these really the questions I was called here to answer? Phone calls and footlockers? Please tell me you've got something more, Lieutenant. Please tell me there's an ace up your sleeve. These two marines are on trial for their lives. Please tell me their lawyer hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone bill.

You weep for Santiago and you curse the marines. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know: That Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives.

	You don't want the truth. Because deep down, in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall. You need me there.

<DIRECTION>
(boasting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We use words like honor, code, loyalty... we use these words as the backbone to a life spent defending something. You use 'em as a punchline.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it. I'd prefer you just said thank you and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post. Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you're entitled to.

</JESSEP>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. From everyone. RANDOLPH, ROSS, the M.P.'s, they're all frozen. JO and SAM are likewise. JESSEP seems strangely, quietly relieved. KAFFEE simply takes control of the room now.
</DIRECTION>
<KAFFEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please the court, I suggest the jury be dismissed so that we can move to an immediate Article 39a Session. The witness has rights.

Silence.

RANDOLPH looks to ROSS.

<RANDOLPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	M.P.'s, guard the prisoner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDOLPH>
<DIRECTION>
The M.P.'s are tentative. They've never heard a marine colonel referred to as "the prisoner" before. They sure as hell have never been asked to guard one.

	Guard the prisoner.

And JESSEP lunges at KAFFEE, and KAFFEE would be dead but for the three M.P.'s who've leapt in to restrain JESSEP. SAM and JO have come to their feet and stand behind KAFFEE.

	I'm gonna tear your eyes right outta your head and piss in your dead skull. You fucked with the wrong marine.

ROSS is done reading JESSEP his rights.

<ROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colonel Jessep, do you understand those rights as I have just read then to you?

The M.P.'s start leading JESSEP out, and KAFFEE notices DAWSON. And DOWNEY. And ROSS. who are watching a man in a marine colonels uniform be led away in handcuffs... KAFFEE takes a handkerchief from his pocket and wipes some sweat from his hands. He takes a deep breath as we

<JURY_FOREMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The SERGEANT AT ARMS takes all the slips of paper from the FOREMAN and brings them to RANDOLPH.

KAFFEE stands, and nods to DAWSON and DOWNEY that they should do the same. SAM and JO stand as well.

SAM slaps his hands down on the table --
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes you did! A jury just said your conduct was unbecoming a marine. What does that mean?!

</SAM>
<DAWSON>

But KAFFEE has nothing to say.

DAWSON and DOWNEY walk to the SERGEANT AT ARMS and begin to follow him up the aisle and out of the courtroom. But before they get to the door, KAFFEE turns around and calls

DAWSON snaps a salute and holds it.

KAFFEE stares back. Then stands up straight and returns their salute.

With one last glance back at KAFFEE, DAWSON turns and walks out the door, followed by DOWNEY.

ROSS walks over to the defense table.
