CAMERA PULLS UP from the Bailey home and travels up through the sky until it is above the falling snow and moving slowly toward a firmament full of stars. As the camera stops we hear the following heavenly voices talking, and as each voice is heard, one of the stars twinkles brightly:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Joseph, trouble?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN_S_VOICE>
<JOSEPH_S_VOICE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_S_VOICE>
<FRANKLIN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN_S_VOICE>
<JOSEPH_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_S_VOICE>
<FRANKLIN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN_S_VOICE>
<JOSEPH_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_S_VOICE>
<FRANKLIN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but he's got the faith of a child –– simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN_S_VOICE>

</CLARENCE_S_VOICE>
<FRANKLIN_S_VOICE>

</FRANKLIN_S_VOICE>
<CLARENCE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Splendid! Is he sick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARENCE_S_VOICE>
<FRANKLIN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN_S_VOICE>
<CLARENCE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?

<FRANKLIN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN_S_VOICE>
<CLARENCE_S_VOICE>

</JOSEPH_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The stars fade out from the screen, and a light, indistinguishable blur is seen.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARENCE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where? I don't see a thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARENCE_S_VOICE>
<JOSEPH_S_VOICE>

	Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The blur on the screen slowly begins to take form. We see a group of young boys on top of a snow-covered hill.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARENCE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, yes. This is amazing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARENCE_S_VOICE>

<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He leans down to finish scooping out the ice cream, his deaf ear toward her. She leans over, speaking softly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

He turns back to the cash register, whistling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE –– taking in entrance to prescription room at end of fountain. Gower comes to the entrance. He is bleary-eyed, unshaven, chewing an old unlit cigar. His manner is gruff and mean. It is evident he has been drinking.
</DIRECTION>
<GOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	George! George!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOWER>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.

</GOWER>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pres. HAMMERTON COLLEGE." BACK TO SHOT. George puts the telegram down. A goodness of heart expresses itself in a desire to do something for Gower. He gives the ice cream to Mary without comment and sidles back toward Gower.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR PRESCRIPTION ROOM OF DRUGSTORE –– DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT –– Gower, drunk, is intent on putting some capsules into a box.

<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SHOT –– George and Gower.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up the capsules and puts them in the box. Gower waves George aside, takes his old wet cigar, shoves it in his mouth and sits in an old Morris chair in the background. George turns a bottle around from which Gower has taken the powder for the capsules. Its label reads "POISON." George stands still, horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<GOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take these capsules over to Mrs. Blaine's. She's waiting for them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOWER>
<DIRECTION>
George picks up the capsule box, not knowing what to do or say. His eyes go, harassed, to the bottle labeled poison. George's fingers fumble.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<GOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ummmm . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOWER>
<DIRECTION>
Gower stares moodily ahead, sucking his cigar. George turns to him, the box in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it a charge, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<GOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>

INTERIOR OUTER OFFICE BLDG. AND LOAN –– DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT –– The offices are ancient and a bit on the rickety side. There is a counter with a grill, something like a bank. Before a door marked: PETER BAILEY, PRIVATE, George's Uncle Billy stands, obviously trying to hear what is going on inside. He is a very good-humored man of about fifty, in shirt-sleeves. With him at the door, also listening, are Cousin Tilly Bailey, a waspish-looking woman, who is the telephone operator, and Cousin Eustace Bailey, the clerk. The office vibrates with an aura of crisis as George enters and proceeds directly toward his father's office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT –– Uncle Billy listening at the door. As George is about to enter his father's office, uncle Billy grabs him by the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_BILLY>

</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bank examiner! I should have called him yesterday. Switch it inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
He enters a door marked WILLIAM BAILEY, PRIVATE. George stands irresolute a moment, aware of crisis in the affairs of the Bailey Building and Loan Association, but aware more keenly of his personal crisis. He opens the door of his father's office and enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR BAILEY'S PRIVATE OFFICE –– DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT –– George's father is seated behind his desk, nervously drawing swirls on a pad. He looks tired and worried. He is a gentle man in his forties, an idealist, stubborn only for other people's rights. Nearby, in a throne-like wheelchair, behind which stands the goon who furnishes the motive power, sits Henry F. Potter, his squarish derby hat on his head. The following dialogue is fast and heated, as though the argument had been in process for some time.
</DIRECTION>
<BAILEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.

	Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?

</GEORGE>
<POP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POP>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.

<POP>

	He's pretty young for that job.

</POP>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<POP>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</POP>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about –– build things . . . design new buildings –– plan modern cities –– all that stuff I was talking about.

</GEORGE>
<POP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still after that first million before you're thirty.

Annie stops serving to hear his answer.

<GEORGE Well_I>

<GEORGE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm sorry, Pop. I didn't mean that remark, but this business of nickels and dimes and spending all your life trying to figure out how to save three cents on a length of pipe . . . I'd go crazy. I want to do something big and something important.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<POP>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, George, I feel that in a small way we are doing something important. Satisfying a fundamental urge. It's deep in the race for a man to want his own roof and walls and fireplace, and we're helping him get those things in our shabby little office.

Freddie needs no more. He takes the key from Mickey and turns the switch. The floor begins to part in the middle, each half sliding under the bleacher seats. Pandemonium starts. Dancers begin to scream as they try to get off. Some are so engrossed in dancing they continue at top speed. Teachers and elders start to scurry off. As the floor opens, it reveals an attractive, lighted swimming pool.

	Peter Bailey died three months ago. I second Mr. Potter's motion.

</DR_CAMPBELL>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you very much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DR_CAMPBELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_CAMPBELL>
<POTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go further than that. I'll say that to the public Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POTTER>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone looks at him surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to control himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's fine, Potter, coming from you, considering that you probably drove him to his grave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_BILLY>
<POTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peter Bailey was not a business man. That's what killed him. Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him, God rest his soul. He was a man of high ideals, so-called, but ideals without common sense can ruin this town.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(picking up papers from table)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop . . . You know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi. You know . . . I happen to know the bank turned down this loan, but he comes here and we're building him a house worth five thousand dollars. Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POTTER>
<DIRECTION>
George is at the door of the office, holding his coat and papers, ready to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter. You have all the papers there. His salary, insurance. I can personally vouch for his character.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<POTTER>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A friend of yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POTTER>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<POTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</POTTER>
<DIRECTION>
George puts down his coat and comes around to the table, incensed by what Potter is saying about his father.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a minute –– just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . Why, in the twenty-five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why . . . Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You . . . you said . . . What'd you say just a minute ago? . . . They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<POTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POTTER>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Board)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I've said too much. I . . . You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
George leaves the room, followed by the jubilant Uncle Billy. Potter's face is grim with hatred. The "frustrated old man" remark was gall in his veins.
</DIRECTION>
<POTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sentimental hogwash! I want my motion . . .

<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tom! Tom! Randall! Now wait . . . now listen . . . now listen to me. I beg of you not to do this thing. If Potter gets hold of this Building and Loan there'll never be another decent house built in this town. He's already got charge of the bank. He's got the bus line. He's got the department stores. And now he's after us. Why? Well, it's very simple. Because we're cutting in on his business, that's why. And because he wants to keep you living in his slums and paying the kind of rent he decides.

	Can't you understand what's happening here? Don't you see what's happening? Potter isn't selling. Potter's buying! And why? Because we're panicky and he's not. That's why. He's picking up some bargains. Now, we can get through this thing all right. We've got to stick together, though. We've got to have faith in each other.

INTERIOR POTTER'S OFFICE –– DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT –– Potter is lighting a big cigar which he has just given George. The goon is beside Potter's chair, as usual.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<POTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like it? I'll send you a box.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POTTER>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(nervously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I . . . I suppose I'll find out sooner or later, but just what exactly did you want to see me about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<POTTER>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	George, now that's just what I like so much about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pleasantly and smoothly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	George, I'm an old man, and most people hate me. But I don't like them either, so that makes it all even. You know just as well as I do that I run practically everything in this town but the Bailey Building and Loan. You know, also, that for a number of years I've been trying to get control of it . . . or kill it. But I haven't been able to do it. You have been stopping me. In fact, you have beaten me, George, and as anyone in this county can tell you, that takes some doing. Take during the depression, for instance. You and I were the only ones that kept our heads. You saved the Building and Loan, and I saved all the rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POTTER>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<POTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POTTER>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(indignantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forty-five!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<POTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forty-five. Forty-five. Out of which, after supporting your mother, and paying your bills, you're able to keep, say, ten, if you skimp. A child or two comes along, and you won't even be able to save the ten. Now, if this young man of twenty-eight was a common, ordinary yokel, I'd say he was doing fine. But George Bailey is not a common, ordinary yokel. He's an intelligent, smart, ambitious young man — who hates his job –– who hates the Building and Loan almost as much as I do. A young man who's been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born. A young man . . . the smartest one of the crowd, mind you, a young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places, because he's trapped. Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic-eaters. Do I paint a correct picture, or do I exaggerate?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POTTER>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(mystified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what's your point, Mr. Potter?

</POTTER>
<GEORGE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hire me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<POTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to manage my affairs, run my properties. George, I'll start you out at twenty thousand dollars a year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POTTER>
<DIRECTION>
George drops his cigar on his lap. He nervously brushes off the sparks from his clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(flabbergasted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty thou . . . twenty thousand dollars a year?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<POTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POTTER>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would I?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking around skeptically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.

</GEORGE>
<POTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in –– providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POTTER>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what about the Building and Loan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<POTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POTTER>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<POTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POTTER>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<POTTER>

	<DIALOGUE>

</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
As they shake hands, George feels a physical revulsion. Potter's hand feels like a cold mackerel to him. In that moment of physical contact he knows he could never be associated with this man. George drops his hand with a shudder. He peers intently into Potter's face.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd –– vehemently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No . . . no . . . no . . . no, now wait a minute, here! I don't have to talk to anybody! I know right now, and the answer is no! NO! Doggone it!

(getting madder all the time)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sit around here and you spin your little webs and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money. Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter! In the . . . in the whole vast configuration of things, I'd say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider. You . . .

<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for –– to have teachers like you? Silly, stupid, careless people who send our kids home without any clothes on? You know, maybe my kids aren't the best-dressed kids; maybe they don't have any decent clothes . . .

	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at you. You used to be so cocky! You were going to go out and conquer the world! You once called me a warped, frustrated old man. What are you but a warped, frustrated young man? A miserable little clerk crawling in here on your hands and knees and begging for help. No securities –– no stocks –– no bonds –– nothing but a miserable little five hundred dollar equity in a life insurance policy. You're worth more dead than alive. Why don't you go to the riff-raff you love so much and ask them to let you have eight thousand dollar? You know why? Because they'd run you out of town on a rail . . .But I'll tell you what I'm going to do for you, George. Since the state examiner is still here, as a stockholder of the Building and Loan, I'm going to swear out a warrant for your arrest. Misappropriation of funds –– manipulation –– malfeas- ance . . .

CLOSE SHOT –– The place is an Italian restaurant with bar. The bottles sparkle. There are Christmas greens and holly decorating the place. It has a warm, welcoming spirit, like Martini himself, who is welcoming new arrivals. The booths and the checkered-cloth-covered tables are full. There is an air of festivity and friendliness, and more like a party than a public drinking place. George is seated at the bar –– he has had a great deal to drink, far more than he's accustomed to.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT –– George, Clarence, and the tollkeeper. George is seated before a wood-burning stove before which his clothes are drying on a line. He is in his long winter underwear. He is sipping a mug of hot coffee, staring at the stove, cold, gloomy and drunk, ignoring Clarence and the tollkeeper, preoccupied by his near suicide and his unsolved problems. Clarence is standing on the other side of the stove, putting on his undershirt. This is a ludicrous seventeenth century garment which looks like a baby's night shirt –– with embroidered cuffs and collar, and gathered at the neck with a drawstring. It falls below his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tollkeeper is seated against the wall eyeing them suspiciously. Throughout the scene he attempts to spit, but each time is stopped by some amazing thing Clarence does or says. Clarence becomes aware that his garment is amazing the tollkeeper.

The tollkeeper, about to spit, is stopped in the middle of it by this remark. Clarence, secretly trying to get George's attention, now picks up a copy of "Tom Sawyer" which is hanging on the line, drying. He shakes the book.

CLOSE SHOT –– It is Martini's place, but almost unrecognizable. The cheerful Italian feeling is gone. It is now more of a hard- drinking joint, a honky-tonk. Same bar, tables have no covers. People are lower down and tougher. Nick the bartender is behind the bar. George and Clarence come in. George does not notice the difference, but Clarence is all eyes and beaming. They go up to the bar.

MEDIUM SHOT –– George moves into the scene. The sign bearing the name of the town reads "Pottersville." George looks at it in surprise, then starts up the street toward the main part of town. As he goes, CAMERA MOVES WITH him. The character of the place has completely changed. Where before it was a quiet, orderly small town, it has now become in nature like a frontier village. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS of night clubs, cafes, bars, liquor stores, pool halls and the like, with blaring jazz MUSIC issuing from the majority of them. The motion picture theatre has become a burlesque house. Gower's drugstore is now a pawnbroker's establishment, and so on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT –– George stops before what used to be the offices of the Building and Loan. There is a garish electric sign over the entrance reading: "Welcome Jitterbugs." A crowd of people are watching the police, who are raiding the place, and dragging out a number of screaming women, whom they throw into a patrol wagon. George talks to one of the cops:

<DIRECTION>
The rest of the crowd all greet George with greetings and smiles. Each one comes forward with money. In their pockets, in shoe boxes, in coffee pots. Money pours onto the table –– pennies, dimes, quarters, dollar bills –– small money, but lots of it. Mrs. Bailey and Mrs. Hatch push toward George. More people come in. The place becomes a bedlam. Shouts of "Gangway –– gangway" as a new bunch comes in and pours out its money. Mary stands next to George, watching him. George stands there overcome and speechless as he holds Zuzu. As he sees the familiar faces, he gives them sick grins. Tears course down his face. His lips frame their names as he greets them.

<UNCLE_BILLY>

(emotionally at the breaking point)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary did it, George! Mary did it! She told a few people you were in trouble and they scattered all over town collecting money. They didn't ask any questions –– just said "If George is in trouble –– count on me." You never saw anything like it.

As various members of the family bring out a punch bowl and glasses, Janie sits down at the piano and strikes a chord. She starts playing "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing," and the entire crowd joins in the singing. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS of the various groups singing the hymn, and some people are still coming in and dropping their money on the table. Carter, the bank examiner, makes a donation; the sheriff sheepishly looks at George and tears his warrant in small pieces. In the midst of this scene, Harry, in Naval uniform, enters, accompanied by Bert, the cop.

CLOSE SHOT –– George, still holding Zuzu in his arms, glances down at the pile of money on the table. His eye catches something on top of the pile, and he reaches down for it. It is Clarence's copy of "Tom Sawyer." George opens it and finds an inscription written in it "Dear George, remember no man is a failure who has friends. Thanks for the wings, Love Clarence."

	That's a Christmas present from a very dear friend of mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
At this moment, perhaps because of the jostling of some of the people on the other side of the tree, a little silver bell on the Christmas tree swings to and fro with a silvery tinkle. Zuzu closes the cover of the book, and points to the bell.
