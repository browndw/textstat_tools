"I wonder," Toad said to himself presently, "I wonder if this sort of car starts easily?" Next moment, hardly knowing how it came about, he found that he had hold of the handle and was turning it. As the familiar sound broke forth, the old passion seized on Toad and completely mastered him, body and soul ... He increased his pace, and as the car devoured the street, he was only conscious that he was Toad once more, Toad at his best and highest. And he sped he knew not whither, fulfilling his instincts, living his hour, reckless of what might come to him... "

EXT. LONG BEACH STREET - LOWER GRAND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The streets are empty. Low fog skims the sidewalks below a gray stew of a sky. It's slightly fuzzy, slightly surreal. The vast Port of Los Angeles is visible in the b.g... No cars parked here ... No cars except -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silver with deep grill, its sculptured side panels ending in air scoops ... All cock and balls, it stands alone in the lonely cool before dawn ... An old-school totem to speed and style... And then SOMEONE approaches...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the mists of morning ... In leather coat and jack boots ... He's early 30s, with the vaguely whimsical confidence of a shimmer that refuses to fade ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is RANDALL RAINES, whom they call MEMPHIS - though know one's quite sure why ... But they do know he's the auto-boost in Southern California ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Memphis approaches the Mustang with a gathering awe ... Like a desert crash survivor coming upon an oasis ... He walks around it ... Admiring it ... Adoring it ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then a FIREBIRD pulls up alongside him. Its driver - ATLEY JACKSON, early 30s, handsome, jocular leans out for:

	I know, I know ... It's Eleanor ... Just take her, slick. - -

</ATLEY_JACKSON>
<DIRECTION>
And Atley drives off slowly, Memphis looks this way and that ... No one about ... He removes a SLIM JIM from a deep pocket in his coat... He slims the door panel ... Pops the button ... opens the door ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watch him work. Quick as shit. A SCREWDRIVER appears another pocket ... He pops the BUTTERFLY to the IGNITION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RATCHET appears... He strips the mechanism... Now a GIZMO - a,small socket-like device - is pressed into the ignition ... A twist of the wrist ... And the 320-bhp 289 V8 rumbles like a jackhammer. The whole thing took 20 seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a cassette TAPE from another pocket ... Slaps it into the deck. Bruce Springsteen's "Ramrod" wails from the coaxials. And Memphis floors it... And off they tear...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The look on his face suggests a supreme satisfaction ... A grand re-awakening of long-dormant pleasure centers ... A speed Jones, fixed and fumy ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slots in behind Atley Jackson's Firebird ... And slotting in behind Memphis, in a Z-28, is DONNY ASTRICKY, mid-30s ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On they go ... The fore and aft car providing escort...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Except that, from seemingly out of nowhere --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A POLICE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
appears behind them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Donny instantly goes into diversionary tactic ... He races through a STOP SIGN ... And the cruiser's bubbles flash on ... And Donny is pulled-over ... Atley and Memphis drive on in their respective vehicles...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The UNIFORM COP gets out of his car, goes to Donny.

And off of Donny's look --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We go to Memphis in the Shelby... As FOUR CRUISERS comes speeding toward him, sirens wailing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK SHOTS of Memphis racing the Shelby through the early morning harbor town streets ... Sirens peel ... Memphis turns up the music ... Pins the gas ... The chase is on ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Memphis maneuvers the Mustang with a dazzling aplomb... Memphis gutterballing the car, skating the shoulder, the cops in heavy pursuit ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now he's picked up another CRUISER... He passes Atley Jackson, heading in the opposite direction... Atley has picked-up a pair of cruisers himself ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Memphis on a straightaway now, speeds up, feels the boost. But up ahead, a ROADBLOCK has formed... How'd they get that deployed so fast? And behind him, the unmarks blaze ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guns his bitch... Straight at the roadblock .. Three CRUISERS and a PORTABLE WOODEN BARRICADE... Memphis pins her ... ZOOOOOM! Dead-on to the roadblock ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And, at the last moment, as the COPS dive out of the way, Memphis bangs the gear shift into neutral -- yanks the parking brake -- And the Mustang spins on the straight -- Screeching spin ... And Memphis takes the HARD LEFT ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And he's managed to outrun them... Finding himself above Lower Grand... Looking down ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can see the secondary pursuit down below ... Atley being chased... IN THE DISTANCE - Atley is LAUNCHED FROM THE SHOULDER, the Firebird rolling down a drainage culvert ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landing with a sickening thud on its back. Memphis is horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOWER GRAND - LATER

<DIRECTION>
Rescue team presence. Atley being hauled out of the wreck... His leg is a torn mess ... He's barely conscious... A cuffed Donny Astricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser ...

Midnight auto nonpareil ... To one side of the yard is a GARAGE: Watch as a HONDA ACCORD, with a BLOODY WINDSHIELD, enters the garage. A young Mexican KID driving.

An antique treadle lathe stands in one corner. A stock layout of expensive woods - oak, birch, maple, cherry, mahogany - is stacked against the rear wall ...

Jars and bottles and cakes of glues, resins, stains and bleaches cram a shelf unit ... There's a MAN here, at a band saw. This is RAYMOND CALITRI, 59 ...

He wears an apron, protective glasses and a lopsided sneer. A Richard Widmark motherfucker - with the diamond hard look of a cobra. The liegelord of downtown...

And now he works the a hand saw, making critical cross-cuts on a wide panel of maple ... Atley Jackson is here as well ... As noisy as it is out in the yard, in here, once the door is closed, it's as SILENT-as a tomb...

A BANK OF MONITORS on one wall show the cars being crushed and disassembled in the yard. Memphis is led into the room.

</OTTO>
<MEMPHIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEMPHIS>
<OTTO>

	The conundrum still applies, of course. The purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death and/or a life of crime. However. This cannot be successfully carried out without baby brother's considerable resources, shabby though they may be.

</DRUNK>

And the Drunk reaches out across the bar, to grab a bottle And Sway grabs his hand, twists it ... The Drunk groans in agony ... And Sway, still clutching his hand, hops over the bar ... And drags the drunk by his twisted hand to the front ... Cries of "Attagirl, Sway!" pepper the air ...

He studies her... Then:

<MEMPHIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?

</MEMPHIS>
<SWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?

</SWAY>
<MEMPHIS>

</MEMPHIS>
<SWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A distinction worth noting ...

</SWAY>
<MEMPHIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And here I am...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEMPHIS>
<SWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -

</SWAY>
<MEMPHIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kip's in trouble

</MEMPHIS>

And now she looks concerned
</DIRECTION>
<SWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of trouble -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWAY>
<MEMPHIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
	</DIALOGUE>

<SWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you got some Italians -- ?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Six or seven...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEMPHIS>
<SWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...

Memphis nods ... Beat. They sit there. Regard Sway...

</MEMPHIS>
<DIRECTION>
And Mitch leans over to him, conspiratorially ...
</DIRECTION>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should her face when she's having sex --

And Memphis turns to him...

And Memphis reaches out, and GRABS Mitch's nipple, PINCHING. Mitch's face curls ...
</DIRECTION>
<MEMPHIS>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it a squinty, grimacing, contorted face? Agonized and writhing and ugly? Oh, now I see it, yes, yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEMPHIS>
<DIRECTION>
And Memphis releases him... And Mitch goes down hard ... And Sway comes over ...
</DIRECTION>
<SWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you doing -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWAY>
<MEMPHIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEMPHIS>
<DIRECTION>
And he's out of there, before Mitch's PALS can get to him.
</DIRECTION>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who was that guy, Sara?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at the door ... Shrugs ...

	</DIALOGUE>
</SWAY>
<MEMPHIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEMPHIS>
<DIRECTION>
And he uses a rag to tenderly wipe a small black smear of oil from her cheek...
</DIRECTION>
<SWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stops short; sees the new Eleanor outside)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where to -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWAY>
<MEMPHIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno. I know a place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEMPHIS>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him... Long and hard...
</DIRECTION>
<SWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This time it's for real?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWAY>
<MEMPHIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEMPHIS>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACCHIOCHI'S - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Memphis opens the passenger door for her ... And she gets in... And she smiles ... And Memphis climbs behind the wheel. He neutral-drops Eleanor, chirping off ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONTAINER SHIP - LONG BEACH HARBOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As two TUGS guide the giant freighter away from the docks ... All those containers ... Filled with cars ... But here comes a COAST GUARD CUTTER ... Churning for the ship ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff on the deck ... Stopping this one cold...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LANDFILL - RHODE ISLAND - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vast expanse of trash and garbage and layers of earth. Deserted, except for THE PANEL VAN parked dead center. Digger and Butz slide the casket from the van, parked before an ALREADY DUG GRAVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they move the casket, a KNOCKING from inside. A POUNDING. And muffled CRIES. Digger and Butz exchange a horrified glance... They stare at the casket, spooked.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you believe this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTZ>
<DIGGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What should we do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIGGER>
<BUTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We gotta do what we gotta do --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTZ>
<DIGGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. I hate the screamers, man. Why can't he finish the freakin' job?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIGGER>
<BUTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget about it. Occupational hazard, Digger. C'mon...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTZ>
<DIRECTION>
And just as we think they're sure to open it -- they DROP THE CASKET INTO THE HOLE -- !
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And begin to dump shovelfuls of earth upon it; its unseen occupant thumping and pounding and yelling -- And soon the casket is covered in dirt. Gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we PRE-LAP The Turtles' pop gem "Eleanor" ("You got a thing about you/I just can't live without you/I really want you/ Eleanor near me...") CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE 405 FREEWAY NORTH - ELEANOR - MOVING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Memphis driving. Sway riding shotgun. Long Beach at their backs ... Memphis looks quite enthralled behind the wheel... He loves driving this car. Sway watches him. He feels it --
</DIRECTION>
<MEMPHIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEMPHIS>
<SWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWAY>
<MEMPHIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She does have one thing you don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEMPHIS>
<SWAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWAY>
<MEMPHIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bench seats.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEMPHIS>
<DIRECTION>
And he grins ... Pats the seat beside him... And Sway slides close... He throws his arm around her ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And off they go ... As The Turtles' ("Eleanor/Gee, I think you're swell/And you really do me well/You're my pride and joy, etc.") SING ON... And we hear:
</DIRECTION>
<MEMPHIS>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like bingo -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEMPHIS>
<DIRECTION>
And Eleanor drives away from us ... Into the searing horizon line ... Becoming just another single, yellow dot in the pointillist pattern that is the American road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
