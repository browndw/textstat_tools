EXT. DESERT LANDSCAPE (UTAH) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jagged mountains defy a dark, foreboding sky. We hear PLODDING HOOVES, CREAKING LEATHER. A lone wanderer appears. Wearing a long coat and a battered hat, he carries a bolt-action carbine. His name forgotten, history remembers him simply as THE POSTMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His laden pack mule, BILL, BRAYS, as they pass a battered sign: "The Great Salt Lake Marina." They start down a slope and begin to cross a...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DRY LAKE BED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bizarre, wind-swept sight. Dozens of boats resting lee- to on the dry, cracked earth. It's like God pulled the plug. Rusty mooring chains snake their way around house boats, ski boats and a cabin cruiser or two.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	The last of the great cities died when my father was a child. Another victim of yet another war. The plagues followed. And the terrors. The living hid themselves away in tiny hamlets in hopes of surviving whatever new madness conspired to rob them of the little that remained. The Earth itself had fallen prey to chaos. For three years a dirty snow fell that even summer could not erase. The ocean was barren. Poisoned. Near death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
As The Postman continues to cross, the CAMERA PULLS BACK. He's soon lost in the massive vista.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sixteen long years passed before the great lungs started working again. My father said it was as if the ocean breathed a great sigh of relief...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
A RUMBLE of THUNDER. RAIN begins to fall. The earth just sucks it up at first, but it's coming hard. Rivulets run. Puddles form. We begin to get the feeling that soon these boats will be tugging at the mooring chains once again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACK a rivulet as it runs, filling up a depression in the sand. And then, running to fill another in a series of depressions. They make a pattern we recognize as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAN'S FOOTPRINTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
These tracks may already be days old as they fill with rain water. Then, the sound of light, padded FOOTFALLS. A LION ENTERS FRAME. Lean, hungry and dangerous, the big cat has been tracking this man. He lets out a low, disappointed GROWL. The rain has foiled his dinner plans -- for now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY ON-RAMP (UTAH) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bullet-ridden sign reads: "U.S. 84 North." The Postman leads Bill down a barren 4-lane. Weeds poke up through the asphalt. The rusting hulk of a car rests in the median, covered in a tangle of purple wisteria. The Postman plucks a flower. He sticks it into a buttonhole and continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILL BRAYS woefully. In answer:
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. And if you ask me again, I'm going to slug you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
They near a sign: "Thank You For Visiting Utah." The Postman waves, shouts to the sign as he passes it.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been fun, hasn't it, kids?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

	You're welcome!

<DIRECTION>
EXT. 4-LANE (IDAHO) - BILLBOARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bill tugs up weeds as The Postman is climbing up a ladder on a highway that razor cuts the plains to the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above, The Postman sands atop a billboard catwalk. He references a tattered road atlas, scans the horizon through binoculars with one broken lens. He pauses at a Union 76 ball just visible above the tree line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY TRAVEL STOP (IDAHO) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A 76 Station and the remains of a Howard Johnson's. Alert, carbine in hand, The Postman leads in the mule. Rusting cars sag on flattened tires. There's a stripped fire engine, its cracked hoses leading to the HoJo foundation which bristles with burned timbers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bill stops to drink out of a stream. The Postman swats at him with his hat.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damnit, Bill, you know I need to check it first!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Bill hangs his head. The Postman digs through his pack. He removes an old Tupperware container and replaces its contents -- a tiny sheaf of litmus papers and several small bottles -- with stream water. He adds a few drops from each bottle. Swirls it around. Then dips a tiny strip of paper into the water. The paper turns a vivid purple. The Postman is dubious.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better than turpentine.

Bill drinks.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ain't picky, Bill. I like that about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman takes his carbine and a burlap sack and crosses to the 76 Station. An old extension ladder on the ground. The pole holding up the 76 ball has a 30-degree bend in it, like someone once tried to pull it over. Beyond the 76 ball, the sun sets -- but we here in the 20th Century have never seen such a wild riot of color before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman tries the station door. Locked. Smiling ironically, he steps in through the blown-out window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 76 STATION - OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shambles. The Postman kicks around the table. He finds a few beat-up CDs, flips through them. Reads the label.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Running on Empty'? Tell me about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Tossing it, he turns, stops. There, resting on a pile of trash is a bashed-in portable TV. The Postman smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Bill! We got TV! 147 channels. Everything from Jesus to 'Jeopardy'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He steps over, switches on the set. Nothing happens, but The Postman pretends just the same. He mimics static, then:
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Like sands through the hour- glass, so are the days of our lives...'
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(switching channels)

The Postman stops suddenly. Click.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We interrupt our regularly scheduled program to bring you the Second Civil War... Well, shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman stares at the blank screen a moment. There's a sudden, panicked RUSTLING from behind the service manager's desk. The Postman wheels around, raises the carbine.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want any trouble... I bet you don't either... Let's just call it a draw, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Sudden MOVEMENT. The Postman shouts in surprise as a Doe dashes out from behind the desk. Scared, it bounds back and forth between the walls. Then freezes in the corner. The Postman sighs in relief, lowers the carbine.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look out, Bill!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The doe bolts for the window and runs right into Bill. Bill has a conniption fit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Investigating further, The Postman spots a cigarette machine. The front glass is smashed and all the slots are empty. But he looks down to the lock at the bottom. It's intact. He pulls a crowbar from the sack, crouches by the machine and digs the pry into a seam and pulls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The panel bursts open to reveal four half-open cartons of cigarettes. He doesn't believe it for a second. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm rich.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. 76 STATION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Embers of a campfire glow. The Postman is asleep, the carbine in reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILL BRAYS and nervously stamps his hooves. The Postman reaches for the carbine only to find the barrel of a shotgun pointed in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three BANDITS! Hard-eyed and ugly. One, barely 20, is mostly just ugly. The Postman looks down the barrels of a shotgun, a rifle and a revolver. The LEAD BANDIT kicks the carbine out of reach.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just passing through. I don't mean anyone any harm.

<DIRECTION>
(re: stream)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Water's good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Lead Bandit pokes at The Postman's shoulder with the muzzle of his rifle. The Postman knows why.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not a Holnist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Lead Bandit pokes again. Harder. The Postman opens his shirt, reveals his bare left shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
They just stare at him, none saying a word. Creepy.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm headed for a town called St. Rose. Somewhere west of Portland.

The third BANDIT, a HULKING brute, has been quiet.

</LEAD_BANDIT>
<DIRECTION>
The Hulking Bandit, raises his shotgun. The butt end. He's going to bludgeon The Postman to death.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay! My stuff's up there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The 76 ball is twenty feet above the ground. In the gloom you can just see a hole has been punched through the side.
</DIRECTION>
<BANDIT_20>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you got in there?
	</DIALOGUE>

The Lead Bandit swats Bandit #20 upside the head.

<BANDIT_20>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe he's got it booby-trapped.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT_20>
<DIRECTION>
The Lead Bandit is about to smack Bandit #20 again -- then he sees the logic out of it. The Postman shakes his head, but isn't that convincing.
</DIRECTION>
<LEAD_BANDIT>

	You go up and get it.

CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. 76 BALL - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ladder set against the bent pole. Prodded by a shotgun, The Postman climbs, disappears through the hole and into the tilting 76 ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 76 BALL - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Full of The Postman's earthly possessions. Trick is, how to save them and his life at the same time. He spies an old wrench: remnant of an attempt to remove the rusty bolts holding the ball in place. An idea begins to take shape.
</DIRECTION>
<LEAD_BANDIT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just you start tossing those cigarettes down!

There's no answer. The Bandits eye each other nervously.

<BANDIT_20>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe he fell asleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT_20>
<DIRECTION>
76 BALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman grabs the wrench, starts working one of the last two rusted bolts. As it starts to give...
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's going to take a second. I got my stuff bolted in.
	</DIALOGUE>

BANDITS

The Lead Bandit takes a cautious step back.
</DIRECTION>
<LEAD_BANDIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put some buckshot through it, Martin. Just to hurry him up.

</LEAD_BANDIT>
<HULKING_BANDIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I only got three shells left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULKING_BANDIT>
<LEAD_BANDIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So use his gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAD_BANDIT>
<DIRECTION>
The Hulking Bandit picks up the carbine and aims. CLICK. It isn't loaded. The Hulking Bandit tosses the gun aside, pulls a knife from his boot. Grimly, he begins to climb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
76 BALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cramped, The Postman's busy at the base of the ball, trying to unscrew the last remaining bolt. It won't budge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LADDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hulking Bandit has only a few more rungs to go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
76 BALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No good. Time's up. The Postman starts rocking the pole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LADDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hulking Bandit has reached the opening -- feels the rocking motion. Hangs on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
76 BALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knife in hand, the Hulking Bandit looks inside. At that instant, The Postman rocks the pole one more time. The rusty bolt is not enough to keep the ball's full weight in place. It pops. The ball is frozen for an instant before going with the pole's tilt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LADDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The 76 ball drops off the pole, rolling over the Hulking Bandit's back and down the ladder's incline. The other Bandits dive clear as the 76 ball hurtles past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE POSTMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
whips head over heels as the ball speeds away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The 76 ball launches off a dirt berm, but soon comes to a stop as it slams into an old utility pole and bursts apart. Fighting the vertigo, The Postman staggers to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bill!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Bill bolts from the station as the Lead Bandit raises the RIFLE and FIRES at The Postman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Losing balance, The Postman lands on his butt just before a bullet splinters the utility pole above his head. Wobbly, he tries to gather his packs. The Bandits charge, quickly closing the ground, but Bill is there first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding as much as he can, The Postman heaves himself over Bill's back. As the mule gallops away, the Lead Bandit aims the rifle. He's got The Postman in his sights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's about to fire when -- Bandit #20 stands up INTO the SHOT. He's got a fistful of cigarettes in each hand and he's laughing like a hyena!

EXT. OVERLOOK HILL (IDAHO) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman sits on a rock, holding Bill's halter so the mule must face him. They are in the midst of an argument.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's true, we haven't done this in a while, but it's like riding a bicycle. Now, open your mouth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman pries his mouth open. Taking a toothbrush, he tends to Bill's teeth, then gives him an appraising look. BILL BRAYS.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know the rule. It's my rule! Avoid civilization at all costs. But we gotta eat, don't we?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as BILL BRAYS again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you so worried about, Bill? All you gotta do is stand there. I'm the one with all the lines.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman leads the mule down the hill toward the town far below. Making his case all the while -- even as BILL BRAYS in protest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE (IDAHO) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A patch of mud. In the center of the square fifty townspeople stand before a plank stage where The Postman wraps up a performance of MacBeth. He plays it with a mis-remembered gusto the people enjoy. Children especially are enamored. A heavily-muscled man, WOODY, lingers on the fringe of the crowd -- watching The Postman with inscrutable intensity.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They said, 'Fear not, MacBeth, 'til Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane'!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He looks off stage for someone, but no one appears.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said, Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Bill trots on-stage. Covered with twigs, BILL is Birnam Wood. He BRAYS lustily. The audience laughs in delight. The children clap. Only Woody seems unaffected.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman grabs two wooden swords -- he knows it's going well.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arm, arm yourselves! If the witch's words are true, there'll be no running or hiding here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Shaking off the twigs, Bill takes one of the swords in his mouth. The two of them dash back and forth pretending to fight off an imaginary attack. Finally, The Postman looks out at the audience, remembers the words the best he can.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and the day after that. Out brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts his hour upon the stage and is heard no more. It's a tale told by a moron. Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(waves sword)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But blow, wind! Come wrack! At least we'll die with the harness off our back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The audience erupts in applause. But Woody stands still as stone. The Postman takes a bow. Even Bill does a cross-legged dip. Knowing when to quit, he steps off the stage to many hearty handshakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Woody watches his every move. MRS. THOMPSON, one of the town's leaders, steps up. She's accompanied by crotchety old CURMUDGEON LARRY.
</DIRECTION>

Before she can answer, a SENTRY cries...
</DIRECTION>
<SENTRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holnists! Holnists are coming!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENTRY>
<DIRECTION>
All eyes look down the road leading into town. A raiding party of Holnist Cavalry are on their way in. Mrs. Thompson sees The Postman's concern.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_THOMPSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. We give them food and supplies. All the towns do.

	Well, I'd just as soon not give them anything of mine. Let's find the back door, Bill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman gathers his stuff, slings packs onto Bill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The forty Holnists in orange and black uniforms ride in. They're armed with mostly pistols and rifles. Some carry bows, knives, spear guns and swords. On their bare shoulders, branded into the flesh -- the number "8."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out front, always leading by example is, GENERAL BETHLEHEM. Tough, smart, merciless with style. Commander of the United Clans of Holn. Nothing escapes his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A little behind him is the mysteriously silent Colonel Getty, second in command.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman, finished packing, begins to move from building to building -- careful not to attract any attention.

<BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman freezes, turns, is relieved to find Bethlehem's not talking to him at all. The General looks down from his horse at children playing an impromptu game of "Birnam Wood."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The children stop, stare at their feet. Bethlehem affects a "kindly" smile to accompany his gentler tone.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said, what are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
Meantime, The Postman continues his surreptitious escape. The MAYOR hurries forward to greet Bethlehem.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just a game, General Bethlehem. Something they saw in a play. No harm in it.

Head down, The Postman makes for "the back way." But it's guarded by three daunting Holnist soldiers. No getting by them. The Postman does a quick 180, goes back the way he came.

	I'm taking three conscripts from each town. They will have the honor of serving in the Holnist Army until such time as I see fit.

<DIRECTION>
(to Mayor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three men. You suppose you could do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
The Mayor nods in acquiescence. Bethlehem looks to a Holnist officer. The officer, IDAHO, steps up and addresses the town.
</DIRECTION>
<IDAHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All men between 15 and 50 and of suitable ethnic foundation are required to show themselves now.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The Holnist soldiers fan out, prodding any likely or unwilling candidates forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman is now walking behind Bethlehem. Some of the Townspeople cast him a furtive glance as he makes his way toward the open courtyard and, ultimately, the gate out of town.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three conscripts are hustled before Bethlehem. He looks over the first -- Woody. Smells him. Not much of a decision here.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Acceptable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<IDAHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IDAHO>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Acceptable, Captain!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
The second -- a thin teenager. Bethlehem feels his arm, turns his head from side to side.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll need to put some meat on, but I like an impressionable mind. Acceptable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
The third -- an innocuous man. Or so we think. Bethlehem stares hard at his olive skin, traces a finger over the bump on the man's nose.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mongoloid. Unacceptable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
Soldiers shove the man back into the crowd. The Brave Boy that was playing Birnam Wood allows himself a tiny smile when he sees that The Postman might make it.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want pure blood. Someone like...

Bethlehem notes the Boy, turns to see the object of his attention, and spots The Postman leaving out the front gate.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>

Idaho and another soldier are on it. The Postman tries to back away as the two dismount and come toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't understand...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
But Idaho and the soldier aren't programmed for explanations -- they grab him.
</DIRECTION>
<IDAHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were required to show yourself.

Spread out in the valley is General Bethlehem's Holnist Expeditionary Force. A five hundred-man army enjoying all the comforts a bivouac can offer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
19 head-shaved CONSCRIPTS, including Woody and The Postman, are held in a cramped, barbed wired pen. They watch as three more are shoved inside. One of them is Bandit #20. He and The Postman come face to face, recognize each other.

The Postman steps toward him, Bandit #20 backs off quickly.

General Bethlehem approaches on horseback. Colonel Getty follows behind. Bethlehem looks his new recruits over. Dismounting, he enters the pen and walks among them.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome, gentlemen, to your new life. You have been born again as soldiers in the army of the United Clans of Holn. The strong have been sapped by the whimpering propaganda of the weak. Men, strong men, have been denied their destiny. You men have been saved from that fate. Redemption is within your grasp.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
He starts down the line, looking the men over. He stops in front of a GANGLY RECRUIT. The Postman is alongside.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You. What did you do before you were given this opportunity?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<GANGLY_RECRUIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a shovel. I digged holes.

Bethlehem regards him benevolently.

	Is there any question in anyone's mind that I was talking to you? Yes, you. You look like a dangerous man. Are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just a performer. Shakespeare. Stuff like that.

<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shakespeare?

</BETHLEHEM>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was a writer. He --

<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know who Shakespeare was... 'Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
Bethlehem says the lines boldly, encourages his men to clap for him. He looks at The Postman expectantly. Finally...
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I, um, you want a line?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Bethlehem nods. The Postman thinks a moment...
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'To be or not to be: That is the question.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Bethlehem looks at his men as if to say, "Is this all this guy's got?" Bethlehem eyes The Postman; he wants a contest.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.'

	'Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of York.'

Bethlehem claps The Postman on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're pretty good. You're also a fighter. I see it in your eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman doesn't answer. Hesitant, he doesn't want to get into any more trouble than he's already in.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you agree? Come on, a man's got to speak his mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
Bethlehem sounds sincere. He seems like a good guy.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mean any disrespect, sir, but you'd be better off just letting me go. A fighter is about the last thing I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman doubles over as Bethlehem hooks a fist into his gut. Bethlehem clubs him in the head, dropping him to his knees, then digs a boot into his side. The Postman goes down.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you think I should be the judge of that, soldier?
	</DIALOGUE>

The Postman gasps to catch his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get up. I said, get up.

</BETHLEHEM>

The Postman staggers to his feet. Blood trickles from his nose as he stares across at Bethlehem.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put up your fists.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd win.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Bethlehem looks to Getty. CLICK. Getty shoves a PISTOL is into The Postman's ear. The Postman reluctantly raises his fists. Bethlehem gives him a satisfied nod.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now fight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman takes a tentative step forward. Bethlehem drives him back with a flurry of blows. The Postman is dazed, nearly out on his feet. Bethlehem holds him up.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. You're not a fighter. But you will be. I'm giving you a chance at a life that means something. A life worth living.

That said, Bethlehem delivers one last blow to The Postman's face. Everything goes BLACK...

	Let's move it. Everybody up and at 'em.

The Postman comes to. He licks his dry, blood-caked lips. A sudden movement startles him -- it's Woody, shoving him a battered cup of water. It's like he's been keeping watch. The Postman is surprised, a little suspicious, and very grateful as he gulps the water down.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. Did I win?

Woody shakes his head "no."

Woody and The Postman scramble to fall-to with the other conscripts. Idaho surveys the ranks.

EXT. TRAINING CAMP - MESS LINE - CLOSE ON MEAT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A COOK dumps a scoop of gristly, gray meat into each mess pail as the conscripts wait in line. They fall to ravenously, too hungry to taste how bad it is. Idaho supervises.
</DIRECTION>
<IDAHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eat up! You got meat tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IDAHO>
<DIRECTION>
The line has almost passed. Just The Postman left and Bandit #20 bringing up the rear. Idaho looks at The Postman, addresses the COOK.
</DIRECTION>
<IDAHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you tell Shakespeare what kind of meat that is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IDAHO>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mule.

</COOK>
<DIRECTION>
Probably Bill -- and The Postman knows it. He stares in revulsion at the putrid meat ladled into his pail.
</DIRECTION>
<IDAHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A godawful animal. The sterile offspring of a horse and a donkey. Can you imagine that?! There's no room in this new world for a bastard like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IDAHO>

Bandit #20 holds out his pail. But the cook won't fill it.
</DIRECTION>
<IDAHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh uh.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(loudly; for all)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any man last in line ain't hungry enough. You show up last, you don't eat!

<DIRECTION>
Bandit #20 steps away in disbelief. Not knowing what else to do, he sits down beside The Postman, the only man with food who isn't eating.
</DIRECTION>

	I'll die before I'm last in line again.

EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The conscripts stand at attention under the guard of Idaho and two other soldiers. To their right is a dead oak tree. Behind them, three rows of folding chairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two figures approach. Bethlehem and Getty. Getty carries a sheathed sword. Bethlehem surveys the troops -- taking no more notice of The Postman than anyone else.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The laws of eight, gentlemen. That is the legacy handed down to us by Nathan Holn.

	May he burn in hell.

<DIRECTION>
Getty looks over at him. He heard him. The Postman swallows hard. Getty stares hard. Then he turns away. He's not going to bust him on it.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are the laws that we live by. The eight is our symbol. Each man will bear it with pride.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
Bethlehem nods at Idaho who pushes up his own sleeve to reveal the branded 8.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only then will you be part of the clan. Sit down, gentlemen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
The men move to sit in one of the three rows. Only then does it become apparent that there are 18 men and only 17 chairs. One SLOW RECRUIT is left standing. It doesn't take him long to realize that he's in trouble.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Law One. You will obey orders without question.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
The Slow Recruit moves to do so.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You disobeyed a direct order. You broke Law One.

Idaho and another soldier step up beside the Slow Recruit.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Law Two. Punishment shall be swift.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
They hustle the Recruit to the tree. Idaho unslings a coil of rope, throws it over a tree limb. They quickly slip a loop over the Slow Recruit's ankles and haul him upside down into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Law Three: Mercy is for the weak. Four: Terror will defeat reason. Five: Your allegiance is to the clan. Six: Justice can be dictated. Law Seven. Any clansman may challenge for leadership of the clan. Does any man here wish to challenge me?

</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
There are no takers.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On your feet!

</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
The conscripts stand like jackknives snapping open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without a word, without a look -- Bethlehem reaches out and draws a sword from a sheath that Getty holds. Bethlehem steps to the Slow Recruit -- who slowly twists around.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>

	Law Eight: There is only one penalty: Death.

As the sword finds its mark. Bethlehem looks at him, but addresses all.

	You will get out of this army what you put into it. Work and you'll be fed. Fight and you'll be respected. Die and you'll be remembered. It's up to you.

</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
Bethlehem turns and walks away. Getty following behind. The Postman watches as they go. Idaho steps up to him.
</DIRECTION>
<IDAHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You thinking of challenging for leadership of the clan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IDAHO>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir. I'm a follower not a leader.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<IDAHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see Colonel Getty? Always following the General? He's the only man who ever challenged. Fight lasted six seconds, but the General didn't kill him. He cut off his tongue and he cut off his balls and old Getty's been following him like a dog ever since.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IDAHO>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman looks back to see Bethlehem and Getty disappear into the gloom. Idaho grins, likes how this affects a new man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman moves on. Idaho stops Woody as he passes.

	The General don't see it, but I say you got some nigger in you.

Woody clenches his jaw, but wisely doesn't answer.

EXT. PLAINS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rain as the army moves. Boots suck at the mud. War wagons heave out of ruts. A monster gun is mounted on an old John Deere semi, pulled by a team of ten horses. The conscripts fill the middle ranks, each bearing a heavy pack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marching beside Woody, The Postman stares blankly ahead. The cry to halt. The conscripts unsling their packs, catch their breath. Idaho pulls The Postman out of line.

INT. GENERAL BETHLEHEM'S TENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Bethlehem stands before a painter's easel, palette in hand. He's got a mirror set up so he can see his reflection. He's doing a self-portrait in the tradition of the great Dutch Masters -- but it's a dismal failure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He continues painting even as Idaho leads The Postman in. Idaho salutes, steps back. For a moment, The Postman doesn't quite know what to do.
</DIRECTION>

Bethlehem wants an answer. The Postman clears his throat.

</THE_POSTMAN>

	Do you know what I did before the war? Do you think I was in the army? I sold copying machines. I was a salesman. The talent to lead men and devise and execute a battle plan were locked away inside me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up Finding A Way to Win by Nathan Holn. A 20- year-old self-help book.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If Nathan Holn hadn't come along, I'd still be selling copying machines. Can you imagine the wasted life? Can you imagine the magnitude of it? But war... War gives men like me a chance.

He turns to a dog-eared page in the book.

Idaho leaves. Bethlehem goes back to his painting. He considers himself in the mirror. After a long stare-down, he shouts:

<DIRECTION>
Bandit #20 looks scared, Woody unreadable.
</DIRECTION>
<BANDIT_20>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't.

</BANDIT_20>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

<BANDIT_20>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. I can't. I like it here. I like being a part of something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT_20>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman can't believe what Bandit #20 just said. Bandit #20 turns, hurries away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman looks to Woody who doesn't tip his hand either way. He moves away as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The conscripts break camp. Hot work. Glistening with sweat, The Postman stops to stretch. Across the way, he sees Bandit #20 talking to Getty. Getty glances at The Postman who returns to work, watches under his eyebrows as Idaho joins the group. There's trouble brewing here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Worried, The Postman looks to Woody, who watches the exchange as well. He is, as usual, inscrutable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CLEARING - RIVER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The river is swollen and swift from the spring thaw. Marching along the east ridge above it, the army is given the order to halt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman looks ahead to where Idaho confers with Bethlehem. Something's wrong. They look to where:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two carbine-toting soldiers stand alertly at guard by a thicket across the river. A rotten wood and rope bridge spans the space between the ridges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Idaho rides to the conscripts:
</DIRECTION>
<IDAHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of you dogs has earned himself a treat. Over there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IDAHO>
<DIRECTION>
Idaho points to the thicket as he proceeds down the line.
</DIRECTION>
<IDAHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those men hunted themselves a lion this morning. Must've been a zoo around here before the war. Anyhow, they shot him and he crawled into that thicket. A third man went in after him. We don't know if he's dead or alive. I need a volunteer. Someone's gotta go in and get our boy out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IDAHO>
<DIRECTION>
No volunteers, except the zealot Bandit #20.
</DIRECTION>
<BANDIT_20>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT_20>
<DIRECTION>
Idaho ignores him, stops in front of Woody.
</DIRECTION>
<IDAHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess size ain't a measure of courage, is it? Shakespeare!
	</DIALOGUE>
</IDAHO>
<DIRECTION>
The fix is in. The Postman steps out of line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Idaho's about to hand The Postman a carbine when --
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so, Captain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
Bethlehem nods to Getty. Getty takes a hunting knife from a belt-sheath and tosses it, blade first, into the ground between The Postman's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come out alive and you got yourself a lion steak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
Hefting the knife, The Postman stares at the west ridge.
</DIRECTION>
<IDAHO>
<DIRECTION>
(winks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you'll find your St. Rose up there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IDAHO>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman looks to Bandit #20 who stares back defiantly.
</DIRECTION>
<IDAHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you waiting for, Christmas?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IDAHO>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit #20 can't contain his giggling, so Idaho backhands the sound out of him -- then looks back to The Postman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grim The Postman starts forward, looks from the rotten bridge to the water and back again as he moves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All eyes on him as he starts across...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRIDGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman steps lightly. Far below, the river rages. A knotty plank starts to crack underfoot. Scooting off it, he takes a last look around. Continues across to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WEST RIDGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The soldiers greet him -- unholy smiles on their ugly mugs. They point him ahead, prod him forward toward a trail of wet blood which leads deeper into the thicket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stooping, The Postman enters. The soldiers split off and track along with him on either side of the thicket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THICKET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thorns catch and tear at his clothes as The Postman pushes his way through. He freezes. Ahead, sprawled and twisted, the mauled, bloody corpse of a Holnist soldier.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you stopping?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He alive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
Clearly he is not.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring him out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman heaves the corpse onto his back. Rising, steadying himself, he looks back over his shoulders at a GUTTURAL GROWL. He hurries forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone stares across the river, straining to see as The Postman emerges with the corpse on his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman starts across, hampered by his burden. He pauses, at his feet, the cracked, knotty plank.
</DIRECTION>
<IDAHO>
<DIRECTION>
(across river)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurry up! You still got a lion to bag!
	</DIALOGUE>
</IDAHO>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman decides, deliberately steps on the PLANK. CRACK. The Postman and the corpse drop thirty feet down, disappear in the river below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The corpse surfaces first, floats in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then The Postman. Farther down the river. Swimming downstream with powerful strokes. Between his efforts and the current, he's being quickly swept away from the Holnists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Bethlehem's eyes narrow in fury.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RIFLE BARKS a SHELL BACK after The Postman, but he disappears around a bend in the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bethlehem signals to two soldiers. They start running along the east ridge toward the riverbend.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two more start across the bridge to the west -- moving with military precision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bethlehem wheels toward the conscripts, points out Woody.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the water. Come back without him and you and another man will die in his place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
Woody dives in the water. Bethlehem looks to Idaho who dives in as well. Conscripts buzz with nervous excitement.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSCRIPTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go! Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSCRIPTS>
<BANDIT_20>
<DIRECTION>
(caught up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get him, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT_20>
<DIRECTION>
He takes off running across the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fallen tree spans the river. As The Postman is swept beneath, he reaches up and catches hold. Pulling himself out of the water, he scrambles for the west shore. He disappears into the woods as two soldiers appear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They catch hold of the tree, look to the west banking, see footprints in the mud where The Postman pulled himself out. They start after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CLEARING - WOODS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clothes in tatters, his lungs ready to burst, The Postman stops. He takes cover as the two soldiers run past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Breathing hard, The Postman steps out, starts across the clearing. He's halfway when Bandit #20 steps out from the trees. They look at each other for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just let me go. I don't want to be part of your army.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit #20 hesitates for a moment, then breaks into a grin.
</DIRECTION>
<BANDIT_20>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My army. I like the sound of that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT_20>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman gestures with his knife.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't --
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<BANDIT_20>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got him! Over --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT_20>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman lunges, digs into Bandit #20's gut. He blinks in surprise, then sags to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman takes a step back. A shadow falls over him. It's Woody. Staring down at The Postman. They can hear others approaching from the river.
</DIRECTION>
<WOODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They sent me to kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOODY>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment, Idaho and the second soldier come into the clearing. Idaho grins, relaxes his grip on his gun when he sees the mismatch between Woody and The Postman.
</DIRECTION>
<IDAHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, boy. Get him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IDAHO>
<WOODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's you or me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOODY>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<IDAHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finish it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IDAHO>
<DIRECTION>
Woody circles The Postman, until he's facing Idaho and the soldier. Woody takes a long look at The Postman, smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<WOODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No harness on my back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOODY>
<DIRECTION>
As The Postman realizes what he's doing, Woody flips his knife through the air and into the soldier's throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Woody rushes him, Idaho raises his GUN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Idaho pumps TWO ROUNDS into Woody, but the big man keeps coming. The THIRD ROUND finds his heart, puts Woody down. Dead. But not before he lands on top of Idaho.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Idaho struggles to get out from under Woody's massive frame, The Postman heads for the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Covered in Woody's blood, Idaho FIRES a ROUND as The Postman disappears into the woods. Idaho starts after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IDAHO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tracking. He sees a dribble of fresh blood. He touches it with his fingers and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He cocks his head at MOVEMENT to his left. Smiling, hefting his pistol, Idaho moves in. More SHUFFLING. Just ahead. He's got him now.
</DIRECTION>
<IDAHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want your St. Rose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IDAHO>
<DIRECTION>
There's a RUSTLE of BRUSH just before a ROAR splits the air. Idaho doesn't even have time to scream as the LION pounces down on top of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CLIFF - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman, lungs heaving, stops his climb long enough to take stock of the Army waiting on the distant river edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Strength ebbing, he heaves himself up and continues climbing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOODS (EASTERN OREGON) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A chilling RAIN drills down, washing across an old forest road. Covered with undergrowth and dotted with saplings, nothing's been down here in years.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blue-lipped and shivering, his clothes torn and soaked, The Postman trudges along. He tries to rub some warmth back into his numbed limbs, but a coughing spell wracks his body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He trudges forward, shoes heavy with freezing mud. He's made his escape, but he won't last the night if he doesn't find some shelter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An unnatural shape ahead, just off the road. Square. He cautiously pulls back a few branches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old, rusted Jeep with faded U.S. government markings. Its hood buried under the dirt of an old mud slide. The Postman stoops to look through the passenger side window, comes face-to-face with death. A skeleton sits inside, the skull grinning against the glass facing The Postman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But The Postman doesn't jump back. He just stares. The two heads meet halfway as The Postman's face is reflected on the glass, superimposed over the skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hypothermic shiver wracks his body. The Postman tries the door, but it won't budge. The other side of the Jeep is buried. But seeing that the windshield is partly smashed, he clears away the debris, peels back the spider- webbed safety glass and climbs inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JEEP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulling the glass back down, he looks almost shyly at the skeleton, like two kids about to "park" for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. How ya doin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The back of the Jeep is filled with bags marked U.S. Mail. The Postman picks up a hat off the console. Oddly respectful, he runs a finger along the band over the "Horse & Rider" emblem.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman reaches, touches the embroidered American flag patch on the skeleton's jacket shoulder. Another shiver. A moment later, The Postman is pulling the nice dry jacket off the skeleton and shoving his own arms inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sloshing sound. He pats down the jacket. Finds a liquor. He gives the skeleton a "you shouldn't have" look. But the cap won't budge. He twists, pries, bangs the neck of the steering wheel. At last it gives. He takes a long, hard swallow. The warming fire streams down his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman grabs a random letter, reads it aloud.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Jerry Ball, Pine View.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to open it, looks at the skeleton and shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, arrest me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's a piece of good news. Jerry's decided to go to school to get his contractor's license.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Tossing it aside, he takes a drink, opens another. The words are in crayon -- a child's scrawl.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles to skeleton)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little Jimmy wants his grandpa to know he lost a tooth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman turns the envelope over in his palm. A tiny tooth falls out. The Postman considers it. This suddenly isn't so amusing. He puts it back in the envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shoving mail sacks aside, he climbs in the back. Burrowing in, he pulls the sacks back, covering himself with a blanket of mail. Getting warmer already, he regards the skeleton a beat as the RAIN DRUMS ON the ROOF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JEEP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wearing the blue uniform, The Postman looks down at the fresh grave, realizes a eulogy is in order. He takes off the hat, holds it over his chest for a heartfelt moment of silence.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for being there for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(raising the flask)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's to you. I consider my taxes very well spent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He swallows the last few drops, then sets the flask down as a headstone. What now?
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All dressed up. Nowhere to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY (SOMEWHERE IN OREGON) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His hair growing back nicely, The Postman has reached the proverbial fork in the road. He considers his two options: "Pine View -- 32 miles." Or "Ridgemont -- 220 miles." He looks the two roads over, thinks.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's easy.

EXT. GATES (PINE VIEW, OREGON) - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The town is protected by a tall, long palisade. Like Ft. Apache. All is dark as The Postman approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Greetings, Pine View, Oregon!

</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SENTRIES appears from the gate house. They aim arrows.
</DIRECTION>
<SENTRY_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just head back the way you came. Pine View ain't buying, ain't listening and don't give charity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENTRY_1>

A moment of truth is here. Finally, with authority:

	Civilian, I'm on official business. I demand entry into the town of Pine View.

More silhouettes appear on the palisade. One is SHERIFF BRISCOE, a big, no-nonsense man.

An uproar. He makes himself heard above it.

	Wait! I'm going to get something out of my bag.

There's an absolute stunned silence. Like a switch was thrown.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. INSIDE GATES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd parts as everyone turns to look back at IRENE MARCH. Mrs. March, in her late 50s, is blind, her eyes clouded by cataracts. In disbelief...
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MARCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he say my name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MARCH>
<DIRECTION>
The sense of hope is palpable as the gates are swung back. Two TOWNIES hurry Mrs. March out to meet The Postman. They're followed by a throng. As he sees she's blind...
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Too late now. They stop Mrs. March in front of him. She stares off just to his left, a little afraid.

Excited, the people move closer. Someone holds up a torch and The Postman starts.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Dear Irene. Sorry I haven't written. Everything's so crazy. The strange weather. The food shortages. That farmer Nathan Holn causing all that trouble. It's hard to understand. David's home from the Army. The war was over before he even got there. Thank God for that. He's still my baby no matter how big he gets. We're going to miss you for Christmas, but maybe next year.

Mrs. March reaches out a trembling hand to take the letter.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MARCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My sister in Denver. Fifteen years ago. Thank you.

The populace erupts with excitement. Mrs. March takes The Postman's hand, clasps it tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MARCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a Godsend. A savior.

The Postman pulls his hand back, rejects the title.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'm just... a postman.

<DIRECTION>
An almost awesome silence. Too much for The Postman.

The townspeople welcome him with cheers. The Postman raises a silencing hand. As they quiet...

	Yes, there is! If there are dogs in this town, you have to leash them while I'm here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Only The Postman laughs. No one else reacts. Briscoe watches dubiously from the wall as the people surround The Postman and sweep him through the gates and into town.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One couple watches The Postman closely as he makes his way into town. She is ABBY -- a sweet-faced, pretty woman. Her husband, MICHAEL, is a decent-looking sort, tall and strong.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABANDONED HOTEL - ROOM 7 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A freestanding tub has been set up, water "bucketed" in. The Postman luxuriates in his first hot bath in years and sings a familiar tune to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Stop. Oh, yes, wait a minute, Mr. Postman. Waaa-ait, Mr. Postman...'
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FORD crosses the parking lot of an abandoned motel. He's a black kid, maybe 16, too young to remember any other life but this. He carries The Postman's uniform on a hanger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABANDONED HOTEL - ROOM 7 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman looks up at a KNOCK. Ford steps in. Like most kids, he needs a hero. Holding up the uniform, he just found one.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
<DIRECTION>
(beaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cleaned and pressed, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. Didn't somebody say something about dinner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm supposed to take you to Foster's.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(extending a hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name's Ford. Ford Lincoln Mercury.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman just nods, hoisting himself out of the tub and hurriedly wrapping a towel around himself.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Used to be John Stevens, but I changed it on account of I want to drive cars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Hoping to impress, Ford reaches into a pocket, pulls out a worn, creased flyer for a "Ford Lincoln Mercury" dealership. Ford finds The Postman just staring at him, waiting for the uniform he's still got in his hand. Embarrassed, Ford quickly hands it over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford leads the way as they leave the motel behind. The Postman looks good in his uniform. They cross a parking lot where five partly-stripped cars have been sitting for years. There's a potted plant outside the driver's door of one.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I live in that car. A 2003 Pontiac Sinatra. With a nine- banger and a Q-eight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	V-eight. Eight cylinders. That means an eight-banger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<FORD>
<DIRECTION>
(in awe of him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were they fast?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A buck seventy-five on a strip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A buck seventy-five? I thought maybe I could fix some of them up. It's nothing compared to what you do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
This is the last thing he expected to hear out of this kid's mouth. A moment, then...
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The important thing to remember about cars is, you can't eat 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead, people are gathered inside an old Foster's Freeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FOSTER'S FREEZE (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The townspeople fill the booths, line the walls. They talk excitedly amongst themselves, break into spontaneous applause as Ford and The Postman enter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman is surprised, uncomfortable at this display. But then he sees that a banquet has been laid out on the counter. The centerpiece is a huge vat of steaming stew.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PEOPLE clear a path for him.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell us about the government!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_1>
<WOMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, tell us everything!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_1>
<DIRECTION>
Startled, The Postman doesn't quite know what to say. They seat him at a table -- but the food looks miles away.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there a President?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_2>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<WOMAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's his name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_2>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I'm pretty hungry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
But these people won't be denied. Finally...
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His name is, uh... Richard Starkey. From Maine. He has a saying. 'Things are getting better, getting better all the time.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
There's warm applause at that. Several people try the expression out on each other.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He a Democrat or a Republican?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_3>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Parties are over with. The individual is what counts. You vote for the best man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen sets a steaming bowl of stew in front of The Postman. Famished, he digs in.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_4>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Europe? Any word?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_4>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman tries to speak through a mouthful of food.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lady Di's in charge. Sixty years old and she still kicks ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<WOMAN_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Nathan Holn still alive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_3>
<THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles at irony)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He died. Skin cancer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
That's sure good news to everyone. But...
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_4>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the Holnists? They're still out there. What's the government going to do about them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_4>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman looks at the desperate faces -- he'd rather get back to his meal -- but this may be the most important question of all. He doesn't want to lie.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The government's just getting started. You're on your own for at least eighteen months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<MAN_5>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the Marines Corp?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_5>
<DIRECTION>
A clamor of Holnist questions.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be quiet, everyone! Can't we just let this man eat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
The people nod and The Postman finally gets to eat. He catches sight of Briscoe watching him from the door. After a moment, Briscoe leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FOSTER'S FREEZE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A band plays an odd array of instruments. There's dancing. The Postman sits behind four empty bowls. People watch him eat like it was a religious experience. He pushes back the fifth bowl.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never thought I'd hear myself say this, but I can't eat anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He's cut off by the sight of a silent, little boy. The kid's looking up, staring intently at something.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The boy just stares.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(re: the cap)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The boy nods. The Postman shakes his head and smiles to himself. He takes off the cap, sets it on the kid's head.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Almost fits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The boy's eyes go wide with wonder. His stock's gone up 1000%. Before he can rush off to impress his friends, ELLEN -- his mother -- steps over and gently chides him.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not a toy, honey. That's very important. Give it back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
The boy carefully removes the cap, hands it back to The Postman. Ellen smiles gratefully and gently guides her son away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman shrugs, turns to find Abby, the pretty woman we saw at the Pine View gates. She smiles at The Postman.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like to dance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if I can, I think I'm still on duty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs. Abby says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been a long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Abby holds out her hand like a promise.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All you got to do is hold on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
DANCE FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abby and The Postman dance. She keeps looking him over.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is something wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How tall are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About six feet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you smart?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smarter than some I guess. Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just wondering. Did you ever have the bad mumps?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman smiles. She's odd, but beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never had the bad mumps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever had herpes or syphilis or anything like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head "no." They continue to dance.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So as far as you know, you have good semen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that a trick question?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mean to be nosy. I'm only asking because I want you to make me pregnant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
Stunned, The Postman stops dancing. Abby takes this moment to grab Michael.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's got to be the uniform.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Abby takes Michael's arm, introduces him proudly.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is my husband. Michael.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
Michael smiles, shakes hands with a grave-digger's grip. The Postman doesn't know what to think.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been trying to have a baby for three years. We can't on account of Michael had the bad mumps when he was twelve. So we need a body father. We could ask a man here, but it could cause trouble. I've seen it happen. Things go okay until the woman starts to show. Then it can be bad. But you'll only be around once in awhile with the mail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman just stares at them. Abby looks to Michael.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He hasn't said 'no'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(undaunted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you say, mister? You'd be doing us a favor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have to think about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman excuses himself with a nod and turns away, shaking his head at the strangeness of this new world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But no rest for the wicked, as soon as he's free from Abby and Michael, he's running smack into another group of well-wishing TOWNIES. Mrs. March is among them. She's holding an envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<TOWNIE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. March wants to give you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Mrs. March)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's right here, Irene.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOWNIE_1>
<MRS_MARCH>
<DIRECTION>
(re: letter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's to my daughter Annie. She left five years ago. She was only fifteen. The last I heard, she was living up north...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MARCH>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman swallows hard, looks from the envelope to the faces around him, to Mrs. March. She looks blindly back. How can he lie to her?
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Mrs. March, you should know that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<MRS_MARCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MARCH>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
But she stops him, grabs for his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MARCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a feeling about you. I know you'll do what's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MARCH>
<DIRECTION>
Her hand leaves his and she disappears into the crowd. She's left him with her letter and no choice at all.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got to get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PINE VIEW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman moves through town. The streets are deserted. He's got his pack on, his mailbag. He passes a 7-11 converted to a blacksmith shop. There's a horse tethered to the railing in front of it. He grins; maybe he's going to make it out of here after all. As he starts to move toward the horse...
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's right around the corner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
An OLD MAN sits on his porch across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(freezes, startled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<OLD_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you're looking for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Old Man winks knowingly, then heads inside. As The Postman turns the corner, he finds himself in front of the post office. An old brick building. Chiseled in the granite facing: "UNITED STATES POST OFFICE. EST. 1884."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POST OFFICE (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Long ago stripped, it still has a proud, official, almost holy feel. The Postman wanders in, stops to read the credo calligraphied on the wall. "Neither snow, nor rain..." He turns at a SOUND. Ford is here, leaning against a wall.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew you'd come here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ford nods. A sage sixteen-year-old.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you get to be a postman, anyhow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to be in the right place at the right time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could I do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you wanted to drive cars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not anymore. That was kid's stuff. This is real. So, where's the right place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could be anywhere. Anytime. Only another postman can make you a postman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kinda like vampires, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something like that. You have to be sworn in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ford raises his right hand, palm out, ready to take the oath. It takes The Postman a moment to realize.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The organization's kinda shaky. It might not last.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd meet a lot of people who don't believe in you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll set them straight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a lonely job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been lonely all my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
This response strikes a chord. The Postman sees how badly Ford wants something to hold onto. He sees himself.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So have I, Ford. So have I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman looks up at the creed on the wall. Finally...
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell? Repeat after me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<POSTMAN_FORD>
<DIRECTION>
(repeating)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POSTMAN_FORD>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<FORD>
<DIRECTION>
(repeating)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, no, I'm saying that. You just listen... By my authority you are now empowered to carry the mail.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(extends a hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulations, you're a postman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
They shake hands. The Postman doesn't realize, but this is the most important moment in Ford's life.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to know I'd die to get a letter through.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Ford's intensity takes The Postman back. But the moment is broken when...
</DIRECTION>
<BRISCOE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnny, why don't you run along. I need to speak to this man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRISCOE>
<DIRECTION>
Ford bristles at "Johnny," looks to The Postman.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see you around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure thing, Ford.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ford exits.
</DIRECTION>
<BRISCOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnny's real impressed with you. Whole town's real impressed with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRISCOE>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I take it you're not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<BRISCOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smarter than you look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRISCOE>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can I do for you, Sheriff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<BRISCOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can clear out. Or I can throw you out. Either way suits me fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRISCOE>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid you don't understand, Sheriff. I'm a government employee. Authorized by --
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<BRISCOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not authorized by shit. You're nothing but a drifter who found a bag of mail. And I want you out of my town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRISCOE>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is going in my report.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<BRISCOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These people don't need dreams, Mr. Postman. They need something real. They need help with the goddamn Holnists. Are you going to bring them that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as The Postman doesn't answer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't think so. All you cost us so far is a few bowls of soup and maybe later a few broken hearts. I aim to keep it that way. You can stay till morning. Then I don't ever want to see you again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRISCOE>
<DIRECTION>
Briscoe exits, leaves The Postman alone in the post office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABANDONED HOTEL - ROOM 7 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman arrives home. He pushes open the door, knocking over a stack of letters that have been shoved under the door. He gathers them up, flips through them. They're written on scraps, the backs of pictures, on handkerchiefs and homemade paper. They aren't old.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're brand new. Shaking his head, he closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman has no sooner done so when there's a KNOCK on the window. He looks over at a woman. She shrugs, smiles, holds up a letter. The Postman sighs; he's trapped in here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOSTER'S FREEZE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA STARTS ON a man with a string-tied package crossing the streets and DRIFTS TO the abandoned car where Ford lives. He's home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON FORD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Concentrating, Ford holds a needle and thread and a piece of cloth on which he's drawn an approximation of the post office shoulder patch. By moonlight he embroiders it in. Not exactly work you'd pay money for, but not bad either.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABANDONED HOTEL - ROOM 7 - CLOSE ON STRING-TIED PACKAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
~from the previous scene. It's on the table with a growing stack of mail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman is in bed, trying to sleep. But it's hard- coming. He laces his fingers behind his head, stares up at the moon through a hole in the wall. A KNOCK at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just leave it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
There's a pause. And then, ANOTHER KNOCK.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said leave it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens. Surprise. Abby stands in the doorway, her hair held up by an old red ribbon. He sits up.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Abby.

</THE_POSTMAN>
<ABBY>

Abby laughs. The Postman is charmed.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're funny. Hardly anyone's funny around here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess no one feels much like laughing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The two of them just look at each other a moment. Abby fingers the ribbon in her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you decided yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well, I've been thinking about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Abby lets her shift drop to the floor, then slides under the sheets alongside him.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
They lie there awkwardly for a moment. He looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, you're beautiful. Sorry, I know you'd probably like to keep things more clinical.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't even know my name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>

She shushes him, covers his mouth with her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
He nods he understands. She stares into his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would be easier for me if you closed your eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman closes his eyes. Abby slides her hand away from his mouth. And as they start to make love...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABANDONED HOTEL - ROOM 7 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman wakes, reaches for the warm body that was there last night. But Abby is gone. All that's left behind is her red ribbon. Wistful, he picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABANDONED HOTEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman exits. In uniform, his bag slung over his shoulder. He starts then stops short. Only now do we see most of the townspeople have silently assembled here. They've been waiting for him, starving for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford steps up, hands him another fresh packet of letters. The Postman sees that Ford hangs on to four or five.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about those?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are going to Blue Jay. About twenty miles east. I thought I could take them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman scans the crowd. Looking for Abby maybe?
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(absently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. They're yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Briscoe rides up, regards The Postman sternly.
</DIRECTION>
<BRISCOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm your escort out of town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRISCOE>
<DIRECTION>
Some of the town's CITIZENS lead up a saddled mare.
</DIRECTION>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We took a vote, Mr. Postman. We want you to have this horse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<CITIZEN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now don't say no. A man on horseback can cover ten times the territory of a man on foot.
	</DIALOGUE>

<THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles at Briscoe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take it.

</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He ties his mailbag to the saddle, swings himself up.
</DIRECTION>
<CITIZEN_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a bedroll, some oats and a week's rations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_3>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where do you figure you'll go from here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go?... Oh yeah... I'll head west, then work my way back here in a sort of figure eight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
"8." Everyone's quiet a moment. They shift uncomfortably. The Postman looks out at the crowd. They crave hope. He should probably just keep his mouth shut.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Times seem hard right now. But you have to believe it's getting better. Birds are migrating again. The rains are back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The people consider him and then each other. By God, they do feel hopeful. Suddenly, Ellen, her little boy by her side, begins to sing. It's weak at first, but one-by-one the others join in. Soon the whole town is singing:
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN_TOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Oh beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain. For purple mountain's majesty, above the fruited plain. America...'
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN_TOWN>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman looks around. They sing their hearts out. The guilt is overwhelming. He digs his heels into the horse's flanks and rides out of town.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PALISADE GATES (PINE VIEW) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People line the top as The Postman and Briscoe ride out. The strains of "AMERICA" still in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<BRISCOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a helluva nerve, whoever you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRISCOE>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman doesn't rise to the bait.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Abby around?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<BRISCOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She and Michael are working the north meadow this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRISCOE>
<DIRECTION>
Briscoe reins up -- he's gone as far as his duty commands.
</DIRECTION>
<BRISCOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you're on your own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRISCOE>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman tips his cap and continues riding by "Pine View - Population 132." Briscoe watches a moment, then calls after him:
</DIRECTION>
<BRISCOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Are you really who you say you are?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRISCOE>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I come back with some mail, you'll know!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman continues. Caught in an inner turmoil, Briscoe reaches into his pocket, and pulls out a letter. He turns it over in his hands, looks off at The Postman.
</DIRECTION>
<BRISCOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God damn it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRISCOE>
<DIRECTION>
Briscoe urges his horse forward, catches up. He hands The Postman the letter, then rides back for town. The Postman watches Briscoe. The people lining the wall. And he realizes just what effect he's had. There's nothing to do, but shrug his shoulders and ride. Strains of "AMERICA" still ECHO hauntingly OVER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ON ROAD - SUN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A green and lavender sunset. In the middle of nowhere, The Postman rides, chewing a piece of jerked beef. He flips through some of the letters entrusted to him.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seattle. Boise... St. Rose, Paradise on the Pacific...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He considers the letter, looks around as if someone may be watching. He just begins to tear the corner, then stops.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe one thing can still be sacred.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to horse)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All in all, not a bad gig, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The HORSE SNORTS. Smiling, The Postman shoves the envelope into his bag. As he does, he finds something else. The red ribbon. He runs it through his fingers, thinks wistfully of Abby. Then, like a knight of old representing a lady's honor, he ties it to his mailbag and rides on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WELL (PINE VIEW) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abby's washing clothes with a tub and washboard. Waging war on dirt. Michael leans against a tree, watches Abby at work until she notices him. She wipes the sweat from her brow, tries not to smile.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you looking at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything.

</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
He steps over and they're in each other's arms. This is love. But as Michael kisses her, we hear a familiar alarm:
</DIRECTION>

	Holnists! Holnists are coming!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENTRY>

Led by Bethlehem and Getty, the soldiers ride in. Something about the citizens disturbs Bethlehem.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't usually look at me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
Bethlehem reins in across from the post office. Someone has hung a tattered old American flag.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's responsible for that?!

</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
No one answers. All heads are down now.

INT. POST OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford is sweeping up. The place looks almost presentable. He stops when he hears Bethlehem calling once more for the responsible party.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford starts forward. Suddenly Briscoe is blocking his way.
</DIRECTION>
<BRISCOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holnists, Johnny. You gotta stay out of sight.

</BRISCOE>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a postman. And I'm not hiding from anyone. I --

Briscoe grabs him by the shirt, hauls him out the back way.

	You. You'll be responsible.

<DIRECTION>
(to soldiers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get him a torch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
Michael walks out into the square. One of the soldiers returns with a burning torch, gives it to Michael.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bethlehem looks at the town, then at Michael.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Set that flag on fire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
ON MICHAEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's killing him, but Michael sets the torch to the flag.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now throw it through the window of your 'post office.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH! The TORCH goes through the post office WINDOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON FORD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Struggling to get out, but Briscoe blocks his way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BETHLEHEM
</DIRECTION>

As flames grow, he takes one last look around.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The United States doesn't exist. That flag is an abomination.

Briscoe steps forward, attempts to diffuse the situation.

<BRISCOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	General Bethlehem.

(as Bethlehem turns)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're gathering the tribute, sir. Can I take your wagons?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRISCOE>

Bethlehem decides not to kill anyone, looks to Getty.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make sure that fire doesn't go out.

The General joins Briscoe.

Tears on his cheeks, Ford watches the post office burn.

EXT. PARKING LOT (PINE VIEW) - EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bethlehem relaxes with his officers as wagons are loaded. Michael is just passing with a sack of grain on his shoulder, when Bethlehem looks across the street -- spies Abby and some of the other women sewing grain sacks shut.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good Lord. That, gentlemen, is a first-rate piece of ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
Michael overhears. He looks over as Bethlehem's men nod in agreement. Michael sees that they're talking about Abby.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell the Sheriff I want to be introduced. She does not belong in a mudhole like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
One of the men hurries off. It's concern for Abby, not for his manhood that makes him step forward.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>

	Excuse me.

<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know what system of government we have here, son?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Michael shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A feudal system. Like the Middle Ages. With lords and vassals. That's you and me. Those lords, they had some ideas. If a vassal got married, it was the lord's right, his right, to sleep with the bride on the wedding night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me and Abby have been married for three years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<BETHLEHEM>

<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't? I'm tired of can't. We had a great nation once. Do you know what made it that way? I can! Till the weak came along. The 'I can'ts' destroyed us. But I'm going to make us strong again. I'm going to be the father of a new nation.

Abby rushes forward, but she's blocked by Getty and another man. She cries out again and again.

Filled with impotent fury, Briscoe squeezes out the words.

Briscoe might go after Bethlehem despite the odds.

Not waiting for an answer, Getty charges the crowd, knocks one of the onlookers down. A dead silence.

They open enough to let the Postman ride out, then close behind him. He sits nervously on his horse waving a white flag. He's met, dismounts and is led to a command post where Bethlehem is studying a rough map of the town.

The last time he and Bethlehem were face-to-face, the Postman had a shaved head, was dressed in rags, and was covered with cuts and bruises. Bethlehem can't place him, but there's something familiar all the same.

Bethlehem has decided.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In accordance with law eight and by the authority of Emergency Order 46, you are hereby --

</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
A CRACK of RIFLE FIRE. The Captain's forehead explodes and he falls to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shocked, Bethlehem whirls for the source of the GUNFIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abby! FIRING from a position behind a supply wagon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But even as Bethlehem turns, an ARROW SINGS in and lodges in his arm. Fired from a pocket of sentries up on the palisade. Bethlehem bellows in outrage and pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman takes advantage of the moment of chaos to grab the fallen Captain's gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls a Holnist rider from his horse and swings into the saddle. The unhorsed rider goes for his gun. But once more SHOTS RING OUT and he goes down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bethlehem ducks as another BULLET ZINGS close. Too close.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
Two soldiers move forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly The Postman's HORSE comes THUNDERING -- trampling the Holnist nearest him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other Holnist hears, looks back, sees The Postman coming and takes aim just as The Postman brings his gun to bear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Holnist FIRES first. We don't see the hit. Just watch as The Postman FIRES an answering ROUND. The Holnist goes down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman reins up alongside the wagon. Grunting with pain, he reaches down, takes Abby's arm and swings her up behind him. Then digs his heels in for all he's worth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More Holnists come on the run. They FIRE. The HORSE SNORTS in pain. He's hit. But The Postman urges him on, heading into the woods.
</DIRECTION>

Bethlehem snaps off the arrow shaft and shouts:

<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't stop now. They'll be coming after us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman's head lolls forward. She feels something on her hand, pulls it back smeared with blood. The Postman's shot in the belly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The horse is failing. Near death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the sound of PURSUING CAVALRY. Abby urges the horse off the road. When the thicket grows too dense, Abby jumps down. She catches The Postman as he slides off, easing him to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(disoriented)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Abby...

<DIRECTION>
Abby shushes him. She pulls on the horse's bridle to force him farther along. But it's no good, the wounded horse goes down on its knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And five RIDERS THUNDER past. Fooled. All but the SIXTH, who pulls up to listen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the deep b.g., flames lick at the billowing black smoke. The town is burning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The HORSE WHINNIES: in its death throes. Abby panics, tries to quiet the horse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sixth Soldier has heard the suffering horse. He draws his rifle from the saddle boot and starts into the thicket.

<DIRECTION>
ON ABBY AND POSTMAN
</DIRECTION>

The Postman lies unconscious on the ground. Abby sits beside him, rifle in hand. The Sixth Soldier appears.

<ABBY>

He hesitates at first. Then dismounts and moves toward her. Abby cocks the rifle.

Moving closer still, he doesn't see the BRANCH pulled back in The Postman's hand until it SNAPS hard into his face.

<DIRECTION>
He stumbles back.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right.

</ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
Abby dashes out, rifle in hand. She swings for the bleachers. The butt catches the side of the Sixth Soldier's head. He falls hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman's eyes flutter. Dazed, he watches as Abby pilfers through the Soldier's gear. She takes everything of value: a knife, bullets, a canteen. His eyes flutter closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOODS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snowflakes swirl. Abby lays a sapling travois beside The Postman. He groans as she rolls him onto it, tucks a blanket around him. Using all the strength God gave her, Abby lifts one end, gets it high enough to hitch it to the Sixth Soldier's horse. As Abby leads the horse away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOOD ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The snow has increased. A Holnist patrol moves down the road, disappears around a bend. A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abby appears, leading the horse and travois. She crosses the road and disappears into the woods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later, she reappears with a pine branch which she uses to brush at the snow, obscuring their tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CASCADE MOUNTAINS (OREGON) - DAY

Riding into a blizzard, Abby leads the way up a zigzag path. A valley opens up below. The unconscious Postman lies bundled on the travois.

EXT. HUNTING SHACK - DUSK

A little square shape just visible beyond a creek. Abby leads the horse and travois-bound Postman to it.

INT. HUNTING SHACK - DUSK
</DIRECTION>

One room. Dirt floor. The WINDOWS RATTLE in the WIND. Snow falls through a hole in the roof. The wooden DOOR BURSTS back and Abby enters. Half-frozen, she leads the horse and the travois right inside.
</DIRECTION>

INT. HUNTING SHACK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fire has been lit.
</DIRECTION>

The Postman lies unconscious, his shirt open as Abby washes around his wound. She pulls the shirt back to clean his chest. The material falls away and Abby stops short. There -- high on his biceps -- a branded "8." She stares in disbelief.

She turns her back on him without a word. The Postman tries an exchange just the same.

</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He's nonplused to find Abby standing beside a pile of their neatly-packed gear.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got our stuff out.

</THE_POSTMAN>
<ABBY>

</THE_POSTMAN>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't think we'd stay here forever, did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(The Postman has no response)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd appreciate if you'd walk with me long enough to find someplace safe for the baby. Then we can split up.

	You shaved.

	Yeah...

<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It looks nice.

</ABBY>

Before he can respond, she's heading off toward the pass, leaving The Postman to shake his head at the absurdity of it all. He shouts after her.

EXT. VALLEY - BELOW CASCADE MOUNTAINS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrying their gear, Abby and The Postman walk across a meadow of wild flowers, headed for an old road.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever heard of St. Rose, Abby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've heard people talk. I've heard lots of names. Bliss. Hesperia. New Eden. Sheriff Briscoe says it's a fantasy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's wrong. St. Rose is out there. And I'm going to find it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you're The Postman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I'm nobody, Abby. I'm just...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Before he can come clean -- they see a distant RIDER coming hard. The Postman unslings the rifle, slides a round into the chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is what I hate. Strangers. Do you say 'hi' or do you blow their head off? Do they want to share what they got or take what you have? And if they want to take, how far are you willing to go to stop them? Damn it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Rider)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. That's far enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Rider pulls up short, wearing a blue home-made uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't want any trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<RIDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me neither, mister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDER>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman is taken aback. The Rider, a girl, pulls off her cap, mops it across her brow. Maybe 14, we'll always know her by her Ponytail. Abby registers the uniform first.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<PONYTAIL>
<DIRECTION>
(RIDER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carrier 18. U.S. Postal Service. Got any mail?

</PONYTAIL>
<DIRECTION>
Lowering the rifle, The Postman looks over at Abby, back to Ponytail.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's impossible.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, tell us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<PONYTAIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's only the greatest man who ever lived. He crossed the wasteland, shook his fist at the enemy and spit in the eye of General Bethlehem himself. He's back east with President Starkey right now.

<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who told you all this?

</THE_POSTMAN>
<PONYTAIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Postmaster Ford Lincoln Mercury. He's in direct contact with the restored congress.

	Thirty-two. As of midnight.

EXT. R.V. PARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oregon's main post office. A silver Airstream, fifty mobile homes and rusty Winnebagos resting on flat tires. Flying from a pole: the flag of the restored United States. A young recruit is ringing a bell on the top of a Winnebago.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford walks along an RV boulevard. He's joined by two young carriers, RED and Chubby (the sentry from Benning). All wear hip, personalized variations of the official uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got another letter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUBBY>
<DIRECTION>
They come around the corner to where seven young recruits wait. They're joined by another twenty carriers.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More recruits?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven of them. They're coming from everywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
Ford looks them over in satisfaction.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you get a letter or didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Ford smiles, reaches into his pocket. He pulls out a creased sheet of paper. Chubby grins.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gather 'round, everybody. Got another letter here. Came in last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Buzzing with excitement, the carriers gather around Ford.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUTH END OF BOULEVARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ponytail leads Abby and The Postman. They come up in the back of the crowd. Flanked by Red and Chubby, Ford stands on the hood of a car, letter in hand. The Postman taps a clueless YOUNG CARRIER on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's all this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<YOUNG_CARRIER>

</CARRIERS>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here in Minneapolis with President Starkey, but my thoughts are with you. Remember, nothing worth doing can be done overnight. Keep your chins up and do your best not to get shot. Signed, The Postman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
A buzz goes through the crowd. Ponytail looks over.
</DIRECTION>
<PONYTAIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His letters are always kind of short.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PONYTAIL>
<DIRECTION>
Abby and The Postman exchange a look.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
<DIRECTION>
(looks up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on now. There's a P.S... Anybody know what P.S. stands for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman raises his hand. Ford looks his way. His mouth drops as he realizes. In silence, he walks over to The Postman. They embrace and all the weight Ford's been carrying on his young shoulders suddenly falls to The Postman. The kid nearly collapses.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUBBY>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That would be H.S., Chubby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<CHUBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I seen him once when I lived in Benning. It's The Postman!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Word goes through the crowd like a wave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman takes the letter, reads.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	P.S. Ford knows what to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ford shrugs sheepishly.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess you want to talk about this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman takes Ford by the elbow. They disappear into the tent. The carriers just staring after them, awestruck.
</DIRECTION>
<PONYTAIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found him! I found him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PONYTAIL>
<DIRECTION>
They clamor around her.

INT. TENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman and Ford.

<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	President Starkey? Minneapolis? Ford knows what to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you were dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So? I'm not making the connection. What's all this then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I lied. I told people you were in contact with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I didn't want it to end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how long I can stay, Ford. President Starkey will send word one day and I'll have to move on. Understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. But you'll stay till he sends word? Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman can't answer, just turns and walks out of the tent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As The Postman exits, Chubby leads the carriers in a salute. The Postman actually turns a moment to see if someone else is standing behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks back, sees the young, shining faces.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, don't do that. Hands down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Their hands go down in one crisp military move. The Postman looks at Abby, to Ford as he exits the tent. The kid is craving reassurance.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll stay 'til President Starkey sends word, right? Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, till he sends word, right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ford smiles, gestures to the carriers.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you say a few words?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman looks over at the carriers. They quiet under his gaze, immediately respectful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The problem is, he has no idea what to say. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two plus two equals four.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The cheering is tumultuous. The Postman picks Abby out of the cheering crowd -- the look on her face says it all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RV PARK - WINNEBAGO ROW - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guts of the operation. Several carriers are busy sorting and bagging letters. It goes out pinned to a clothesline which crisscrosses back and forth. Everyone follows as Ford takes The Postman on a tour. There are hushed whispers among those who are seeing him for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We bring all the mail here first. We sort it, group it and then it goes out. So far we got thirty routes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Ford leads The Postman and Abby into another Winnebago. Chubby and Red and Ponytail follow. Those that can't fit just peer in through the windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WINNEBAGO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old manual crank printing press is working away. Ford proudly removes a sheet, shows it to The Postman. A caricature of eight evil Holnists, forming a figure eight. Beneath: "Unite Against Holnist Tyrraney!"
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>

The seven young Recruits seen earlier stand in a line. They're joined by OLD GEORGE, every day of 75 years old.

Ponytail holds up her hand, swears them in.

<PONYTAIL_RECRUITS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PONYTAIL_RECRUITS>
<DIRECTION>
As they finish, The Postman and Ford pass by. The Recruits salute. Shaking his head, The Postman's about to salute back when he spots Old George. George has a faded purple "AIRBORNE" tattoo on his arm and a twinkle in his eye. There's an old crow on his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How old are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<OLD_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seventy-five, sir.

<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you ride?

</THE_POSTMAN>
<OLD_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope. Can't walk too good, either.

</THE_POSTMAN>
<OLD_GEORGE>

The Postman looks at Ford again. Then:

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did you get that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>

EXT. RV CAMP - AIRSTREAM - SUNSET

Carriers move items out of the trailer. The camp is buzzing as usual. The Postman looks on -- sees Abby passing by.

<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Abby --
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?

</ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
He's got her attention, just doesn't know what to do with it.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ford wants me to have his trailer. Said it's the best one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm on the other side of town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<THE_POSTMAN>

</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head, and then walks away. The Postman watches her disappear into the bustle of the camp.
</DIRECTION>

	So much for the uniform theory.

<DIRECTION>
The same sun sets on the Holnist camp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BETHLEHEM'S TENT - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bethlehem once again at his easel with palette in hand. He's trying another style -- Impressionism -- and it's worse than the last. He looks over as Getty and Gibbs approach with a PRISONER.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think, Lieutenant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<GIBBS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't tell what it is if you stand too close. The colors all kinda run together, don't they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIBBS>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
Bethlehem looks away from his painting to see Gibbs and Getty flanking a scared, blue-clad mail carrier. For an instant, mistakes him for:
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if it isn't our old friend the U.P.S. man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<GIBBS>

	We captured him on the Oregon border.

<CARRIER>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Carrier Twelve. United States, um, Postal Service.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIER>
<DIRECTION>
Getty sets some of the Carrier's anti-Holnist propaganda onto Bethlehem's field table. Bethlehem picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's hard to say what he's thinking. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want the camp struck at dawn. We're moving north.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<GIBBS>
	<DIALOGUE>

Bethlehem looks back to Carrier Twelve.

</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RV CAMP - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ten letter carriers are on horseback. Among them, Red and Ponytail. Ford and The Postman are also on horses. Each rider salutes The Postman, then gets a sheaf of anti- Holnist propaganda from Ford.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish they'd stop saluting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
It's annoying him. As Chubby rides up. The Postman catches his right wrist as he attempts to salute. So Chubby salutes with the left hand instead. As they line up:
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just stay safe and remember. The mailman's more important than the mail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<CHUBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, he's smart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUBBY>
<DIRECTION>
The sun just peeks up over the horizon. At that signal, the carriers thunder off, the ground trembling under them. The look on their faces. The glory of it all. They're alive! The Postman hesitates, watches after them a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Urging his horse forward, he rides after them. With them. And then, like an exploding firework, each postman shoots off in a separate direction. Headed for all points of the compass and some in between.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OREGON HAMLET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman looks down on the gathered crowd from his horse and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>

	For President Starkey and the First Congress of the Restored United States, I officially declare Postal Station 10... What's the name of this town?

EXT. TOWN (SOMEWHERE IN OREGON) - DAY

An eye-blink of a town. Ponytail stands on a crate reading names and handing letters to the grateful people massed around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOWN (IDAHO BORDER) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Red and Chubby finish mail call, exchange an amazed look as they're offered a platter of food.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The moon hangs low over an interstate. A rider is silhouetted by the silvery orb, looking like some post- apocalyptic Don Quixote. It's The Postman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FARMHOUSE/COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seen FROM the porch, a rider gallops hard on the road beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LITTLE BOY comes rushing out, letter in hand. The boy pulls up short; realizes the rider is already too far gone. The boy's shoulders sag; he's crushed.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I missed him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
It's an almost psychic moment as the rider reins up in the distance and turns back around. A frozen beat and he starts galloping back down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fearless, the boy holds out the letter. The rider closes; it's The Postman. The boy stretches out as far as he can. Without breaking stride, The Postman leans out of the saddle, snatches the letter as he passes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy watches after him -- knows what he's going to be when he grows up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PINE VIEW GATES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheriff Briscoe huffs and puffs his big frame up the ladder and onto the top of the palisade.
</DIRECTION>
<BRISCOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Phil, this better not be another of your U.F.O.'s.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRISCOE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks where the sentry points. The Postman waits at the gate, behind him on horseback: Ford and Abby.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm back! And I got mail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>

EXT. PINE VIEW STREETS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pine View is throwing a party. It's in full swing. A couple of guitars. A banjo and a trombone. Everyone dances.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman walks with Briscoe, sees Mrs. March as her letter is read to her. Catches a glimpse of Abby dancing with Ford. He seems, for the first time, truly happy. For that matter, so does Briscoe.
</DIRECTION>
<BRISCOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Things are getting better. Getting better all the time.

George crosses the trailer, opens a cabinet. Inside: twenty odd guns plus the parts for several more. The CROW CAWS.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ELVIS, OREGON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quiet. An old flag ruffles outside the post office -- the only new structure in town. Old George sweeps the porch as a patrol of ten Holnist soldiers ride into town. George makes no move to flee as they near. As they rein up across from him he just smiles and continues sweeping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sensing it, the Holnist officer looks up. There, on the roof, stands The Postman. Ford and Briscoe flank him -- along with twenty mailmen and locals, armed with guns, bows and rocks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the soldiers raise their rifles, the roofies OPEN FIRE. George whips up a sawed-off SHOTGUN. BOOM! Caught in the storm, the ten soldiers go down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grim, The Postman looks to Ford as the locals cheer. George resumes sweeping. The mailmen climb down to strip the weapons off the dead.

A soldier finally grabs hold of one of the halters and brings the wagon to a stop. Half-dressed, Bethlehem steps up. A tarp covers the back upon which is written...

	Ford doesn't know what it means to be a kid. He doesn't have your memories. None of them do. All they've got is the lousy world we gave them. And this is the only decent thing in it.

<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Being a postman? It's all bullshit, Abby. All of it.

An excited murmur among the carriers. Only Ford eyes The Postman suspiciously. The Postman reads:

He looks at them, doesn't need to read what's in his heart.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In dark days, in a weary world, you gave everything and asked for nothing. You beat back despair and replaced it with hope and for that your country can never repay you. But the price is too high. I won't see anymore of my bravest die. It is my duty to hereby disband the Postal Service of the restored United States. You are to burn your uniforms and The Postman is to return to Minneapolis at once. Thank you and that is all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
A hushed silence. The Postman walks away. The carriers exchange tired, defeated looks. Abby just sighs, knows he's not necessarily wrong.
</DIRECTION>

Ford catches up with The Postman. He stares at The Postman; The Postman stares back.

The Postman is packing bags onto a horse as Abby approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to St. Rose, Abby. And I'm taking you with me. I know you don't want to hear it, but that's my child inside you. I want to see it born somewhere safe. I have a right to that, Abby. Whether you like it or not.

</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Abby walks away. The Postman rests his head on his pack for a moment. Heavy.

The CLICK of a GUN causes The Postman to lift his head and see Luke standing there.

The Postman turns, sees Luke's face fraught with confusion and emotion.

Some carriers drop their uniforms into a bonfire.

The Postman and Abby ride up on the ridge above the RV camp. They pause to look back one last time. Across the way, on the other side, Ford is doing the same thing. As though he senses it, Ford stops and looks back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford raises his hand, salutes. Slowly, The Postman brings up his own hand. But he doesn't salute. He waves. Good- bye. As Ford turns away, so does The Postman.

As a family of transients begin to rise from where they're camped in the breakdown lane:

Bethlehem sits waiting at his camp table. Behind him, a finished painting.

This time he's painted himself in the grand Rococo-style - - as part of the Holy Family with doves and flowers and glowing rays from Heaven. It's awful.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

A pair of boots are walking through the water. It's The Postman. He turns over a body in the water. It wears a homemade postal uniform, a bag of mail twisted around his arm. It's a young face, one we haven't seen before. He looks up to Abby on a ridge.

The family of transients are grilled by three Holnist scouts. One man points the way Abby and Bethlehem rode.

Littered with rubble. The wood, brick, steel and concrete of what was once a small town. Amazingly, one gray house still stands, miraculously untouched by whatever disaster visited this place.

A wild-haired SQUATTER steps out on the porch as Abby and The Postman ride by. He waves hello with a .45.

Out of the corner of his eye, The Postman catches a blur of movement.

He turns his head quickly, but he's barely in time to see a wooden basket, attached to one of the high wires, swing from a distant tower. There's a sentry inside it.

The basketed sentry whistles away at 40 mph, heading straight for an adjacent tower. In a matter of seconds, he's lost from view.

The exchange cuts Abby like a knife. She gets up and leaves. The Mayor keeps his council -- not sure what to make of this arrangement.

	Couple hundred miles at least. I couldn't say for sure.

It's the discovery of a lifetime. The Postman looks to the west end of the bridge, where Abby stands alone.

	You seem like a decent man. And these seem like decent people.

EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fog obscures the east end. A sentry squints at the MUFFLED CLOP of HOOVES. The mist parts to reveal, seventy yards away: three Holnist scouts on horseback. Emissaries from hell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the sentry blows a whistle...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As word spreads, folks move down the bridge for a look. Eating their bread, The Postman, Abby and the carriers join them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EAST END
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mayor stands across from the lead scout -- conferring. Finally, the Mayor points him back the way he came. The lead scout doesn't budge, spots The Postman in the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He and The Postman seem to stare at each other forever. Then, with a flick of the reins, he's gone. The other two follow. Swallowed up by the misty evening gloom. The Postman's head swims dizzily. It's not over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mayor returns to dozens of nervous questions.
</DIRECTION>
<B_C_MAYOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're looking for The Postman.

A little BOY steps forward, sings out.
</DIRECTION>
<B_C_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's a postman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</B_C_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
A silent moment. It's been so long, no one's sure how to answer. The Postman looks down at the ground. The carriers exchange deflated looks. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
(stepping forward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never heard of a postman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head "no." Seems a shame. As The Postman looks over at Abby, she takes a page from his book.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There used to be a postman for every street in America. They wore uniforms. And hats. Like this one...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to The Postman's gear, returns with his postal cap. Sets it on the boy's head.
</DIRECTION>
<B_C_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow...
	</DIALOGUE>
</B_C_BOY>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My postman knew the name of every kid on my street. He knew our birthdays. He'd even find the baseballs you'd hit down the street. I can still see the smile on his face. The tip of his cap -- when he had a letter in his bag with my name on it. Mine always came just after school. You could set your watch by him. Unless you were waiting on something special -- like a present from somewhere far away or a letter from your sweetheart. Then it seemed like he'd never come. I used to think they could make time stand still.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
Several other listeners nod -- they're completely with her.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think we ever really understood what they meant to us until they were gone. Getting a letter made you feel like you were part of something bigger than yourself. No place was ever too far away for the postman. So nobody ever had to be alone. The postman was someone you could count on. Things just made more sense when they were around.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the kind of world we used to have. A world a lot of us took for granted. And now we've got this one. And it makes me wonder -- what kind of world do I want my child to live in? I want my child to live in a world where hopes and dreams aren't just lies you tell yourself to get through another day. I want my child, and I want my friends -- I want all of us to live in a world where you still get your mail.

The Postman and Abby gasp as the Mayor opens the lid to reveal: 20 well-oiled rifles and 15 pistols with ammo. The Postman blinks over at the Mayor.
</DIRECTION>
<B_C_MAYOR>

	I don't know, but I believe in you. You have a gift, Postman. I saw it back in Pine View. You made Mrs. March feel like she could see again. You made Ford feel like he was part of the world. You give out hope like it was candy in your pocket.

The soldiers pick up their guns and that's when they see The Postman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE POSTMAN

<DIRECTION>
Riding over the crest. Galloping toward them. Behind him, forty new mail carriers. All riding like mad. One of them carries the flag of the restored United States.

They take their positions -- and without a word -- they kick their horses into a charge. Coming straight for each other like medieval jousters.

Bethlehem reaches for his sword. But before it clears the scabbard, The Postman lunges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The horses collide. Bethlehem and The Postman hit the ground hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holnists and Carriers alike begin to move forward for a better look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fight is fierce. Bloody. The Postman and Bethlehem are at each other like coiled snakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's more of a fight than any of the Holnists -- especially Getty -- expected. The spectators pull in tighter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both combatants have taken a beating -- and still, they fight on -- trading bloody, raw-knuckled punches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of Bethlehem's connects. The Postman loses his footing, hits the ground -- knocking his head on a rock with a resounding CRACK. Dazed, he's slow to rise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's just the moment Bethlehem needs, he straddles the fallen Postman, reaches for his knife with one hand -- grabs The Postman's throat with the other.

	Will stay this courier from the swift completion of his appointed rounds...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Bethlehem reels, stumbling back. The Postman pounces on top of him, begins to strangle him. Bethlehem tries to pry the fingers from his throat, but can't. He's going to die.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman is urged on. By both sides. Holnists. Carriers. Ford. Even Holnist Luke. He looks up at the faces -- and finally lets Bethlehem go. The General gasps for breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Ponytail and Chubby move forward to untie Ford, The Postman looks to both sides.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't have to be this way. We don't have to kill each other. We can live together. We can --
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ford takes Chubby's pistol, sets it against the side of Bethlehem's head.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Law three. Mercy is for the weak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ford, don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Bethlehem shakes his head -- doesn't want him to, either.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Law eight. There is only one penalty and that penalty is death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Ford's going to shoot.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He isn't worth it. I'm the head of the clan now! There are going to be new laws!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to all)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Law one! No more killing! There's going to be peace!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman looks at carriers and Holnists alike.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who else? Who else has a law?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone has to learn how to read.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's law two. Who else?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<CARRIER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three. Liberty and justice for all!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIER_1>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four. No more tattoos.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<CARRIER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Law five. Give peace a chance!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIER_2>
<HOLNIST_SOLDIER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Law six. Mercy is, it's okay sometimes!

</HOLNIST_SOLDIER_2>
<CARRIER_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven! Bring back vacations!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIER_3>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman nods solemnly, looks to Ford.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about it, Ford Lincoln Mercury? You give us law eight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ford grits his teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(close -- for Ford)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be a leader, Ford.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Law eight...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Ford FIRES! Bethlehem flinches, then sags as he realizes Ford has fired into the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Live and let live.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman smiles in relief as Ford lowers the revolver and starts to hand the weapon over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Forgotten for an instant, Bethlehem makes a last, wild lunge, grabs Ford's gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Bethlehem aims at The Postman, a SHOT rings out. Hit in the chest, Bethlehem blinks in amazement before he falls to the ground, dying. Getty has shot him.
</DIRECTION>
<BETHLEHEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing and bear-baiting. Oh, had I but followed the arts...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETHLEHEM>
<DIRECTION>
He dies.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grow like savages -- as soldiers will -- that nothing do but mediate on blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Getty throws his rifle on the ground. Other weapons are laid down. The war, at long last, is over.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody take a letter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<CHUBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUBBY>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A letter...

DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABBY'S PLACE (BRIDGE CITY) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abby, in bed, holding her new baby in her arms. She's reading a letter. What she reads makes her smile. She puts the letter down and cuddles her baby.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your daddy wrote to tell you that he'll be here as soon as he can. And that he loves you very much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
Abby looks up to see The Postman standing at her door. She looks at him, smiling with tears in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_POSTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mail's slow. I'll have to see about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_POSTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Abby smiles down at the child in her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your daughter. Her name is Hope.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
The Postman takes the tiny child in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	And so my father returned home after the Holnists were defeated...

EXT. ST. ROSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beach town. No wall, no sentries, just cottages lining a dozen sand-swept streets. A crowd has gathered to hear The Postman's daughter, HOPE, mid-thirties, speak. Beside her, a bearded, 52-year-old Ford in his postmaster's uniform. They stand before a large, tarp-draped statue.
</DIRECTION>
<HOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he never did see St. Rose. There was too much to be done. He'd made a promise and in keeping it -- he traded one dream for another. With no regrets. And so, in honor of my father...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOPE>
<DIRECTION>
She unveils the statue: we've seen this before. It's The Postman on his horse, low-slung in the saddle, leaning down to pluck the letter from the Little Boy's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's an OLDER MAN in the audience who seems especially moved by the statue. There's a younger man beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
As St. Rose applauds...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.

<DIRECTION>
THE END
