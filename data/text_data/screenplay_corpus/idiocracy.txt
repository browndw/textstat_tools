<NARRATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Plagues and World Wars came and went, and by simply being unconscious for several hundred years, Joe had managed to become something neither he, nor anyone who had ever known him, thought he had the potential to become... the smartest person on Earth...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NARRATOR>
<DIRECTION>
As the sun rises, we see that this is not a natural mountain range -- it is a huge, stinking mountain of garbage, ridiculously steep and unstable, the result of centuries of stacking garbage with no plan whatsoever. We are definitely in the future.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUSH IN ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The highest peak. A truck winds its way up a small road, a Dr. Suess-looking path carved into the side of an absurdly steep face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the wheel of the truck is the DRIVER, the dumbest looking guy you've ever seen, a fat gum-drop-headed guy, with a weird futuristic haircut, an ugly uniform and the McDonalds golden arches tattooed on his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is looking at a porn magazine while he drives. He alternates between excited grunts from the porn and startled grunts as he nearly swerves off the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver manages to navigate the truck to the summit. He parks it, pulls a lever and the garbage begins to unload, causing the mountain to quiver under the new extra weight. The driver cracks a beer and watches. In the background we see an OMINOUS BLACK DUST STORM of epic proportions approaching -- like the Great Dust Bowl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck finishes unloading and the driver tosses his empty can on top, but the dusty wind knocks it back down. The driver tries again. And again. Frustrated, he finally takes the can and plants it forcefully on top, causing the small peak to collapse, which causes the next part below to collapse, and a chain reaction on down the mountain. It was one beer can more than this mountain was designed to hold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a WIDER SHOT, we see a huge, epic
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GARBAGE AVALANCHE!!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The huge waves of garbage engulf the city below. CLOSER, we see Joe AND RITA'S PODS emerge, riding the crest of the garbage wave. They split into two directions. We FOLLOW Joe's pod for a while.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON Joe'S POD as it comes to a stop. PULL OUT to reveal we are in
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FILTHY STREET - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe's pod has come to rest on a dirty street below a giant billboard ad of a scowling, Neanderthal looking macho-man with a cigarette hanging from his mouth. It reads, "If you don't smoke Carltons...Fuck you!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we PULL OUT further, we see that every single square inch of everything is plastered with advertisements. Even the passersby's clothes are covered with ads. Everything seems to be in some stage of decay.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TV screens everywhere blast out competing trash and talking vending machines compete like carnival barkers for the attention of passersby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER ANGLE. Dumb-looking, overweight people wander around. On the back of everyone's left hand is a UPC tattoo. No one seems to have noticed or cared much about the garbage' avalanche. They pay no attention to Joe's pod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the ground RUMBLES. Another wave of garbage comes roaring down the street, smashing into Joe's pod, sending it flying into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUNDOWN APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A half-built, dirty-looking place. Joe's pod goes crashing into a window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUNDOWN APARTMENT - APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pod lands on the floor of a tiny room with only enough space to house a La-Z-Boy recliner and a giant TV. DIZZ, mid-30s fatass, sits sunken deep in the recliner. He watches TV, his jaw hanging open in a dull expression, doesn't seem to register the pod that just crashed through his window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside Dizz's window, the dust storm and avalanche continue. He couldn't care less. From the TV we hear an announcer with that testosterone-heavy Fox style, but even dumber sounding.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TV show begins: The MAIN CHARACTER, a frail, feeble looking man with a permanently worried look on his face, stands on a high-rise balcony looking out at the view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big lumbering JOCK comes up behind him, kicks him in the balls, sending him over the balcony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON DIZZ, amused.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Uuuugh!...

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe's pod. It starts to come to life. We hear fluids flowing, LED lights come on. The pod displays a message: Unfreezing!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK ON THE TV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The show continues. In rapid succession, the Main Character falls off the balcony, lands on a high voltage wire, on his balls, gets sling-shotted off, starts falling, heading straight for a fence, lands on his balls, then falls into someone's yard. A dog runs up, bites his balls, he scrambles over the high fence, falls down the other side, lands on a sawhorse, right on his balls, then finally falls to the ground. He stands up, brushes himself off, then notices something: a huge wrecking ball swinging right towards his balls. He stands there like a deer caught in the headlights, then WHAM, right in the balls. We follow him through the air, his balls straddling the wrecking ball...

ANGLE ON THE POD:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pod door opens. Joe leans up, cracks open his freezer burned eyes, looks around dazed. He's still in his military hospital outfit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe looks at Dizz. He has no idea what he's looking at or where he is. He clutches his head in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>

	Ugh?

</DIZZ>
<DIRECTION>
Joe rubs his eyes, takes in his surroundings. He is completely disoriented. Nothing makes sense to him.

EXT. CITY STREET -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe hits the ground hard. Joe gets up and painfully limps around. He looks across the street, sees something that makes him do a double-take:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE' S POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cheerful T.G.I.F.-looking restaurant. The sign reads: Buttfucker's! (In the exact shape, colors and font of Fuddrucker's.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe looks at the sign a beat, at the kids' birthday party going on inside, back at the sign, and shakes his head. A guy and a girl walk by, each obese and wearing those T-shirts that make it look like you're naked.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(points to Buttfucker's)
</DIRECTION>

</JOE>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Read? What do I look like, a fag?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
The guy growls at Joe. Joe stumbles off, nearly getting run over by a broken-down futuristic car being pulled by a team of dogs. The car is continually making that annoying dinging sound they make when the door is open. Joe rubs his eyes in disbelief, then walks unsteadily, holding his head.

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Joe stops near a group of guys.
</DIRECTION>
<NARRATOR>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe wandered the streets, desperate for help, but the English language had deteriorated into a hybrid of hillbilly, valley-girl, innercity slang, and various grunts. Joe was able to understand them, but when he spoke in his ordinary voice, he sounded pompous and "faggy" to them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NARRATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Joe asks for directions. The guys all laugh and make fun of him. Joe pleads. One of the guys freaks out and starts beating his chest and yelling incomprehensible obscenities. Joe runs away, then he notices something.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh thank God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
JOE'S POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A (misspelled) sign reads: "Memorial" Hospitle. Above it is a huge billboard which reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Surgery with an ATTITUDE!" With a picture of a Vin Diesel type in a scrub suit, holding a scalpel, with an anti- authority, "fuck you" scowl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe just shakes his head and walks towards the entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
[NOTE: For the purpose of this script, the dialogue of people of 2974 will be written in normal English, but for the movie, a future-dumbass accent and appropriate slang would be created, as described above.]
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. "MEMORIAL" HOSPITLE - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe walks through the waiting room. People are sprawled around with a variety of strange injuries -- a fat guy tangled up trying to take off his sweatshirt who's violently struggling to free himself, a whole family with their hands all stuck in a big jar of food like it's a raccoon trap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe staggers up to what looks like a fast food counter. A dull, bored-looking COUNTER WOMAN is behind the counter, wearing a uniform that's halfway between Mcdonalds's and hospital whites.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.. uh, I was in this army experiment- and I'm not feeling so good. I think I might be seeing things...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<COUNTER_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uuuh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUNTER_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
We see the Counter Woman looking down at a machine that looks like one of those cash registers at Mcdonalds where there are no words or numbers, just pictures, icons depicting various ailments -- a picture of an elbow with pain lines coming out, a picture of a guy with a knife in his head making a frowny face, a guy's butt, a knee, etc.
</DIRECTION>

She glances up at Joe, back at the key pad, thinking hard:

Joe starts to leave then turns around.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there a drinking fountain?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
The woman just points over her shoulder. Joe walks up to the drinking fountain and hits the button. He starts to drink and then makes a confused, disturbed face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls away from the fountain to reveal some fluorescent greenish gatorade-type liquid is being dispensed. On the side of the fountain is a logo that reads, "RAUNCHO, THE THIRST MUTILATOR." Joe stops a passing doctor.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>

	Excuse me, I think this is Gatorade or something. I'm just looking for some regular water?

The Doctor stares at him a beat, then just starts LAUGHING LIKE AN IDIOT and walks off.

INT. HOSPITAL - DIAGNOSTIC ROOM - LATER ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe is in line leading up to a uniformed TECHNICIAN running what looks like one of those auto-diagnostic machines from Jiffy Lube, or an automated car wash.
</DIRECTION>

A sad-looking man pulls up his pants as the technician hits a button on the machine.

Joe sits, waiting for the doctor. He sees a magazine on the doctor's desk:

Joe picks up the magazine. He sees the date on it: March 3, 2974.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Weird misprint.

Joe flips through it. He lands on an article: Economy be all bad and shit!/Inflation higher than a motherfucker! Another article: Dust Storms kicking our ass. On another page, a picture of an impoverished man, with the quote: "I'm fuckin' hungry!"

Joe is thrown in the back of the squad car.

<DIRECTION>
The courtroom is a mess, like a run-down inner-city public school classroom. There's garbage everywhere, graffiti. The flag is lying on the floor in a heap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An audience of rowdy spectators waits for the trial to begin. The crowd jeers as Joe is wheeled in in a cage.
</DIRECTION>

A pumped-up BAILIFF in tights walks in with a microphone. He whips up the crowd like an announcer at a wrestling match:

The Judge enters. He is surprised and frightened by the noise of the courtroom. He bangs his gavel until everybody shuts up.

The prisoners are herded off the bus and into the prison.

<DIRECTION>
INT. PRISON - CHECK-IN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe is shoved into a room where PRISON GUARDS are preparing new inmates for life in prison -- they're taking their clothes, giving them uniforms and sending them into various lines -- Maximum Security, Minimum Security, Parole.
</DIRECTION>
<PRISON_GUARD>

</PRISON_GUARD>

The Guard shoves Joe towards one of the lines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE'S POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out in the Prison Exercise Yard, a scary, angry 400-pound man is sitting, naked, on the ground. His horrible folds of fat cover up what we can only assume are the world's most disgusting genitals.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A closer look reveals that he is actually sitting on the face of some poor bastard trapped beneath him. The trapped man's legs kick futilely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe stares in disbelief at this horrific image. The man catches Joe looking, points to the guy below him and clearly mouths "You're next."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe recoils.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe is now at the front of the line, looking panicked. He's about to be sent off to lockdown. Desperate and terrified, he gets an idea.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(to guard, tentative)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, actually... I'm getting out of prison today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. The guard just stares at Joe, trying hard to process this... then smacks Joe upside the head.
</DIRECTION>
<PRISON_GUARD_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're in the wrong line, dumbass!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRISON_GUARD_2>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, uh... I'm a big dumbass. Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
The guard grabs Joe, buzzes him through a security gate, then shoves him into the "parole" line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A third guard scans Joe's UPC and checks his computer terminal.
</DIRECTION>
<PRISON_GUARD_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... Uh, yeah. I don't see you in here, so you're gonna have to, uh, stay in prison.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRISON_GUARD_3>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you check again? 'Cause I was, like, definitely in prison.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(points off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That guy sat on my face and everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
The guard looks off, then looks down at his terminal, getting confused. The guard concentrates very hard, looking for Joe's name.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat, Joe takes off running. Everyone just watches him go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alarms start going off like crazy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone just keeps standing around. The guards look confused and frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREETS - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe is running as fast as he ever has. He seems to have put some distance between himself and the cops. But as he runs past some kind of vending machine, we see an infrared beam silently scan his UPC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREET - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe stops for a moment, totally out of breath. He looks up and recognizes a familiar billboard -- the Carltons Cigarettes ad. He then notices his pod through the broken window of Dizz's apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

The TV starts pumping out some primitiv bootknocking jam. Dizz settles in, gets comfortable. The mood is broken by a loud knock on the. door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIZZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go 'way! 'Bating!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIZZ>
<DIRECTION>
The knocking keeps going. Dizz gets up, not happy, and opens the door.

	So, what do you want me to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIZZ>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I've been thinking -- it's been a thousand years, someone's' gotta have invented a way to travel back in time by now. I mean, I think they were pretty close, even back in my day. Something with Einstein or something?

Joe is stumped. Then, a brainstorm!
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>

	Okay, how about this? You get me to the time machine, and when I get back home, I open a savings account in your name. 1000 years later, it'll be worth billions!

Joe picks up the money and looks at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The $10,000 bill looks like a garish, over-detailed Master P album cover. In the center is a long-haired former president with his arms around two bikini girls, a 40 in each hand, and a giant dollar sign gold necklace. Various slogans are plastered around: "Ten Thousand bucks," "That's what I'm talkin' about," "Gettin' Paid," "Haulin' Ass."

Joe, Rita and Dizz try to blend into the line leading into the club. Inside, futuristically hip people are dancing and having a great time.

As the line moves forward, we see it leads up to a ROBO BOUNCER ("Powered by OmniPal!") who scans each person's UPC and looks them up and down before admitting them into the club.

DOWN THE STREET:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe, Rita, Dizz hear a big noise. They turn and look down the street in horror as the police converge on Dizz's car and start blasting away at it with guns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cops, dumb-looking and incredibly well-armed, are totally indiscriminate --shoulder-mounted missiles are straying into apartment buildings, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One cop has his shoulder-mounted missile on backwards. It fires out the back, goes straight up -- after a beat, a plane crashes in the background.

People get excited by the violence. They start cheering the cops on. Random fights start breaking out.

The crowd goes wild, starts shooting guns in the air. President Camacho feeding off their enthusiasm, picks up his even huger gun and starts enthusiastically spraying the ceiling with bullets.

EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - DAY

<DIRECTION>
It's similar to the Seattle Science center -- kind of like a huge college campus, but for dumbasses.

Rita looks for the time machine. She heads up some steps into what looks like it could be the Smithsonian. We PULL OUT to reveal she is heading into THE NATIONAL FART MUSEUM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NATIONAL FART MUSEUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rita wanders through, looking for the time machine. There are dioramas of cavemen hunting, T-rex skeletons, recreations of the Apollo moon landing, abstract sculpture. All the displays have. one thing in common: a continuous audio track of various farts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rita passes a kindergarten class being led on a tour, then up to a diorama featuring a life-size stuffed wolly mammoth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees a button down below the glass and pushes it. A LONG, LOW FART is heard.
</DIRECTION>

Rita shakes her head and keeps walking. Suddenly, she's grabbed by a bunch of Secret service cops.

Overwhe1med, Joe clutches his head miserably, then gets an idea.

</JOE>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, she charged some guy a bunch of money and didn't put out. That could get her ten years. Don't worry though, we can get her a temporarY whoring license as long as you're doing her. Cuz you're Government.

EXT. CROPS - THE NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe, Rita, Dizz, Joe's Guards and Cabinet Members stand at the edge of a HUGE FUTURISTIC WHEAT FARM, with automated watering systems, automated plows etc. Joe looks on at the shriveled up dead plants, pestilence-ravaged, with flies and parasites buzzing everywhere. It's bleak.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>

	Boy ah... Yeah, that sucks...

The cabinet all start laughing like idiots, doing the juvenile finger-in-hole gesture, as Joe and Rita head across the field to some bushes, in a ravine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rita and Joe reach a place where they can't be seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND THE BUSHES:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe pulls the map out of his pocket and unfolds it. It's incredibly crude and useless, like a 3-year-old would draw: a big box in the corner says "time masheen." There's no scale, directionals, or any other markings.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, Damnit! Way to go, Dizz...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe throws it down in frustration.

	Maybe we should just make a run for it-- ask for directions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think that's a good idea. We can't take any chances. My face was all over national TV. There's no way I'm going back to that jail.

	Upgrayed can't find you! Okay? It's impossible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you think so? Let me tell you a story. I ran off to Buffalo once, didn't tell no one where I was going. I check into a motel, the phone rings-- BAM! It's Upgrayed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that was a thousand years ago! Just trust me. You're safe.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really think so?

</RITA>
<JOE>

	I figured it out! Electrolytes are salt. That's your problem. It's just like the Dust Bowl. It probably worked for a few decades, but now salt's building up in the topsoil. That's what's killing the plants. That's what's causing the dust storms - just like the Dust Bowl!

The audience starts nodding, impressed, on board, when they hear "electrolytes."
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT_CAMACHO>

<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, ah... Be seems pretty happy. Do you think I could get my pardon now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ATTORNEY_GENERAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, Camacho said you could get it as soon as the crops grow. That way they can lock your ass down if your plan doesn't work. He's a good mo-vi- tator.

Joe goes over and sits in a chair.

<RITA>

	To tell you the truth, I'm not in such a big hurry to get back to Upgrayed anyway. And I'm not sure if it's the drugs they gave us in that experiment or what, but I kind of feel like I'm smarter than most of these people.

Joe is caught off guard, a bit awkward.

Rita can't help herself, she starts laughing. Joe nervously joins in.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

Joe wakes up, goes over to the window and looks out at the rose garden. Nothing is growing yet. The sprinklers are on with water, but it still looks barren. He looks a little worried.

I told you not to make me secretary, but you did it anyway, so I just tried to help. I told you it was gonna take a long time for the plants to grow, and it will work if you give it a chance. I know it will. Look, even if you find me guilty and lock me away, for your own sake you can't switch back to Rauncho. Eventually, it will kill everything, and you'll all starve. You gotta believe me. That's all I gotta say. Thank you. Uh, your extreme... ness...es.

Joe manages to outmaneuver the Assblaster, charging at Joe from the other direction, but then Joe's car stalls out again in the middle of the arena.

The Assblaster and the Bitchmaker position themselves on opposite sides of Joe, and get ready to smash him. Joe frantically tries to restart his car.

The two gigantic trucks come charging at Joe. Joe looks like a dead man. Then, at the last second Joe's engine turns over just enough to lurch the car forward, out of the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two trucks collide. The Assblaster's jackhammer gets chewed up by the Bitchmaker's rotoblades, sending shrapnel into the Bitchmaker's cockpit, KNOCKING OUT THE BITCHMAKER'S DRIVER. Joe breathes a sigh of relief, until he gets rammed by the Dildozer from behind, sending his car flipping and bouncing several times. The crowd goes nuts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe's car lands upside-down. It looks like it's all over. But then he sees that his steering wheel has broken off, enabling him to leave the car. He climbs out, his left hand still cuffed to the broken-off steering wheel. He takes off running, narrowly escaping as the Dildozer pulverizes what's left of his car.. The crowd's loving it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Assblaster backs up and stops. The crowd goes wild, yelling some kind of one syllable chant that sounds vaguely like "dogs." Joe looks confused. Then a hatch falls open on the back of the Assblaster, dumping a load of PIT BULLS the size of small horses on the arena floor.

Joe does what amounts to a vehicular sucker punch, SLAMMING THE DILDOZER INTO THE WALL. The Dildozer bursts into flames. The crowd becomes interested again.

Joe sees the driver is stuck in the burning Dilldozer. He watches for a beat. Be looks conflicted and then realizes he has to save him.

He runs over and pulls the Driver out. But as soon as the Driver is safe, he immediately starts beating the shit out of Joe. Then the Driver grabs an axel rod, comes back over to finish Joe off.

President Camacho and the Cabinet Members see this. They jump out of their box seats, Camacho in the lead, climb into the arena and pull the driver off, and beat his ass down, rescuing Joe. Camacho raises Joe's hand in victory, pointing at the sprouts on the Jumbotron. The crowd cheers Joe.

	Ah, forget it.

</ATTORNEY_GENERAL>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, you can't just keep giving up so easily. You've gotta take command. Make decisions! Think about things! If you don't, who will?

</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
More blank, confused stares from the Cabinet members.
</DIRECTION>
<EXTREME>

<JOE>

<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going--?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Rita jams her tongue down his throat and throws him down on the pool table. Joe doesn't put up much of a fight, goes with it.

He leans down to look, but Dizz knocks him out of the way like a football player, and starts watching. We don't hear Joe and Rita, but from the noises Dizz is making, we get the idea that they're going at it pretty good.

The Cabinet Members are all sitting around.

Joe stumbles out. He's only wearing his underwear, but doesn't seem to care. He looks a little happier and a tad stupider than he did before. He flops down in a chair, grabs a handful of Food, and eats it, thoughtfully.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know... Maybe I don't need to go to that time machine right away.
	</DIALOGUE>

Joe, Rita and Dizz sit strapped into a car on a track, like a typical amusement park ride, or haunted house.

A Voice Over begins. Note: this is not the Computer Voice, it's more like a Vincent Price horror movie voice.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to the Time Machine. We are going to take you back... Back! BACK!! First, to the year 1939, when Charlie Chaplin and his evil Nazi regime enslaved Europe and tried to take over the world!

Beat. The crowd looks a little confused.
