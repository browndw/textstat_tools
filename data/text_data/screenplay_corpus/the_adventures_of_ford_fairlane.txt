EXT. ENIGMATIC BODY OF WATER - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VIEWER'S VIEWPOINT breathlessly GLIDES OVER a body of water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HELICOPTER DRESSING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOBBY VOMIT charges through what seems to be a typically- deliciously-trashed dressing room, barking into a phone headgear apparatus. His wire rim glasses amusingly con- trast with his traditional rock star look of shoulder- length blond hair and red-tank-top-over-black-spandex. His pacing reveals a helicopter pilot in the b.g., flying the dressing room.
</DIRECTION>
<VOMIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wha-at!... No, no, I can't do it tomorrow. I'm taping a Rock Against Drugs spot. It's important to me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOMIT>
<DIRECTION>
Vomit savagely snorts into a vial of crystal methe. Behind him, a big blanket on a couch rises up, becoming a giggling lump.
</DIRECTION>
<PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five minutes, Mister Vomit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILOT>
<VOMIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, man... Don't worry, Johnny, I have it with me now. I'll just put it in a little protection program. He can't stop us, man, no way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOMIT>
<DIRECTION>
Vomit rips off his headgear and looks to a purse on the couch just as the purse's owner, a cancer-curing beauty wearing nothing but an oversize I (picture of a heart) Black Vomit T-shirt, bursts out from under the blanket, sipping from a pink bottle of wine cooler. Her name is ZUZU PETALS.
</DIRECTION>
<ZUZU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peek-a-boo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZUZU>
<VOMIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Zuzu, didn't I tell you to lay off the coolers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOMIT>
<DIRECTION>
Zuzu giggles away as Vomit slithers down to kiss her. While maneuvering his lips, he reaches out to Zuzu's purse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WATER - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VIEWER'S VIEWPOINT finally GLIDES PAST the water OUT OVER a dam, where, at the base, are thousands of screaming fans. A stage has been built atop the dam amid spooky industrial art design.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter, equipped with a warped logo and the words BLACK VOMIT, swooshes to a halt above the stage where a band is rabidly pounding away. The chopper begins to descend upon a makeshift "backstage area" to the side of the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<CROWD_OF_THOUSANDS>

<DIRECTION>
INT. DRESSING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding Zuzu's purse behind his back, Bobby Vomit bobs back up. Zuzu takes a dainty sip from her wine cooler, babbling softly in a losing battle with consciousness. Vomit opens the purse and pulls a compact disc from his Spandex. The cover reads Black Vomit's Greatest Hits and has a red number one on it.
</DIRECTION>
<ZUZU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I had this dream, right. You guys were doing that song, 'I Love You More Than My Own Death,' right, when all of a sudden these penguins come on stage and tell the audience that I used to wet my bed. And that I enjoyed it. It was so real ... How 'bout a kiss, Bobby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZUZU>
<VOMIT>
<DIRECTION>
(closing Zuzu's purse)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Babe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOMIT>
<DIRECTION>
Zuzu drowsily raises her head, eyes closed, and adorably puckers up. Vomit tosses her purse smack dab into her face and lips with a bonk. Zuzu reacts with a dreamy smile and curls into a sleeping fetal position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vomit turns to stare out at his screaming fans and then down to the "backstage area," zeroing in on an eccentrically, but stylishly, dressed man in sunglasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACKSTAGE AREA - NIGHT (SUN HAS SET)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man is JULIAN GRENDEL. The SOUNDTRACK suddenly ig- nores the band to go into Grendel's mind where elegant CLASSICAL MUSIC is PLAYING. He wryly murmurs to himself as the reflection on his sunglasses go from the screaming crowd to the landing chopper.
</DIRECTION>
<GRENDEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vomit. Vomit. Vomit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRENDEL>
<DIRECTION>
The inner CLASSICAL MUSIC CUTS OFF as Bobby Vomit bounds out from the 'copter, a skipping Zuzu in tow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vomit and Grendel exchange cold smiles. Julian Grendel is deaf; the sound of his speech is perverse in an inter- esting way.
</DIRECTION>
<GRENDEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice of you to drop by, Mister Vomit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRENDEL>
<VOMIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't spank me, Mister Grendel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOMIT>
<DIRECTION>
Vomit pleasantly walks behind Grendel and then wields around, screeching into the back of his boss's head.
</DIRECTION>
<VOMIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drown in hell, you deaf motherfucker!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOMIT>
<DIRECTION>
Grendel turns around with a smile.

</GRENDEL>
<DIRECTION>
Vomit seethes off to a nearby roadie holding a big drum of goo, flinging off his wire rim glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<VOMIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's do it, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOMIT>
<DIRECTION>
The roadie begins pouring the goo over Bobby's head.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The audience explodes in a flurry of cheers as...
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome, sluts and perverts, I give you, Black Vomit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby Vomit strolls onto the stage -- and he's on fire. Covered from head to toe by licking flames -- a heavy metal human torch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two Roadies with fire extinguishers fo-o-osh out the inferno that is the rock star's body. Another roadie tosses him a mike. Vomit smolders a bit -- transparent goo oozing over his body.
</DIRECTION>
<VOMIT>
<DIRECTION>
(calmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, L.A.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOMIT>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd riots as the band breaks in with their question- able but aggressively stated definition of music. Bobby Vomit wails his way through a toxic first verse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops singing to spasm to his guitarist's solo. He relifts his microphone and uh, he chokes, making gurgl- ing sounds as if something were trying to crawl out of his body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd sounds like all ten thousand of them are in labor -- they love this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julian Grendel takes off his sunglasses with a scared expression.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vomit's face turns red as he thrashes about the stage bashing down amps and barbed wire set design. Vomit! Vomit! Vomit!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The band starts missing notes, looking around. This doesn't seem to be part of the act. Dribbling a crimson tide, Bobby Vomit falls to his knees with a final scream of earthly existence. A final stream of blood rolls from his mouth down the white dam to the crowd who has reached a new level of frenzy beyond the limits of human comprehension.

EXT. HOTTEST CLUB IN LOS ANGELES - LATER IN NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VIEWER'S VIEWPOINT TRACKS DOWN a line of men and women standing outside the Rolls-Royce of nightclubs. The desperate-to-get-in crowd are dressed-to-kill-be- killed-and-kill again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the front of the line, the overly rich and gorgeous thrust and screech over the velvet ropes as a stoic DOORMAN, standing before glass doors, uses all the zen he can to tune them out.

Ford moves deeper into the club and lights up his seventieth cig of the day and takes in the la dolce vita ambience. A band rocks out with an attractive, bizarrely-dressed female lead singer. A mirthful CLUB GAL gets a look at Ford and stops laughing. She pulls away from her suitor to slap Ford with a growl.
</DIRECTION>
<CLUB_GAL>

<FORD>

</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
The Club Gal storms back into the arms of her suitor while Ford wiggles life back into his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford scopes the tables around him. His viewpoint halts at a man with red hair. A BOUNCER breaks his concentration.
</DIRECTION>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ford, I gotta ask you to put that out, dude. Nobody smokes anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
Ford flings his hand down with a quick motion and rubs at the carpet with his foot. The Bouncer smiles and walks away. Ford lifts back up his hand, revealing that the cigarette never left it. He takes a drag with a grin until a hand slaps the cigarette into his face. It's the TWIN SISTER of the Club Gal who slapped him two minutes ago, in a different outfit.
</DIRECTION>
<TWIN_SISTER>

Ford scans to Jaime, Larry and the Man in the Hat at the bar.

As the Man with Hat stutters like the fanatic he is, Ford casually knocks off his hat revealing weird streaks of red hair. Ford smiles, turns to the bar, and takes a last sip from his shake before smashing the fountain glass into the face of the stuttering Sam, sending him off his barstool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sleazebag leaps up like a wild animal and swings his fist at Ford. Ford grabs onto the flying fist, stopping it dead. Sam sharply swings his other fist around, but Ford grabs this one, too, locking them into an Arthur Murray lesson position.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall we da-ance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Ford heaves the fanatic into a nearby table. The fanatic drops on all fours and crawls under the table. A chuckling Ford strolls between the tables.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam crawls out from under one table and makes under the long tablecloth of another. The crowd has taken an active interest, but the band continues to play.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So finally got a tip that paid off. Why can't you sleazebags who harass women take 'no' for an answer? I mean, hey, it's never happened to me personally...

</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Ford lifts up the tablecloth. The sleazebag fanatic is not there. Ford bobs back up with a puzzled expression and puts a cigarette in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford brings out a lighter as the fanatic suddenly materializes behind him. Sam grabs a huge glass candle holder from one of the tables and smashes off the end of it, causing a jagged edge. The band stops playing as the CANDLE SIZZLES in Sam's hand.

<SAM_THE_SLEAZEBAG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM_THE_SLEAZEBAG>

Sam swings out again, but this time connects with a slash to Ford's chin. Ford is more annoyed than hurt. His solemn anger stops Sam the Sleazebag in his tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're ten seconds away from the most embarrassing moment in your life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Ford launches a powerful uppercut that knocks the fanatic's candleholder-holding hand up into the psycho's own arm. Screaming in pain, the fanatic flees toward the dance floor trying to pull out the shards. Don pipes up from a nearby table.
</DIRECTION>
<DON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on Ford, this shit's getting old.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON>
<DIRECTION>
Ford smiles, super-swiftly raising his arm. A gun slides out of his sleeve through a sliding Taxi-Driver-style apparatus, into his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford FIRES up at a discotheque ball rotating above the dance floor. The gunshot breaks the ball out of its ceiling home and sends it swooshing down right upon the Sleazebag fanatic's head, knocking him out cold.

Ford turns to the approaching, awed twin sisters.

INT. FORD'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The swank nightclub a memory, the VIEWER is now given a jarring tour of Ford's lovable ratty beach house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VIEWER'S VIEWPOINT MOVES UP TO a wall where a set of curtains mysteriously cover a compartment. ACROSS the wall, the VIEWER sees hundreds of autographed photos of various rock stars pinned to the wall in a surrealistically haphazard fashion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULLING OUT A BIT, it can be seen that the hellhole is packed solid with unwrapped VCRs, discarded gold records, answering machines, remote controls, Walkmans, Watchmans, cellular phones, and all sorts of other basically useless goodies. Each one has a smarmy "Thanks Ford"-type note tagged to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tremendous music system adorns another wall with a pair of five-foot tall speakers standing like silent sentinels. Embedded in one of the amplifiers is a wall socket timer clock -- two needles about to touch. The TIMER, reading 3:59 p.m., WHIRS a bit and then there is a CLICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE ON MUSIC SYSTEM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The LOUDEST MUSIC in the history of Dolby stereo BALSTS out of the speakers. Dust is literally kicked up as a rollicking ROCK SONG careens through the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FORD'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The twin sisters pop up in the bed in various states of undress, their squeals of pain inaudible in the face of the music. The lump in the bed between the twins jerks spasmodically for a second, then calmly rises, revealing itself to be Ford Fairlane, still wearing the sliding gun system on his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ruffled Ford plods in and grabs a pack of cigarettes off a vibrating speaker. He ritualistically lights up and inhales.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford pulls back the curtains on the wall revealing a carved-out compartment in the wall. Inside the space is an obviously old, but still in mint condition electric guitar with a picture of Jimi Hendrix propped next to it. Ford closes his eyes and touches the guitar with a religious solemnity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford pulls the curtains and then bends down to a red "Hotline"-looking phone with a quizzical expression on his face. Ford picks up a remote control and zaps OFF the STEREO, revealing that the PHONE is RINGING. Ford picks up.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, Jazz, I'm coming. So I'm late. I go to work when you go to bed.

Decked out wrinkled-hip, Ford closes the front door of his charmingly dilapidated home.

Ford tears the cigarette from the Kid's mother and starts to throw it away, but instead pockets it. They approach Ford's dazzling blue namesake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford SQUEAKS off the CAR ALARM with a beeper and then opens up his unusually modulated trunk. Sam the Sleazebag is seen huddled in a heap within. Ford tosses a smashed-up Twinkie to him and recloses the trunk to frenzied screams.

EXT. MINI-MALL DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A two-tiered mini-mall nightmare looms ahead. The exquisite eateries of SUZIE'S SUSHI DONUTS and MUY BURRITO are sandwiched in on the first level with a tanning salon and an adult book store.
</DIRECTION>

The top tier is not as popular. Empty For-Rent spaces surround a place that has a big plate glass window that reads FORD FAIRLANE PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR.

INT. FORD'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

	There are 5,000 private investigators in L.A. It made sense to specialize. Why did I pick the music industry? Why not fishermen?

EXT. BEACH BEHIND FORD'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A smoking Ford stands starkly, wailing with his guitar in cathartic quasi-Hendrixian blasts, ruining a perfectly nice MUSICAL SEGUE ON the SOUNDTRACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down to picture, nailed to the fence before him, of a young Ford and Johnny doing silly rock star poses. Young Ford holds a cheap guitar while Johnny clutches a pair of drumsticks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford presses the cigarette against the photo, setting it a- fire and then resumes his "playing." The Kid rolls up on his skateboard, holding his ears, breaking into Ford's solo.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ouch.

</THE_KID>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you, get off my cloud. I'm talking to my friend. 1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.

The Kid holds out his hand. A ring of Snoopy in his fighter pilot outfit is attached to his hand. A couple of notes of "Snoopy and the Red Baron" play on the soundtrack.

INT. FORD'S PLACE - NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford snores away on his couch, holding his guitar. The koala bear sleeps beside him. The DOORBELL RINGS. And AGAIN. Ford's eyes pop open to a pile of wadded up money on his coffee table.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe it. I took the money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
He meanders to the door like a Cocoon II cast member and opens the door. COLLEEN SUTTON stands in a striking pose at the door. Behind her in the street is a blue limousine and a driver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The very attractive Colleen belongs to the genre of rich people that has seen it all, every piece of decadence perpetuated. Nothing fazes her, even the chilling sight of a just-woke-up Ford.
</DIRECTION>
<COLLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help. I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry. What is it they call you? Mr. Rock and...

</FORD>
<COLLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please.

</COLLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ford takes a carton of orange juice from the coffee table. He shakes it and then pours into a pretty used-looking glass also from the coffee table. He hands it to the deadpan Colleen.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about the glass. And the house. And the breath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<COLLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich. The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me. When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?

</COLLEEN>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, I never met your father.

Colleen looks down to Ford's crotch. Ford does the same and then raises his head with a laugh.

Incredibly LOUD MUSIC BLASTS through the room. Colleen splashes orange juice all over herself, undulating in a wacky, Martin Shortesque double take. Ford remotes off his alarm. Colleen regains her composure with a big orange juice stain.

They sit upon the couch, the dozing koala between them.

<COLLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me?

</COLLEEN>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see, you're her worried sister. Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole.

</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Speechless, Colleen pulls out a thick envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<COLLEEN>

	Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.

INT. MIXING BOOTH - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Don Cleveland, the suave black producer from the club, sits behind a large mixing board along with engineers and mixers. A passable tune with ghoulish VOCALS is FILTERED into the booth. As Don speaks, Ford stands behind him, staring through the glass at the source of the wretched music.
</DIRECTION>
<DON>

Ford's Fairlane pulls up before a pretty ominous marina. Boars are eerily moored with no sign of human beings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PIER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford creeps across the pier. He puts the finishing touches on his arm-to-hand sliding gun apparatus before looking to a nice-sized but inherently tacky boat from which an eerie ROCK SONG spookily emits. The bow reads: THE MIGHTY PENIS.

INT. CABIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford comes down and turns on some bizarrely hued lights revealing a literally rocking bachelor pad from hell com- plete with a scary rack of dildos and an inflatable doll that floats above a neon ME sign. Ford goes past a wall that has cut out quasi-nude shots of breasts and buttocks.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The love boat is making another run...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
He then makes a glance to another picture on the wall. It is the same young-and-wanna-be-rock-stars picture of Johnny and Ford that Ford viewed earlier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford sadly blinks before looking to a gun rack on the wall that holds three shotguns. Ford wobbles over to an entertainment system set up next to the rack. He turns OFF the eerie rocker on the STEREO. A video cassette marked "Collie and Me" lies on an adjoining VCR. Ford puts the tape in.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Ford steps over to a closet and opens the door. And there's a smiling guy in a psychedelic tie-dye shirt standing inside. Ford quickly closes the door -- and BAM -- a hand crashes through the door and latches on to Ford's neck. Ford beats off the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ka-blam! The smiling guy kicks the door off its hinges. Meet SMILEY: He's muscular, and seems mean, despite the fact he has a ponytail, wears sandals, nice black gloves, and has a damn smile that never ever leaves his face.
</DIRECTION>
<SMILEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's it going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMILEY>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley's fist swooshes at Ford's head. Ford's hand whips out of nowhere and grabs the fist in midair.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>

	You're ten seconds away from the most embarrass --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Crunch! Smiley punches Ford across the jaw with his left jaw!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford's body careens into a dresser. He bolts up and as he did so wow-ly in his opening scene, super-swiftly raises his arm. Only this time the gun doesn't slide out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford feebly tries to reach in his sleeve to retrieve the gun but crack! Smiley strikes again. Ford runs to the gun rack and tries to pull out a shotgun, but it is locked. Panicked, Ford yanks the entire gun rack off the wall as Smiley latches on with a nasty bear hug. Ford FIRES off a wild BLAST from one of the still-in-the-rack GUNS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shotgun blast demolishes a Playboy centerfold and causes a BLAST of WATER to whoosh out from her remains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley moves into a strangling mode while Ford's hands move down to the next gun on the rack. Another BLAST BURSTS a hole in the other WALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford FIRES OFF yet another one into the floor below him causing a devastating geyser that allows him to break away from Smiley.

<DIRECTION>
Water is amusingly blasting out from every angle. Ford and Smiley battle semi-obliviously to this new added element of nature. The water rises above their knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford spins around and grabs the TV off the still-standing home entertainment center. He SMASHES it upon Smiley's head, submerging him into the water which is now at Ford's waist. Ford frantically scans the water like a shark attack victim, but Smiley does not emerge.

EXT. DECK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford collapses onto the damp deck with a gasp. The entire lower level of the boat is underwater. Ford works himself into a standing position as Smiley ferociously resurrects from out of decktop windowcase.

	Polo.

<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley does a savage medley of punches across Ford's gut before slapping him into the deck rail. WATER SPLASHES onto the deck as the boat goes into death throes. Ford ungracefully makes a clinging jump onto...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLY BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford beaches himself on the tippy top of the boat. Smiley effortlessly pops up and moves around behind Ford's head.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had enough?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley laughs as he places his thumb behind Ford's earlobe at Ford's jawline. This hurts... The fly bridge is the only part of the boat above water.
</DIRECTION>
<SMILEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feel my thumb? I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain. I leave. Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.

	I. Am. The. Biggest. Sissy. In. The. Whole. Fucking. World.

</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley removes his thumb, pats Ford on the head, and then proceeds to exuberantly backstroke away. A job well done.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford's torso is the only thing above water. His sliding gun apparatus pings to life. The gun finally slides into his hand. Ford snorts and shakes his head as he dis- appears below the water.

INT. DOROTHY CHANDLER PAVILION LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elite of Los Angeles, with impeccable tuxedoes and gowns to prove it, grandly stream into a large auditorium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford, holding a plastic bag of party ice over his face, stumbles through the pavilion doors in a wrinkled tuxedo. The ice bag breaks, sending ice and water down Ford's shirt. Various snooty patrons turn to harrumph, includ- ing Colleen, who does a double take when she realizes who she is harrumphing at.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</COLLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
A couple of gasps rise up out of the patrons around them. Ford and Colleen feel the breeze of heads turning all around them. They turn to see what everybody is looking at.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What they are looking at is Jazz! Gone are her glasses and businesslike dress. She stands at the inside entrance of the pavilion in a tight, low-at-the-top- high-at-the-bottom black leather mini-dress.

Jazz squints at the crowd trying to find Ford, who is quickly coming right towards her.

<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Jazz, I told you to dress 'nice' not nice. What, did you think this was a date?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>

Ford looks to Jazz's grim face. Yes, that's what she thought.

Male dancers wearing incredibly tight outfits that leave nothing to the imagination prance and move across the stage.

Ford and Colleen take in the spectacle before them. They speak in whispers.

Colleen mock-whimpers into the aisle. Ford turns to a dig- nified woman seated next to him and motions to the stage.

INT. DOROTHY CHANDLER PAVILION LOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Balletgoers stream into the lobby for the post-ballet re- ception. Ford meanders out with the buzzing crowd, a couple patrons taking notice of his wrinkled attire. Ford blazes a Marlboro Gold as a SNOOTY NON-SMOKER who got a snide closeup earlier in the segment, points to a "Yes, I mind if you smoke" button on his lapel.
</DIRECTION>
<SNOOTY_NON_SMOKER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOOTY_NON_SMOKER>

As Ford speaks, he takes a rubberband and attaches it to a lighter in a way that keeps the flame lit. He then places it in the Non-Smoker's tuxedo pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, you're right, sir, and I'm sorry. I thought I lived in a country where you were free to do any stupid thing you wanted; drive to work naked, make love to a V.C.R., but hey, you reminded me I live in a hell where any sperm like you can stab me in the heart with these things called opinions, just because you have them.

The Non-Smoker weakly smiles, his jacket starting to smoke.

	It's okay. It's okay, guy. Smoke all you want. Here, have one of mine...

</SNOOTY_NON_SMOKER>
<DIRECTION>
The Non-Smoker fumbles out a pack of cigarettes from his literally smoking jacket and then bolts away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An hors d'oeuvres tray cruises by. Ford grabs something on a toothpick and casually shoves possibly the worst thing he's ever tasted in his life into his mouth. Ford doesn't chew -- he just looks around for someplace to spit it out just as Julian Grendel approaches.
</DIRECTION>

In his underwear, Ford vegges on his couch with a koala bear at his feet and with a BLENDER WHIRRING beside.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't I pick fishermen?

</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Ford STOPS the BLENDER, flips off the lid, and begins drinking his homemade vodka milkshake straight out of the blender, but only after setting it on fire and blowing it out.

Ford then lazily remotes ON the TELEVISION. "MTV News" with KURT LODER finishes up. Ford unslumps up with Kurt's revelations.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vomit pulls the babe's monster-faced head out from between the bars of the cage. He savagely kisses her and then runs to the door of the cage. He flings it open. The babe no longer has the face of a monster. She has the face of Zuzu Petals for that is who the babe is.

WITH Spotlights, with T-shirt hawkers and with a couple hundred mournful rock and roll fans pushing and shoving at the gate, the viewer believes they are at a concert not a funeral.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. FUNERAL GROUNDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford mounts a small hill to blend into the already-in- progress funeral. Many people stand in various not necessarily tasteful black clothes. A row of nubile mournettes kneel praying, the lipstick on their face is noticeably and obscenely askew.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Geez, am I the only one who paid full price here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
A priest stands next to a big empty hole. The band members of Black Vomit are situated behind it, with their instruments. They begin a mournful metal jam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of a HELICOPTER is heard. Everyone seems to be ignoring this fact but Ford. A chopper is cruising toward the funeral.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CHOPPER sounds get LOUDER as the helicopter positions itself over the open grave. The band increases its intensify as the crowd chants "Vomit! Vomit! Vomit!" A large transparent tube is pushed out of the helicopter with an attached black parachute. The tube is lit up by round dressing room-style bulbs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tube floats down toward the grave. Ford and the VIEWER get to see that in the lit tube is Bobby Vomit. It swooshes perfectly into the grave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford shakes his head in amazement. Getting serious, he pulls the picture of Zuzu Petals from his pocket and scans the crowd. More young, pretty girls in sexy black pass before the grave, but no Zuzu.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GIRL IN A BLACK VEIL (three guesses who) quietly sobs beside Ford, holding the black purse from the opening scene (okay, one guess who). With a whimper, she puts her head against Ford's stomach. By reflex, Ford puts his arm around to comfort, but his eyes never leave the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL_IN_VEIL>

Zuzu fiercely balls her fist and punches Ford in the groin. She then bolts up and starts sprinting away. Ford gasps after her.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fluck me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Zuzu keeps running. She gives a glance back toward Ford as a black gloved hand thrusts out and grabs her by the neck. The arm leads to the maliciously chipper face of Smiley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley lifts Zuzu up and heaves her into a sidecar connected to a state of the art motorcycle. With a painful crash, Zuzu lands upside-down in the sidecar. Smiley straddles the BIKE and ROCKETS off, recklessly weaving through tombstones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Panting, Ford stops running toward the motorcycle. He changes direction and begins running...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
until he reaches his Fairlane. Ford wails in anger for his tires have been punctured. The PHONE in his car suddenly RINGS. Ford reaches in and pulls out the portable phone.

Portable phone pushed up under his armpit, receiver be- tween his head and his shoulder, Ford barrels up a hill...

INT. HEARSE

The body of a VOLUPTUOUS WOMAN rests naked on a gurney in the back of the hearse. The gurney wobbles back and forth toward Ford in the driver's seat. A tag on her hand reads LYDIA.

Smiley hangs up the phone, and ROARS into the street out- side the cemetery. Zuzu scowls, until Ford pulls up beside them, shouting out his window.

Ford super-swiftly raises his arm activating the sliding gun apparatus. The gun sails out of his sleeve, past his hand, out of his car, and over Smiley who rightfully laughs.

HEARSE

All this motion commotion causes the body of the Vol- uptuous Woman to burst out from the back and to crash into the front seat. Ford shrieks at the inert, well- endowed flesh. Suddenly, the PHONE RINGS. Ford fren- etically picks up...

	Zuzu Petals, I'm Ford Fairlane! I'm the good guy, he's the bad guy!

Entertained, Smiley FIRES his GUN at the hearse. Ford swerves around behind the motorcycle to Smiley's side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zuzu loops her purse around her neck and then, with a devilish grin, she stands up in the sidecar. Smiley watches incredulously as Zuzu jumps from the sidecar onto the motorcycle between his legs and then, after blowing a kiss, into the open passenger window of the hearse.

A disoriented Smiley swerves off onto a sidewalk, zipping past freaked out pedestrians.

Zuzu presses the remote control. Bah--oom! The TELEVI- SION EXPLODES, blowing Zuzu off the couch against the back wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford rushes into the smoky, raped, and abused living room and bolts down to the dazed and blackened Zuzu. Ford shakes her into some sort of consciousness.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zuzu, wake up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<ZUZU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hah fluck, great video, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZUZU>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<ZUZU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay? I just blew up. I feel orgasmic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZUZU>
<DIRECTION>
Ford glances up to see flames flickering at the curtains of his Jimi Hendrix guitar shrine. With a mute howl of pain, he lets go of his grip on Zuzu, letting her head clunk to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Puh-leeze...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
He speeds to the curtain and pulls. The guitar is gone. Ford gasps for breath while Zuzu moves into a wobbly standing position behind him. She walks OUT OF VIEW as Ford's anger finds sound.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My axe!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<ZUZU>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZUZU>
<DIRECTION>
Ford stops gasping. He races into his...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KITCHENETTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where Zuzu stands before a microwave oven, calmly combing ash out of her hair. The timer reads 00:09... 00:08...
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Ford grabs Zuzu by the hand and yanks her toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<ZUZU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, my purse!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZUZU>
<DIRECTION>
Zuzu breaks off from Ford to retrieve her purse on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, my purse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Zuzu zooms back and grabs Ford's hand, pulling him out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTSIDE FORD'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford and Zuzu burst from the house and dive onto the grass, heads down. A pause then a familiar BEEPING sound sig- nalling the end of a MICROWAVE cycle. Zuzu lifts her head.
</DIRECTION>
<ZUZU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it was just a pot pie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZUZU>
<DIRECTION>
BAH-OOM! A corner of the HOUSE neatly EXPLODES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford, lighting up a cigarette, and Zuzu achingly move into standing positions to watch the gently BELLOWING RUBBLE. Neighbors come out of their places to take part in the fun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Kid slowly approaches from behind the transfixed Ford and Zuzu. His eye is black, his lip bleeding, and his shirt is torn.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tried to stop them, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
Ford spins around and The Kid collapses in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_KID>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up, you dummy. Who did this to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<THE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits. I think Armani. They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_KID>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<THE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that. I kicked their ass!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(coughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I tried. There were two of them you know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_KID>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, how could you be so stupid? Come on, we're going to a hospital.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
The Kid stands up and wiggles away from Ford. He starts marching away toward the beach. Ford follows...
</DIRECTION>
<THE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tried to help you...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_KID>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And hey, I appreciate it...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's my father? Have you even looked?

<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<THE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Liar! You don't care! About anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
The Kid runs off. Ford gruffly exhales and turns to an arms-crossed Zuzu, who is not pleased about what she has seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford and Zuzu straggle over to Ford's Fairlane with nice, new tires. Ford pulls out his alarm beeper and raises it.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, at least the guys at the garage brought my baby back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Ford presses the ALARM beeper button... BAH-OOM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OPEN ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Battered and burned like Road Warrior extras, Ford and Zuzu drift down the side of the road. They wearily extend their thumbs at a passing car.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why the music industry? Ford Fairlane, detective of the fishermen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
A weensy sports car containing two rich FRAT BOYS swerves to the side of the road. As Ford and Zuzu rush to the car, the Frat Boys laugh and ride off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The license plate reads UNPOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah! Mo-ther-fu --

Ford is about to lose it when suddenly Melodi, the killer cute nymph from the club daintily pulls up in a Cabriolet.

EXT. OUTSIDE SORORITY HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melodi buoyantly grabs a doorknob beneath some incom- prehensible Greek letters. Ford and Zuzu try to brush themselves off.
</DIRECTION>
<MELODI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh wow, hiding out from cold blooded killers. The sisters are going to die...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELODI>
<DIRECTION>
Melodi swings open the door leading the VIEWER INTO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SORORITY HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a burst of LOUD MUSIC, the most ludicrous manifes- tation of the classic college-girls-behind-closed-doors fantasy unfolds in eye-popping fashion. Girls in short- shorts are aerobicizing to the music, girls in Calvin Klein underwear with shredded tank tops are engaged in an intense game of Twister.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gorgeous girl precariously holds a towel against her body as she tries to iron her Garfield panties, two girls in negligees bite into their corn dogs. A girl wearing only a strategic length T-shirt is tipping her bare toes, trying to change a bulb.
</DIRECTION>
<MELODI>

	Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.

	Hebedeebuh. Hebedeebuh. Maybe I did die in the explosion.

</FORD>
<ZUZU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know the feeling. This must be hell. Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZUZU>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ye-ah. Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Zuzu turns to the stunned Ford and laughingly spanks him as the sorority sisters scamper over.

<ZUZU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't forget, Jazz, bonewad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZUZU>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORD'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jazz sits at her desk in the dimly, eerily lit office. The PHONE RINGS. Jazz hits the speaker button, speaking somberly.
</DIRECTION>
<JAZZ>

INT. SORORITY KITCHENETTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford speaks on a wall phone while achingly watching a girl in a teddy slowly fill up a balloon in a faucet.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmh! My house was blown up, my car was blown up, and my koala bear isn't in too great a shape, either.

	'That's too bad.' All you can say is 'That's too bad.'

</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VIEWER'S VIEWPOINT PULLS OUT ON Jazz in the eerily- lit office. The Punk Gunslinger stands behind her, pointing a gun. The HEAVY METAL GUNSLINGER sits across from her, doing the same.
</DIRECTION>
<JAZZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Ford, that's all I can say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAZZ>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SORORITY HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GIRLS have formed a giggling circle around Ford. Each sip a silly-colored wine cooler. Zuzu is grudgingly having fun, too.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, then Springsteen says to Madonna, 'Hey, I only eat lime Jell-O...'

INT. FORD'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Heavy Metal Gunslinger bobs up from a phone book.
</DIRECTION>
<HEAVY_METAL_GUNSLINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got an address for the sorority.

	<DIALOGUE>
	If you ever have a son, I hope his dog dies...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEAVY_METAL_GUNSLINGER>
<DIRECTION>
The Punk Gunslinger pushes Jazz back against the Heavy Metal Gunslinger. The Metal Gunslinger grabs her arms while the Punk grabs her legs. They swing Jazz back and forth three times before heaving her SMASH! through the plate GLASS WINDOW of the office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SORORITY HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sisters stand in semi-darkness around Ford, each holding a lit candle, and each wearing only a special robe. Ford is also wearing a robe over boxer shorts.
</DIRECTION>
<SISTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quantas -- Jujubees -- Salcido -- Ford Fairlane -- Quantas -- Jujubees...

<DIRECTION>
Ford looks over to Zuzu who stands by the window doing a "jerking off" motion. Ford smiles, until he looks...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV - THROUGH WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Two Gunslingers ride up in a Jeep without their lights on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SORORITY HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford spins to the Sisters.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody, blow!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
The Sisters blow out their candles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SORORITY LAWNS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still in his robe, Ford bounds across the lawns of various sorority lawns until he is far from the malevolent Jeep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford stands at the top of an inclined street. He looks to the Jeep at the foot of the hill before turning next to him. Next to him is the sports car with the UNPOOR license plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford reaches down to the emergency brake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEEP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two Gunslingers intensely load their guns. The Punk Gunslinger looks up, then back down, and suddenly back up again with a squeal. The sports car is coming right at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Too late to run. The sports car sails right into the JEEP, wounding it with a loud CRUNCH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRAT BOYS pile out of the across-the-street-parties with howls.
</DIRECTION>
<UNPOOR_FRAT_BOY_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Du-udes, they executed my Midget!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNPOOR_FRAT_BOY_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
The Frat Boys thunder towards the Jeep. The Punk Gunslinger exhales a "This ain't my night" breath before pulling out an UZI. He SPRAYS a line of cars parked before the fraternity, SHATTERING WINDOWS, setting off CAR ALARMS, and sending scared Frat Boys running away squealing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POLICE SIRENS can be heard in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK_GUNSLINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's cut-our-losses time, dude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUNK_GUNSLINGER>
<DIRECTION>
The JEEP starts to SCREECH off, but then stops and backs up so the Heavy Metal Gunslinger can lob a GRENADE into the sports car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Unpoor Frat Boy Driver watches in agony as his CAR EXPLODES. Ford comes up from behind him, takes the Boy's hand and extends the thumb. Ford grins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SORORITY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A victorious Ford struts into the sorority to much applause. Ford looks down to a box of water balloons and pulls out one with each hand. High-energy MUSIC is playing on the STEREO.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All work and no play makes Ford a dull boy.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The Sorority Sisters all start to yank off their robes when suddenly a crumpled and bloodied Jazz enters the house.
</DIRECTION>
<JAZZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do we have to have an office on the second floor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAZZ>
<DIRECTION>
Jazz begins to collapse. Ford drops his water balloons and catches her.
</DIRECTION>
<JAZZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came to warn you...

<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance! Get that music off!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<ZUZU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, I have a much more appropriate C.D. Bobby sneaked it into my purse the day he died. It was so romantic...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZUZU>
<DIRECTION>
Zuzu pulls out the red number one Black Vomit C.D. from her purse. She goes to the compact disc player and slides it in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The painful COMPUTER SCREECHES: SCRE-E-E-E! BUZZ! SHSHSHSHSHSH! come croaking out the SPEAKERS. The Sorority Sisters hold their ears, whimpering in pain, while Zuzu obliviously tries to dance to it. Ford and Jazz smile at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<MELODI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't music!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELODI>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is to us! It's computerised.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Jazz takes the Black Vomit compact disc case (with a red number on it) from Jazz and holds it up.
</DIRECTION>
<JAZZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet. What were your words...
	</DIALOGUE>

	'A fucking C.D. This case is closed.'

<DIRECTION>
Ford triumphantly pulls the small toy duck from his pocket. He frowns and throws it away, then pulls out Colleen's C.D.

<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sisters, the sorority computer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER CORNER OF SORORITY HOUSE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire sorority and Zuzu are huddled around a seated Ford and slightly-cleaned-up Jazz, who is banging away at a computer.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aha, just what I suspected!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<JAZZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not funny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAZZ>
<DIRECTION>
The computer screen is filled with incomprehensible, scrambled nonsense.

<ZUZU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is boring, guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZUZU>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zuzu, be quiet. Put in Colleen's disc. Number two.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Jazz slides Colleen's disc in the C.D. modem. More scrambled nonsense of a different kind appears on the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<ALL_GIRLS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bor-ring.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALL_GIRLS>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<JAZZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits. This one is putting out low bits. The data is in some fucked binary system. The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc. Comprendo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAZZ>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Su-ure. Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers. Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(standing up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's not necessary. People are dead. One was a friend. The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...

</SORORITY_SISTER_3>
<DIRECTION>
Ford cuts them off with a deadpan blink.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jazz, get to a hospital. Zuzu and I are going to feel things out with Mr. Grendel. If I don't call in an hour... hell, I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JULIAN GRENDEL'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bizarrely-over-the-top-high-tech. Strange furniture -- gold records -- the spooky portrait of Julian and his father. A nighttime cityscape sparkles through the windows. Awnings meant for sunlight jut out and block moonlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bathed by high-tech lighting, wearing a tuxedo, Julian Grendel is pounding a feverishly-modulated CLASSICAL TUNE on a piano.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the VIEWER TAKES IN the sight of a confused Ford and Zuzu standing off to the side, the latter blowing gum bubbles, it is REVEALED that Julian's piano is literally soundless. The piano has had all its chords ripped out. The classical piece existed only in Julian's brain and on the soundtrack. Julian's actual playing produces only a dull clicking sound.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, nice piano. Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh... It's another time, Julian, another place. If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<GRENDEL>
<DIRECTION>
(wry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shock.

	And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<GRENDEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Golly, I'd probably faint.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRENDEL>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Smiley, smiling in another tie-dye shirt, non- chalantly walks into the room carrying a couple shirts in cleaners bags in his black-gloved hands.
</DIRECTION>
<ZUZU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZUZU>
<SMILEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bro, they still can't get that spot out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMILEY>
<DIRECTION>
Grendel downs Ford with a punch to the gut and tears the CDs from Ford's pocket. Smiley laughs and whimsically shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<ZUZU>

	Ford, you were right!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZUZU>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ye-ah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Julian picks up a remote control and zaps a STEREO. A dramatic CLASSICAL PIECE floats on. He then coolly pops open the drawers of three CD modems beneath a large computer screen. He plunks a disc in each...
</DIRECTION>
<GRENDEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(furious, coming to the third modem)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, where's the third C.D.? How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here! A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc. Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRENDEL>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits. Shit, just start torturing me, man. I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<GRENDEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't play games... ugh. Did you say you don't have the third... ugh.

<DIRECTION>
(a beat of contemplation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to torture you, Ford.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRENDEL>
<DIRECTION>
The two Gunslingers enter and along with everyone else in the room, look to Zuzu who obliviously pops a bubblegum bubble.
</DIRECTION>
<GRENDEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not her, Ford. I'm afraid sometimes a pussy is just a pussy, but a 1962 Fender Stratocaster with an original Humbucking Pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left-handed genius -- Jimi Hendrix, is something else entirely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRENDEL>

The Punk Gunslinger lifts up Ford's beloved guitar out from under a couch in the office as Smiley bolts behind Ford and holds his arms behind his back.

Grendel throws down the 2/3 and takes the guitar from the Punk. He gently places the guitar on the table and takes a comfy seated position on the couch. He flicks a switchblade and lowers it toward the guitar.

EXT. 14TH FLOOR LEDGE

Ford and Zuzu are climbing down and around the side of the building.

<FORD>

EXT. 12TH FLOOR AWNING

Zuzu's feet dangle -- she hits the tiny ledge. Ford steadies her.
</DIRECTION>

Ford tries to open a window, but it's locked. He tries the next one -- they're all locked. Ford kicks the window. Bonk! -- the glass bounces, unaffected -- Whoa! -- Ford teeters from the hit -- falling -- Zuzu grabs him and pulls him back up.
</DIRECTION>

	Pretty smooth, huh?

HEAVY METAL GUNSLINGER

Ford helps Zuzu drop her feet into the hap... and Smiley's hand juts up and grabs Zuzu's legs. Smiley is in midair pulling down on Zuzu. He must have jumped up to snatch them.

<DIRECTION>
EIGHTH FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley and Zuzu fall down as one. Slap! -- Smiley hits the ledge -- let's go of Zuzu -- and she falls outward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clang! -- Zuzu slams into the slanted metal awning -- her feet slide out from underneath her like a bad ice skater -- she reaches for the ledge -- misses -- but slap! She grabs onto the top edge of the awning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lays there, at a forty-five degree angle, her feet sticking out into the atmosphere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Smiley stands right above her grinning. Smiley rests a steadying hand on the wall -- sticks his foot out towards the top of the awning -- towards Zuzu's fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<ZUZU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Fo-ord!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZUZU>
<DIRECTION>
THUNK -- Ford drops from above and lands on the ledge behind Smiley. Smiley's gloved hands lunge out at Ford and grab his throat. Ford shoots his hands out and locks them on Smiley's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zuzu hangs on for dear life as Ford and Smiley squeeze- push-twist -- both almost dependant on the other to keep balance. Bored, Smiley decides to finish off Ford. He swings Ford's head out a bit, then in, smashing Ford's skull against the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The force of the smash knocks them both off balance. They twist -- tip -- let go of each other -- and both fall -- CLANG! -- CLANG! -- onto the METAL awning right next to Zuzu -- Smiley in the middle. Each holding on with one hand to the CREAKING AWNING, they both start to wail punches on each other. Then kicking.
</DIRECTION>
<ZUZU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fluck this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZUZU>
<DIRECTION>
Zuzu gets into the act. With her nails. And Smiley's eyes. She rips away blindly at his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley yells. He loses his grip and starts to slide down -- until he grabs Ford's belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford gleefully unloosens his belt and lets a desperate and descending Smiley yank it all the way out. Ford reaches out to the belt at the last second. He savors the sight of Smiley hanging on for dear life.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.

<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. 'B-y-e!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Before Ford can let go of the belt, he catches sight of Smiley's glove ripping open revealing a Snoopy-in-a fighter-pilot-suit ring, just like his son's, The Kid. The "Snoopy and the Red Baron" SONG PLAYS a couple of beats. Ford looks to God.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. God. You're an asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<ZUZU>
	<DIALOGUE>

<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is fucking unbelievable. Zuzu, it's a long story, you see...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley suddenly lurches up to Ford's neck and starts strangling away. And that's when the awning bends -- it wasn't built for this. The angle changes from forty-five to twenty-five as all three people slam down and bounce.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Snoopy comes off in Ford's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They all lose their grip. And free fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In midair, Zuzu latches onto Ford's legs and Smiley latches onto Zuzu's legs. Ford's elbow crunches through the edge of the next metal awning. His encrusted elbow is the only thing that is keeping the dangling three-way chain of himself, Zuzu and Smiley from death. All three howl and scream in amusing syncopation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford looks to his left and stops screaming. Hanging from two good guitar strings, off a building thermometer, is the guitar. Ford loudly cheers and breaks into a rendition of "Purple Haze."
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>

	Whoooo! Oh, God, buddy, I'm sorry for calling you an asshole. You're number one, man! Hey, Zuzu, look I found my guitar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
Ford looks down to Zuzu who is rightfully wailing her head off. Ford is slapped back into reality. Ford looks over to his guitar, back down to Zuzu, then up to God. He whines.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're tearing me apart, here!
	</DIALOGUE>

Ford reaches over to his guitar and unhooks it from the thermometer with his free hand.

<DIRECTION>
Ford fiercely flings down his guitar. It blazes down into Smiley's face. Smiley lets go of Zuzu with a final howl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford and the viewer watch the guitar swirl and spin in the air before crunching to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zuzu climbs up Ford's back and INTO the FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<ZUZU>
	<DIALOGUE>

They stand shellshocked and motionless for a moment, until Ford turns around and tries to catch his breath. Zuzu's body language says that she still thinks she's on a ledge.

<FORD>

	Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s. Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.

A flash of reflected light hits Grendel's face causing him to wince. He wiggles his head and continues...

Kyle Troy, the untalented prettyboy from the studio comes out, wearing a heavy metal-style wig, to the bullshit applause of the crowd. He is accompanied by a security guard.

	</DIALOGUE>
</GRENDEL>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music. Those ingrates really take a bite. But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...

	What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRENDEL>
<DIRECTION>
Holding the radio mike, Zuzu scampers up behind Grendel with giddy self-consciousness at the adventure at hand. As Grendel launches into a tirade, Zuzu holds up the mike just behind him. She reacts to his words with over- the-top facial expressions.
</DIRECTION>
<GRENDEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should kill more music people! When I was sixteen, I wrote an opera, the greatest piece of music ever created in the 20th Century outside the Dirty Dancing soundtrack. It was called 'Paco the Shoeshine Boy.' When I showed it to my father, he said it 'wasn't happening.' That 'no playlists worth his while would touch it'!

</FORD>
<GRENDEL>

Grendel pulls off his plastic ears and holds them out to Ford.

Zuzu, with a squeal, runs off to the stage. Grendel pursues...

Zuzu and Grendel run out in view of everyone. Grendel looks out at the dead silent tableau of people who were cheering him only moments before.

Ford grabs the shake and flings the contents into Grendel, who gets off a SHOT with his GUN. Ford dives behind an amp as Julian lets another SHOT FLY. Ford pulls from his pockets matchbooks from a multitude of L.A. clubs. He lights a handful of them on fire as Grendel moves in for the kill.

An RTD BUS RUMBLES to the corner of Ford's street. The sad Detective shuffles off the bus to the tune of the SADDEST SONG in film history.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Ford walks toward his house, he passes his debris, still splayed out on the street from the night before; mangled gold records, smoldered speakers, his red hotline now burntline phone, and then there's that funky sliding- arm-and-gun apparatus with a gun attached. Ford picks it up, sliding the gun back and forth with a rueful smile.

Ford's house is looking gloomy, dark, and missing a lot of pieces. Ford walks through the intact, but dis- embodied, front door.

I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine...

The viewer's VIEWPOINT is LULLED TO a friendly hut by a beautiful tropical cove. A humble hand-drawn sign reads: FORD FAIRLANE, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR - FISHERMEN ONLY.

SWINGING AROUND the hut, the viewer DISCERNS Ford, Jazz, and The Kid kicking back on chaise lounges in silly tropical shirts with identical sunglasses.
