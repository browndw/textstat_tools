:SC: "THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT CLOSE - JOE THERRIAN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's in his mid-thirties, his face relaxed in sleep, childlike. Nestled soundly a tangle in the arms of his wife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA STAYS CLOSE. SLIGHTLY BLURRED, SOFT, SLOWLY SWINGS ROUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT CLOSE - SALLY THERRIAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's in her mid-thirties, with large deep eyes. She watches her husband unguarded in sleep. Her pretty face, alert, she's barely breathing. Traces the just visible lines around his eyes, and mouth. Brushes fingertips against his eyelashes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT CLOSE - SALLY'S HAND PULLS THE BEDROOM SHADE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It retracts with a loud WHACK, sun, sky, trees.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>

	And breath...and chataronga...

:SC: EXT. POOL AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're in the middle of a yoga lesson. Joe and Sally stand on their mats. Steven, their instructor, wanders around the couple issuing soft-spoken instructions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large room with hard wood floors, dominated by a huge fireplace. The dining room on one side, living room on the other. Floor to ceiling windows overlook the back porch garden pool... The house is classic Neutra. All GLASS and SMOOTH LINES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The calm is broken by the telephone. Joe and Sally ignore it until the answering machine picks up. They break their yoga poses and listen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA hovers over the answering machine.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (over answering machine; sweet, British, slightly desperate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe, it's Lucy. Remember me? It's the black sheep here. Bah...not funny. Haven't heard from you, need you, call me. Love you madly. Hi, Sally. Joe, I'd love to talk to you before I go...
	</DIALOGUE>

<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go where?

</JOE>
<LUCY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a damn nuisance you aren't here, big brother. Sorry I drone on. I miss you. I lo--

</LUCY>

The machine cuts her off.

<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe and Sally have resumed their positions. This wasn't the call they were waiting for.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AMERICA, forty-one, and ROSA, fifty, struggle up the steps of the back porch carrying grocery bags and packages, come through the sliding glass door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the dining room and into the kitchen, watches the two unpack groceries, flowers, etc., and start to dress the dining room table. They speak quietly to each other in Spanish.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	America, could you just...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
America closes the sliding doors between the kitchen and the dining room, giving the couple their privacy.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>

(CONT'D) (calls out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, America!

	Okay, let's just take a deep breath, let your ribs expand and relax. And reach up and into downward dog.
	</DIALOGUE>

Otis, the Bisenji/Sheperd mix, sleeping on his leopard pillow, stirs, stretches and groans.

The phone RINGS again.

<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (over answering machine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, I have Dr. Harmon calling for Sally Therrian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Sally jumps out of the down dog position and runs to the phone, all angles.
</DIRECTION>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, hi, hi...and? Thank God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Sally stands with the phone to her ear, her back to Joe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. POOL AREA - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe watches her from his position, not concentrating on the teacher waiting a sign. Sally returns to the lesson. They do their handstands against the wall, on either side of the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Sally nods, she and Joe, at Steven's instructions, come out of their handstands and lie on the floor in a stretched relax, facing one another.
</DIRECTION>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy anniversary, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy anniversary.

They smile.

<DIRECTION>
America slides open the dining room doors. The dining table is covered with bundles of freshly cut flowers. Rosa is singing in Spanish.
</DIRECTION>
<AMERICA>
<DIRECTION>
(with the authority of long years of service)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Joe, we have to have the house. If you please now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMERICA>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA glances off photos of the couple: portraits and candids, their wedding day, with friends, on vacation, tumbling on the lawn, and the like. Some framed and hung, some taped to the fridge or simply leaning on a shelf. It's clear that at least a handful are by the same photographer, black and whites, grainy and beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are lots of photos of Joe and his sister Lucy, documenting their relationship from childhood. There's an ANNIE LEIBOWITZ photo-shoot of Sally carelessly displayed somewhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BEDROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe stands behind Sally in front of the full length mirror, his arms around her, stroking her belly.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you. Most beautiful woman in the world.

</JOE>
<SALLY>

<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</JOE>
<SALLY>

	In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>

She pushes him on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kiss my eyes.

</JOE>

She does.

<SALLY>

	My wrists.

He does.

<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kiss the back of my knees.

</JOE>
<SALLY>

	Through the sweats or not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls down his sweats. She kisses the back of his knees. He turns, stares up at her.
</DIRECTION>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>

Sally shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(after a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I missed that.

</SALLY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're great.

</JOE>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, you're really back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For good.

They begin to make love...the phone RINGS.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get it.

</SALLY>
<JOE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(puts the call on hold)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Skye Davidson. She needs directions to the house. You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you. It was the only chance I had to meet her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She goes on location tomorrow. Sally, I'm sorry. Look, I can't keep her on hold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SALLY>
<DIRECTION>
(pissed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no of course not. It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(regards her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to uninvite her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no of course not. How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<DIRECTION>
She gets out of bed, starts into the bathroom. The CAMERA is with her.
</DIRECTION>
<SALLY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (into the bathroom mirror)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.

	Skye!

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(flattered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You read the book again? Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again. If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park. Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right. It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Sally's started the bath, and is watching him from the doorway. He meets her eyes mid-sentence.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh? I don't think tonight. I'm sure they're well behaved. All our friends have dogs, and they always want to bring them. We'd be outnumbered, you see? So we sort of put a ban on it. Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He rolls his eyes. Sally walks back into the bathroom, she isn't buying it.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.

The doorbell rings. There are two closed doors on either side of the room. The bed shows no sign of consummated sex. Joe comes through the left hand door, nearly dressed.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the fuck can be here at this time? It's not even seven!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>

Sally comes through the other door, one shoe off, one on.

:SC: INT. FOYER - EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house is filled with exquisite flower arrangements, candles everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JERRY and JUDY ADAMS are on the porch, just beyond the glass of the front door. Their argument is inaudible. They're in their mid-thirties, conservatively dressed. She's stunning, genetically nervous. Jerry carries a briefcase. She's got the gift.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sally opens the door. Hugs and buses them, hello.
</DIRECTION>
