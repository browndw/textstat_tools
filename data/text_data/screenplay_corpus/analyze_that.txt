</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two men, CAESAR and MARTY "DUCKS," stand at the end of the deserted bar, talking quietly, oblivious to the exotic dancer grinding her pelvis on a pole in the middle of the small stage. Body language and charisma tell us that Caesar is the boss, "Ducks" his lieutenant.

<CAESAR>

	I just don't think it was him.

Caesar starts to walk away as the bartender, now holding a sawed-off shotgun, moves closer to Ducks. The exotic dancer splits in a hurry through a curtain at the back of the stage.

Vitti turns and stares at them. They fall silent immediately.

<EARL>

<DIRECTION>
Earl exits with the guard. Vitti hesitates a moment, then warily steps into his cell. CUT TO: :SC: INT. VITTI'S CELL - MIDDLE OF NIGHT The cellblock is quiet. A guard stops outside the darkened cell, looks around to make sure no one is watching, then pulls out a GUN with a SILENCER, reaches through the bars and FIRES REPEATEDLY into Vitti's shadowy form under the blanket. Then he slips away as quietly as he appeared.

<DIRECTION>
ON his exit we PAN DOWN TO Vitti, unhurt, curled up under his bunk. CUT TO: :SC: INT. MEMORIAL CHAPEL - DAY A deluxe casket flanked by elaborate floral displays and an easel displaying a portrait of the deceased, Dr. Isaac Sobel. Mourners fill the pews, standees at the back, an overflow crowd.

<RABBI>

<BEN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	One, of course, is the public Isaac Sobel, the eminent psychotherapist and popular author known to millions of readers around the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Laura, Michael and Ben's Mother listen proudly to the eulogy.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The second Isaac Sobel is the private man -- my father -- Dad. And for those of you who knew him well and knew our family -- well, let's face it -- my father was a psychotic, mind- fucking prick. An arrogant, abusive, ego-inflated --

<DIRECTION>
A RINGING CELL PHONE interrupts him. JUMP CUT TO: BEN still seated in the front row, daydreaming. The RINGING CONTINUES as all the mourners and even the Rabbi discreetly check their cell phones.

Vitti and another WISEGUY pass through the cafeteria line with their trays. Vitti now looks catatonic.

Vitti just stares, wild-eyed, actually drooling a little.
</DIRECTION>
<WISEGUY_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I have your tapioca?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A guard, the one who tried to kill him, watches Vitti from his post. Then he nods to someone across the room. COYOTE, a heavily-muscled and tattooed gang member, nods in response. Vitti walks past the table where Coyote is sitting with other tough Hispanic gang members.
</DIRECTION>
<COYOTE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Vitti)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Fredo! Or is it Guido?

His friends laugh. Vitti stops and stares dumbly at them.

<COYOTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just keep walkin', Don Corleone.

<DIRECTION>
There is a tense moment, then Vitti bursts out laughing.

	Shut up!

<DIRECTION>
Vitti laughs harder, strangely manic.
</DIRECTION>
<COYOTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said, shut up, bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
But Vitti can't stop. He drops his tray of slop, splattering food on the men. Coyote leaps to his feet and pulls a shiv.
</DIRECTION>
<COYOTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a dead man, jefe!
	</DIALOGUE>

Coyote lunges at Vitti with the knife, but Vitti suddenly whirls around, bashes Coyote in the face with his food tray and bursts into song.

</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Based on his symptoms and the test results, I'd say brief psychotic disorder -- if it persists, possibly schizophreniform disorder. And Dr. Cutler agrees with my diagnosis.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHAPIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So he's crazy?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Cutler? No, he's annoying, but --
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHAPIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vitti.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not crazy. At least not permanently. In certain people, continuous exposure to an extremely stressful situation -- soldiers in combat, for instance, disaster victims, a hostage situation, or being locked up in a maximum security prison with someone trying to kill you -- it can produce a temporary psychotic state.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHAPIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How temporary?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A day, a week, up to a month -- if the precipitating stressors are removed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHAPIN>
<DIRECTION>
(musing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which means he's not going to get any better while he's still in the can.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He could get worse. He could deteriorate to the point where he'd be permanently schizophrenic.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHAPIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I'd say he's got a real problem, because he goes before the parole board in four weeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think they'll let him out?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHAPIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(thinks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, couldn't you release him to a halfway house or some place where he could get some decent treatment? Based on my earlier work with him, I don't think he's dangerous, and I think he was making a real effort to reform himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHAPIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(thinks for a long moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Then I'll tell you what. I'm gonna release him into your custody.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>

	Mine? Me? No, this is a bad time for me. My father just died -- and I've got this bulging disc in my neck -- and we're redecorating, which is a total nightmare. I can't --

(firm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got thirty days to get him in shape for his parole hearing. That means sane, sober and gainfully employed. But let me warn you, Doctor. If he fucks up in any way -- if he flees, or if I find out that this whole thing was just a setup so he could get back on the street and return to a life of crime -- I will hold you totally responsible, and I'll see that you are stripped of your license and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Are we clear?

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why "The Wrench"?

	That's what I wanted to do, but you told me I had no choice -- it was either here or Sing Sing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not trying to punish you. These aren't my rules, but I have a responsibility here. Besides, I thought you might like a nice home- cooked meal after being in prison that long.

	</DIALOGUE>
<VITTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So? From the look of 'em, some of those broads haven't seen the old salcicc' in a long time. It's good for them.

	With your life.

</BEN>
<VITTI>

	First I'm gonna find out who's tryin' to kill me. I'm a target. Somebody could shoot right through that window -- blow my fuckin' head off.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Ben sees that he's in the line of fire, gets up and moves out of the way.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, that's a priority. Have you thought about what you're going to do for work?
	</DIALOGUE>
<VITTI>
	<DIALOGUE>

<VITTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like hitting a guy on the head with a baseball bat.

	Oh, sporting goods. We'll check the want ads tomorrow but don't get your hopes up. Anything else?

Vitti is at a loss.

	Well, let's think. When you were a kid, What did you want to be?

	Fine. I wanted to be a philatelist.

<VITTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanted to look up people's assholes all day?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Paul, I believe you're thinking of a proctologist. I wanted to collect rare and unusual stamps.

<VITTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must've been a lot of laughs when you were a kid. Lonely, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>

<BEN>

	A cowboy. Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
<VITTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. My father gave me a cowboy suit -- you know, the vest, the chaps, the cap guns -- the whole thing. And he used to take me up to my uncle's farm in New Jersey and lead me around on this pony. Yippee-i-o. You happy now?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you watched cowboy movies and TV shows with your father.

<VITTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I guess.

	Do I remember? I think about it every fuckin' day of my life. What's that got to do with it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

Vitti starts thinking about his father and starts to weep.
</DIRECTION>
<VITTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. He did.

<VITTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Okay. That's enough of that shit.

<VITTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I know it.

<BEN>

	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is not social. Paul's meeting a television producer who might have a job for him. He's nervous and wants me here as a buffer. I'm a buffer, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a grown man. I don't see why he needs a chaperone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He doesn't. He needs a buffer. I'm here in buffer capacity only.

<LAURA>

	No. We gettin' any real food? This is like eatin' fuckin' bait.

Raoul chuckles and glances uncomfortably at his girlfriend. Ben laughs loudly to cover the awkward moment. He's suffering from some reaction between the pills and the booze and he's oddly thick-lipped.

<BEN>

	Rah-oo. Row. Rowl. I guess you need both lips for that name. You know what I love about Paul? He was born without a filter. He says exactly what he's thinking -- just lays it right out there. He doesn't edit himself.

<VITTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't admire me too much.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. That would be incredible. Did you hear that, Paul? Raoul wants to know if you'd be interested in working on his show as a consultant. You know, give technical advice, coach the actors --

	That's her claim to fame.

	Well, wherever he's from, I think he's a wonderful actor.

	It's my job. He needs me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that automatically means you have to help him? You're always doing this -- putting other people's needs ahead of your own, like you're this martyr or saint or something. It's like living with Mother Teresa.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I hear she was tough to live with. Lot of parties, loud music -- lepers.

<LAURA>

Ben sits heavily on the bed.

<BEN>

	It's just a confusing time. I became a therapist because he was a therapist, so obviously his approval was very important to me. But is that the only reason I did it? I don't know. And now that he's gone, why do I keep doing it? Is this what I really want?

	Yeah, I know. When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way.
