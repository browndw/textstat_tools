:SC: VIRTUOSITY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two men bolt recklessly through a downtown street. Hunters hot on the trail of their prey in an urban jungle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sidewalk is crowded with people. So is the street. Too many people, not enough cement. Los Angeles, 1997.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Summer, probably August. 103 degrees. Heat shimmers off the horizon. Making the sky look peculiar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men keep running. Passed a GUY sitting at a bus stop, watching a television in his lap. YOU HEAR the NEWSCASTER.

<DIRECTION>
The guy pays little attention to the broadcast. He seems almost bored by it. Like this kind of news is commonplace. Or he's got more important things on his mind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody is sweating. Including the two men struggling to swim upstream in the river of pedestrians.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their uniforms are freshly pressed. Their shoes just recently shined. Hair tightly cropped. Faces perfectly shaved. Clearly men proud to wear the badge of the Los Angeles Police Department. The guy in the lead is

<PARKER_BARNES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His body is a running back's. His endurance a marathoner's. His face one you'd want for your own. He's in his 30s. If he was in his 20s, you'd still be jealous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARKER_BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
His partner is JOHN DONLEY, late 20s, eager to prove himself. He struggles to keep up with Parker. John accidently knocks over several pedestrians. They give no reaction, except to pick themselves up and continue on their way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker and John keep charging. Their conversation breathless:
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't get over how different you look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
(ruefully)

<DIRECTION>
Parker spots Sid 6.7 across the room. Without hesitation the hunter chases his prey. Gun out and firing. NOT what you would call Standard Police Procedure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bullets riddle Sid 6.7's table as he dives from his chair. He lands next to a bowling ball bag, which sits beneath his table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John charges from the other direction until a WOMAN gets up from her chair, standing directly in John's line of fire.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Woman)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lady, move!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Before she can do so, Sid 6.7 stands behind the Woman, grabbing her and throwing her across the table into Parker. CRASH! They tumble to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the same movement, Sid 6.7 removes a gun from inside his jacket and shoots John in the shoulder before he can fire. John's gun flies from his hand. Sid 6.7 advances toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker struggles to his feet. Aims his weapon. Sid 6.7 does the same, but without looking. BOOM! Parker gets a bullet through his shooting arm. His wound IDENTICAL to John's. Parker's weapon tumbles to the floor as his arm goes limp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker charges him wildly, but Sid 6.7 brutally kicks him in the stomach. In perfect rhythm with the symphony playing in the background. Parker doubles over, gasping for breath. Another kick drops Parker to his knees.

He grabs his bowling bag and SLAMS it into John's head, knocking him out. Sid 6.7 puts John's unconscious body over his shoulder.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR THE RESTAURANT KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker charges through SOUS CHEFS chopping vegetables, who work undistracted. The Vegetables look plastic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker turns a corner, stopping fast. At the other end of the aisle stands Sid 6.7, who presses his gun against the head of a frightened BUSBOY. Sid 6.7 holds the Busboy's body in front of his own as a shield.

Advancing up the aisle, Parker levels his gun at Sid 6.7 with his good arm. Now, all work comes to a stop as the Sous Chefs watch the showdown.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Recital's over, asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
He fires directly through the chest of the innocent Busboy hitting Sid 6.7.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sous Chefs gasp in horror as the Busboy drops through Sid 6.7's grasp to the floor. Dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid 6.7 stares at Parker in disbelief. Blood is now visible flowing from a bullet hole in Sid 6.7's shoulder, which was caused by the same bullet. Sid 6.7's arm dangles uselessly. His gun lies on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<SID_6_7>

(surprised, but pleased).
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You and me aren't so different, after all...

Parker again pulls the trigger. Click. Click, click. No bullets.

	Like a violin without strings...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID_6_7>
<DIRECTION>
He takes off around the corner. Grabbing another clip from inside his uniform, Parker goes after him. Only to stumble over something. Sid 6.7's bowling bag. Blood flows through its zipper. You now realize the object inside is NOT a bowling ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beside the bowling bag lies John's body, which is convulsing. His hands have been tied to bare electrical wire. John is being electrocuted. Parker kicks away the wires, but not in time.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SHIT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
He scans the room for Sid 6.7. Parker has no idea Sid 6.7 is standing directly behind him. Sid 6.7 grabs Parker by the throat.
</DIRECTION>

	I told you I was going to perform a new piece with you. It's called, "First You Suffer, Then You Die." Hope you like it.

Parker gags, unable to breathe. He then starts to DE— MATERIALIZE from within Sid 6.7's grasp.

	<DIALOGUE>
	NOOOH! You can't take him, yet. I'm not finished!

</SID_6_7>
<DIRECTION>
John's body also de—materializes as Parker disappears entirely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blood seeping from Sid 6.7's wound stops flowing and starts retracting into his body. Along with his bone fragments. His shoulder is healing itself. Right before your very eyes. We PULL BACK TO REVEAL what you are seeing is
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON A MONITOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scene continues seamlessly. Sid 6.7's skin heals over his shoulder wound once his internal parts are back in their proper places. No scar whatsoever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His clothing also returns to perfect condition. Literally, as good as new. This is known as AUTOMATIC RESETTING.

The previously dead Busboy also Auto Resets. His wound healing by itself. We PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal the monitor is one of several

INTERIOR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT CENTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a/k/a LETAC. The facility is a converted aerospace research building in Pacoima. Funded by government black book dollars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The look is a mixture of industrial grime and high-tech sparkle. Banks upon banks of computer equipment. Wires, cables, conduits, connectors everywhere you look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In complete disarray to the uninitiated. But to those in the know, this is the most advanced facility of its kind in the world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The building is partitioned into dozens of stations. At each station, a leading engineer in his field is frantically readying a prototype for demonstration. Each new technology designed to help fight the new Cold War... the War on Crime.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The atmosphere is competitive. Voices are loud. Tension, anticipation in the air. Only a lucky few will have their inventions approved for production.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LETAC is, quite simply, Los Alamos from 1940 meets Sega from 1994.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At a station in the middle of the room, TWO UNCONSCIOUS BODIES lie on narrow beds wearing form-fitting skull caps made of polyurethane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each skull cap has 100 acupuncture needles stuck through it at points designated as neural primes. Each needle is directly connected to the participant's nervous system.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tail end of each needle is connected to a fiber optic wire which leads to one of numerous interconnected computers surrounding the beds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each of these components isn't much to look at on its own. But together, with the rest of the apparatus, are part of something very new —— a revolutionary law enforcement training device whose name you read:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIRTUAL REALITY CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION SIMULATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To be perfectly clear, the events you just witnessed involving Parker, John, and Sid 6.7 took place within virtual reality, not the real world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dozens of small character modules, similar to today's Nintendo game cartridges, are plugged into .the system's main console.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each of the modules bares a name and number, such as MAITRE D' 1.7 and SHEILA 3.2. There is no character version number greater than 4.0. Until you see the module labelled SID 6.7.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The simulation timer stops at: 17 hours, 52 minutes, 11 seconds. A clock reads: 3:04:32 PM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four observers, two men and two women, watch virtual reality monitors positioned around the station. One of the men wears an L. A. P. D. uniform. His name is WILLIAM COX, 40S. His nameplate reads CHIEF OF POLICE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the women sits by herself in front of a monitor. Intently following the action on screen. Studying it clinically. Her name is DR. MADISON CARTER, late 30s.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is beautiful, and charming, but those qualities take a back seat to her intelligence. She is one of the country's foremost authorities on criminal psychology. Her concerns are empirical. Her quest is knowledge. She has little in common with the other observers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other man is FREDERICK WALLACE, 5Os, Chairman/CEO of LETAC. Expensive suit. Commanding, powerful. But not as commanding, or powerful, as ELIZABETH DEANE, 605, the Presidentially—appointed Crime Czars
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elizabeth Deane is solely responsible for the funds allocated to LETAC. As well as which prototypes will move on to production.

LAB ASSISTANTS remove the polyurethane skull caps from the two unconscious bodies. The acupuncture needles remain in the caps. You can now see the faces of the participants:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker and John.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker lies calmly, his eyes fluttering as he gradually returns to consciousness. He looks very different than his virtual rendering:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His hair is long and ragged. His face is unshaven. A scar across his cheek. A hoop earring in one ear. His outfit a filthy prison uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John's outfit matches Parker's. Physically, he looks as clean—cut as his virtual rendering. Except that he is convulsing. Violently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His flailing appendages repeatedly hit the apparatus around him. Like an epileptic having a grand mal seizure. It's ugly. Frightening.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
(barely conscious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SOMEBODY.. .DO SOMETHING!

</PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
TWO PARAMEDICS burst through the doors and rush to John. The paramedics inject him. Fibrillate him. Repeatedly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The simulator's designer, DARYL LINDENMEYER, 40s, high— strung, intense, and brilliant beyond words, stands by the equipment protectively. He is far more concerned for the safety of his machines than he is for John's life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John's body goes limp. His vital signs flat. The Paramedics record the time of death and cover the body with a sheet. They begin to assemble a gurney to wheel him out.

After giving Wallace a cold, hard stare -- namely at his hand stitched lapel, his gold watch, and his diamond-studded cufflinks, she exits. Wallace follows after her quickly. You now notice that the chair Dr. Madison Carter had occupied is now empty. She left a while ago.

Cox remains. Lindenmeyer hurriedly examines the simulator as if it were his child. There are several scratches, but no major damage. He looks relieved.

Lindenmeyer watches with satisfaction as the guards put Parker in handcuffs and leg chains.

INTERIOR FOLSOM COUNTY MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker is led into the Inmate Receiving Room at gunpoint. He is ordered to remove his clothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands completely naked, arms held out to the sides, as he is strip searched. Every portion of the body in which someone could hide something is closely inspected.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without being graphic, we watch the de—humanizing procedure. He opens his mouth as wide as possible. Pulls his earlobes foreword to reveal behind them. Then bends over, hands on the floor in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is scanned with a metal detector. So is his clothing, which is then returned to him.

INTERIOR THE PRISON CAFETERIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker eats at a table with a dozen other inmates. The food is unrecognizable. The air thick with humidity and cigarette smoke. Nobody is talking. Just staring. At Parker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker forces down the remainder of his meal, then returns his utensils to a bin. And heads to the bathroom. All eyes following Parker's every move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other inmates then turn their attentions to a man of incredible size following Parker. 6' 6", 255 lbs. His face covered with red scar tissue from burns suffered long ago. This is BIG RED. He follows Parker into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR THE BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graffiti covers the walls. Red uses a stained urinal, then turns to the stalls. A pair of prison—issue shoes and socks are visible beneath one of them.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time to hurt...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
Red kicks in the door to the stall. Revealing a pair of shoes and socks stuffed with a prison shirt. Red hears something behind him. And turns around slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker stands barefooted and shirtless. SCARS are visible around each arm just below the elbow. You will learn what these represent momentarily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker is six inches shorter and 60 pounds lighter than Red. But the punch Parker delivers to Red's face makes you think it's the other way around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
You HEAR the sound of metal crushing bone. Red is thrown backwards into the stall. Blood splatters from his mouth, adding another shade of redness to his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Red's teeth stick out of Parker's fist. Parker pulls out the teeth. He does not bleed. Nor seem in pain. Metal is visible beneath the surface of his skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For the first time, you notice SMALL TATTOOS on the outsides of his palms. They read: WENTLOW MODEL 17-L, and 17-R, followed by serial numbers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Red charges Parker wildly. Parker dodges him like a matador does a bull. Then brings his fists down savagely on the back of Red's head. His skull CRACKS. Red drops to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker jumps on top of him, arms around his neck. Choking him. Red staggers to his feet. His eyes wide. His face now even redder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker maintains his mechanical grip. Red finally succumbs to the lack of oxygen. He drops to his knees. Parker does not relent until he feels the barrel of a gun at the back of his head.

There are also various shapes and sizes of robots, androids, and other synthetic forms. The most human—looking ones are the least functional. The least human—looking ones, the most functional.

You follow a remote—controlled, box—shaped robotic sentry moving swiftly through an obstacle course resembling a subway station. It is being operated by CLYDE REILLY, 20s, a hardware genius who has spent too much time in windowless rooms.

Hidden from Reilly's view, Lindenmeyer, the software expert who created Sid 6.7, stares jealously through a narrow gap in a partition. Trying to contain his anger. And failing. Especially as...

He kneels in a corner, working intensely on another image. Completely lost in concentration. His hands, his clothing, covered in paint. He almost appears to be part of the art work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The work is intricate. It clearly takes Parker a very long time. Which gives him something to do during the nights he is unable to sleep. Which is most of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is so absorbed in his task that he seems oblivious to the constant taunts ECHOING throughout the cell block. Threats of the ugliest, most vile kind. The kind Parker has had to live with every night for the last five years.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pausing to admire his work, Parker finally hears the taunts.

His face becoming a mixture of frustration, guilt, and anger.

Parker immediately resumes painting.

It's close to 4:00 AM.

There is no liquid left in the incubator -- it's all been absorbed. All that is visible is the silhouette of a human form crouched within steam. The form stands.

The human form inside incubator opens the hatch. Steam pours out from within its confines as it climbs out slowly.

Reilly approaches the figure with the expectancy of a father about to see his newborn child for the first time. Lindenmeyer hangs back.

Lindenmeyer is nowhere to be seen. The office door is unlocked, and open. Watching Sid 6.7's expression, you realize something isn't quite right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His expression is exaggerated. Artificial. Only for a moment, but it's enough to remind you Sid 6.7 is not human.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The billions of nano—mechanisms which make up his anatomy are still learning to function in a fully-coordinated fashion. Sid 6.7 is, literally, getting used to his new skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In various ways throughout his "life" —— be it a wandering eye, or a momentary limp —- you will be reminded that Sid 6.7 is a synthetic nano—organism unlike anyone has ever seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A surgical knife by the aquarium catches Sid 6.7's attention. Picking up the knife, he runs his finger across the razor— sharp knife blade. Cutting himself slightly. A drop of blood appears. Sid 6.7 tastes his (synthetic) blood.

ON THE TV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Dodger game is in progress. A pop fly is caught by the center fielder. The runner at third tags and heads for home. The play at the plate is close. The umpire calls the runner out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera pans to the MASSIVE SCREEN over left field to show the instant replay. Reactions of fans around the stadium are shown in CLOSE—UP. The fans also respond to seeing themselves on the massive screen.

<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR THE ELECTRONICS STORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid 6.7 watches the TV intently, completely ignoring the horrified customers circling around him because of the dead Skinhead at his feet. A SALESMAN, who'd been demonstrating a videocamera, tapes Sid 6.7 from behind a customer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SALESMAN'S POV -- HANDHELD VIDEO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Sid 6.7 realizes he's being videotaped, his entire face seems to light up. Playing directly to the camera, he clearly loves being in the spotlight. The attention. The focus. It's suddenly as if he's had years of training. He is completely at ease. And simply captivating.

A bullet rips through Sid 6.7's side. Blood begins to seep from the wound. But then immediately begins to retract. Once his blood has returned, his skin heals over the wound. Leaving a scar. Which also then disappears.

Other than the hole in his shirt, Sid 6.7 is as good as new. He never even misses a step as he disappears around the corner.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A guy in Dodger baseball cap and jacket. Walking calmly away from the stadium. He descends down an escalator into a recently-built subway station. It is Sid 6.7.

PARKER

charges after him. A heat—seeking missile locked on target.

She does the best she can to follow after him. People knock into Parker as hard as he does them. A human version of bumper cars.

Reaching the entrance to the subway, Parker leaps down the escalator three steps at a time. Madison remains in his wake.
</DIRECTION>

INTERIOR THE SUBWAY STATION

</MADISON>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Both.

He races down the tunnel to the north/south trains. Madison heads down the other. Her determination beginning to win out over her inexperience.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hesitates at the escalator leading to the south-bound side of the tracks. Further down the tunnel is the escalator to the north—bound trains. Parker chooses the escalator closest to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE SOUTH-BOUND PLATFORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Passengers pass the time by watching a television mounted above them. Except for Parker, who scans the crowd. Then across the tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE NORTH-BOUND PLATFORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the entire crowd, there is only one person not watching the TV screen. He is watching Parker. Through his gun sight. Sid 6.7 pulls the trigger. BOOM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE SOUTH-BOUND PLATFORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker dives to the ground, just avoiding the bullet. He scrambles behind a pillar for protection. Only to see the guy standing behind him wasn't as lucky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE EAST-BOUND PLATFORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Madison hears the gunshot ECHO through the station. Which scares the already-terrified fans trying to get away from Dodger Stadium. Chaos is rapidly becoming Pandemonium.

Passengers rush in every direction. Some are screaming. Some are crying. Nobody knows who fired the shot. Or where to go. But everyone is going somewhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Including Sid 6.7, who makes his way through the flurry of movement toward the up escalator. It is difficult to keep sight of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARKER

The rest of the passengers hit the deck, except for a COLLEGE STUDENT listening to music on headphones. He is riding the escalator up. Sid 6.7 stands behind him, using the student as a shield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARKER' S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Sid 6.7 ascends, slight portions of his body are momentarily exposed behind the student as he sways with the music coming from his headphones. Parker does NOT have a clean shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In 10 seconds, Sid 6.7 will disappear from view completely and Parker will have no shot at all. A momentary sliver of Sid 6.7 becomes visible. An inch-and-a-half at most.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
doesn't hesitate. He lines up his shot and pulls the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE NORTH-BOUND UP ESCALATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The college student standing in front of Sid 6.7 gets winged in the shoulder. Not a serious wound, but a painful one just the same.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bullet must have hit bone, because it deflected upon impact, missing Sid 6.7 entirely.
</DIRECTION>

The student drops to the escalator, screaming in pain. Sid 6.7 crouches beside him.

The top of Sid 6.7's head is exposed an inch, maybe two.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
fires again. Repeatedly. Moving closer and closer to the edge of the platform, trying to get a better angle while he still has a shot.

Parker moves to the very edge of the platform. His arm extended out over it. Completely oblivious to

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MADISON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leaps off the descending escalator on the south—bound side and rushes to Parker.
</DIRECTION>

She pulls Parker back just before the train reaches him. Had his arm still been raised, Parker would have lost his arm a second time.

30 minutes later. The chaos outside Dodger Stadium has subsided. Madison and two PARAMEDICS lead the bandaged College Student to an ambulance.

Parker doesn't respond. All around them, a cacophony of news broadcasts is heard. From passing cars. From boom boxes. From portable TVs. Over and over, you hear what Sid 6.7 had said while killing the woman in Dodger Stadium:

	</DIALOGUE>
</COX>
<DIRECTION>
Sid 6.7 turns his head in surprise toward Cox as a rifle is FIRED in the distance. Cox steps directly in the sniper's line-of-fire and takes the bullet meant for Parker through the chest. Cox drops to the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NOOOOOO!

Parker ignores them. He bolts across the street, moving in the same direction as the bus below. Through speeding traffic.

Bullets fly. Parker keeps charging. Right in front of a moving van barreling across the bridge. The cops lose sight of Parker.

The garbage truck passes beneath Parker as he leaps from the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TOP OF THE GARBAGE TRUCK

Parker lands on the back of the truck. Right next the opening and-closing steel jaws of the truck's massive trash compactor. His gun tumbles from his hand, falling to the street.

Sid 6.7 dives on top of Parker, putting him flat on his stomach. And his face against the steel teeth. Sid 6.7 chokes Parker. Hard.

Madison walks calmly behind them. Scanning the crowd. Looking for Lindenmeyer. Her every instinct telling her he's here. He must be.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She spots him. Veering from the direction the cops headed in, Madison casually wades into the crowd. She takes out her

Parker and Sid 6.7 continue battling next to the compactor's lethal jaws. The machine makes an awful, grinding sound. Not unlike the sounds Parker and Sid 6.7 are making. The fight is primal. Savage. And moving at 30 miles-per-hour.

</PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
He should concentrate more on fighting, and less on asking questions, because he's losing. Parker takes a wicked shot to the face, and then the groin. Sid 6.7 holds Parker's head between the compactor's jaws. Which are closing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With every last ounce of effort he has, Parker hurls his legs up into Sid 6.7. Which throws Sid 6.7 into the compactor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The steel jaws immediately close in on Sid 6.7, who frantically tries to climb out. He gets his hands out. Then his head. But that's about it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without emphasizing graphic detail, Sid 6.7 is decapitated. His lifeless body drops back into the compactor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His head tumbles to the street. The force of the impact causes the Sid 6.7 character module to separate from the neural net.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The character module scatters into the street. Parker immediately jumps off the truck after it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker's landing isn't pretty. Finally getting to his feet, he sees the Sid 6.7 character module is about to be run over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker dives for it, nearly getting run over himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The approaching car SCREECHES to a halt next to him. It's driven by Lindenmeyer. At gunpoint. Madison sits behind him, her gun to his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM! The car behind them obviously wasn't prepared to stop so quickly. The bumpers of the two cars are now intertwined. Neither vehicle will be going anywhere soon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Madison pulls Lindenmeyer roughly out of the car. She drags him to Parker, who is still on his knees, clutching the Sid 6.7 character module. SIRENS approach in the distance.

Parker lies unconscious on a bed. He is connected to the simulator via the neural connectors in the polyurethane skull cap, just like he was before.

<CUT_TO>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR THE SHOPPING MALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is a seven—story mecca of shopping. An atrium allows you to look from the ground floor up to the seventh. Sid 6.7 rushes up the escalators. Going up to the second floor. Then the third.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker follows suit climbing escalator after escalator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Throwing people out of his way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE SEVENTH FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
which is also the highest, Sid 6.7 veers out of view. Parker races up the final steps to the seventh floor. Sid 6.7 is nowhere to be seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker searches methodically. Efficiently. He finally spots Sid 6.7. Who has Parker's head lined-up perfectly in his gun sight. Parker is a sitting duck. BOOM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker dives behind AFFLUENT SHOPPER 2.1, who takes a bullet in his ascot. Parker quickly grabs him, and uses his body as a shield against Sid 6.7's constant gunfire until Parker arrives behind a marble column.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We really aren't that different, are we?

What he cannot see is that behind the column, Affluent Shopper 2.1 is Auto Resetting. Parker puts his gun to the shopper's head.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move, and don't make a sound. Got it?

Affluent Shopper 2.1 nods his head repeatedly. Parker collects himself behind the column, then pivots out from behind it. Firing in Sid 6.7's direction. Each bullet finds its mark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Absorbing the blows, Sid 6.7 backs up against the atrium railing. Taking one final shot, he falls backward. Over the railing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Sid 6.7 tumbles through the atrium. Out of control.

Speeding toward the ground seven floors below.

<DIRECTION>
The sense of momentum is exhilarating. And terrifying. If you get dizzy easily, close your eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM THE FIRST FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid 6.7 falls through the atrium like a rock directly at you. A 200 pound rock. WHAM!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lands face down in the marble floor. The impact is bone— crushing. Sid 6.7 does not move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until he begins to regenerate. His fluids begin returning to his body. His bones regaining proper form. Within seconds, his body appears as good as new.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(Technically, because this is VR1 the proper term would be Auto. Reset. But since Sid 6.7 thinks he's in the real world, regenerating is what he thinks he's doing.)

Sid 6.7 stands, dusting himself off.

As Lindenmeyer moves to Parker, Madison stays right with him. Her gun aimed at Lindenmeyer's head. Lindenmeyer carefully removes one of the neural connectors from Parker's skull cap. Before removing another, he looks for a safe place to put the connector.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Which now leaves Parker a clean shot at Sid 6.7's head. BOOM! BOOM! Two hits. Two head wounds. Sid 6.7 falls behind a truck, losing his weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before Sid 6.7's wounds have finished regenerating, Parker is already on top of him.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
(neighborly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, old buddy, old pal, good to see you again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
He empties his clip into Sid 6.7, then discards the gun. As Sid 6.7's wounds heal themselves, Parker pounds him mercilessly.
</DIRECTION>
<SID_6_7>
<DIRECTION>
(losing it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You...ruined...I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID_6_7>
<DIRECTION>
Trading blows, he manages to get to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARKER>
<SID_6_7>
<DIRECTION>
(exploding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID_6_7>
<DIRECTION>
He knocks Parker back with a good shot to the face, then disappears around a van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker continues the hunt. Quietly. Carefully. Tension grows in the silence that follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He carefully makes his way around a truck. Only to see Sid 6.7 swinging a two-by-four directly at his head. WHAM!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker is knocked on his ass. Daze4. Blood streams down his cheek. He staggers to his feet, blocking another blow with his arm. Which SNAPS the wood in two.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker grabs one of the boards. He battles with Sid 6.7.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fight between Parker and Sid 6.7 is intense. Exhausting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parker gives it everything he has.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Madison appears behind Parker, holding his gun. She wavers, having trouble keeping her balance. She has even more trouble aiming her weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<MADISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Parker...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADISON>
<DIRECTION>
She moves around, trying to get a clean shot at Sid 6.7. Which she does not have.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's your pulse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARKER>
<MADISON>
<DIRECTION>
(totally focused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't tell you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADISON>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then shoot him already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARKER>
<MADISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Duck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADISON>
<DIRECTION>
Without hesitation, Parker hits the deck. Leaving Sid 6.7 completely exposed. Madison steadies her sight.
</DIRECTION>
<SID_6_7>
<DIRECTION>
(to Madison)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You couldn't hit the side of a...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID_6_7>
<DIRECTION>
As he raises his two—by—four high over Parker's head, Madison pulls the trigger smoothly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN SLOW MOTION, you follow the bullet as it exits the barrel of her gun. And penetrates Sid 6.7's skull between the eyes and exits out the back of his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid 6.7 collapses on the ground next to Parker.
</DIRECTION>
<MADISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do we do now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADISON>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't want to watch. Turn around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
She does so. Parker reaches OUT OF FRAME to remove the Sid 6.7 character module from within his skull. Then reveals the character module in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MADISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What should we do with it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADISON>
<DIRECTION>
Glancing in the flatbed of a truck, Parker gets an idea, and knocks on the driver's window. As the DRIVER rolls down his window, classic ROCK & ROLL MUSIC can be heard from inside.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mind if I borrow a couple of your tools for a second?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARKER>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be my guest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Parker removes two sledgehammers from the back of the truck. He offers one to Madison.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Care to join me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
Madison gladly accepts takes the sledgehammer. Parker drops the Sid 6.7 character module onto the pavement. And together, they start pounding the shit out of it. WHAM! WHAM! In perfect time with the music. Which the driver cranks even louder. As we ROLL CREDITS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
