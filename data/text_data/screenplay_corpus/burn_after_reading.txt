High in the air----so high we an see the curvature of the earth. The eastern seaboard stretches away, flecked with clouds.

As we dissolve in closer the picture bleaches of color. We are looking down at the city of Washington, D.C.

Dissolve closer still: a black-and-white aerial photograph of a neighborhood in suburban D.C. dominated by a sprawling building. Computer type quickly bleeps on:

Behind him we see the apartment door opening. Katie, an attractive middle-aged woman, enters, taking her key out of the door, but stops, surprised to see Osbourne.

The thought, such as it was, peters out. Osbourne rises and wanders around the room, glassy-eyed.

He suddenly stops, head cocked, listening.

Faintly, a ringing phone.

<DIRECTION>
INT. COX BASEMENT STAIRWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the cut Osbourne is thundering down a steep carpeted stairway. He inclines his head to clear the ceiling that juts over the bottom half of the stairwell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The phone is louder here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COX BASEMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A semi-finished basement with cheap paneling and a low dropped ceiling of water-stained Johnson-Armstrong tile. The ringing phone is on a cheap government-surplus desk. The answering machine, with Osbourne's voice, picks up:
</DIRECTION>
<MACHINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have reached The Cox Group...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACHINE>
<DIRECTION>
Osbourne, robe flapping, shuffles hurriedly in his slippered feet toward the phone.

<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are looking over Osbourne's shoulder----he is still in his robe----as he sits hunched on an ottoman, looking at a daytime game show.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few beats of the show.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roaring laughter from the studio audience. Mild chuckle from Osbourne in the foreground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT LIVING ROOM - DAY - STILL LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ticking clock. Osbourne paces with the microcassette recorder. He raises it with a thought, draws a breath, and then stops, and looks off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ticking grandfather clock: ornate hands on an ornate clock face Two or three minutes to five.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Osbourne stares for a long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COX KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OSBOURNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shoulders twisting as we hear ice clattering out of a tray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pours coke sizzling onto the ice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses for a long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a bottle of rum out of a cabinet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pours some into a hatch-marked shot glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at it. The amber liquid tops the hatch mark. He conscientiously pours the overage back, murmuring:
</DIRECTION>
<OSBOURNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Single...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBOURNE>
<DIRECTION>
He dumps the shot into the Coke.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAILBOAT - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As before, the boat, docked at the end of the marina pier, is seen in long shot through the windshield of a car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Closer on the boat. As water laps against pilings and the boat gently bobs and creaks, we hear, muffled, the sounds of a couple having sex. When it builds to climax we cut:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAILBOAT - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Minutes later. We hold on a door for a quiet beat, then we hear the gurgle of water, and then the door opens. Harry Pfarrer emerges from the small bathroom, buckling his belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the bedroom which he emerges into Katie Cox is just finishing dressing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry looks at his watch.

	At Fenninger's. Reunion committee dinner. See you later.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POTOMAC BRIDGE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Long-lens, hand-held, point-of-view seeming: Harry Pfarrer is jogging in his Treasury sweats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Closer on him. Brow furrows. He spins, jogs backwards, looking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His point-of-view: nothing unusual; traffic on the bridge, no pedestrians particularly close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry, mildly puzzled, slows and stops. He turns again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Point-of-view up the bridge: empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry starts jogging again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COX BASEMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are tracking toward the desk in the corner, at which Katie sits. She cracks open a CD case and loads the CD into Osbourne's computer. A suspense drone builds as we track in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katie starts typing, then suddenly stops. She holds still, listening for noises in the house. Nothing. She resumes typing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear male voices beginning to swell in song. The voices continue after the suspense drone snaps off, at the cut to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FENNINGER'S - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

A musty steakhouse. On the walls are hunting-scene prints and steel engravings of English country houses.

A placard resting on a chair outside the Georgian Room: CLOSED FOR PRIVATE PARTY.

From inside the room, male voices:

</PATIENT>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well we can do liposuction there as well, but that area will respond to exercise. Buttocks and upper arms begin to store more fat when you get up around forty, the body just tells it to go there, but the thighs will respond to toning exercises.

	Uh-huh. I know, I can work out on my arms til the cows come home, but...

	Yeah, I don't want to get anything burned off.
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. YACHT - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
We are in the bedroom. The boat rides gently at anchor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry has an arm around Katie, in bed. Both stare at a point in space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat that is silent except for the faint sloshing of water against hull:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and then, you know, you grow up. I guess that's what's happened with me. You just... people change. We married when I was, what, in my mid- twenties. A kid. We were kids. Twenties. You think it's forever. Then, you know, you're older----you begin to feel your mortality, you start to think, well, there's no more time for dishonesty. Subterfuge. You go, I'm not that person. The choices you made, you can't, just through inertia----

</HARRY>
<KATIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm thinking of divorcing Ozzie.
	</DIALOGUE>

Harry doesn't react----a careful, studied non-reaction. After more sloshing:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I'm just thinking, Whoa. I mean, frankly, I'm thinking, Whoa. I, I, I guess that's what I should be thinking about too. With Sandy.

	That's what you were just saying.

	So if I were divorced----
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATIE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well yes, if you were uh, you know, yes. Yes, I should settle things. With Sandy. Because of you and me. It just takes, courage, you know. To inflict that pain. Scary stuff. Scary stuff. You're a brave lady. Well, of course, it would be easier for you.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of Hardbodies, stands with one hand on the back of his chair----which Chad occupies----and one hand on the desktop, looking over Chad's shoulder at a computer screen that Chad is scrolling down. Standing behind both men is a short Mexican Indian man, also in a Hardbodies uniform.

INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY

CLOSE ON A REAR-VIEW MIRROR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dark blue Ford Taurus, three or four car lengths back on a quiet Chevy Chase street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry Pfarrer glances at the rear view mirror. Behind him we see the steel pipe from Home Depot laying across the top of the back seat of the station wagon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHEVY CHASE HOUSE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Harry is just getting out of the wagon which is parked in the driveway of the suburban house.

INT. HOUSE - DAY

Harry is struggling through the front door with the length of pipe.

</SANDY>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, yeah, it's me.

He takes the pipe, opens the staircase door to the cellar, sets the pipe inside on the upper stair, and closes the door behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CELLAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry is at a workbench welding a length of trimmed pipe to a short piece of hardware clamped in a table vise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His home shop is in a caged-off section of the basement. There is also haphazard storage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One shelf holds stacked boxes labeled with magic marker: "Oliver in the Oval Office," "Yea and Nay for Oliver," "Point of Order, Oliver!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry loosens the vise and takes out the piece of hardware. He drops it, a small bearing-mounted clip, onto a length of pipe held horizontal in another vise. He experimentally slides the clip along the length of pipe: it slides smoothly back and forth, nicely balanced.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
The side-view mirror. It shows a man approaching on bicycle along the sidewalk wearing a suit and a bike helmet. The man dismounts several paces behind the parked car, locks his bike to a fence separating the sidewalk from a small park, and takes off his helmet. It is Chad.

<DIRECTION>
The overhead light is switched on.

<DIRECTION>
As Harry and Linda come down the stairs:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta tell ya----I saw an ad for this in a gentleman's magazine----twelve hundred bucks. I take a look at this thing, I think, Jesus, you gotta be kidding----I'm a hobbyist, this is basically nothing but speed-rail, I could probably go to Home Depot and whip this up myself for, like, a hundred bucks...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He sweeps the drop-cloth off his project.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It looks like a rowing machine, though with a higher seat. Its function is obscure.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(smug)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it. You siddown, feet in the stirrups, and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes the seat with his foot. It slides forward then back, forward and back, rocking. On its forward arc a dildo emerges from the center of the seat's pipe-track, angled toward the seat-bottom which is cleft to accommodate its entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat as the seat squeaks back and forth, the dildo rhythmically bobbing up and down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At length:
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Omygod!

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't that somethin'? Hundred bucks all-in if you don't count my labor. And the, you know----cost of the dildo. Those things are not cheap.

<DIRECTION>
THRU A WINDSHIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Night. Rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car corners into a driveway and its headlights rake the front of the Cox townhouse, which is dark. A couple of pieces of luggage and several cardboard boxes are stacked on the stoop, most of them protected from the rain by the eave but some not.
</DIRECTION>
<OSBOURNE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>

EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG LENS POINT-OF-VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car is pulling into the driveway. Katie Cox emerges from the driver's side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reverse shows Chad, in his suit, watching from a parked car across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Harry Pfarrer emerges from the passenger side wearing a brown pin-striped suit. Encumbered by something bulky he follows Katie up the walk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It seems to be some kind of pillow or cushion under his arm, but very large, and wedge-shaped. Katie is letting herself in; Harry gives a furtive glance around----as Chad sinks back in his car seat----before entering with the wedge-cushion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door closes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chad relaxes, straightens up. A beat. He looks idly around. He notices:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another car, parked on the same side of the street, further up. Someone is just straightening from a slouch to become visible over the driver's headrest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chad looks, puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR/EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chad is sucking the dregs of his Jamba Juice up a straw when a noise brings his look around:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the townhouse is opening. Katie emerges, in a change of clothes. Harry follows in sweats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They get into her car. It pulls out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chad watches it go up the street. He is about to open his door but pauses, seeing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The parked car up the street. Katie's car having passed, it now pulls out and follows at a discreet distance. Both cars disappear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chad opens his door and gets out. He is crossing to the townhouse when he notices another car parked on the other side of the street. A man sits in the driver's seat, smoking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chad proceeds on to the house. There is a barred garden- level door tucked under the stoop. Chad checks out the caging on the door. He looks up the façade of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KATIE'S CAR/EXT. POTOMAC BRIDGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It pulls over at one end of the Potomac bridge that we have seen before. Harry emerges.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the odometer say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<KATIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATIE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About five or approximately five? I mean----about f----
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<KATIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For fuck's sake, Harry, it's five miles. Five point two.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATIE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, fine----I gotta do at least five. Five and a deuce is okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<KATIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm surprised you have any energy left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATIE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You kiddin'----pull around the corner we'll do it again in back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<KATIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are very coarse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATIE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, back of the car. I didn't mean a rear-entry, uh----
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<KATIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ach. I'm late----
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATIE>
<DIRECTION>
The car squeals away, leaving Harry on the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chad is cornering the house on the driveway side, appraising. A low wall separates driveway from back garden. Chad gives a quick glance around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BACK GARDEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chad vaults the wall to land in the garden.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The garden steps down to a back door. Chad checks out the windows in back, then goes to the door. It is locked. It has a large window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BACK WINDOW - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can see Chad's form outside the door. Its pane is tapped once... twice... it breaks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POTOMAC BRIDGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY JOGGING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spins, jogs backward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His point-of-view: a car, traveling slowly. Following?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry cuts across a park lawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOWNHOUSE BASEMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chad is nosing around the basement. He notices Ozzie's office set-up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET NEAR PARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emerging from the park onto another street. He looks around and, satisfied that he has lost the tail, jogs on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chad is looking at the screen of Ozzie's computer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He fishes a CD out of his suit pocket, feeds it into the computer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jogging, entering a residential area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chad is emerging from the basement. He is looking idly around, heading toward the front door when a shape materializes in its frosted glass sidelight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chad freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is scraping at the lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chad quickly mounts the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chad freezes, listening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The downstairs door swings open, shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Footsteps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tread on the stairs: Chad scurries into the first open door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chad hotfoots into a closet and eases its door most of the way shut. The footsteps mount the stairs. Chad peeks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His POV: The bed, bedclothes rumpled. In the middle of the bed, a wedge-cushion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beyond, the open bedroom door shows a slice of hallway and stairs. Harry arrives at the top of the stairs. He nudges back a drape on the window at the top of the steps. He looks down one way, then the other. He lets the drape fall back and seems to relax.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry enters the bedroom. He strips off his shirt and steps out of his pants on his way into the bathroom off the master bedroom. He leaves the door open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chad reaches gingerly for the closet door to close it but stops abruptly as we hear the shower turned off and the curtain whipped back. Harry emerges from the shower. He rinses off, humming "Born Free," and walks into the foreground pulling on shorts and shirt and a pair of dress pants that was draped across a bureau.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chad shrinks back into the closet as Harry approaches. Harry stops, just outside the cracked door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the crack we see only the white of his shirt. Abruptly Harry turns his back to us and recedes into the room and bends to pick something off the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chad leans in ever so slightly to see, but draws back again as Harry approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chad looks over to his right: on a hanger, the brown pinstripe coat that matches Harry's pants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The closet door is thrown open.
</DIRECTION>
<CHAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nuhhh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAD>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	AHHHHHHHHHH!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry jerks up the gun which he's pulled from the shoulder holster in his other hand and----BAM----shoots Chad in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gun bucks. Unused to the recoil and still screaming, Harry staggers back and trips over the edge of the bed and drops the weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crabs briefly backward and then flips over and scrambles off on all fours. In the hallway he rises and tramples down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BOTTOM OF STAIRS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops at the bottom of the steps, panting. He looks back up the steps, trying to control his heavy breathing so that he can listen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long silence.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
No answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry enters. He opens a drawer, closes it, opens another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry enters from the kitchen and starts slowly mounting the stairs, a chopping knife in one hand.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry tops the stairs. He pauses, looking at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bedroom door, ajar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, his gun lies on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry takes cautious steps toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses at the cracked door. Suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hungh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He plunges through the door and runs for the gun and scoops it, dropping the knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands and spins, panting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His point-of-view: the closet. Its door ajar. Legs protrude into the room as if Chad, hidden within, is sitting with his back against the closet wall contemplating his next move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry walks cautiously over. With a bare foot he experimentally waggles one of Chad's feet. Limp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry nudges the door.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He leans back in, trying not to look, but for some reason feeling obliged to return the wallet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he opens the suit coat to slip it back in the inside pocket he notices:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The suit label has been cut away. He fingers the raveled fringe.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>

INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - DOOR/PALMER'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>

We are low, outside an office door. The shoes enter frame and the door is swung inward, away from us, to show Palmer DeBakey Smith seated behind his desk.

He looks up.

Harry Pfarrer stands at the kitchen counter chopping carrots. He is intensely focused and chops very, very quickly, producing slices in high volume.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reverse shows Katie Cox in a chair in the living room, frozen in a look up, a file of papers forgotten in one hand as she gazes over half-glasses at Harry. His chopping continues unabated.

The chopping stops.

Katie, unused to backtalk from Harry, is stunned. She returns in a manner as hard as his:
</DIRECTION>
<KATIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry: stop the foolishness.

</KATIE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Harry glares at her, vibrating with rage. Her look at him is equally hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry abruptly turns and stomps up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brief tromping on the second floor. Katie sits in puzzled suspense.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Footfalls descend the staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry reappears at the foot of the stairs with his wedge- cushion tucked under an arm. He flings the front door open, goes out, slams it shut.

EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE/INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY

Harry stomps to his car in the driveway and flings in the cushion. He gets in, seething. After a beat he pulls out his cell phone and dials.

A ring. Pick-up. A female voice:

He folds the phone, miserable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he pockets it his attention is caught by something in the side-view mirror:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car parked across the street. A man's shape in the driver's seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOWNHOUSE - DAY

Harry, jaw set, gets out of the car and starts down the drive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The parked car starts.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Fucker!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
The car tries to pull out but is closely hemmed in by cars front and back; it will need a couple moves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry runs back to his own car, starts it, throws it into reverse and backs straight down the drive toward the frantically shuttling car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He t-bones it.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_FROM_WITHIN_CAR>

</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He again throws the car into reverse.

The man in the other car abandons his attempt to pull out and scrambles frantically toward the passenger side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry again smashes into the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET ACROSS FROM TOWNHOUSE - DAY

The other man emerges from the far side. He flees down the sidewalk as fast as his weight will permit, pocket change jingling, yelling as he runs:

Pounding footsteps.

The overweight man does not have Harry's stamina: Harry closes, leaps, and tackles.

He crawls up the man's body, hand-over-hand, panting:

Harry is blindsided. He stares. He slowly sits up, digesting:

The freed Tuchman Marsh man also sits up, still panting heavily.

Harry rises and walks stiffly, zombie-like, up the street. The man watches him go.
</DIRECTION>

After a few paces Harry stops and sits on the curb. He starts weeping.

The man, still breathing heavily, calls out:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. Sorry to call out of the blue but I have a, well, a publishing question and I thought you might be the person to ask, I have this manuscript, something to do with my professional experiences, not to go into too much detail but I think it's pretty explosive stuff and I think that it could merit a fairly wide readership handled properly and it isn't quite finished yet but there's a situation where I'm worried about it leaking now and maybe excerpts being published or on the internet, whatever, without my permission, and a lot of the impact being, um, blunted, so I'm actually anxious to bring it to market sooner than I'd planned----I mean, like now, in fact----so I was thinking, I know you, and you seem to do well, so I was wondering if you were happy with your publisher. The people you use.

<DIRECTION>
Then, quietly:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>

Now Linda stares, unsure of what to make of the question.

	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
Harry stares at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leaps to his feet and looks around in a panic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His point-of-view, sweeping the park. Nearby, the man with plugs, though talking with his date, is looking at him again. Farther away, a man sits in a curbside sedan. Watching? Hard to say.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry turns and runs. Linda gapes.

INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Osbourne sets the packing box heavily down on a bureau in the upstairs bedroom. The box is a third loaded up with liquor bottles. It also holds a mixed drink which Osbourne now takes out. The ice cubes clink as he sips, poking through things in the bureau.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One drawer holds scarves and accessories and a large case. He opens the case and starts dumping jewelry from it into the cardboard box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<OSBOURNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ow! Fuck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBOURNE>
<DIRECTION>
He yanks his hand back and shakes it. He looks at the ball of his thumb. He sucks it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He carefully picks a brooch out of the jewelry case and flings it across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He resumes dumping jewelry into his box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He suddenly stops:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A faint knock. The front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Osbourne waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The knock repeats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front door creaks open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Osbourne carefully sets down his drink. He steps quietly to the closet and pulls a small cedar chest off a high shelf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WASHINGTON MALL/INT. LINDA'S CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda flings open the door to her car parked on the street bordering the mall. She gets in and turns the ignition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulling into traffic she checks her rear-view, and her look snags on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dark four-door sedan pulling out a few cars back. It falls in behind her. Its driver is a man in sunglasses. He reaches up and touches fingertips to one ear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda frowns. She looks forward, glances again at the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another dark car pulls into the lane next to the first. Its driver is also a man in sunglasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Downstairs, Osbourne rounds the corner from entryway to living room, a handgun at the ready. His drink is in his other hand. Ice cubes clink as he moves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The living room is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Osbourne advances cautiously. A quick sidelong look at the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He proceeds to the basement door.

The light ahead turns yellow, red.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cars ahead stop. Linda stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rhythmic thudding sound. It almost makes her car vibrate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around. She rolls down her window, sticks her head out, looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A black helicopter hovers overhead, rotors thudding. A black- clad body leans partway out. The person seems to be looking down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda draws her head back in.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh for Pete's sake.

INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BASEMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Osbourne is slowly descending the stairs, gun and drink in either hand, gun up, ice cubes clinking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The basement comes slowly into view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone stands behind his desk, at the computer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Osbourne descends further. He stops on the bottom step and stares at Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of Hardbodies. Ted stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long silence between the two men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, quietly:
</DIRECTION>
