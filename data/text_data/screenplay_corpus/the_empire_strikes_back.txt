A Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe robots from its underside.

One of these probes zooms toward the planet Hoth and lands on its ice- covered surface. An explosion marks the point of impact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOTH - METEORITE CRATER - SNOW PLAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>

A weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind. A strange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the smoke-shrouded crater. The ominous mechanical probe floats across the snow plain and disappears into the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope. The bundled rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a Tauntaun. Curving plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged beast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop. Pulling off his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker notices something in the sky. He takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a comlink transmitter. His Tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him.

Luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard. He pats the beast on the head to calm it.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind. He hears a monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-foot-tall shape towering over him. It is a Wampa Ice Creature, lunging at him ferociously.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaargh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Luke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a huge white claw. He falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified screams of the Tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck being broken.

The Wampa Ice Creature grabs Luke by one ankle and drags him away across the frozen plain.

Rebel troopers rush about unloading supplies and otherwise securing their new base. The rider, Han Solo, swings off his lizard and pulls off his goggles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks into the main hangar deck toward the Millennium Falcon, which is parked among several fighters. Mechanics, R2 units, and various other droids hurry about. Han stops at the Millennium Falcon where his Wookiee copilot, Chewbacca, is welding on a central lifter. Chewie stops his work and lifts his face shield, growling an irritated greeting to his boss.
</DIRECTION>

Princess Leia, standing at a console nearby, is dressed in a short white combat jacket and pants. Her hair is braided across her head in a Nordic fashion. She overhears their conversation and seems somewhat distressed.

The jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of a Hoth day. Luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy stalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor. One side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood. He opens his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the gorge walls. Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and futilely tries to unfasten the throngs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exhausted, he drops back into his hanging position. As he hangs there, he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about three feet out of reach.
</DIRECTION>

He focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he squeezes his eyes tight in concentration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as the ice creature looms over Luke, the lightsaber jumps into Luke's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts himself loose from the ice. He flops to the snow in a heap. The startled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes blinking. Luke scrambles to his feet. He swings his lightsaber and the beast screams in pain.

</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
The sliding door closes behind the indignant Threepio as Chewie and he move back to the hold. Suddenly, the ship lurches again, throwing Leia across the cabin into Han's arms. Then, abruptly, the motion stops as suddenly as it started. With some surprise, Han and Leia realize they are in each other's arms.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>

Leia flushes, averting her eyes. She's not exactly fighting to get free. But, of course, Han blows it...
</DIRECTION>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get excited.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAN>
<DIRECTION>
The anger rises in Leia.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited.

</LEIA>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else.
	</DIALOGUE>

Han grins quickly wickedly at Leia as he turns and exits through the door. Leia's confused emotions show clearly on her lovely face.

EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG CLEARING - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mist has dispersed a bit, but it is still a very gloomy-looking swamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke pulls an equipment box from the shore to the clearing. He ignites a little fusion furnace and warms his hands before it. Taking a power cable, he plugs it into Artoo's noselike socket.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go.

The droid whistles his appreciation. Luke then opens a container of processed food and sits before the thermal heater.

Nervously, he looks around at the foreboding jungle.

<STRANGE_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feel like what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Luke jumps out of his skin. Artoo screeches in terror. The young warrior grabs for his lightsaber as he spins around, looking for the speaker. Mysteriously standing right in front of Luke is a strange, bluish creature, not more than two feet tall. The wizened little thing is dressed in rags. It motions toward Luke's sword.
</DIRECTION>

After some hesitation, Luke puts away his weapon, although he really doesn't understand why. Artoo watches with interest.

</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
With the aid of a walking stick, the tiny stranger moves over to one of the cases of supplies. He begins to rummage around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo moves to the edge of the case - standing almost eye level to the creature who is carelessly handling the supplies - and squeaks his disapproval.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their tiny visitor pick up the container of food Luke was eating from and takes a bite.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put that down. Hey! That's my dinner!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
The creature spits out the bite he has taken. He makes a face.
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How you get so big, eating food of this kind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
He flips the container in Luke's direction and reaches into one of Luke's supply cases.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aww, cannot get your ship out?

</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
The creature spots something of interest in Luke's case. Luke loses patience and grabs the case away. The creature retains his prize - a tiny power lamp - and examines it with delight.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh... you're making a mess. Hey, give me that!

(retreating with the lamp)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mine! Or I will help you not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
Clutching its treasure, the creature backs away from Luke, drawing closer to Artoo. As Luke and the creature argue, one of Artoo's little arms slowly moves out toward the power lamp, completely unnoticed by the creature.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>

Artoo grabs hold of the lamp and the two little figures are immediately engaged in a tug-of-war over it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo beeps a few angry, "Give me thats."

<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, ah, ah!

The creature lets go with one hand and pokes Artoo lightly with one finger. Artoo reacts with a startled squeal, and lets go.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Find your friend, hmm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda.

</CREATURE>
<LUKE>

(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
With that, the creature scurries out of the clearing, laughing merrily. Luke stares after him. All he sees is the faint light from the small power lamp moving through the fog. Luke makes his decision and starts after the creature.
</DIRECTION>

Artoo, very upset, whistles a blue streak of protest.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo.

Artoo beeps even more frantically. But as Luke disappears from view, the worried little droid grows quieter, and utters a soft electronic sigh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN HOLD AREA

Threepio whistles and beeps a strange dialect into the control panel in front of him. The control panel whistles back a few mystifying beeps.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, where is Artoo when I need him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Han enters the hold area and kneels on the floor near the control box.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, of course I'll have to replace it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAN>
<DIRECTION>
He hands a wire coil up to Chewie who is working near the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here! And Chewie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAN>
<DIRECTION>
Chewie brings his head back through the trap door in the ceiling and whines. Han glances back at Threepio, then speaks quietly to Chewie so only he can hear.
</DIRECTION>
<HAN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Leia finishes welding the valves she has been working on and attempts to reengage the system by pulling a lever attached to the valve. It doesn't budge. Han notices her struggle, and moves to help her. She rebuffs him.
</DIRECTION>
<HAN>

	Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.

</HAN>
<LEIA>
<DIRECTION>
(still struggling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you please stop calling me that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>

Han hears a new tone in her voice. He watches her pull on the lever.
</DIRECTION>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, Leia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAN>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes.

</LEIA>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though.

(he watches her reaction)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAN>
<DIRECTION>
She lets go of the lever and rubs her sore hand.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Occasionally...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a little smile, haltingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.

<HAN>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAN>
<DIRECTION>
With that, Han takes her hand and starts to massage it.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAN>
<DIRECTION>
Leia is flushes, confused.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop that! My hands are dirty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?

</HAN>
<LEIA>
<DIRECTION>
(looking right into his eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Afraid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>
<DIRECTION>
Han looks at her with a piercing look. He's never looked more handsome, more dashing, more confident. He reaches out slowly and takes Leia's hand again from where it is resting on a console. He draws it toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're trembling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAN>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not trembling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>
<DIRECTION>
Then with an irresistible combination of physical strength and emotional power, the space pirate begins to draw Leia toward him... very slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAN>
<DIRECTION>
Leia is now very close to Han and as she speaks, her voice becomes an excited whisper, a tone completely in opposition to her words.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I happen to like nice men.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a nice man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAN>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you're not. You're...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her now, with slow, hot lips. He takes his time, as though he had forever, bending her body backward. She has never been kissed like this before, and it almost makes her faint. When he stops, she regains her breath and tries to work up some indignation, but finds it hard to talk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Threepio appears in the doorway, speaking excitedly.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Han turns slowly, icily, from their embrace.
</DIRECTION>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Thank you very much.

</HAN>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.

The moment spoiled, Han marches out after Threepio.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Asteroids collide, creating a fireworks display outside the bridge window. Darth Vader stands, staring out the window above the control deck. Then slowly turns toward the bridge. Before him are the hologram images of twenty battleship commanders. One of these images, the commander of a ship that has just exploded, is fading away quickly. Another image, in the center and a little apart from the others, is faded and continually disrupted by static. It is the image of Captain Needa, commander of the Star Destroyer most hotly on the tail of the Millennium Falcon. Admiral Piett and an aide stand behind the Dark Lord.
</DIRECTION>
<NEEDA>
<DIRECTION>
(in hologram)
</DIRECTION>

	No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found.

The Dark Lord, Darth Vader, is alone in his chamber. A strange sound enters the room and a light begins to play across Vader's black figure. He looks up and bows quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A twelve-foot hologram of the Galactic Emperor materializes before Vader. The Emperor's dark robes and monk's hood are reminiscent of the cloak worn by Ben Kenobi. His voice is even deeper and more frightening than Vader's.

EXT. DAGOBAH - CREATURE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A heavy downpour of rain pounds through the gnarled trees. A strange baroque mud house sits on a moss-covered knoll on the edge of a small lagoon. The small, gnomish structure radiates a warm glow from its thick glass windows. As rain tap-dances a merry tune on Artoo's head, the stubby little droid rises up on his tip-toes to peek into one of the glowing portals.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CREATURE'S HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo, peeking in the window, sees the inside of the house - a very plain, but cozy dwelling. Everything is in the same small scale as the creature. The only thing out of place in the miniature room is Luke, whose height makes the four-foot ceiling seem even lower. He sits cross-legged on the floor of the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature is in an adjoining area - his little kitchen - cooking up an incredible meal. The stove is a steaming hodgepodge of pots and pans. The wizened little host scurries about chopping this, shredding that, and showering everything with exotic herbs and spices. He rushes back and forth putting platters on the table in front of Luke, who watches the creature impatiently.
</DIRECTION>

	Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now.

Luke's head spins in the direction the creature faces. But there is no one there. The boy is bewildered, but it gradually dawns on him that the little creature is Yoda, the Jedi Master, and that he is speaking with Ben.

	This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things.

Yoda turns his piercing gaze on Luke, as though the Jedi Master's huge eyes could somehow determine how much the boy had learned. After a long moment, the little Jedi turns toward where he alone sees Ben.

The cockpit is quiet and lit only by the indicator lights on the control panel. Princess Leia sits in the pilot's seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs her hand across the control panel as she thinks of Han and the confusion he has created within her. Suddenly, something outside the cockpit window catches her eye. The reflection of the panel lights obscures her vision until a soft suctionlike cup attaches itself to the windscreen. Leia moves closer to see what it might be. Large, yellow eyes flash open and stare back at her. Startled, she jumps back into her seat, her heart pounding. There is a scurry of feet and a loud screech, and in an instant the eyes are gone. The young princess catches her breath, jumps out of her chair, and races from the cockpit.

It is very dark inside the huge asteroid cave, too dark to see what is attacking the ship.

Leia stamps her foot on the floor of the cave.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all.

Han kneels and studies the ground, then attempts to study the outline of the cave.

Chewie barks through his face mask, and points toward the ship's cockpit. A five-foot-long shape can be seen moving across the top of the Falcon. The leathery creature lets out a screech as Han blasts it with a laser bolt.
</DIRECTION>
<HAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Leia)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

The black shape tumbles off the spaceship and onto the ground in front of the princess. Han bends down to investigate the dead creature.
</DIRECTION>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables.

</LEIA>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAN>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, a swarm of the ugly creatures swoops through the air. Leia puts her arms over her head to protect herself as she runs toward the ship. Chewie shoos another Mynock away with his blaster. Several of the batlike creatures flap their wings loudly against the cockpit window of the Falcon. Inside, Threepio shudders at their presence.

He unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side of the huge cave. The cavern begins to shake and the ground starts to buckle.

Chewie barks and moves for the ship, followed closely by Leia and Han. The large wings of the Mynocks flap past them as they protect their faces and run up the platform.

The Wookiee heads for the cockpit as Han, followed by Threepio, rushes to the hold area and checks the scopes on the control panel. Leia hurries after.

Suddenly, a row of jagged white stalagmites and stalactites can be seen surrounding the entrance. And as the Falcon moves forward, the entrance to the cave grows ever smaller. Han pulls hard on the throttle, sending his ship surging forward.

	Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger... fear... aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight.

Artoo beeps in the distance as Luke lets Yoda down to the ground. Breathing heavily, he takes his shirt from a nearby tree branch and pulls it on.
</DIRECTION>

He turns to see a huge, dead, black tree, its base surrounded by a few feet of water. Giant, twisted roots form a dark and sinister cave on one side. Luke stares at the tree, trembling.

Luke moves into the almost total darkness of the wet and slimy cave. The youth can barely make out the edge of the passage. Holding his lit saber before him, he sees a lizard crawling up the side of the cave and a snake wrapped around the branches of a tree. Luke draws a deep breath, then pushes deeper into the cave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The space widens around him, but he feels that rather than sees it. His sword casts the only light as he peers into the darkness. It is very quiet here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, a loud HISS! Darth Vader appears across the blackness, illuminated by his own just-ignited laser sword. Immediately, he charges Luke, saber held high. He is upon the youth in seconds, but Luke sidesteps perfectly and slashes at Vader with his sword.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vader is decapitated. His helmet-encased head flies from his shoulders as his body disappears into the darkness. The metallic banging of the helmet fills the cave as Vader's head spins and bounces, smashes on the floor, and finally stops. For an instant it rests on the floor, then it cracks vertically. The black helmet and breath mask fall away to reveal... Luke's head.

Across the space, the standing Luke gasps at the sight, wide-eyed in terror.

Within the quarters assigned her on Cloud City, Leia paces in agitation. She has changed from her cold-weather pants and jacket to a lovely dress. Her hair is down, tied back with ribbons. She moves from a large, open window and turns to see Han entering through the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<HAN>

Han takes Leia by the shoulders and gently kisses her forehead.

Not speaking, Han considers her words and gazes at her troubled face.

INT. CLOUD CITY - JUNK ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is piled high with broken and discarded machine parts. Four Ugnaughts, small hoglike creatures, separate the junk and throw some pieces onto a conveyer belt which moves briskly toward a pit of molten metal. Pieces of Threepio's golden body move down the belt. Chewie enters the room and spots an Ugnaught picking up and inspecting Threepio's head. The Wookiee barks a command, startling the Ugnaught, then reaches to grab the head. But the Ugnaught tosses it away from him to another Ugnaught. This game of keep-away goes on until Threepio's head falls from their grip and bounces with a clang onto the ground.
</DIRECTION>

INT. CLOUD CITY - LIVING QUARTERS - DAY

The door zaps open. Chewbacca walks in, carrying a packing case of Threepio, arms and legs hanging over the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>
<DIRECTION>
Chewie sets the case on a table, grunting and groaning an explanation.

<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him?

Leia walks between Han and Lando as Chewie follows a short distance behind. Long shafts of light pour across the corridor between tall, pure-white columns.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're part of the mining guild then?

<LANDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed... which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.

</LANDO>
<DIRECTION>
The group walks into another corridor and heads for a huge doorway at the far end.

<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAN>

<DIRECTION>
The mighty doors to the dining room slide open and the group enters the dining room. At the far end of a huge banquet table sits Darth Vader. Standing at his side and slightly behind him is Boba Fett, the bounty hunter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faster than the wink of an eye, Han draws his blaster and pops off a couple of shots directly at Vader. The Dark Lord quickly raises his hand, deflecting the bolts into one of the side walls, where they explode harmlessly. Just as quickly, Han's weapon zips into Vader's hand. The evil presence calmly places the gun on the table in front of him.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chewbacca is in a Cloud City prison cell. The stark room is flooded with hot light. To add to Chewie's misery, a high-pitched whistle screeches loudly. Chewie is going mad. He hits the wall with giant fists as he paces back and forth across the cell floor. The upper lights go off abruptly. The prisoner rubs his eyes and moves to a wall, where he listens for a moment. Then, moaning to himself, he moves to a platform where the disassembled pieces of Threepio lie. He picks up the golden droid's head and meditates on it for a moment, barking a few philosophical remarks. Chewie sticks the robot's head on its torso and starts adjusting wires and circuits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the lights in Threepio's eyes spark to life as Chewie touches two connectors together. Threepio immediately begins to speak, but his voice is so slow and so low as to be nearly unintelligible.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no... Please don't get up. No!

Chewie looks at Threepio in bewilderment, then scratches his furry head. He gets an idea and adjusts some connections, whereupon Threepio immediately begins speaking normally.

Darth Vader strides through the room as two stormtroopers prepare an elaborate torture mechanism. Han is strapped to a rack which tilts forward onto the torture device. Vader activates the mechanism, creating two bursts of sparks, one of which strikes Han's face.

The door opens, and Vader leaves the torture room just as Han screams a sharp, piercing cry of agony. Darth Vader moves to the holding chamber, where Lando and Boba Fett await him.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELL

Chewie now has a little more of Threepio back together. One arm is connected, but the legs are yet to be attached. There is one small problem, however. It seems the Wookiee has managed to put the droid's head on backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Threepio is cut off in mid-sentence as Chewie angrily deactivates a circuit and the droid shuts down. The Wookiee smells something and sits up. The door to the chamber slides open and a ragged Han Solo is shoved into the room by two stormtroopers. Barking his concern, the huge Wookiee gives Han a big hug. Han is very pale, with dark circles under his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel terrible.

Chewie helps Han to a platform and then turns as the door slides open revealing Leia. She, too, looks a little worse for wear. The troopers push her into the cell, and the door slides closed. She moves to Han, who is lying on the platform, and kneels next to him, gently stroking his head.

Han hauls off and punches Lando. The two friends are instantly engaged in a frantic close-quarters fight. The guards hit Han with their rifle butts and he flies across the room. Chewie growls and starts for the guards. They point their laser weapons at the giant Wookiee, but Lando stops them.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a great activity on the carbon-freezing platform. Six Ugnaughts frantically prepare the chamber for use. A special coffinlike container is put in place. With Boba Fett in the lead, a squad of six stormtroopers brings in Han, Leia and Chewie. Strapped to Chewie's back, with only his head, torso, and one arm assembled, is Threepio. Threepio's head faces the opposite direction from Chewie's and the droid is constantly twisting around in a vain effort to see what is happening. His one attached arm is animate and expressive, intermittently pointing, gesturing, and covering his eyes. The remaining pieces of his body are randomly bundled to the Wookiee's back so that his legs and other arm stick out at odd angles from the pack.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>

From the instant of Chewie's first move, Threepio begins to scream in panic while he tries to protect himself with his one arm.

Han winks at the Wookiee, who wails a doleful farewell.

In a flash the guards have slipped binders on Chewbacca, who is too distraught to protest. Han turns to Princess Leia. They look sorrowfully at one another, then Han moves toward her and gives her a final, passionate kiss.

Tears roll down Leia's face as she watches the dashing pirate walk to the hydraulic platform. Han looks one final time at his friends - and then, suddenly, the platform drops. Chewie howls. Leia turns away in agony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lando winces in sorrow; it makes a life-changing impression on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly, fiery liquid begins to pour down in a shower of sparks and fluid as great as any steel furnace. Holding Leia, Chewie half-turns away from the sight, giving Threepio a view of the procedure.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What... what's going on? Turn round, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh... they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is.

Chewie is in no mood for technical discussion; he gives the droid an angry glance and bark.

A huge mechanical tong lifts the steaming metal-encased space pirate out of the vat and stands him on the platform. Some Ugnaughts rush over and push the block over onto the platform. They slide the coffinlike structure to the block and lift the metal block, placing it inside. They then attach an electronic box onto the structure and step away. Lando kneels and adjusts some knobs, measuring the heat. He shakes his head in relief.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boba Fett enters from a side hallway followed by two guards pushing the floating, encased body of Han Solo. Two stormtroopers, who follow, immediately spot Luke and open fire on him. The youth draws his weapon and blasts the two troopers before they can get off a second shot. The two guards whisk Han into another hallway as Fett lowers his arm and fires a deadly laser at Luke, which explodes to one side and tears up a huge chunk of wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke rushes to a side hallway, but by the time he reaches it, Fett, Han, and the guards are gone. A think metal door blocks the passage. Luke turns to see Leia, Chewie, Threepio, and Lando being herded down a second hallway by several other stormtroopers. Leia turns just in time to see Luke.

A laser bolt explodes near the princess. Everyone turns to see what Threepio has already spotted coming from the other direction; a squad of stormtroopers running toward them. Artoo peeks out from the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leia and Chewbacca start firing at the troopers as Lando makes a break for the elevator. Laser bolts continue to explode around the princess and the Wookiee, but they refuse to budge. Lando sticks his head out of the elevator and motions for the pair to run, but they barely notice. They seem possessed, transported, as all the frustration of captivity and anger of loss pour through their death-dealing weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But after a few moments, they begin to move through the rain of laser fire toward the elevator. Once they are inside, the door slams shut and the stormtroopers race forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke and Vader are locked in combat on the platform overlooking the chamber. Their swords clash, the platform sways. Luke aggressively drives Vader back, forcing Vader to use defensive tactics.
</DIRECTION>
<VADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have learned much, young one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADER>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll find I'm full of surprises.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Vader makes two quick moves, hooking Luke's sword out of his hand and sending it flying. Another lightning move at Luke's feet forces the youth to jump back to protect himself. Losing his balance, Luke rolls down the stairs to the circular carbon-freezing platform. There he sprawls on the floor, surprised and shaken. Just in time he looks up to see Vader, like a giant black bird, flying right at him. Luke rolls away as Vader lands. Crouching, Luke keeps his gaze steadily on his enemy.
</DIRECTION>
<VADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Behind Luke the hydraulic elevator cover has opened noiselessly. All the while, Luke slowly, cautiously moves back, away from the Dark Lord.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Vader attacks so forcefully that Luke loses his balance and falls back into the opening. There is a rumble, and in an instant freezing steam rises to obscure Vader's vision. Vader turns aside and deactivates his sword.
</DIRECTION>
<VADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADER>
<DIRECTION>
Through the steam behind Vader something blurs upward. Liquid metal begins to pour into the pit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vader turns around - and then looks up. He sees Luke, who has leaped fifteen feet straight up and who now hangs from some hoses on the carbonite outlet.
</DIRECTION>
<VADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Impressive... most impressive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADER>
<DIRECTION>
Luke jumps down to the platform where he is separated from Vader by the steaming carbonite pit. He raises his hand. His sword, which had fallen on another part of the platform, swiftly jumps into his outstretched hand and is instantly ignited. Vader immediately lights his sword as well.
</DIRECTION>
<VADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear... now release your anger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADER>
<DIRECTION>
Luke is more cautious, controlling his anger. He begins to retreat as Vader goads him on. As Luke takes a defensive position, he realizes he has been foolhardy. A quick sword exchange and Luke forces Vader back. Another exchange and Vader retreats. Luke presses forward.
</DIRECTION>
<VADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only your hatred can destroy me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADER>
<DIRECTION>
Breathing hard, Luke jumps in the air, turning a somersault over Vader. He lands on the floor and slashes at Vader as the room continues to fill up with steam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vader retreats before Luke's skillful sword. Vader blocks the sword, but looses his balance and falls into the outer rim of pipes. The energy Luke has used to stop Vader has brought him to the point of collapse. Luke moves to the edge and looks down, but sees no sign of Vader. He then deactivates his sword, hooks it on his belt, and lowers himself into the pit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLOUD CITY - TUNNEL AND REACTOR CONTROL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving through a tunnellike entrance, Luke cautiously approaches the reactor room. He ignites his sword and moves into the room and toward a large window as Vader enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke raises his sword and moves forward to attack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind Luke a large piece of machinery detaches itself from the wall and comes smashing forward toward his back. Luke turns and cuts it in half just as another machine comes hurtling at him. Using the Force, Luke manages to deflect it and send it flying as if it had hit an invisible shield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large pipe detaches and comes flying at Luke. He deflects it. Sparking wires pull out of the wall and begin to whip at the youth. Small tools and equipment come flying at him. Bombardment from all sides, Luke does his best to deflect everything, but soon he is bloodied and bruised. Finally, one machine glances off his and goes flying out the large window. A fierce wind blows into the room, unmoving, stands the dark, rocklike figure of Vader.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A piece of machinery hits Luke and he is knocked out of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR LEADING TO LANDING PLATFORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leia, Lando, Chewie and the droids come round a corner and head for the door to the landing platform. They glimpse the Millennium Falcon for a moment before the door slams shut. The group ducks into an alcove as stormtroopers arrive at the end of the corridor. The troopers send a rain of laser bolts at the group. Chewie returns their fire as Lando punches desperately at the door's control panel.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDO>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo takes off a computer cover and sticks his computer arm into the socket. Suddenly, a short beep turns into a wild scream. Artoo's circuits light up, his head spins wildly, and smoke begins to seep out underneath him. Quickly, Chewie pulls him away.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDO>
<DIRECTION>
Lando, Leia, Artoo, and Chewie flee down the corridor. As he scoots along with them, Artoo sends some angry beeps Threepio's way.
</DIRECTION>

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

<DIRECTION>
In a panic, Cloud City residents are trying to get out of the city. Some carry boxes, others packages. They run, then change direction. Some are shooting at stormtroopers, others simply try to hide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Other stormtroopers pursue Lando, Leia, and Chewie who are firing back at them. Artoo works on another door to the landing platform while Threepio berates him for his seeming ineptitude.
</DIRECTION>

	What are you talking about? We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump.

They race for the Millennium Falcon as a battalion of stormtroopers reaches the main door. Lando and Leia hold off the troops as the droids get on board with Chewie. As Chewie bounds to the ship the Threepio on his back, Threepio hits his head on the top of the ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt. Bend down, you thoughtless... Ow!

INT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke moves along the railing and up to the control room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vader lunges at him and Luke immediately raises his lit sword to meet Vader's. Sparks fly as they duel, Vader gradually forcing Luke backward toward the gantry.
</DIRECTION>
<VADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADER>
<DIRECTION>
Luke answers by rolling sideways and thrusting his sword at Vader so viciously that he nicks Vader on the shoulder. The black armor sparks and smokes and Vader seems to be hurt, but immediately recovers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke backs off along the narrow end of the gantry as Vader comes at him, slashing at the young Jedi with his sword. Luke makes a quick move around the instrument complex attached to the end of the gantry. Vader's sword comes slashing down, cutting the complex loose; it begins to fall, then is caught by the rising wind and blown upward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke glances at the instrument complex floating away. At that instant, Vader's sword comes down across Luke's right forearm, cutting off his hand and sending his sword flying. In great pain, Luke squeezes his forearm under his left armpit and moves back along the gantry to its extreme end. Vader follows. The wind subsides. Luke holds on. There is nowhere else to go.
</DIRECTION>
<VADER>
	<DIALOGUE>

</VADER>
<DIRECTION>
Vader puts away his sword and holds his hand out to Luke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A calm comes over Luke, and he makes a decision. In the next instant he steps off the gantry platform into space. The Dark Lord looks over the platform and sees Luke falling far below. The wind begins to blow at Vader's cape and the torrent finally forces him back, away from the edge. The wind soon fades and the wounded Jedi begins to drop fast, unable to grab onto anything to break his fall.
