EXT. CARNIVAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A loudspeaker playing Percy Sledge's "When a Man Loves a Woman," as we see a carnival in the distance - with a Ferris Wheel turning round and round.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A black man is by a stall. On his arm is an Irish girl with blond hair. The black man is drunk, and is tossing rings around a bowling pin.
</DIRECTION>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's cricket, hon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JODY>
<DIRECTION>
An attendant hands him the teddy bear. It looks ridiculous in his huge hands. He gives it to the girl.
</DIRECTION>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JODY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't matter if you don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JODY>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his arm around her and drags her on.
</DIRECTION>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jody won't be offended. Jody's never offended. What'd you say your name was?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JODY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jude. Suits you, Jude.

</JODY>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The teddy bear?

</JUDE>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JODY>
<DIRECTION>
He comes to a small canvas tent with a sign on it - TOILET.
</DIRECTION>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotta piss, Jude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JODY>
<DIRECTION>
He holds her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't run off, Jude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JODY>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know me, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Jody walks inside the canvas flap and vanishes from sight. We can still see his hand, holding Jude's. She leans against the canvas, looking bored.
</DIRECTION>
<JODY>
<DIRECTION>
(inside)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if I did?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JODY>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd know I wouldn't run off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
She stands there, listening to the sound of him urinate. Her eyes flick around the carnival. They settle on a tall dark- haired man in a dark jacket. He nods.
</DIRECTION>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JODY>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you know what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JODY>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me, Jody
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
He staggers out, buttoning up.
</DIRECTION>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JODY>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to kiss her. She turns her head away.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who gives a fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JODY>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>

She pulls him over toward the water.
</DIRECTION>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never know nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JODY>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People. They could be looking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Jody follows her, as she walks backward, drawing him on. He moves his hips to a song as Jude leads him over the beach, under a train trestle.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come and get me, soldier --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever you say, Jude...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JODY>
<DIRECTION>
He sinks down on his knees toward her. She wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him. Jody writhes on top of her, fumbling with his belt. Jude cocks one eye upward. A shadow falls across them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON JODY, kissing her. A gun is put to his head. He turns around, drunkenly.
</DIRECTION>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JODY>
<DIRECTION>
The gun whacks him across the cheek and he falls sideways.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jude scrambles to her feet and darts like an animal through a field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jody feels his cheek. He can see her blond head vanishing among the fields. He looks up and sees a group of men around him. The tallest of them, Fergus, cocks the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mini, driving down a country road. Two men in the front, three in the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the floor of the car Jody lies, with three pairs of feet on top of him, a black bag over his head and the barrel of a gun dangling close to his face. Fergus holds the gun. He is smoking a cigarette. His movements are slow and somewhat innocent.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's your name, soldier?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jody pulled through and tied to a chair. Maguire, a small lean man, talks to him through the hood.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGUIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The situation is simple. You're being held hostage by the Irish Republican Army. They've got one of our senior members under interrogation in Castleraigh. We've informed them that if they don't release him within three days, you'll be shot. You'll be treated as our guest until further developments. Have you anything to say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGUIRE>
<DIRECTION>
Jody is motionless under the black hood.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give him a cup of tea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<MAGUIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want a cup of tea?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGUIRE>
<DIRECTION>
He still says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the men are drinking tea. The blond woman comes in with a plate and some food on it.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See does he want some.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want some food?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Jody sits as still as a grave, saying nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Late at night -- it is dark. The men are sleeping. Fergus is sitting by a chair, gun in his hand, watching the prisoner. Jude comes in, with a flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey -- what's he like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Horny bastard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you give him it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a look at him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on. Have a heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
She moves over to him. She prods him in the legs with her foot. He doesn't move. Then she lifts the hood ever so slightly, to peer inside. Suddenly the man moves like lightning, jerking his head down so the hood comes off, throwing his body, tied to the chair, over Jude.
</DIRECTION>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fucking bitch -- you fucking whore --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JODY>
<DIRECTION>
He pins her to the ground, his body bent with the chair. He writhes on top of her in a grotesque parody of love. She is screaming and the room is alive, each man awake, grabbing guns, screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGUIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn the fucking thing off --

She rubs her hand on his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, it was a breeze. Just thought of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
She sidles closer, coming on to him.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you know what, Fergus? One of you made me want it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
She puts her lips to his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't answer. They embrace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING.

<DIRECTION>
A hot summer's day. There are tall hedges all around the house. Fergus leads Jody, still bound and hooded, over toward a greenhouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dusty tomato plants and vines everywhere. Broken glass. The sun pouring through. Fergus leads Jody over to a wrought iron chair and sits him in it. He sits opposite, gun on his lap. Fergus takes some sandwiches out of a brown paper bag. He holds one out toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eat something, would you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't.

	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't eat through a canvas bag.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JODY>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus walks over to him, lifts the hood up so his mouth is revealed, and pushes the sandwich toward his lips. Jody eats, slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a farce, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JODY>
<FERGUS>

Fergus pushes the last crumbs of the sandwich toward Jody's mouth.

Jude comes into view.

Jude pours out the tea.

	Scorpion wants to cross a river, but he can't swim. Goes to the frog, who can, and asks for a ride. Frog says, "If I give you a ride on my back, you'll go and sting me." Scorpion replies, "It would not be in my interest to sting you since as I'll be on your back we both would drown." Frog thinks about this logic for a while and accepts the deal. Takes the scorpion on his back. Braves the waters. Halfway over feels a burning spear in his side and realizes the scorpion has stung him after all. And as they both sink beneath the waves the frog cries out, "Why did you sting me, Mr. Scorpion, for now we both will drown?" Scorpion replies, "I can't help it, it's in my nature."

Fergus takes his place in the chair beside Jody.

<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't even smoke, you know that? It just seemed the right thing to do.
	</DIALOGUE>

Fergus pulls the hood off. Jody looks around him. He has a cut lip where Jude struck him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus prods him on with the gun. Jody stumbles forward. Fergus is all cold and businesslike.
</DIRECTION>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus?

</JODY>
<FERGUS>

</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>

	JODY!!!

Fergus aims, then changes his mind and runs.

</JODY>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus gains on him -- stretches his arm out -- but Jody sprints ahead again -- as if he has been playing with him. He laughs in exhilaration. Fergus pants behind him, wheezing, almost laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Fergie -- you can do it -- a bit more wind --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JODY>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus grabs his shoulder and Jody shrugs it off, gaining on him again.
</DIRECTION>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bit of fun, Fergus, eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JODY>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly the trees give way. Jody turns, laughing, to Fergus.
</DIRECTION>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Told you I was fast --

<DIRECTION>
Fergus is panting, pointing the gun at Jody
</DIRECTION>
<JODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JODY>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly a Saracen tank whips around the corner, hits Jody with the full of its fender. His body flies in the air and bounces forward as another tank tries to grind to a halt and the huge wheels grind over him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus, screaming, "No-!" He almost moves forward, then sees soldiers spilling from the tank around the body. Fergus turns and runs.

INT. BUILDING SITE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE UP into an elegant, empty Georgian room, covered in clouds of dust. A figure among the clouds of dust, hacking at a wall with a sledgehammer. It is Fergus, dressed in laborer's overalls, covered in dust. He is knocking the bricks from an outer wall. He works furiously and relentlessly, like a machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the wall, with the hammer striking it. One brick falls away, then another. Daylight pours through the clouds of dust and the growing hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus's face, as he works.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hole. More bricks falling away. Through the clouds of dust and the streams of daylight we now see a patch of green.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus's face, working. His rhythm slows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hole. More bricks fall away. Then the hammer stops. The dust begins to clear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The jagged hole. The dust drifts across it, revealing a cricket pitch, with tiny sticklike figures running on the green.

Fergus, returning from work, crosses the street, and enters through a white door.

Fergus dressing. He puts on a cheap suit, like any country boy in a big city. He takes Jody's wallet from the trousers of his overalls. He flips it open, sees the picture of the soldier and Dil. He puts it in the pocket of his suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY

Fergus walking down a street looking for an address. Some distance down the street is a sign -- MILLIE'S UNISEX HAIR SALON.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She gestures toward a chair. Fergus sits down. She comes toward him and fiddles with his hair.

She pushes his head back into a basin behind him. She begins to knead his hair in hot water and shampoo.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice laugh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
Dil raises Fergus's head up, with his new-cut hair and holds a mirror up behind his head so he can see the back. He looks like a young London stockbroker. The hair salon around them is empty.

EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.

<DIRECTION>
Fergus emerges from the shop. He takes one last look through the window where Dil is taking off her smock, touching up her hair, etc. It is as if she has forgotten all about him. He walks off through the crowds and then ducks into a doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doorway of the shop. Dil comes out, dressed in a pair of high heels, a very short skirt, different, more raunchy clothes on her than we saw inside. She locks the glass door and walks down the street, across the road, and into a pub called the Metro. Fergus follows.

Fergus is about to talk when she pipes up.

The barman mixes it. She stares at the mirror, staring at Fergus, who is trying to avoid her eyes. The barman hands her the drink.

Fergus, standing across the road from the pub. He is sweating. Dil comes out of the pub. She looks this way and that, as if searching for Fergus. Fergus stands back into a shadow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dave, the burly man, comes out. He grabs her by the elbow. She shrugs him off. She walks off. Dave follows, grabs her by the elbow again. The sense of an old argument. Dave suddenly strikes her across the face with his open palm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leans her head against a wall. Dave then puts his arms around her, consoles her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT.

Fergus stands there, observing.

A light comes on in an upstairs room. Dil enters; we see her shadow in silhouette behind the curtain and the shadow of Dave coming in behind her. He begins to remove her blouse. She stands absolutely still as he does so.

</DIRECTION>
<DEVEROUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Pat's a cricket fan, eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEVEROUX>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus turns. We see Tristram Deveroux, a young Sloane type in a three-piece suit, whose house it is. Beside him is Franknum, the cockney foreman.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not Pat. It's Jim.

Fergus resumes work.

INT. METRO - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is now crowded with people, black, white, punky and street chic, a lot of leather All the women are heavily made-up. Someone is singing from the tiny stage and rows of cheap colored bulbs are flashing around it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the way Fergus walks through, it is obvious he has never been here at night. He seems most out of place in his cheap suit, making his way through the crowd to the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus looks through the odd crowd, but can't find Dil. Col, the barman, sees him and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<COL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So can we consider you a regular, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>

</FERGUS>
<COL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you get to say, The usual, Col. Things like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COL>

Col pushes a colored cocktail with one of those Japanese umbrellas toward him.

	So let's call this the usual.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>

Fergus reaches for his wallet to pay, but Col interrupts.
</DIRECTION>
<COL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. It's on me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COL>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus tries to pretend he's familiar with the drink, and by implication, whatever are the norms of the place. He lifts the glass to his mouth, but the umbrella keeps getting in the way.
</DIRECTION>
<COL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it out, if you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COL>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus takes out the umbrella. He holds it in one hand and drinks with the other.
</DIRECTION>
<COL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You came to see her, didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COL>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus shrugs. He takes out a cigarette. A guy in leather to his left smiles at him.
</DIRECTION>
<COL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something I should tell you. She's --

<FERGUS>

<DIRECTION>
THE JUKEBOX.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hand presses a button. The needle selects a disk. A song by Dave Berry, "The Crying Game."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus looks up. Close-up of Dil's hand, as music begins, making movements to the music. We see Dil, standing on a stage, swaying slightly. She seems a little drunk. She mimes to the song. She mouths the words so perfectly and the voice on the song is so feminine that there is no way of knowing who is doing the singing. She does all sorts of strange movements, as if she is drawing moonbeams with her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd seems to know this act. They cheer, whether out of approval or derision we can't be sure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dil singing, noticing him. She comes to the end of the song. The crowd cheers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus, watching her make her way through the crowded bar, toward him.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Fergus suddenly stands and makes his way to the door.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. PUB - NIGHT.

Fergus comes out. A black bouncer is there, but there is no sign of Dil. He walks a few yards and hears voices down an alley. He looks up it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P0V - ALLEY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Dil pushing Dave away. He grabs her, turns her roughly.

</DAVE>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DAVE>

	Got very fucking grand, haven't we --
	</DIALOGUE>

He tries to pull her back.

</FERGUS>
<DIL>

She bends low to Dave.

<DIL>

	He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cunt.

But his voice is softer. Fergus removes his foot. Dil grabs his arm.

She draws him away.

Dil leans close to Fergus.

She tilts up her face. Fergus kisses her, tenderly.

<DIL>

</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darling, you shouldn't have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She laughs and leans toward him and kisses him in a classically old-fashioned way. The girls inside the salon pull back a curtain, and they all clap.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>

	What's that about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>

</DIRECTION>
<DIL>

	Won't hurt you to come in.

Fergus enters slowly. He looks around the room; there is an exaggerated femininity about everything in it.

She goes into a small kitchen. Fergus looks at the mantelpiece and sees a picture of Jody. The camera tracks into the soldier's smiling face. Then into Fergus's face. His reverie is broken by the sound of a voice outside -- Dave's.

He nods toward the picture. She looks down into her drink.

</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
And they fall into one another's arms. She stretches up with her whole body over him. They grow suddenly and violently passionate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They fall into the cushions of the couch onto the floor. The photograph above them seems to smile. He draws up her dress with his hands. She suddenly pulls away.

<DIL>

</DIL>
<FERGUS>

</FERGUS>
<DIL>

</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the buttons on his shirt and her mouth travels down his chest. Fergus tries to draw her up toward him, but her hand reaches up to his mouth and presses his head back while her other hand undoes his pants. She kisses his stomach; her mouth moves down his body. Fergus stares at the picture of Jody. Jody's eyes seem to burn through him. Dil raises her head and kisses his mouth. There are tears in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would he think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>

Fergus gets up and stands behind her, gently pushes the hair from her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you can t stay, you know that?

</DIL>
<FERGUS>

INT. METRO - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Singer in a blue dress. Dil and Fergus by the bar. Both drinking drinks with umbrellas. Dave comes up behind them with his neck brace.

</DAVE>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck off, Dave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DAVE>

	No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus nods. He stands. Dave steps two feet back.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was only going to ask her for a dance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus takes Dil's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
The woman is singing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they circle, people begin to look at them admiringly. Dil holds her cheek close to his.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he come here too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this an obsession of yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe.

</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He did sometimes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he dance with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
Dil doesn't answer. Looks at him out of the corner of her eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want to look after you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does that mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something I heard someone say once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
She draws back and looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>

She dances closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
In the bar, people singing along with the music. Col sings. Dave sitting at the bar, sulking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not having me on, are you? 'Cause Dil can't stand that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
She puts her cheek against his. Dave, at the bar, slams his drink down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she does get very upset...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
Dave stands up to leave. On the stage the act finishes. Dil draws Fergus back to the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Col, the barman, pours her drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One for him, too.

Col pours and smiles.

</DIL>
<FERGUS>

</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm superstitious. Drink.

</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
He drinks. He grimaces. She throws it back in one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't leave me now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aha.

</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The thing is, can you go the distance?

</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Depends what it is.

</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, depends on nothing.

</DIL>

She takes the bottle herself and fills their glasses. She slams it back. He sips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In one.

</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She tilts his glass back. He swallows it in one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She enters; Fergus walks in slowly. He looks from the cricket whites that are hanging up behind a curtain to the photographs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you thinking of, hon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm thinking of your man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm wondering why you keep his things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Told you, I'm superstitious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She turns toward him and undoes her hair. It falls around her shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus runs his hand down her throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She draws him behind a curtain toward the bed, pulls him down. They kiss passionately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me one minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She walks into the bathroom. Fergus lies there, looking at the picture, listening to the sound of running water. She comes out then, dressed in a silk kimono. She looks extraordinarily beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches out his hand and grasps hers. He draws her toward him. He begins to kiss her face and neck.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would he have minded?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
She murmurs no. His hands slip the wrap down from her shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON HIS HANDS, traveling down her neck, in the darkness. Then the hands stop. The kimono falls to the floor gently, with a whisper. The camera travels with it, and we see, in a close-up, that she is a man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus sits there, frozen, staring at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did know, didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She gives a strange little laugh, then reaches out to touch him. Fergus smacks the hand away.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus. I feel sick --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and runs to the bathroom. She grabs his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't go, Jimmy --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
He kicks her away. He runs into the bathroom and vomits into the tub.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She crouches on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I thought you knew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
He retches again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What were you doing in the bar if you didn't know -- I'm bleeding...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She lights a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus runs the taps. He washes his face, rinses his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right, Jimmy. I can take it. Just not on the face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus slams the door shut. She is sitting on the couch, the kimono round her once more, looking very much like a woman. A trace of blood on her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y'see, I'm not a young thing any longer.... Funny the way things go. Don't you find that, Jimmy? Never the way you expected.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus comes out of the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up. Some hope in her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
And he makes to go. She grabs him to stop him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't go like that. Say something...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls away from her. She falls to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
He drags himself away and runs down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FERGUS'S FLAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus in bed. Flash to shot of blackness, Jody grinning in cricket whites, throwing the ball up and down in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. METRO - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is hopping. Fergus enters. He now sees it as he should have seen it the first night -- as a transvestite bar. He makes his way through the crowds. All the women too- heavily made-up. Some beautifully sleek young things he looks at he realizes are young men. He makes his way to the bar where Dil is sitting, nursing a drink with an umbrella in it. Her face is bruised. She is wearing dark glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he walks toward her she sees him in the mirror. She talks to Col the barman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's back, Col
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<COL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COL>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<COL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it, Dil --
	</DIALOGUE>
</COL>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Tell him to go fuck himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus sits. Col turns to him.
</DIRECTION>
<COL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
There is a tear running down her cheek, under the dark glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dil --

</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him it hurt --

</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to talk to her, Col --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<COL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Says he's got to talk to you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</COL>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus touches her arm.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Dil --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She whips her arm away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him again, Col. Go fuck himself --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She walks into the crowd, toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus, walking outside Dil's place. The blinds in her room are down and the light is on inside. We see her outline, pacing up and down behind the blinds, smoking a cigarette. We hear the song "The Crying Game."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus stands beneath her doorway, scribbles a note, and sticks it in the letter box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRICKET PITCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man removes a large number six from a huge scoreboard with a pole and replaces it with a number nine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below the scoreboard we can see Dil walking across a lawn toward the building where Fergus is working.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SITE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus, fitting a new window into the finished wall. On the pitch we see the cricketers, distorted through the moving glass of the window. Across the pitch Dil walks, with a lunch basket in her hand, dressed in a very short skirt with high heels. As she approaches the site a chorus of whistles breaks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus, hearing the whistling, stares out. He sees Dil moving toward the site. He drops the window and the glass shatters. As the whistles continue, we see Dil in the site's lift, which rises up. We see Deveroux and Franknum climbing up a ladder toward Fergus .
</DIRECTION>
<DEVEROUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEVEROUX>
<FRANKNUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKNUM>
<DEVEROUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEVEROUX>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DEVEROUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEVEROUX>
<FRANKNUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not in my experience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKNUM>
<DEVEROUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Off his wages.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEVEROUX>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mean that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DEVEROUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants to know do I mean that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEVEROUX>
<FRANKNUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKNUM>
<DEVEROUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bloody right I do...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEVEROUX>
<DIRECTION>
Through this conversation Fergus can hear the chorus of wolf whistles increasing. He looks out the gap where the window should be and sees Dil in the lift. The laborers whistle at her, looking up her skirt, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She passes by a gap in the wall and blows a kiss at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DEVEROUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEVEROUX>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's not a tart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DEVEROUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, of course not, she's a lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEVEROUX>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's not that either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus walks out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus walks round the scaffolding. Dil sees him and waves, sits on some bricks and opens the hamper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darling --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She is acting bright and businesslike, like any wife. She is wearing dark glasses to cover the bruise on her face. She pecks him on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't call me that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, darling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give it over, Dil --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apologies, my sweet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus smiles in spite of himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's more like it, dear. Have a cuppa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She takes out a thermos and pours him some tea.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're something else, Dil, you know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never said a truer word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him a neatly cut sandwich.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. And even when you were throwing up, I could tell you cared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you care, Jimmy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I care, Dil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
She lowers her head.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You crying, Dil?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
He removes her glasses and looks at her moist eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm tired and emotional.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
Then he hears a voice behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DEVEROUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it on your own time, Paddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEVEROUX>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DEVEROUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever it is she does for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEVEROUX>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus looks from Dil to Deveroux.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I was her I'd consider that an insult.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DEVEROUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Consider it how you like. Just get that bloody tart out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEVEROUX>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus stands up suddenly. He speaks quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you ever pick your teeth up with broken fingers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
Deveroux stares, suddenly chilled.
</DIRECTION>
<DEVEROUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that supposed to mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEVEROUX>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a simple question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
Deveroux says nothing. Fergus looks down to Dil.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, dear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
He holds out his arm. Dil gathers up her things and takes it. Her face is wreathed in a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't answer, honey --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus walks her down the scaffolding ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKNUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about that, Mr. Deveroux.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKNUM>
<DIRECTION>
Dil and Fergus descend from the site in the lift.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Made me feel all funny inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said stop it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think that's wise?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing's wise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
The lift stops with a thud.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean to hit you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kind of liked you as a girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a start.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make it up to me, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ask to meet me again.

	When?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whenever. Tonight.

</FERGUS>

She leans forward and kisses him. Fergus hears a wail of catcalls behind him. He watches Dil go as the lift takes him back up to the site.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus, outside the hair salon. Dil, inside, is throwing off her smock and walking toward him. All the girls are smiling. Fergus looks from Dil to the girls as they approach.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. HOSTEL - NIGHT.

Fergus walks into the room and turns on a small desk-light. Then he hears a voice.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, stranger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
He sees Jude sitting in the corner. Her hair is now dark brown.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You vanished.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at her, says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave me alone, Jude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie and Tinker died.

<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.

</FERGUS>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suits you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
She walks round the room.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aye, I was sick of being blond. Needed a tougher look, if you know what I mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
She lies down on the bed beside him, takes off a black leather glove, and puts her hand on his crotch.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck me, Fergus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes her hand away.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I to take it that's a no?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
He says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you did fuck up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</FERGUS>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you know what the thing is, Fergus?

</JUDE>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, what is the thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way, Jude. I'm out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're never out, Fergus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him hard. He looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you don't care whether you die or not. But consider the girl, Fergus. The wee black chick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
He leaps up from the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave her out of this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
She brings her lips close to his so they touch.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I must admit I'm curious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs her hair and pulls her head back.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck do you know, Jude?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls a gun and sticks it between his teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fucking tell me, boy --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus stares at her. Then says quietly:
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's nobody. She likes me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him briefly, with the gun at his temple.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep the faith.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
She goes. Fergus stands in the darkness.

Fergus freezes. He sees Jude looking at him, smiling brightly, then talking back to Dil

She smiles brightly at something behind Fergus. He turns and sees Jude is there. Fergus stands, suddenly.

He throws some money on the table, grabs her arm, and frog- marches her out.

<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A hotel?

</FERGUS>
<MAGUIRE>

He nods toward a car, a Daimler, parked some distance away. Fergus looks from the window to the car.

Fergus quickens his pace.

Jude, by the cafe, watches. Fergus, walking.

The gent makes his way, with gout-ridden slowness, across the pavement, through the passersby, toward the car.

A burly security man emerging from the car, walking toward the old gent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus reaches the car just before he does, and passes between him and the open door. The old gent's stomach brushes Fergus's elbow.
</DIRECTION>
<GENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon me, young man --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENT>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus walks on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jude, from the cafe, watches -- Fergus walking on, the old man being eased with painstaking care inside the Daimler. Then the door closing and the Daimler pulling off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the Daimler has passed Fergus, he turns around and walks back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jude smiles and leaps up as he approaches.

</FERGUS>
<JUDE>

</JUDE>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what if you don't?

</FERGUS>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</FERGUS>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some judge...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
She walks off, crosses the road to Maguire, in the car. Fergus turns around to see Dil in front of the cafe. She goes inside; he follows.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why'd you follow me, Dil?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was jealous, Jimmy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She downs a drink and motions for another. She seems high.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shouldn't be, Dil
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why shouldn't I be jealous?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
There are tears streaming down her face. He takes his hand and begins to wipe her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't. My makeup.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She sits down; he joins her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She own you, Jimmy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She from Scotland too?

</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could say that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you're not going to tell me more?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
He wipes the tears from her face with a tissue then dabs the tissue in her drink and wipes some more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you doing, Jimmy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure.

</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More than that.

</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
Dil's face, staring at him.

<FERGUS>

He sits her down in one of the chairs.

<FERGUS>

</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
Dil nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus takes up a scissors to snip at her hair. Her head leaps back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said anything, Dil
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A girl has to draw the line somewhere --

</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want to change you to a man, Dil...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a secret.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>

She takes a breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus begins to cut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP ON DlL'S FACE as her hair is shorn. Tears stream down her cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're no good at this, Jimmy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
But he keeps cutting. He gives Dil a short, cropped military cut like Jody's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to make me look like him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
She looks in the mirror at it in the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't recognize myself, Jimmy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dil enters, with her new haircut. She goes to turn on the light. He stops her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at her hand on his.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better in the dark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
Her fingers close around his.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it's true, then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like me better like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
She brings her lips to his neck. He lets them stay there. His hands travel up to her blouse. He begins to undo the buttons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Jimmy --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly the blouse slips down, exposing her male torso. She falls down to her knees and tugs at his belt.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No. Dil... get up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
He raises her to her feet and leads her toward the bed. She stretches languorously down on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He unzips her skirt slowly, and draws it off. She turns on the bed sexily, her face to the mattress. She is wearing suspender-belts underneath her skirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
But Fergus stands and walks quietly over to the wardrobe where the soldier's things are. Dil on the bed, slowly turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing, honey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
We see Fergus from her point of view, coming toward her with Jody's white cricket shirt, glowing eerily in the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't call me that --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. What you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus draws her slowly up to a standing position.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try this on, Dil
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
He wraps the shirt around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For me.

<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look on it like a honeymoon.

</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SMALL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From above, we see the figures of Fergus and Dil, sleeping on a double bed, both fully clothed. Fergus smokes, then puts out the cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Time lapse. The light gradually fills the room. Fergus wakes. Looks at the bedside clock, and very gingerly rises, puts on his coat, and walks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SITE - EVENING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car pulls up at the site. Jude gets out. She has a satchel in her hand.

Fergus looking down a ladder-staircase at Jude.

<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You a handyman, Fergie?

</JUDE>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sincerely hope so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus climbs down a ladder to Jude; she hands him something from the bag.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tools of the trade.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him. Fergus looks at her expressionlessly.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And forget about the girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus opens what Jude has given him -- looking inside. There is a gun wrapped in an oilcloth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SMALL HOTEL - NIGHT.

Fergus enters. The room is empty. He calls.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>

</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
No reply. He runs outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus looks up at her building, but the lights are off in her flat. The sound of feet behind him. He turns and sees Dil walking toward him, a bottle in her hand. He runs toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>

</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
They are tussling in the darkness of the park. She is very drunk.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had to go to work!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
He takes her arm.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on...

</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! I'm going home...

</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus and Dil, on the stairs up to Dil's flat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was trying to get out of something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Tell me everything, Jimmy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
And she suddenly faints into his arms. As if on cue.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it, would you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
There is no response. He shakes her.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give it over, Dil, for fuck's sake --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
Still no response. He grows alarmed. He slaps her cheek. She opens her eyes slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. I get nervous. I got this blood condition. Just help me inside, Jimmy, then I'll be all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks in holding her. Leans her against the wall, then goes to the window to check the street outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a large slug from a bottle of whiskey.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You heard what I said, Dil?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My pills...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She points weakly to a cabinet through the open door of the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What pills?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prescription. For my condition.

</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What condition?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My condition. Ennui.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
He goes and gets the pills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a handful of pills. She drinks from the whiskey bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you supposed to take that many?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only in times of extreme stress.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She walks around the room, drinking, then sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, they all say good-bye sometime. 'Cept for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at the picture of Jody. Then she looks at Fergus.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you all right, Dil?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will be.

She stares straight ahead, the bottle clutched in her hands between her knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>

	Go on, then.

Fergus walks slowly toward the door.

</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't go like that.

</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him, standing up. Something incredibly attractive about her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't help what I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
He walks slowly toward her. He kisses her, on the lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the photograph with the soldier's smiling face. Fergus looks from it to her. She seems to be in a sweet narcotic haze. She reaches out her hand and strokes his.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knew you had a heart...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
Fergus sits down on the bed. Dil is lying back on it.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.

</FERGUS>
<DIL>

</FERGUS>
<DIL>

</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She still strokes his hand. Her voice is dreamily slurred, her eyes far away.

<FERGUS>

	Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.

	In a manner of speaking.

</FERGUS>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
She is not rational. She is smiling, far away somewhere.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should scream. You should beat my head off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
She woozily tries to hit him round the face.

<DIL>

Dil raises an unsteady hand and points it at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bang...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<DIRECTION>
He strokes her cheek. She says very slowly and sleepily
</DIRECTION>
<DIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIL>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

Her eyes close. She falls into a deep sleep. Fergus looks down at her, almost fondly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DIL'S FLAT - MORNING.

They are lying on the bed together, fully clothed. Dil wakes. She rises very quietly and goes to his coat, thrown across a chair. She searches through the pockets and takes out the gun.

Jude in bed. An alarm sounds; she reaches to turn it off.

Dil takes several silk stockings out of a drawer and ties them very securely to each corner of the brass bed. She ties them round both of Fergus's feet, very gently, so as not to wake him.

Jude, in front of a mirror, getting ready.

</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>

	What the fuck --

	You was there, wasn't you? You used those tits and that ass to get him, didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIL>

	You won't let me, Jody --

She raises the gun and places it in her mouth. Fergus takes it gently from her mouth and places it on the table. He lifts her up by the shoulders.

</FERGUS>
<DIRECTION>
He leads her out the door. Fergus goes back into the room, past Jude's body. Looks out the window to where he can see Dil staggering down the street, through the crowds that have gathered. The wail of police sirens coming closer. He watches Dil run off, with her funny walk. Then looks down and sees the cop cars pushing through the knot of people around the house. He picks up the gun, wipes it with a rag to remove Dil's fingerprints. He turns to the picture of the soldier; talks to it.
</DIRECTION>
<FERGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>

<FERGUS>

	Well, there was this scorpion, you see. And he wants to go across the river. But he can't swim. So he goes to this frog, who can swim, and he says to him, "Excuse me, Mr. Froggy..."

CAMERA PULLS BACK, and as Fergus tells the story of the scorpion and the frog, the music comes up -- "Stand By Your Man."

FADE OUT.
