EXT. SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vast sea of stars severas as a backdrop for the Main Title, following by a rollup, whcih crawls into infinity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is unrest in the Galactic Senate Several hundred solar systems under the leadership of the rebel leader, Count Dooku, have decalred their intentions to secede from the Republic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This separatist movement has made it difficult for the limited number of Jedi Kights to maintain peace and order in the galaxy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Senator Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo, is returning to Coruscant to vote on the critical issue of creating an army to assist the overwhelmed Jedi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN UP to reveal the amber city planet of Coruscant. A yellow Naboo Fighter flies OVER CAMERA toward the planet, followed by a large Royal Cruiser and two more Fighters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - DAWN The ships skim across the surface of the city landscape. The sun glints off the chrome hulls of the sleek Naboo spacecraft as they navigate between the buildings of the capital planet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN Two Naboo Fighters land on one leaf of a three-leaf-clover landing platform. The Royal Starship lands on the central lead, and the third Fighter lands on the remaining plaform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small GROUP OF DIGNITARIES waits to welcome the Senator. One of the members of the group os a well dressed JAR JAR BINKS, a member of the Galactic Representative Commission, and DORME, Senator Amidala's handmaiden.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the FIGHTER PILOTS jumps from the wing of his ship and removes his helmet. He is CAPTAIN TYPHO, SENATOR AMIDALA'S Security Officer. He moves over to a WOMAN PILOT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAPTAIN TYPHO We made it. I guess I was wrong, there was no danger at all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ramp ;pwers. TWO NABOO GUARDS appear. SENATOR AMIDALA, ONE HANDMAIDEN (VERSE) and FOUR TROOPERS descend the ramp. AMIDALA is more beautiful now than she was ten years earlier when, as Queen, she was freeing her people from the yoke of the Trade Federation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DIGNITARIES start to move forward. SENATOR AMIDALA reaches the foot of the ramp, when suddenly there is a blinding FLASH and a huge EXPLOSION. The DIGNITARIES and PILOTS are hurled to the ground as the starship is destroyed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klaxons blare, alarms sound! CAPTAIN TYPHO and the TWO ESCORT PILOTS get up and run to where SENATOR AMIDALA lies dying. Beyond, ARTOO DETOO drops down from the Naboo Fighter and rolls toward the wreckage. The FEMALE ESCORT PILOT kneels by SENATOR AMIDALA and takes off her helmet, revealing SENATOR PADME AMIDALA.

EXT. SENATE BUILDING - DAY The massive Senate Building glistens in the afternoon sun. Small patches of fog have still to burn off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY The vast rotunda is buzzing with chatter. MAS AMEDDA, the Supreme Chancellor's majordomo, tries to quiet things down as PALPATINE confers with an AIDE, UV GIZEN, riding a small one man floating scooter.
</DIRECTION>
<MAS_AMEDDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Order! We shall have order! The motion for the Republic to commission an army takes precedent, and that is what we will vote on at this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAS_AMEDDA>
<DIRECTION>
Everything quiets down. The AIDE disperses, and SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE steps to the podium.
</DIRECTION>
<PALPATINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...My esteemed colleagues, excuse me... I have just received some tragic and disturbing news. Senator Amidala of the Naboo system... Has been assassinated!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PALPATINE>
<DIRECTION>
There is a shock silence in the vast arena.
</DIRECTION>
<PALPATINE>
<DIRECTION>
(continued)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This grievous blow is especially personal to me. Before I became Chancellor, I served Amidala when she was Queen. She was a great leader who fought for justice, not only in this honourable assembly, but also on her home planet. She was so loved she could have been elected queen for life. She believed in public service, and she fervently believed in democracy. Her death is a great loss to us all. We will all mourn her as a relentless champion of freedom... and as a dear friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PALPATINE>
<DIRECTION>
There is a moment of silence. ASK AAK, the SENATOR of MALASTARE, moves his pod into the centre of the arena.
</DIRECTION>
<SENATOR_ASK_AAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many more Senators will die before this civil strife ends! We must confront these rebels now, and they need an army to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_ASK_AAK>
<DIRECTION>
A second pod moves into the centre of the area with DARSANA, the AMBASSADOR OF GLEE ANSELM.
</DIRECTION>
<AMBASSADOR_DARSANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why weren't the Jedi able to stop this assassination? We are no longer safe, under their protection.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBASSADOR_DARSANA>
<DIRECTION>
Senator ORN FREE TAA swings forward in his pod.
</DIRECTION>
<ORN_FREE_TAA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Republic needs more security now! Before it comes to war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORN_FREE_TAA>
<PALPATINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must I remind the Senator from Malastare that negotiations are continuing with the separatists. Peace is our objective here... not war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PALPATINE>
<DIRECTION>
The SENATORS yell pro and con. MAS AMEDDA tries to calm things down. SENATOR PADME AMIDALA, with CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, and DORME, manoeuvre her pod into the centre of the vast arena.
</DIRECTION>
<AMIDALA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My noble colleagues, I concur with the Supreme Chancellor. At all costs, we do not want war!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMIDALA>
<DIRECTION>
The Senate goes quiet, then there is an outburst of cheering and applause.
</DIRECTION>
<PALPATINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is with great surprise and joy the chair recognises the Senator from Naboo, Padmé Amidala.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PALPATINE>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Less than an hour ago, an assassination attempt was made against my life. One of my bodyguards and six others were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered. I was the target but, more importantly, I believe this security measure before you, was the target. I have led the opposition to build an army... but there is someone in this body who will stop at nothing to assure it's passage...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<DIRECTION>
Many of the SENATORS boo and yell at SENATOR AMIDALA.
</DIRECTION>
<PADMÉ>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I warn you, if you vote to create this army, war will follow. I have experienced the misery of war first-hand; I do not wish to do it again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<DIRECTION>
There is sporadic yelling for and against her statements.
</DIRECTION>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wake up, Senators... you must wake up! If you offer the separatists violence, they can only show us violence in return! Many will lose their lives. All will lose their freedom. This decision could very well destroy the very foundation of our great Republic. I pray you do not let fear push you into a disastrous decision. Vote down this security measure, which is nothing less than a declaration of war! Does anyone here want that? I cannot believe they do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<DIRECTION>
There is an undercurrent of booing... and groaning. SENATOR ORN FREE TAA moves his pod next to AMIDALA.
</DIRECTION>
<ORN_FREE_TAA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My motion to defer the vote must be dealt with first. That is the rule of law.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORN_FREE_TAA>
<DIRECTION>
AMIDALA looks angry and frustrated. PALPATINE gives her a sympathetic look.
</DIRECTION>
<PALPATINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Due to the lateness of the hour and the seriousness of this motion, we will take up these matters tomorrow. Until then, the Senate stands adjourned.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No! I will not let that happen!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PALPATINE>
<MACE_WINDU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if they do, you must realise there aren't enough Jedi to protect the Republic. We are keepers of the peace, not soldiers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACE_WINDU>
<PALPATINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master Yoda, do you think it will really come to war?
	</DIALOGUE>

</PALPATINE>
<DIRECTION>
They all stand as SENATOR AMIDALA, CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, MAS AMEDDA, DORME, and SENATORS BAIL ORGANA, HOROX RYYDER and ORN FREE TAA enter the office. YODA and MACE WINDU move to greet the SENATOR, YODA taps AMIDALA with his cane.

	With you the force is strong... young Senator. To see you alive brings warm feeling to my heart.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you have any idea who was behind the attack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<MACE_WINDU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners, on the moons of Naboo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACE_WINDU>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't wish to disagree but I think that Count Dooku was behind it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<DIRECTION>
There is a stir of surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<MACE_WINDU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi. He wouldn't assassinate anyone, it is not in his character.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACE_WINDU>
<KI_ADI_MUNDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is a political idealist, not a murderer.

	In dark times nothing is what it appears to be, but the fact remains Senator, in grave danger you are.

</YODA>
<DIRECTION>
PALPATINE gets up, walks to the window, and looks out at the vast city.
</DIRECTION>
<PALPATINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Count Dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict. It appears he has no desire to start a war. Why would he kill you? To what end?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PALPATINE>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, but everything in my being tells me he was behind it...

After gazing out of the window for several moments Palpatine turns to Mace.

	Master Jedi, may I suggest that the Senator be placed under the protection of your graces.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Chancellor, please! I don't want any more guards!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<PALPATINE>

	I realise all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you, but perhaps someone you are familiar with... an old friend like... Master Kenobi...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PALPATINE>
<DIRECTION>
PALPATINE nods to MACE WINDU, who nods back.
</DIRECTION>
<MACE_WINDU>

	That's possible. He has just returned from a Border dispute on Ansion.

	You must remember him, M'Lady... he watched over you during the blockade conflict.

	<DIALOGUE>
	This is not necessary, Chancellor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<PALPATINE>

	Do it for me, M'Lady, please. I will rest easier. We had a big scare today. The thought of losing you is unbearable.

AMIDALA sighs as the JEDI get up to leave.

<MACE_WINDU>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MACE_WINDU>

YODA leans into her ear.
</DIRECTION>
<YODA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too little about yourself you worry, Senator, and too much about politics. Be mindful of your danger, Padmé. Accept our help.

ANAKIN shrugs.

<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is she thinking?

</OBI_WAN>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She programmed Artoo to warn us if there's an intruder.

</ANAKIN>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not an intruder I'm worried about. There are many other ways to kill a Senator.

<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, but we also want to catch this assassin. Don't we, Master?

<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're using her as bait??

	It was her idea... No harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me.

<OBI_WAN>

	It's too risky... and your senses aren't that attuned, young apprentice.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT As PADME sleeps, a PROBE DROID approaches outside her window. It sends out several small arms that attach to the window, creating sparks that shut down the security system. Then a large arm cuts a small hole in the glass. A FAINT SOUND is heard as the small section of glass is removed from the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARTOO wakes up, and his lights go on. The PROBE DROID freezes. ARTOO looks around, makes a PLAINTIVE LITTLE SOUND, then shuts down again. The PROBE DROID attaches a little tube to the window. TWO DEADLY LOOKING CENTIPEDE-LIKE KOUHUNS exit the tube, crawl through the blinds and head toward the sleeping PADME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT ANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their conversation in the main room of the apartment.

<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look tired.

</OBI_WAN>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't sleep well, anymore.

</ANAKIN>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because of your mother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know why I keep dreaming About her now. I haven't seen her since I was little.

</ANAKIN>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dreams pass in time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd rather dream of Padmé. Just Being around her again is... intoxicating.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they betray you. You've made a commitment to the Jedi order... a commitment not easily broken... and don't forget she's a politician. They're not to be trusted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's not like the others in the Senate, Master.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been my experience that Senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns... and they are more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not another lecture, Master. Not on the economics of politics.... It's too early in the morning... and besides, you're generalising. The Chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Palpatine's a politician, I've observed that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the Senators.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<ANAKIN>

	I think he is a good man. My instincts are very positive about...

</OBI_WAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT ARTOO sounds an alarm and shines a light on the bed. THE KOUHUNS are inches from PADME'S face. Their mouths are open, and wicked stinger tongues flick out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN burst into the room. The KOUHUNS stand on their hind legs and hiss as PADME wakes up. ANAKIN throws himself in front of her, whacking in half the deadly creatures with his lightsaber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OBI-WAN sees the DROID outside the window and raqces straight at it, crashing through the blinds as he goes through the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WINDOW LEDGE, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT OBI-WAN flies through the glass window and flings himself at the PROBE DROID, grabbing onto the deadly machine before it can flee. The PROBE DROID sinks under the weight of OBI-WAN but manages to stay afloat and fly away, with the Jedi hanging on for dear life, a hundred stories above the city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT ANAKIN and PADME stare at the sight of OBI-WAN being carried off by the DROID. ANAKIN turns to her. She pulls her nightdress around her shoulders.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
CAPTAIN TYPHO, with TWO GUARDS and DORME, enter the room as Anakin dashes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT The PROBE DROID sends several protective electrical shocks across its surface, causing OBI-WAN to almost lose his grip. As they dart in and out of the speeder traffic, OBI-WAN disconnects a wire on the back of the DROID. Its power shuts off! OBI-WAN and the DROID drop like rocks. OBI-WAN realises the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. The DROID'S systems light up again and it takes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT ANAKIN charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked speeders. He vaults into an open one and takes off, gunning it fast toward the lines of speeder traffic high above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT The DROID bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takesthe JEDI wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as OBI-WAN is forced to lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the DROID. The DROID heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy bounty hunter called ZAM WESELL, sees the DROID approach with OBI-WAN hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the JEDI. EXPLOSIONS burst all around OBI-WAN.
</DIRECTION>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a bad feeling about this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<DIRECTION>
FINALLY, the DROID suffers a direct hit and blows up. OBI-WAN falls fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit. The JEDI struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver, ANAKIN.
</DIRECTION>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was wacky! I almost lost you in the traffic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What took you so long?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't find a speeder I really liked, with an open cockpit... and with the right speed capabilities... and then you know I had to get a really gonzo color...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
They zoom upward in hot pursuit of ZAM asshe fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you'd spend as much time working on your saber skills as you do on your wit, young Padawan, you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.

	Only in your mind, my very young apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<DIRECTION>
As this conversation is going on, ANAKIN deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and miraculously through a construction site. ZAM WESELL continues firing at them.
</DIRECTION>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, I forgot you don't like flying, Master.

</ANAKIN>
<OBI_WAN>

</OBI_WAN>
<DIRECTION>
They barely miss a commuter train

<ANAKIN>

</ANAKIN>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just slow down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<DIRECTION>
ZAM WESSEL and the JEDI race through a line of cross-traffic made up of giant trucks. The speeders bank sideways as they slide around right-angle turns between buildings. ZAM races into a tram tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<OBI_WAN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! Don't go in there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>

ANAKIN zooms into the tunnel after ZAM. They see a tram coming at them. They brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the charging commuter transport.
</DIRECTION>
<OBI_WAN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I don't like it when you do that!

<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, Master. Don't worry, this guy's gonna kill himself any minute now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
ZAM WESSEL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN.
</DIRECTION>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing? He's gonna blast me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right - this isn't working.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
ANAKIN slides underneath Zam's speeder. They race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops.
</DIRECTION>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was too close!

<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clear the flag! We're losing power! Hurry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
OBI-WAN leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches forward with a surge of power.
</DIRECTION>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whooooaaa! Don't do that! I don't like it when you do that!

	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
They chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery.
</DIRECTION>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's dangerous near those power couplings! Slow down! Don't go through there!

Huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass.

<ANAKIN>

ZAM slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point-blank as ANAKIN approaches.

<ANAKIN>

	No, we can make it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
ANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER'S speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder.

ANAKIN works to get the speeder started. It quickly races to life.

Suddenly, there is an ambush. Laser bolts fire everywhere. EXPLOSIONS surround them. They look up to see ZAM WESSEL take off.
</DIRECTION>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No we didn’t...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
Out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM. They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the right
</DIRECTION>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going?! He went down there, the other way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a shortcut... I think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<OBI_WAN>

	What do you mean, ‘You think?’ What kind of shortcut?! He went completely the other way! You’ve lost him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master, if we keep this chase going, that creep’s gonna end up deep fried. Personally, I’d very much like to find out who in the hell he is and who he’s working for...

(sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, so that’s why we’re going in the wrong direction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<DIRECTION>
ANAKIN turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up.
</DIRECTION>
<OBI_WAN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you lost him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I’m deeply sorry, Master.

</ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
ANAKIN looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to start counting to himself as he watches something below approach.
</DIRECTION>
<ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me for a moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
ANAKIN jumps out of the speeder. OBI-WAN looks down and sees Zam’s speeder about five stories below them cruising past. ANAKIN miraculously lands on top of the Bounty Hunter’s speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. ZAM looks up and realises what has happened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. ANAKIN works his way back to the speeder’s cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN flies forward to the left front fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a BLAST near ANAKIN'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM can’t reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OBI-WAN has jumped into the driver’s seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, ANAKIN is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passenger’s seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANAKIN sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls the gun out of ZAM’S hand. She grabs the Jedi’s hand, and they struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles to pull the speeder out of it’s nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunter’s speeder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, ZAM pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. ANAKIN goes flying into the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET - NIGHT ZAM exits the crashed speeder and runs. ANAKIN picks himself up off the pavement and runs down the very crowded street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected on the filthy puddles. It's pretty crowded with various ALIEN LOW-LIFES, PANHANDLING DROIDS, and the occasional group of UPPERCLASS SLUMMERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANAKIN barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing ZAM. He loses the Bounty Hunter in the crowd, them sees him again. The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead, ZAM turns in through a door and disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A nightclub sighs is flashing over the door. ANAKIN is just about to follow ZAM when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters. PEOPLE start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the street beside him. OBI-WAN gets out and walks over, holding out ANAKIN'S lightsaber.
</DIRECTION>

OBI-WAN heads for the bar. ANAKIN blinks in surprise, then moves into the room, where ALIEN FACES look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. OBI-WAN arrives at the bar. He signals the BARMAN.

ANAKIN checks out ALIEN FACES. OBI-WAN signals for another drink. The gun moves toward his unsuspecting back.

The drink is poured. OBI-WAN reaches for it. The gun is raised to aim directly at his back, and suddenly OBI-WAN turns fast. His lightsaber flashes. There is a shrill SCREAM and ZAM'S ARM hits the floor. The gun drops from its twitching fingers. Blood spreads.

The room is silent. ALIENS rise menacingly from their seats, and ANAKIN is suddenly at OBI-WAN's side, his lightsaber glowing.

<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is a great mentor. As wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. Only... although I'm a Padawan learner, in some ways... a lot of ways... I'm ahead of him. I'm ready for the trials. I know I am! He knows it too. He believes I'm too unpredictable... Other Jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it... I know I started my training late... but he won't let me move on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That must be frustrating.

ARTOO takes one last big suck and heads away from the food line. The SERVER shouts after him angrily. The little droid moves past groups of eating or sleeping EMIGRANTS and comes to where ANAKIN is sound asleep. The young Jedi seems to be having a nightmare. He is very restless.

He is sweating. PADME leans over to wipe some of the sweat from his forehead. He wakes up with a start, then realises where he is. PADME simply looks at him. He stares back, somewhat confused. ARTOO fills up two bowls with mush.

<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi's life, so you might say we're encouraged to love.

</ANAKIN>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have changed so much
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<ANAKIN>

</OBI_WAN>
<DEXTER_JETTSTER>

<DEXTER_JETTSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's beyond the Outer Rim. I'd say about twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze, toward the south. It should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archive to find. Those Kaminoans keep to themselves. They're cloners. Damned good ones, too.

EXT. NABOO SPACEPORT - DAY The Starfreighter lands in the giant port city of Theed.
</DIRECTION>

PADME, ANAKIN and ARTOO are among the EMIGRANTS streaming from the Starfreighter and into the vast docking area. They exit onto the main plaza.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NABOO PALACE, GRAND COURTYARD (NABOO) - AFTERNOON The speeder bus pulls up and stops. PADME, ANAKIN, and ARTOO get out. The great courtyard stretches out before them, and they see the rose-colored dome of the palace on the far side. ARTOO WHISTLES. They pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard. ARTOO trundles behind them.

(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I doubt that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, really. When I started my training, I was very homesick and very lonely. This city and my Mom were the only pleasant things I had to think about... The problem was, the more I thought about my Mom, the worse I felt. But I would feel better if I thought about the palace - the way it shimmers in the sunlight - the way the air always smells of flowers...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. The first time I saw the Capital, I was very young... I'd never seen a waterfall before. I though they were so beautiful... I never dreamed one day I'd live in the palace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<PADMÉ>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! That was the last thing I thought of. My dream was to help in the "Refugee Relief Movement." I never thought of running for elected office. But the more history I studied, the more I realised how much good politicians could do. So when I was eight, I joined the "Apprentice Legislators", then later on became a Senatorial advisor, with such a passion that, before I knew it, I was elected Queen. Partly because I scored so high on my education certificate, but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. I wasn't the youngest Queen ever elected, but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough. I'm not sure I was ready.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Popular rule is not democracy, Annie. It gives the people what they want, not what they need. And, truthfully, I was relieved when my two terms were up. So were my parents. They worried About me during the blockade and couldn't wait for it all to be over. Actually, I was hoping to have a family by now... My sisters have the most amazing, wonderful kids... but when the Queen asked me to serve as Senator, I couldn't refuse her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I agree! I think the Republic needs you... I'm glad you chose to serve. I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways.

<QUEEN_JAMILLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many systems have joined Count Dooku and the separatists?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN_JAMILLIA>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About two hundred. And more are leaving the Republic every day. If the Senate votes to create an army, I'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<SIO_BIBBLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's unthinkable! There hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIO_BIBBLE>
<QUEEN_JAMILLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the Republic?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN_JAMILLIA>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don't have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. I'm sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federation for help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<QUEEN_JAMILLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The armies of commerce! Why has Nothing been done in the Senate to restrain them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN_JAMILLIA>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid that, despite the Chancellor's best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even Senators on the payrolls of the Guilds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<SIO_BIBBLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's outrageous! After all of those hearings, and the four trials in the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is still the Viceroy of the Trade Federation. Do those money mongers control everything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIO_BIBBLE>
<QUEEN_JAMILLIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember, Counsellor, the courts were able to reduce the Federation's armies. That's a move in the right direction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN_JAMILLIA>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are rumours, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered.

	The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate. It would be to be too dangerous for the economy, we were told.

	We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE - DAY The main entrance at the base of the huge temple is bustling with activity. All sorts of JEDI are coming and going.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ARCHIVES LIBRARY - DAY A bronze bust of Count Dooku, stands among a line of other busts of Jedi in the Archive Room. OBI-WAN stands in front it, studying the striking features of the chiselled face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the walls, lighted computer panels seem to stretch into infinity. Farther along the room in the background, FIVE JEDI are seated at tables, studying archival material.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After OBI-WAN studies the bust for a few moments before MADAME JOCASTA NU, the Jedi Archivist is standing next to him. She is an elderly, frail-looking human Jedi. Tough as old boots and smart as a whip.

	He has a powerful face, doesn't he? He was one of the most brilliant Jedi I have had the privilege of knowing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOCASTA_NU>
<OBI_WAN>

	I never understood why he quit. Only twenty Jedi have ever left the Order.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<JOCASTA_NU>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Lost Twenty... and Count Dooku was the most recent and the most painful. No one likes to talk about it. His leaving was a great loss to the Order.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOCASTA_NU>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<JOCASTA_NU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, one might say, he was always a bit out of step with the decisions of the Council... much like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.

(surprised)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?

JOCASTA NU stares at the bust
</DIRECTION>
<JOCASTA_NU>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was always striving to become a more powerful Jedi. He wanted to be the best. With a lightsaber, in the old style of fencing, he had no match. His knowledge of the Force was... unique. In the end, I think he left because he lost faith in the Republic. He believed that politics were corrupt, and he felt the Jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians. He always had very high expectations of government. He disappeared for nine or ten years, then he just showed up recently as the head of the separatist movement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOCASTA_NU>

JOCASTA NU taps the keyboard and frowns.

	Wouldn't that be on record?

	It ought to be. Unless it was very recent.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for doesn't exist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOCASTA_NU>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's impossible... perhaps the archives are incomplete.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<JOCASTA_NU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The archives are comprehensive and totally secure, my young Jedi. One thing you may be absolutely sure of - if an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist!

<RUWEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now tell me, son. How serious is this thing? How much danger is my daughter really in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUWEE>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There have been two attempts on her life. Chances are there'll be more. My Master is tracking down the assassins. I'm sure he'll find out who they are. This situation, won't last long.

	You still live at home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<PADME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I move around so much, I've never had a place of my own. Official residences have no warmth. I feel good here. I feel at home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADME>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never had a real home. Home was always where my Mom was.

(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
The hologram shows Padme at age seven or eight surrounded by forty or fifty little green creatures. She is holding one in her arms. They are all smiling hugely.
</DIRECTION>
<PADME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was when I went with the Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran. Their sun was imploding, and the planet was dying. I was helping to relocate the children. See that little one I'm holding? His name was N'a-kee-tula, which means sweethear. He was so full of life,. All those kids were. I did everything I could to save him, but he died... they all did. They were never able to adapt... to live off their native planet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADME>
<DIRECTION>
ANAKIN picks up another hologram. It shows PADME at age ten or eleven. She is wearing official robes and standing between two robed legislators. Her expression is severe.

	<DIALOGUE>
	My first day as an Apprentice Legislator. Notice the difference?

<DIRECTION>
INT. JEDI TEMPLE, TRAINING VERANDA - DAY OBI-WAN comes out onto the veranda and stops, watching TWENTY or so FOUR-YEAR-OLDS doing training exercises, supervised by YODA. They wear helmets over their eyes and try to strike little TRAINING DROIDS with their miniature lightsabers. The DROIDS dance in front of them.
</DIRECTION>

	Welcome, Master Obi-Wan!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDREN>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am sorry to disturb you, Master.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<YODA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What help to you, can I be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YODA>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I’m looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him. But the system doesn’t show up on the archive maps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<YODA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An interesting puzzle. Gather round the map reader, younglings. Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet. Find it, we will try...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YODA>
<DIRECTION>
The map reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the top. The CCHILDREN gather around it. OBI-WAN takes out a little glass ball and places it into the bowl. The window shades close darkening the room and the reader lights up, projecting the star map hologram into the room. The CHILDREN laugh. Some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars. OBI-WAN walks into the display.
</DIRECTION>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is where it ought to be... but it isn’t. Gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot. There should be a star here... but there isn’t.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<YODA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most interesting. Gravity’s silhouette remains, but the star and all its planets have disappeared. How can this be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YODA>
<DIRECTION>
There is a brief pause. Then a CHILD puts its hand up. YODA nods.
</DIRECTION>
<JEDI_CHILD_JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because someone erased it from the archive memory.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEDI_CHILD_JACK>
<CHILDREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That’s right! Yes! That’s what happened! Someone erased it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDREN>
<JEDI_CHILD_MAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If the planet blew up, the gravity would go away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEDI_CHILD_MAY>
<DIRECTION>
OBI-WAN stares; YODA chuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<YODA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. To the centre of the pull of gravity go, and find your planet you will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YODA>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Master Yoda who could have erased information from the archives? That’s impossible, isn’t it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, WATER SPEEDER, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON A water speeder driven by PADDY ACCU, the retreat caretaker, skims across the lake away from the island landing platform where a chrome Naboo Starship rests. ANAKIN and PADME are sitting in the speeder as it skims away to where a lodge rises on a beautiful island in the middle of the lake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN TERRACEM LATE AFTERNOON ANAKIN and PADME walk up the stairs from where the water speeder is parked onto a terrace overlooking a lovely garden. Behind them, PADDY ACCU supervises two serving girls, NANDI and TECKLA, as they carry the bags into the Lodge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANAKIN and PADME stop at the balustrade. PADME looks out across the garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising beyond. ANAKIN looks at her silently.
</DIRECTION>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was in Level Three, we used to come here for school retreat. See that island? We used to swim there every day. I love the water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
PADME becomes aware that ANAKIN is looking at her.
</DIRECTION>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don’t like sand. It’s coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everything’s soft... and smooth...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
He touches her arm. PADME has become receptive to the way he looks at her but is nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was a very old man who lived on the island. He used to make glass out of sand - and vases and necklaces out of the glass. They were magical.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
(looks into her eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything here is magical.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could look into the glass and see the water. The way it ripples and moves. It looked so real... but it wasn’t.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes, when you believe something to be real, it becomes real. Real enough, anyway...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
They look into each other's eyes. He touches her chin.
</DIRECTION>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to think if you looked too deeply into glass, you would lose yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's true...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
ANAKIN kisses PADME. She doesn't resist. She comes to her senses and pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shouldn't have done that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. When I'm around you, my mind is no longer my own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the situation... the stress...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...the view.

EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON Obi-Wan's Starfighter is ready for takeoff. OBI-WAN and MACE WINDU stand beside it.
</DIRECTION>
<MACE_WINDU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be wary, this disturbance in the Force is growing stronger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACE_WINDU>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be on his own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<YODA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Council is confident in this decision, Obi-Wan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YODA>
<MACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has exceptional skills. The Council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan. If the prophecy is true, he weill be the one to bring balance to the Force.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACE>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he still has much to learn. And his abilities have made him... well... arrogant. I realise now what you and Master Yoda knew from the beginning... the boy was too old to start the training and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<DIRECTION>
OBI-WAN hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<MACE_WINDU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's something else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACE_WINDU>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master, he should not have been given this assignment. I'm afraid Anakin won't be able to protect the Senator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<MACE_WINDU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACE_WINDU>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has a... an emotional connection with her. It's been there since he was boy. Now he's confused... distracted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<MACE_WINDU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Obi-Wan, you must have faith that he will take the right path.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACE_WINDU>
<DIRECTION>
OBI-WAN climbs into the cockpit of the Starfighter.
</DIRECTION>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has Master Yoda gained any insight into whether or not this war will come about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<MACE_WINDU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probing the Dark Side is a dangerous process. He could be in seclusion for days... May the force be with you.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LOUNGE, LATE AFTERNOON The setting sun touches the mountain peaks. The lake glows in the rose-tinted light. Floatinf lamps glean softly like jewels at the lodge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON NANDI place dessert in front of PADME. TECKLA does the same for ANAKIN. The dessert is some kind of fruit. PADME picks up her fork and goes to spear a piece, but it moves! She frowns and tries again -the fruit moves. She lokk up at ANAKIN. His eyes are on his plate.
</DIRECTION>
<PADME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADME>
<DIRECTION>
ANAKIN looks up - wide-eyed innocence.
</DIRECTION>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
PADME scowls at him. PADME jabs at the fruit - ANAKIN subtly moves his hand and it lifts up from the plate and hovers in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<PADME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That! Now stop it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADME>
<DIRECTION>
PADME laughs. ANAKIN laughs. She reaches out for the fruit - it loops.
</DIRECTION>
<PADME>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anakin!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADME>
<DIRECTION>
ANAKIN moves his fingers. The fruit flies into his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not really supposed to do that... for fun, I mean. If Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be very grumpy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
ANAKIN is pleased. He cuts the fruint into several pieces and sends one back to PADME. She bites it out of the air and laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, FIREPLACE ALCOVE - TWILIGHT A fire blazes in the open hearth. PADME is sitting in front of it, gazing at the flames.

</DIRECTION>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I tell you something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<PADME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADME>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then how can I tell you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<PADME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you should use your Jedi intuition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADME>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't work around you. My mind is always a muddle... I can only think of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<PADME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anakin, don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADME>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From the moment I met you, all those years ago, a day hasn't gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm close to you again, I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. The logs flame in the hearth.
</DIRECTION>
<ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you are suffering as much as I am, tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>

<PADME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I can't. We can't. It's just not possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADME>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything's possible. Padme, please listen...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<PADME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi Knight. I'm a Senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADME>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you do feel something! There's an extraordinary connection between us. You can't deny that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<PADME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Annie, it doesn't make any difference. Jedi aren't allowed to marry. You swore an oath, remember? You'd be expelled from the Order. I will not let you give up your responsibilities... your future, for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADME>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was destined to be a Jedi. I don't think I could be anything else. But you are asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. I wish I could wish my feelings away... but I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<PADME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not going to give into this. I'm not going to throw my life away. I have more important things to do than fall in love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADME>
<DIRECTION>
There is silence as they stare at the fire. ANAKIN is thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wouldn't have to be that way... we could keep it a secret.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<PADME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we'd be living a lie - one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. Mt sister saw it. So did my mother. I couldn't do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADME>
<DIRECTION>
Silence for a moment.

EXT. SPACE It's just like the star map hologram, plus the storm-shrouded planet of Kamino, which is exactly where it ought to be. Obi-Wan's Starship flies OVER CAMERA and heads down toward the planet.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY Heavy rans and hard-driving winds lash the platform as Obi-Wan's Starship approaches. The huge, ultra-modern city of Tipoca rests on great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever-present waves that cover the surface of this watery world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

	That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't wlways agree. In fact, they hardly ever do.

<ANAKIN>

</ANAKIN>
<PADME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But someone.

</PADME>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone wise.

</ANAKIN>
<PADME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.

A mischievious little grin creeps across his face.
</DIRECTION>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if it works...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
PADME stares at ANAKIN. He looks back at her, straight-faced, and can't hold a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're making fun of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>

</ANAKIN>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're so bad!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<DIRECTION>
PADME picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him. He catches it. PADME throws two more pieces of fruit, and ANAKIN catches them.
</DIRECTION>
<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're always so serious. Always carrying the weight of the universe on your shoulders.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
ANAKIN then starts to juggle the fruit. PADME laughs and throws more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They both laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANAKIN stands in front of a SHAAK, yelling at it and waving his arms. PADME starts laughing as ANAKIN runs in circles, chased by the SHAAK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SHAAK crosses in front of PADME. ANAKIN is riding it, facing the SHAAK'S tail. The SHAAK bucks, and ANAKIN falls off. PADME laughs even harder. ANAKIN lies still. PADME jumps uip and runs to where ANAKIN is face down in the grass. She turns him over. He is pulling a stupid face at her. She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. He catches her arm. She struggles. They roll over in the grass. Suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them. They let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANAKIN stands up and holds out his hand to her. She take it. He pulls her up. And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more. PADME scrambles up onto the SHAAK behind ANAKIN. She puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. ABAJUB digs his heels in. The SHAAK starts forward, and they ride away.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, PARADE GROUND (RAINSTORM) - DAY OBI-WAN, LAMA SU and TAUN WE come out onto a balcony. Below is a huge parade ground. The rain and wind are brutal. THOUSANDS OF STORMTROOPERS, faces covered by helmets, are marching and drilling in formations of several hundred.
</DIRECTION>
<LAMA_SU>
<DIRECTION>
(beaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Magnificent, aren't they?

OBI-WAN nods slowly.

<DIRECTION>
INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, COMMINSSARY - DAY LAMA SU conducts OBI-WAN through a large eating area. TAUN WE follows as they walk by HUNDREDS OF CLONES who look exactly alike, all about twenty years old, dressed in black. They are seated at tables, eating.
</DIRECTION>
<LAMA_SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host. As a result they are totally obedient, taking any order without question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAMA_SU>
<OBI_WAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who was the original host?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAM>
<LAMA_SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A bounty hunter called Jango Fett. We felt a Jedi would be the perfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand- picked Jango Fett himself.

</LAMA_SU>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is this bounty hunter now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<LAMA_SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, we keep him here. After a few hundred thousand clones, the genetic pattern starts to fade, so we take a fresh supply. He lives here, but he's free to come and go as he pleases.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAMA_SU>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, BARRACKS - DAY The tour continues through a long corridor folled with narrow, transparent tubes into which CLONES are climbing. Once in the tube, the CLONE goes to sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<LAMA_SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apart from his pay, which is considerable, Fett demanded only one thing - an unaltered clone for himself. Curious isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAMA_SU>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unaltered?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<LAMA_SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it more docile... and no growth acceleration...

<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mentioned growth acceleration...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<LAMA_SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes, it's essential. Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now, we can do it in half the time. Those items you saw on the parade ground were started ten years ago, when Sido-dyas first placed the order, and they're already mature...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAMA_SU>
<DIRECTION>
OBI-WAN looks at the BOY CLONES.

	They're immensely superior to droids, capable of independent thought and action.

<OBI_WAN>

	Very impressive.

	Tell me, prime minister, when my Master Sido-dyas first contacted you, did he say the order was for... himself... or?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<LAMA_SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Himself? Of course not. This army is for the Republic?

(astonished)

	<DIALOGUE>
	The Repubic?
	</DIALOGUE>

JANGO FETT comes in from the bedroom. He wears a jumpsuit. He is unshaven and mean looking, his face pitted with scars of old wounds. There are a couple of weird tattoos on his muscular forearms. He eyes OBI-WAN with suspicion.

<DIRECTION>
Below, a huge wave crashes against the stilts. Spray flies high and whips across the platform where OBI-WAN is standing. He walks over to his Starfighter, looks to see if anyone is watching, then turns and goes back to the door. It slides open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY OBI-WAN enters cautiously from outside. Ahead, the corridor is deserted. He moves down it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY OBI-WAN walks in to find the room in complete disorder. The bedroom door is wide open - clear signs of hurried departure. All of the Fetts' personal belongings are gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OBI-WAN goes to an ultra-thin computer screen. He punches up AN ONSCREEN PICTURE of JANGO FETT and BOBA FETT unhitching the lines securing their ship to the landing platform. JANGO FETT is wearing his armour and rocket pack. BOBA FETT climbs aboard the small Fighter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY JANGO FETT picks up a case and swings it up to BOBA FETT, who stows it inside the ship. JANGO FETT picks up another case and is about to swing it, when:

</BOBA_FETT>
<DIRECTION>
JANGO FETT turns to see OBI-WAN charging out of the tower toward him. As he runs, OBI-WAN draws his lightsaber from his belt. It flashes on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANGO FETT draws his gun and fires at the charging JEDI. OBI-WAN deflects the blast and swings at JANGO FETT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bounty hunter rockets up and over OBI-WAN, landing behind him. He fires a thin wire from his wrist pack, trying to entangle the Jedi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANGO FETT fire several Kamino Kyber Darts from his elbow launcher. OBI-WAN deflects them back at JANGO FETT, but they strike harmlessly against the bounty hunter's armour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE COCKPIT of Jango Fett's ship, BOBA FETT grabs the controls of a laser gun and swings it to aim at OBI-WAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE, in the driving rain, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT circle each other, sizing each other up - feinting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE COCKPIT, each time BOBA FETT is ready to fire, JANGO FETT blocks his view of OBI-WAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN makes a sudden attack, swinging at JANGO FETT, who deflects the blows. One slices off a piece of the bounty hunter's shoulder plate. JANGO FETT rockets into the air and hovers above OBI-WAN. The Jedi spins as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE, the laser shell streaks past OBI-WAN to strike the edge of the tower. JANGO FETT fires down at OBI-WAN. The Jedi deflects the shots back, but JANGO FETT evades them. Then he swoops down, swinging around OBI-WAN. As he shoots past, he kicks the lightsaber out of the Jedi's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lightsaber skids across the wet surface of the landing platform. OBI-WAN dives after it. JANGO FETT zooms in front of him and grabs the lightsaber. OBI-WAN punches it out of his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT watches as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT grapple and fight, punching, kicking, grabbing hold, and throwing each other around. OBI-WAN grabs JANGO FETT tightly, and JANGO FETT rockets up into the air and kicks OBI-WAN loose. OBI-WAN crashes to the deck and slides toward the edge. He grapples desperately for a handhold on the slick surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANGO FETT rockets down to kick at him. OBI-WAN hauls himself up. JANGO FETT zooms to the far side of the platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OBI-WAN uses Jedi powers to pull part of the structure loose. It hits JANGO FETT, who loses his balance, teetering on the edge. OBI-WAN charges acress, dives, and grabs hold of JANGO FETT just as he falls over the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Locked together, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT plummet down toward the raging ocean. At the last moment, JANGO FETT fires a cable out of his backpack that shoots upward and locks onto a metal strut on the underside of the platform. OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT swing and CRASH onto one of the stilts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OBI-WAN is knocked clear and drops onto a SMALL SERVICE PLATFORM just above the waves. He hauls himself to his feet. JANGO FETT hovers in mid-air opposite him, as a HUGE WAVE crashes over OBI-WAN. When it subsides, the Jedi has disappeared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANGO FETT rockets up to the landing platform, where he drops down beside his ship. He clambers inside the cockpit and settles into the pilot's seat. He punches buttons. The engines ROAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE, Jango Fett's ship lifts off from the platform and heads up into the lowering sky. It disappears. Lightning flashes. Rain lashes the tower and streams across the surface of the platform, to where:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HAND suddenlt clutches at the very edge of the platform. A moment later, ANOTHER HAND grabs hold.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW PAN with the binoculars, and suddenly a line of Battle Starships come into view. OBI-WAN touches the viewfinder. Between fifty and a hundred Federation Starships in near rows. Some are on platforms that are carrying the Starships diwn to an underground facility. Other platforms are rising to the surface. They carry THOUSANDS of BATTLE DROIDS that step off and file into the waiting ships. A fully loaded Starship takes off. OBI-WAN swings the binoculars upward, to see more Federation Starships.

EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS - DAWN The pale light grows. Thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold, clear air. Somewhere an dog BARKS. An OLD WOMAN comes out of one of the huts. She carries a pail. She swirls it and tosses the dirty water onto the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she goes back inside the hut, a TUSKEN CHILD runs past, dragging a stick in the sand. The CHILD runs through the line of huts, turns a corner, and stops suddenly, staring at the bodies of the TWO TUSKEN GUARDS. Between them, ANAKIN stands outside the hut door. His face is a grim mask. The CHILD stares, then there is a FLASH OF LIGHT as Anakin’s lightsaber switches on.

	One more thing. Jango mentioned he was recruited by someone named Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that might be?

	Perhaps too many pieces are missing from this puzzle, there are.

Mas Amedda, who had been silent up until now suddenly speaks up.

	This is a crisis! If the Senate votes the Chancellor emergency powers, he could approve the use of the army in a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAS_AMEDDA>
<PALPATINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, please, I don't wish to have emergency powers. That's too extreme a solution. It's akin to a dictatorship. We must rely on the Jedi. Master Yoda, how many are available to go to Geonosis?

MACE WINDU and YODA look at one another.

<YODA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two Hundred,... less or more.

</BAIL_ORGANA>
<MACE_WINDU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patience. We should wait for Obi- Wan to report back. We don't know that Count Dooku has made a treaty with the Corporate Alliance, it's speculation.

</MACE_WINDU>
<SENATOR_ASK_AAK>

	But we must prepare for the worst. I'm going to propose a motion granting emergency powers to the Chancellor at the next session. We must not wait!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_ASK_AAK>
<PALPATINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out of the question, Senator! You and I are too closely aligned. The issue will become partisan and debates will begin. The proposal must come from a neutral source.

<DOOKU>

	I don't wish to make you to join our cause against your will, Senator, but you are a rational, honest representative of your people and I assume you want to do what's in their best interest.

<DOOKU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Chancellor means well, M'Lady but he is incompetent. He has promised to cut the bureaucracy, but the bureaucrats are stronger than ever, no? Senator, the Republic cannot be fixed. It is time to start over. The democratic process in the Republic is a sham, a shell game played on the voters. It will not be long before the cult of greed, called the Republic, will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOKU>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cannot believe that. I will not forsake all I have honoured and worked for and betray the Republic. I know of your treaties with the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guilds, and the others, Count. What is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business... it's business becoming government!

	What is to happen to me? Am I to be executed also?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<DOOKU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't think of such an offence. But, there are individuals who have a strong interest in your demise, M'lady. It has nothing to do with politics, I'm afraid. It's purely personal, and they have already paid great sums to have you assassinated. I'm sure they will push hard to have you included in the executions. I'm sorry but if you are not going to co-operate, I must turn you over to the Geonosians for justice. I've done all I can for you.

The DRIVER cracks his whip over the ORRAY harnessed between the shafts. The cart jerks forward. Suddenly, there isa HUGE ROAR and blinding sunlight as they emerge into the arena
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY The great stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling GEONOSIANS. The cart trundles to the center, where OBI-WAN is chained to one of four upright posts thatare three feet in diameter. The cart stops. PADME and ANAKIN are taken down, dragged to posts, and chained to them. PADME is in the center.

From different gates around the arena, THREE MONSTERS are driven in. One is a REEK (bull-like), one is a NEXU (lion-like), and one is an ACKLAY (a kind of dino-lobster). They are driven in by PICADORS carrying long spears and riding ORRAYS. The PICADORS poke the MONSTERS toward the center, then retire to the perimeter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MONSTERS toss their heads, looking around, ROARING or SCREECHING. Then they catch sight of the THREE CAPTIVES and start moving toward them.
</DIRECTION>

<ANAKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Padme?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANAKIN>
<DIRECTION>
PADME has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to the top of the post. Within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free.
</DIRECTION>
<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It looks like she's already on top of things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<DIRECTION>
The REEK charges ANAKIN. He jumps up, and the beast hits the post hard. ANAKIN lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain around its horn. The REEK backs off, shaking its head angrily, which tears the chain from the post
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OBI-WAN ducks around the post as the ACKLAY charges. It knocks the post flat, sending OBI-WAN sprawling. The ACKLAY crunches the post between its claws, freeing the chain. OBI-WAN leaps up and runs towards ONE of the PICADORS. The ACKLAY taks off after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The NEXU arrives at PADME'S post and rears on its hind legs. One top, PADME struggles to tear the chain free. The NEXU ROARS, displaying wicked, dripping fangs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY beams and rubs his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the arena, OBI-WAN runs at the PICADOR. The ORRAY rears up. OBI-WAN grabs the PICADOR'S long spear and pole vaults over him. The chasing ACKLAY smashes into the ORRAY. It goes down. The PICADOR tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the ACKLAY and crunched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANAKIN's REEK starts to buck. It charges around the arena with ANAKIN hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the REEK's mouth. Its jaws clamp hard on the chain. ANAKIN yanks hard on the chain, turning the REEK, beginning to ride it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The NEXU's claws dig deep into the post. The cat-like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at PADME. She turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw marks across her back. She hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. Then, PADME jumps off the post into the air. She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
In the arena, OBI-WAN runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and throws the spear at the ACKLAY, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a terrible SCREECH and turns on him. The NEXU springs up and makes to leap up at PADME again. She finally manages to work the chain loose. ANAKIN comes charging up on the REEK.
</DIRECTION>

The NEXU springs. PADME leaps from the top of the post to land on the REEK in front of ANAKIN. He hauls her upright. The REEK charges away, around the arena. The NEXU bounds after it. The REEK passes the wounded ACKLAY. The NEXU smells the blood and turns aside to attack the ACKLAY. The TWO MONSTERS fight. The crowd GROANS and BOOS.

COUNT DOOKU looks around the great theater. His smile grows.

The REEK and the NEXU are spooked by the battle. The REEK bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena, trampling DROIDS and JEDI that have moved into its path. PADME picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight. SEVERAL JEDI run to the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to OBI-WAN and ANAKIN.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANAKIN and PADME are back-to-back, fighting DROIDS and flying GEONOSIANS. MACE WINDU fights fiercely with JANGO FETT. Finally, the bounty hunter falls.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OBI-WAN is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh. He stumbles back against the wall, trips, and falls. His lightsaber goes skittering across the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COUNT DOOKU raises his lightsaber. OBI-WAN looks up helplessly. Dooku's lightsaber flashes down and CLASHES against - Anakin's lightsaber! COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN stare eyeball to eyeball.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
OBI-WAN uses the Force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to ANAKIN. With TWO LIGHTSABERS, ANAKIN attacks. COUNT DOOKU parries and ripostes. It is no contest. ANAKIN is driven back against the wall. He loses one lightsaber. Finally COUNT DOOKU, in one flashing move, sends Anakin's arm, cut at the elbow, flying still gripping his lightsaber. ANAKIN drops to the ground in agony. COUNT DOOKU draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the great doors slide open. The DROIDS turn fast, raising their weapons. Through the thick smoke, emerges the heroic figure of YODA. He stops on the smoke-filled threashold, FOUR DROIDS lined up on either side of him, guns pointed.

Before the DROIDS can get off a shot, YODA raises his hand, and the DROIDS are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in heaps of smoking metal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. COUNT DOOKU steps away from ANAKIN to face the Jedi Grand Master. His lightsaber whirls in a formal salute.
</DIRECTION>
<COUNT_DOOKU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master Yoda. At last we shall know who is the most powerful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUNT_DOOKU>
<DIRECTION>
YODA draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane. He salutes formally.
</DIRECTION>
<YODA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Count Dooku. No interest in contests, do I have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YODA>
<DIRECTION>
COUNT DOOKU charges across the space at YODA. He rains down blows upon the tiny figure. YODA doesn't budge an inch. For the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that Dooku aims. Nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. His energy drains. His strokes become feebler, slower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YODA attacks! He flies forward. COUNT DOOKU is forced to retreat. Wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda's speed and swordplay. His lightsaber his a humming blur of light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Count Dooku's lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. He staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel. YODA jumps onto DOOKU'S shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber into the top of the Count's head.
</DIRECTION>
<YODA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The end for you, Count, this is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YODA>
<COUNT_DOOKU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Not yet...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUNT_DOOKU>
<DIRECTION>
COUNT DOOKU raises his arms and knocks YODA off his shoulders and then, with all his might, he uses the Force to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger. It comes crashing down on OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. But in the blink of and eye, YODA is under the crane, holding it up, using the Force. YODA closes his eyes and concentrates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANAKIN is unconscious, and OBI0WAN tries toget out from under the crane. The fallen crane trembles and starts to life. Behind it, the sound of the Sail Ship's engines are heard starting up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YODA concentrates harder. Slowly, the crane rises. The SOUND OF THE ENGINES increases. YODA exerts every scrap of his powers. The crane lifts clear of ANAKIN and is thrown to the ground. DOOKU'S Sail Ship takes off. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN struggle to the exhausted YODA, but it's too late. The Sail Ship rises into the air and flies away. PADMÉ and a CLONE CAPTAIN with about TEN TROOPERS appear in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<PADMÉ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anakin!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PADMÉ>
<DIRECTION>
PADMÉ runs too him and throws her arms around him. ANAKIN is barely able to stand up. The CLONE CAPTAIN marches up to YODA, stops, and salutes smartly.
</DIRECTION>
<CLONE_CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Resistance is at an end, General. What are your orders ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLONE_CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
YODA looks at him and sighs.

EXT. CORUSCANT, OLD TOWN - DAWN COUNT DOOKU'S Interstellar Sail Ship glides through a deserted, burned-out part of Coruscant. COUNT DOOKU manoeuvres the ship into one of the empty buildings and lands.
</DIRECTION>

INT. CORUSCANT, SECRET LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN The ramp lowers. COUNT DOOKU emerges and walks to where the hooded figure of DARTH SIDIOUS stands waiting. COUNT DOOKU bows.

	I bring you good news, my Lord. The war has begun.

<OBI_WAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On his way back to Naboo. He is escorting Senator Amidala home.

<DIRECTION>
They are standing, looking out through the tall windows at the great plaza below. YODA sits in his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<OBI_WAN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must admit without the clones, it would not have been a victory.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBI_WAN>
<YODA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victory? Victory, you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YODA>
<DIRECTION>
OBI-WAN turns and looks at the sad little Jedi sitting in the Council Chamber. Apart from KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON, who is wounded, the Chamber is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<YODA>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Not victory, a defeat, it was... Master Obi-Wan. Begun, the Clone War has!

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN - LATE DAY In a rose-covered arbor overlooking the sparkling late, ANAKIN and PADME stand before a NABOO HOLY MAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREEPIO and ARTOO stand by, watching, as the HOLY MAN blesses the happy couple and, amid gently falling rose petals, ANAKIN and PADME kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CORUSCANT, MILITARY STAGING AREA, BALCONY - LATE DAY PALPATINE, JAR JAR, BAIL ORGANA and the OTHER SENATORS, with TWO ROYAL GUARDS, stand looking down at the square below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS are drawn up in a strict formation or move forwards in near files to climb the ramps of the Military Assault Ships.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the balcony, PALPATINE'S expression is deeply sad. Everyone watches comberly as, in the square, loaded Assault Ships take off. Other land immediately in their place. The sky above is thick with transports. CLONE TROOPS march and board the Ships.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Great Clone War has begun...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
