As the three kick downward. Philip and Ike prepare to film. Kathryn notices Philip checking his power- head and reacts sharply. He notices and gives her a mocking salute, making her angrier yet. Turning, she starts toward the circling shark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHARK SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Intercutting between Kathryn, Philip and Ike and, on the deck of the workboat, Mike and Shelly. Kathryn moves toward the shark until it starts to circle her, Philip and Ike beginning to film.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her expert maneuvering is not lost on Philip, and he watches with interest -- Mike, on the boat deck, watches what he can with apprehension -- as Kathryn slowly lures the shark toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, it darts in at her and she jabs the spear at it (into the audience), causing it to veer away. Kathryn seems surprised by this. The shark begins to circle her again, CAMERA PANNING with her as she keeps an eye on it. Philip and Ike keep filming, Mike keeps watching tensely on the deck as Kathryn positions herself, holding the spear extended, moving it back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abruptly, the shark darts in, moving so precipitously that it goes all the way to Kathryn. She ducks and the shark's jaws clamp shut on her air tanks. Philip reacts to this and starts forward to help her as the shark begins to shake her violently from side to side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Letting go of the spear, she tries to hit the shark in the eye but has no success. Philip shows up, and she waves him off. He cannot believe her reaction but doesn't draw his powerhead, only hitting the shark on the head with the camera. This makes it let go of Kathryn's tanks and back off fast. Philip shoving it aside as it passes him, drawing his powerhead just to be safe. The shark does not attack him though, but retreats. Philip looks at Kathryn. She is shaken up, but the chain-mail suit has protected her from injury. She waves him back irritably. Shaking his head either at her or her stupidity, he backs off to Ike, keeping a wary eye on the shark as Kathryn kicks up to the surface to get another spear. On deck, Mike tries to speak to her as she grabs the spear, but she is under again before he can say a word. Kathryn grimly sets herself again. Seeing this, Philip casts his eyes heavenward, as though thinking, "Dear God, the woman's suicidal." She jabs the spear toward the still lingering shark. Finally, after making a few nervous passes, it goes for her. This time, she is able to shoot the sedating spearhead into its stomach, then kicks up toward the surface as fast as she can, the shark starting after her.

Mike and Shelly rush there, reach down, and grab her hands to haul her up. As they do, the shark comes after her. They yank her over the railing an instant before it lunges out of the water and almost bites her feet off, jaws slamming shut in close shot as it misses, its body crashing back into the water. Kathryn looks at Mike, her face decidedly pale. She attempts to smile.

	We've been looking all night, Mike. I don't think he's out there. If he drowned, I think he went down on the bay side of the gate and the current pulled him out. It was pretty strong when the men were working there.

<MIKE>

	Did you look in the intake passage?

Kathryn running desperately toward her compound. Mike trying, in vain, to get out of the cave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHARK COMPOUND DOCK - KATHRYN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Running to the sub, untying it, jumping in, pulling the canopy shut, and turning on the engine. As the SUB moves into the lagoon, she puts on the scuba mask.

BOBBY AND DAISY

Seeing her leave, they begin to butt frantically at the still-unrepaired gate opening of their pen.

O.S., we hear the SOUND OF THE SUB. No sign of the shark.

<DIRECTION>
MIKE

Trapped in the cave. He hears the O.S. SOUND of the sub and looks out, trying to see.

Inside the sub, concentrating on the cave. Suddenly, a dark form flashes into FRAME just overhead, making her jump in shock. Then she sees --

Swimming around the sub.

Starts to push out through the cave opening. CAMERA ZOOMS IN on his face as he sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, approaching again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHRYN AND DOLPHINS

Speeding toward the shark to intercept it.

KATHRYN

Her face reflecting her fear for the dolphins as she opens the canopy for Mike to get in. He closes the canopy, both looking apprehensively toward the shark.

Being butted by the two dolphins, deflecting its charge.

Spin faster, cutting the shark's maw. Bleeding, it backs off, wheeling away.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tries to drive it away, but the propellers will not turn now, they are jammed. The sub starts sinking toward the bottom. They both twist around.

<DIRECTION>
Moving away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUB - KATHRYN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Points toward the galleon. Mike hesitates, then sees that they have no other chance and they slide back the canopy quickly, push out of the sinking sub, and swim toward the galleon. The dolphins suddenly appear in FRAME, and Mike and Kathryn grab their fins, looking around to see where the shark is, reacting as they see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rushing back toward them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE, KATHRYN, AND DOLPHINS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dolphins speed them to the opening of the galleon hold where they let go of the fins and kick down fast into the hold as the dolphins wheel around to attack the shark again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOLD OF GALLEON - UP ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike and Kathryn swimming downward toward CAMERA. They kick into the dark hold, CAMERA pulling down from them, stopping. They swim past CAMERA and, in the next moment, the berserk shark appears, trying to follow them into the hold. It can't get through, the opening too small, but shatters part of the framing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE AND KATHRYN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ducking away from and pushing aside large, falling pieces of lumber. They look up, reacting as they see
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lunging down into the opening again, breaking off more of the hold framing.

MIKE AND KATHRYN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evading more falling wood, backing away as they look up at
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trying once more, getting stuck in the hold opening which is now enlarged enough for it to wedge in part of its enormous form.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - THE SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trying to get into the hold all the way, the two dolphins butting its side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE AND KATHRYN
</DIRECTION>

Mike looks around, sees something and, grabbing Kathryn's arm, pulls her further into the body of the sunken hull, CAMERA PANNING to show them moving toward the hole in the ship's side.

Still in the opening to the hold, trying to break through, the dolphins still butting its sides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE AND KATHRYN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Look at each other, then, abruptly, decide and kick upward, CAMERA with them. As they move toward the surface, they look down at
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Starting to back out of the opening it has battered into the hold entrance.

MIKE AND KATHRYN

Kicking upward as fast as they can go.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they break through, looking down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT THEY SEE - THE SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coming up at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE AND KATHRYN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not knowing what to do. They start spasmodically as the two dolphins rush up from beneath the water and appear nearby. Without a word, Mike and Kathryn grab the dolphins' dorsal fins, and the dolphins start to rush them away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CHASE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shots alternating between Mike and Kathryn being pulled along by the dolphins and the giant shark pursuing them, getting closer and closer. When it becomes apparent that the shark is going to overtake them, the dolphins make a sharp turn and elude its heavier, straight-forward impetus. Seeing where they are, Mike points downward. Kathryn hits Bobby on the side and he dives abruptly. Daisy follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dolphins diving with Mike and Kathryn as they put their mouthpieces back in. We see that they are outside the Control Room, the men inside looking out at them in shock. Mike lets go of the fin and swims to the lock, gesturing for Kathryn to do the same. She does and both take refuge in the concrete recess as the shark zooms into FRAME from behind CAMERA, rushing at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE RECESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the huge shark comes at them. Mike activates the outer door of the lock, and they are washed in just as the shark smashes its head against the concrete, jaws missing their feet by inches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shark still trying to get at them. Mike shuts the outer door and starts to drain the water from the lock. As it comes below their heads, they pull out their mouthpieces and look at each other with dazed relief. He puts his arms around her, and they lean their fore- heads together, breathing hard. The water is out of the lock in seconds; inside, men activate the inner door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Mike and Kathryn are helped in by the technicians. One of them looks toward the o.s. window suddenly.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
They whirl and look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coming straight at the window as fast as it can. With a deafening CRASH, it hits the window and the glass is shattered, a wall of water roaring in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - MIKE AND KATHRYN AND THE MEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swept across the Control Room by the giant wave of water flung around. One man is smashed against a wall and killed. Several others make it to the door, getting out just before the water slams it shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE AND KATHRYN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Putting their mouthpieces in again as the Control Room fills with water. They look toward
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With one of the technicians in its JAWS and is sub- dividing him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CONTROL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Starts flooding. A tape bank topples , crushing female technician.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IMPALED SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thrashes violently, working its way in. It's caught on a huge section of thick glass piercing its side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE AND KATHRYN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Staring at the shark. Suddenly, the air in Mike's tank runs out and, reacting, he taps Kathryn's arm. She sees his problem, takes a deep breath, and gives him her mouthpiece. They look toward the window at a loud SOUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV - THE SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still very much alive, throwing its gigantic weight forward, getting closer and closer to CAMERA, each violent lurch cutting its side open more, blood pouring from the jagged rent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE PAST SHARK ON MIKE AND KATHRYN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it gets closer and closer to them. They back away, are blocked by a console.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE PAST MIKE AND KATHRYN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Showing the shark closer yet. Despite the impaling blade of glass, despite the internal injuries, the shark -- in seconds -- will have them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MIKE AND KATHRYN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sharing the mouthpiece, huddled together, helpless now. Then Kathryn's eyes widen, both react.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shaking its head as it inches forward, jaws open wide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE AND KATHRYN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drawing back. Kathryn SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emerging from its maw is Philip's body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHILIP'S BODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the GRENADE locked in his fist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quickly grasps a metal strip from the tape bank and fashions a crude hook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Times his move perfectly and KNOCKS the grenade out of Philip's locked fist. The grenade comes to rest between the shark's TEETH. Kathryn gives Mike some air, then
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leaps forward and SNATCHES the grenade out of the shark's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hurriedly wraps a metal strip around the grenade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHRYN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Acts as a decoy and lures the shark's attention as
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULLS the grenade pin and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOVES GRENADE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Into the distracted shark's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE GRABS KATHRYN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And they roll behind a Control Room desk and computer terminal console.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the shark is BLOWN OUT backward through the window opening, torn in half by the explosion, its massive remains starting to slide toward the lagoon bottom, turning the water crimson.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE AND KATHRYN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grabbing the stunned Kathryn, Mike pulls her to the window and out, starting upward through the bloody water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER - MIKE AND KATHRYN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sharing the air, they slowly float to the surface, buddy-buddy breathing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SURFACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike and Kathryn break through. Helping each other, they make their way over to a camera pylon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE AND KATHRYN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cling to the pylon and each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHRYN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly looks alarmed as she remembers:
</DIRECTION>
<KATHRYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby and Daisy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHRYN>
<DIRECTION>
Mike looks about, no sign of the dolphins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHRYN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slaps the water hard three times. No dolphins. She does it again. And again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHRYN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now, in total ANGER AND FRUSTRATION, she pounds the water like Rocky on the punching bag until she is drained, and Kathryn breaks down sobbing as Mike holds her, trying to comfort her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOLPHINS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Come shooting to the surface! They're banged and bruised, but are chirping excitedly and as HAPPY to see Kathryn and Mike as they are to see them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOLPHINS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly swim around the hugging Mike and Kathryn as CAMERA PULLS UP to show the Sea Kingdom, in all its entirety, safe at last.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
