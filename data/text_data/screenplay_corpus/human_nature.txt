	I knew it was coming when in late afternoon, a thunderhead drifted over, sneaking in like kids through the back door of a movie theater, forced casual. It turned the sky a queer shade of green. A green that said "watch out, baby, this is gonna hurt like hell." I could've hightailed, but that would be cheating. Part of the Nature experience is recognizing its mastery over you, your smallness in the face of it.

Nathan nods to his pretty French assistant, Gabrielle, who presses a button. The Lucite domes over the salads lift.

Tentatively both mice reach for a fork. There is a tiny piece of velcro on each mouse's paw and a tiny piece of velcro on each of the forks. The first mouse picks the correct fork, and stabs it into the salad and eats happily, relieved. The second mouse picks the wrong fork. Nathan presses a button, which sends the mouse flying off his chair with an electric shock. The correct mouse keeps eating, unconcerned. Nathan makes a note in his notebook.

Not that I judge it.

Nathan hovers over the Lucite case with the tiny dinner table in it. His assistant, Gabrielle, presses a button, a door opens, and two white mice scurry in. The male pulls out a chair for the female. The female climbs up on the chair, and the male pushes the chair in, then scurries around to the other side of the table and climbs onto his own chair. The Lucite lid over the silverware and salads lifts and both mice pick up the proper forks and begin eating. Nathan scribbles in his notebook.

Nathan looks up. Gabrielle jerks her head in the direction of a very large Lucite case. Inside, Puff, now dressed in a diaper and connected to all sorts of electrodes, is stirring. Nathan and Gabrielle hurry over.
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Puff groggily takes in his surroundings. This is quite a lot to take in. The white room, the strange apes in strange suits, his own clothing, the wires. After surveying the scene for a moment, Puff becomes frightened and agitated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to escape. Not understanding Lucite, he smashes into it, again and again. He tears at his diaper. Nathan gives a nod to Gabrielle, who presses a button on a panel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An electric shock sends Puff flying. He lies on the floor confused and dazed. After a moment, he gets up and again crashes into the Lucite. Nathan gives the signal to Gabrielle and once again she shocks Puff. He once again gets up and crashes against the Lucite. Again he is shocked. He gets up again, and is about to crash against the Lucite, but he thinks better of it, and squats in place, immobilized.

	I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. How could I find myself in this mess? This is a mess. This is not a situation I understand. This is a mess. How do I extricate myself from this mess? Is my girlfriend a man? I don't understand. This is not part of any plan. She deceived me. She has hair.

	But poor Lila. Think of what she's had to go through. The courage she's had to have in the face of this abomination of nature. I should love her all the more. I should love every hair on her body. I mean, she doesn't mind that I have a mortifyingly small...

Gabrielle kneels by Puff's case. Puff crawls over, tries to touch her through the Lucite. Gabrielle sings a French lullaby. It's very sweet. Nathan watches her, looks at her thigh, her hair, the delicate way the tip of her nose moves when she sings. Puff gets drowsy. He curls up on the floor and sleeps.

Nathan unlocks the case. Puff tentatively steps out into the world. He hugs Nathan. It's a grateful, obsequious, slightly pathetic hug. Nathan hugs him back, but he's keeping him at a distance. Puff pulls himself out of the hug, but still rests his hands on Nathan's shoulders and looks him in the eye, almost like a lover. Then he parts with Nathan and goes over to embrace Lila. She graciously receives him. After a moment in the embrace, Puff starts dry-humping Lila. Lila can't get out of his clutches.

Again Nathan shocks him. Again he lands on the floor. He heaves, stands, lunges for the screen again. Nathan shocks him. This happens seven more times. Smoke is pouring out from the collar. Puff struggles to his feet. Looks at the screen. He shrugs.

	And so commenced my reeducation, gentlemen. Lila taught me so much. She was a stern but fair teacher. And over time, I began to remember the carefree joy of living in a pure state of being. But something else happened as well, something perhaps distinctly human... I began to fall in love with Lila.

He regains his composure, finds himself on top of Lila.

They look at each other for a moment. Then they kiss. It's a violent kiss. They grope each other. This is primal sex now. In the dirt. Sweaty. Loud grunting. Lila even presses the shock button at the right moment. Puff seems to like it in this context.

And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.

<DIRECTION>
The car makes a screeching u-turn. It disappears in the direction of the city. When the dust clears, we see the two white mice standing there on the side of the road, shivering and emaciated. The male holds out his the thumb and the female holds a tiny little sign which reads: New York.
