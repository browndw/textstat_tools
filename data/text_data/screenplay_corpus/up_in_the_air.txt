</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, I want you to pack it with all the stuff you have in your life. Start with the little things. The stuff in drawers and on shelves. The collectables and knick-knacks. Feel the weight as it adds up. Now, start adding the larger stuff. Your clothes, table top appliances, lamps, linens, your TV. That backpack should be getting pretty heavy at this point - Go Bigger. Your couch, your bed, your kitchen table. Stuff it all in... Your car, get it in there... Your home, whether you have a studio apartment or a two story house, I want you to stuff it into that backpack.

	That's why I don't have a "back home".

<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. You're so cool. "Mr. Empty Back Pack".
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan emotionally stumbles.
</DIRECTION>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know about the back pack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I googled you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's what us modern girls do when we have a crush.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did it bother you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that depends. Is the bag empty because you hate people or just the baggage they bring along?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't hate people. I'm not exactly a hermit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just don't want to be tied down? The whole responsibility thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think it's even that... I... First time I ever flew, I was sixteen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not going to answer? You're just going to tell me a story?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<RYAN>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles, continues story)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was January and I had just gotten my driver's license. The lakes were frozen over, so we piled into my car and hit the ice to do donuts. When, out of nowhere, I hit a soft spot and the hood of my car tilted up and I was sinking backwards into the water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I literally started to drown. Within a few seconds, I black out. Then, I wake up in the sky. I'm in a helicopter, laying on a stretcher. This guy in a uniform is telling me I was minutes away from dying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(relives it for a second)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So just as we're hovering over the hospital, I sit up. And from there, I could see the whole western horizon. We'd been flying twenty minutes. Twenty minutes to reach a city I'd thought of as remote, halfway across the state... a foreign capital.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(A BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My parents had taught me we lived in the best place on Earth, but now I could see the world was really just one place and comparing didn't make much sense. And I remember thinking - Don't tell me this isn't an age of miracles. Don't tell me we can't be everywhere at once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<DIRECTION>
The idea settles in. Ryan returns to the point.
</DIRECTION>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what originally sparked the back pack. I probably needed to be alone. Recently, I've been thinking that maybe I needed to empty the bag before I knew what to put back in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<DIRECTION>
And now they kiss. It's notably different from their previous kisses. Now, when they lock lips, we are reminded why people kiss in the first place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, all of a sudden, the lights go out on the boat. The motor has stopped. Ryan and Alex look back to find the software dude stepping out of the galley, drunk.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFTWARE_DUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey... I think we're out of gas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFTWARE_DUDE>

Ryan and Alex look out to shore... about 500 yards away. For whatever reason, they just start cracking up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PONTOON BOAT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan and Alex are huddled under a blanket in the corner of the rubber boat as it putters its way to shore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cold, soaked, and smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie and David are there too... still kissing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone gets out of the boat in the cold knee deep water and splashes up to shore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY, MIAMI HILTON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan and Alex followed by Natalie and her make-out buddy, soaked from the knee down, holding their shoes, scamper into the hotel on the balls of their feet.

INT. RYAN'S HOTEL ROOM, MIAMI HILTON - NEXT MORNING

Ryan's eyes flutter awake to see Alex getting dressed.
</DIRECTION>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you're up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got to fly stand-by and make a meeting in Milwaukee.

	Oh... Okay.

</RYAN>
<ALEX>

(notices, teasing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no. I made you feel cheap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, all right... Just leave the money on the dresser.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
(SWEETLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll text you later so we can swap schedules.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Alex gives him a peck. Ryan takes her wrist so she can't leave.
</DIRECTION>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't remember the last time I enjoyed spending time with someone as much as you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither can I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss again and he lets go. Alex leaves and the door closes. Ryan just lays in bed for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAFE - MIAMI HILTON - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan and Natalie have a quiet breakfast. Natalie looks pretty worse for wear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the background is a TRAVELING SALESMAN rolling calls. He perks up for each message then goes back to being miserable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, after a little silent eating...
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last night got a little out of hand. I said things... I don't remember everything I said. I just didn't want you to think...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just relax. It was nice to see you cut loose. So, did you wake him up or slip out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This morning... Your new friend. Did you wake him for an awkward good bye or just slip out so he could feel like a whore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<NATALIE>
<DIRECTION>
(NOT PROUD)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... just left.

<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Protocol is always tricky.

</RYAN>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know what was right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes there really is no right thing to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<DIRECTION>
This doesn't comfort her.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. OCEAN BOARDWALK, MIAMI - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The walkway overlooks a large MARINA filled with giant YACHTS. Ryan and Natalie are doing the photo thing with the CUT OUT of the engagement portrait again.
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to Alex?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had to skip town early to make a meeting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's too bad. Where does she live?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chicago.

</RYAN>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You thinking of going to see her?

</NATALIE>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. We just don't have that kind of relationship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of relationship do you have?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's, you know. Casual.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds pretty special.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It works for us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think there's any future there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never thought about it. What's going on here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really never thought about it?

(a good lie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you not think about these things? How does it not even cross your mind that you might want to have a future with somebody?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's simple, you know that moment when you look into someone's eyes and you feel them looking right into your soul, and the whole world goes quiet for a second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<NATALIE>
<DIRECTION>
(finally, a break through)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Well, I don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're an asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie knocks over the CUT OUT and stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh come on, I'm just dicking around. I need your help...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you think it's worth giving her a chance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A chance to what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A chance at something real?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Natalie, your definition of "real" is going to evolve as you get older...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you stop condescending for one second? Or is that one of the principles of your bullshit philosophy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullshit philosophy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The isolation? The traveling? Is that supposed to be charming?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's simply a life choice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a cocoon of self-banishment.

</NATALIE>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. Big words.

</RYAN>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Screw you.

</NATALIE>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, screw you too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've set up a way of life that basically makes it impossible for you to make any human connections. Now, somehow, this woman runs the gauntlet of your ridiculous "life choice" and comes out the other end with a smile - Just so you can call her casual. Jesus. I need to grow up? You're a twelve year old.

Natalie begins walking away.

A GUST OF WIND suddenly blows the CUTOUT across the boardwalk into the OCEAN.
</DIRECTION>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Fuck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan goes running after the cutout. He climbs down a GANGWAY to a dock that is closest to the CUTOUT, which is beginning to sink in the filthy water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan reaches... and reaches... and just as he's got a finger tip on the photo... FALLS IN.

Ryan and Natalie drive in silence. The weather is frigid.

Sitting on the conference table is a COMPUTER set up for a VIDEO CONFERENCE.

Ryan and Natalie have a moment aside.

Ryan fights the urge to jump in. He is sitting next to Natalie, but just out of view of the camera.

<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's perfectly normal to be upset. However, the sooner you can tell yourself that there are greater opportunities waiting for you...

	Greater opportunities? I'm fifty- seven-fucking years old!

Mr. Samuels is now on the verge of tears. Eyes red.

We remain in the room with Natalie and Ryan, but we hear Mr. Samuels crying. It's loud and embarrassing. It's coming from the next room. He's literally on the other side of the wall.

Finally, Samuels breaks from his daze. He looks up and around for a second, then gets up and leaves.

Natalie catches her breath. A second later, Samuels passes their room, visible through the conference room windows. They watch as he walks away.

A moment of mixed emotions.

INT. RYAN'S ROOM, DETROIT HILTON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan is holding the LARGE EMBOSSED ENVELOPE of his sister's WEDDING INVITATION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls out the RESPONSE CARD, looks at the line for extra guests, then sets it down. He pulls out the actual INVITATION. It looks inexpensive. Sighs.

INT. NORTH TERMINAL, DETROIT AIRPORT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan and Natalie ride the MOVING WALKWAY. Something is on Natalie's mind. She speaks up.

<NATALIE>

	I'm sorry about what I said about Alex. I was out of line.

They get off the moving walkway and stop at a GATE that reads "Omaha". Something off screen grabs Ryan's attention.

Ryan begins to walk off. Pulls out his BLACKBERRY and dials.

<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ryan, where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>

<RYAN>

ALEX enters frame, carrying the engagement CUT OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to admit, when you asked me to meet you in Vegas... I thought we'd gamble, make out in a heart shaped jacuzzi, maybe see one of those weird French Canadian circus shows.

</RYAN>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To a wedding... Jesus, Ryan. Your sister's wedding?

</ALEX>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not like I know her that well.

</RYAN>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just not sure if it's appropriate for me to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. You know. I'm not the wedding type. But for the first time in my life... I don't want to be that guy, alone with his drink. I want a dancing partner. I want a plus one. And if you can stomach it, I'd like it to be you.

A long thoughtful beat. Alex sighs.

<ALEX>

</ALEX>
<RYAN>

They do.

INT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL, MILWAUKEE AIRPORT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two ROLL-AWAYS side-by-side, moving through the terminal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan and Alex walk in unison. They share a smile. Almost like they can't believe they're getting away with something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass a LARGE AIRLINE ADVERTISEMENT featuring MAYNARD FINCH in uniform. "We Value Your Loyalty."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DRIVEWAY, CHALET SUITES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan's rental car pulls into the CHALET SUITES driveway. It's halfway between a Swiss Lodge and a Best Western. Just a little sadder. A yellow sign reads "Welcome Miller-Bingham Wedding Guests!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY, CHALET SUITES HOTEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan and Alex approach the check-in lines. Of course, there's an elite membership line, but they can't use it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan is forced to stand in a queue of three people while a CHECK-IN LADY just stands at her computer at the elite line.
</DIRECTION>
<RYAN>

INT. CORRIDOR, CHALET SUITES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan and Alex walk down the long hallway. They've been given a room at the end. Just as they're entering their room, the door across the hall opens revealing a woman in her early forties with a basket of laundry. It's Ryan's sister KARA.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ryan?

Ryan turns and stops. It's been a while...

	Kara, what are you doing at a hotel?

</RYAN>
<KARA>

	Fuck, I was hoping I wouldn't have to... Yeah, uh, Frank and I are trying out a trial separation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not staying at the house?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>

</KARA>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yup. So, you guys are dating?

Ryan and Alex fumble over each other.

	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not exactly...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, don't worry about it. We're all getting a little old to be calling someone girlfriend... I remember when mom used to call Jack her boyfriend. It drove me up the wall. Boyfriends are for kids...
	</DIALOGUE>

(MOCK ANNOUNCING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm just a divorcee!

An awkward beat in the corridor of the Chalet Suites.
</DIRECTION>
<RYAN>

	So, the rehearsal dinner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'll see you two there.

Kara humps the laundry basket down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ROOM, CHALET SUITES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan and Alex settle in. There's a cheap basket with a pink ribbon tied sloppily around some cellophane. In the basket is a packet, outlining the wedding weekend.
</DIRECTION>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a packet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What in life is worth doing that doesn't have a packet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, I love you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan is kidding, but not really. They play it off as a joke, but can't help feel the weight of this "moment".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLUB ROOM FIRESIDE LOUNGE, CHALET SUITES - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of tables have been slid together for the rehearsal dinner. Ryan and Alex find the dinner in full swing.

Ryan's sister JULIE, the bride, waves wildly.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God, Ryan!

She hops up and gives him a hug.

	Me? You're the one getting married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, right? You haven't even seen my ring.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Julie shows off her ring. It's not quite balanced and seems to favor quantity over quality.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (PROUDLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jim designed it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
JIM raises a hand. This is Julie's husband-to-be and we can tell immediately that Ryan isn't thrilled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan thinks of something. He pulls out the 5X7 PHOTOS they took of the JIM & JULIE CUT OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I brought those photos you were asking for...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
(LIGHTS UP)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh great! They go over there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Julie points to a table and Ryan walks over. When he gets there, we see almost a hundred photos pinned to a map of America. It's overwhelming. All of a sudden, his effort seems miniscule.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan begins to pin his photos on the map over the cities where they were taken. He backs away to see it as a whole and his addition has already become invisible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan returns to the conversation with his sister and Alex.
</DIRECTION>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There were quite a few already up there. Almost couldn't find room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, isn't it great how everyone chipped in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>

	What gave you the idea to do something so...

</RYAN>
<ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
(HELPS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Substantial?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Jim has a lot of our nest egg invested in this real estate venture right now. So when we went over our finances, a honeymoon just didn't seem affordable this second... So I thought... Hey, just because we can't travel doesn't mean we can't have pictures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
The idea of this lands on Ryan pretty hard.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>

Ryan is stuck with Jim, talking real estate. Alex is having a chat with the brides maids about local relationship drama.

	It's sixty acres up against the foothills. I subdivided the old Lazy W Ranch and took a nice slice for myself.

	Homes will go in the high fours.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Must be a nice development.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(CORRECTING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a community, not a development. The concept is turn-key everything. You buy a maintenance contract with the home. We'll whack your weeds, we'll even change the light bulb. Furniture? You buy your own or choose a package. Seamless traditionalism, yet all the perks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan and Alex make eye contact. There's a joy in their connection amongst the ramblings of their company.

	We all need a place to call our own. This is America. This is what we were promised.

	That's a nice touch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<JIM>

Ryan stands in the wings. He takes a breath, then steps out in front of a sea of people.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GOALQUEST XX stage is like nothing we've seen yet. Large and professional. Blue Banners hang from the ceiling. Digital projectors show Ryan's Headshot - What's In Your Backpack?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan sets the BACK PACK on a table and quickly unzips it.

<DIRECTION>
A breath.

<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Imagine for a second that you're carrying a backpack... I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders... You feel them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan isn't feeling them. He is not inspired. He isn't believable. He's barely even there.
</DIRECTION>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, I want you to pack it with all the stuff you have in your life. Start with the little things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>

Ryan is trying, but he can't find the will to do this.
</DIRECTION>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The... um... The stuff in drawers and on shelves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan takes a beat. He just stares at the backpack and thinks about all the things he has removed from it... And then...
</DIRECTION>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, Ryan leaves the stage. Handlers try to figure out what Ryan is doing. The Host runs for the mic.

Ryan steps out of his rental car and approaches the door of the townhouse - checking the address against a piece of HILTON STATIONARY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan stops, knocks, and puts on a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear Footsteps. The door unlocks and opens revealing ALEX. She's wearing sweatpants and glasses. She's at home. She looks different.
</DIRECTION>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Surprise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<DIRECTION>
But there's something else. Alex is in shock... She's frozen.

Something's wrong. Ryan's smile begins to melt.

A couple kids run by through the background, giggling. A man chases after them.

Alex is still speechless. Her eyes are angry and apologizing all at the same time.

Ryan just stands there. Emotionally bleeding to death.

EXT. CHICAGO HILTON - NIGHT

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RYAN'S SUITE, CHICAGO HILTON - MORNING

We see quick glimpses of Ryan getting ready. Crappy little COFFEE MAKER crappily brewing. Crappy hotel BAR OF SOAP crappily lathering. Crappy HAIR DRYER crappily blowing.

<DIRECTION>
(a long beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... an escape.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm an escape?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, a break from our normal lives... A parenthesis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a parenthesis?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seriously, Ryan? I can't believe we're having this conversation. I mean what do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan stumbles on this. What does he want?
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't even know what you want. I'm sorry that I ruined your night... But you could have seriously screwed things up for me. That was my family. That's my real life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<RYAN>

	I thought I was a part of your real life.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan can't quite believe what he's hearing. There's only one thing he can do. He hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ESCALATOR, CHICAGO O'HARE AIRPORT - MORNING

Ryan is walking when his phone buzzes. He checks the DISPLAY - CTC Calling. He presses IGNORE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TICKET DESK - CHICAGO O'HAIRE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan walks up to the TICKET DESK. He is more lost than usual. There is something plucky about the TICKET AGENT.
</DIRECTION>
<PLUCKY_TICKET_AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome back, Mr. Bingham.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLUCKY_TICKET_AGENT>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, right, you got me in 2C?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<PLUCKY_TICKET_AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. Left side aisle, non- bulkhead. Just like you like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLUCKY_TICKET_AGENT>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's got you so fucking happy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>

INT. BOEING 757 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan sits doing nothing. Others around him play Sudoku, read trashy paperbacks, work on laptops. Ryan just stairs at the stitching on the seat in front of him. When... "Bing"
</DIRECTION>
<PURSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special announcement to make.

</PURSER>

Passengers look up.

<PURSER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our pilot has just informed me that we are passing over the city of Mesa... which might not mean much to most of you, but means a lot to one of our fliers today, because he just hit TEN... MILLION... MILES...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PURSER>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Gershwin theme song for the airline rains down from the overhead speakers. Passengers clap. Flight attendants gather at Ryan's seat with big smiles and champagne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan doesn't even react. He's just stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flight attendants separate just enough for a man in a bomber jacket to squeeze through. It's Maynard Finch, the Chief Pilot from the commercial.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYNARD_FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
(TO RYAN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That seat taken?
	</DIALOGUE>

Maynard gives a little salute to his flight attendants, then slides by Ryan to the window seat.

Maynard pulls out a MEMBERSHIP CARD. It's actually been stamped from platinum.

<MAYNARD_FINCH>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seventh card we've made. Small club. We really appreciate your loyalty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYNARD_FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
It has a pair of wings around "Member Number 7". Ryan holds it between his fingertips... Catches his own reflection.
</DIRECTION>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know how many times I've thought about this moment? Played out the conversation I'd have with you right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<MAYNARD_FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? What did you want to say?

	<DIALOGUE>
	So, where you from?

</CRAIG_GREGORY>

	Hey, look, you know I have to ask.

	No, I don't remember anything. Of course they're upset. You never think that...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To whom it may concern, I can't even count the number of people I've fired in my lifetime. So many, that I've forgotten what it's like to actually hire somebody.
