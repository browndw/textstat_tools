EXT. LAFAYETTE CEMETERY (NEW ORLEANS) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An empty breeze blows across a deserted cemetery. We hear the sound of FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING, then nineteenth- century boots ENTER FRAME. We FOLLOW them strolling past the headstones and mausoleums. The sound of a HORSE and CARRIAGE ECHOES in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There comes a time for every vampire when the idea of eternity becomes momentarily unbearable...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
As we REACH an old stone tomb, the boots leap up and OUT OF FRAME. PAN UP to reveal:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FIGURE stands steadily atop the roof of the tomb, silhouetted against the moon like a large, black bird.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The wounds suffered from love and failed friendships don't heal like a human's, but seem to only gape larger. The longing to be mortal returns, a longing for finiteness.

	<DIALOGUE>
	In 1883 I suffered such a spell and decided to cease feeding on blood. Just lie in the earth and let time return to its natural state...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
As the WIND PICKS UP, the LEAVES of a fledgling vine growing up the side of the tomb begin to RATTLE FASTER and FASTER, until curiously, time seems to speed up. Night passes to day and back to night. Shadows from the sun and moon drift across the tomb. As days and months fly by, the vine winds and grows in circuitous patterns all around the tomb.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had hoped the sounds of the passing eras would fade out, and a kind of death might happen. A kind of forgetting where I would be healed from my wounds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The CLIP-CLOP of HORSES and the SQUEAK of PERAMBULATORS DISSOLVE INTO the THUMP and SCRAPE of INDUSTRIAL ENGINES.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But as I lay there, the sounds didn't fade but grew with the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The BUZZ of PROP ENGINES MELT INTO the sound of a JET STREAMING overhead. CARS, MACHINES, RADIO BROADCASTS MERGE INTO a medley of MUSIC from this century -- JACK BENNY, MUDDY WATERS, ELVIS, HENDRIX, SEX PISTOLS.

<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And gradually the world didn't sound like the place I had left, but something different... better...

As we DRAW CLOSER TO the now vine-covered tomb, SOUNDS of the '70s, '80s, '90s PERSIST...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A new fearless attitude had possessed the world, brave and Godless. I began to wonder if it was not time to resurrect. But the thing that eventually brought me back -- the decisive thing really -- came like a bolt out of the blue.

</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
GUITARS STRIKE, DRUMS CRACK and the MUSIC SLAMS OUT, raw and dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF GLIMPSES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slender hands with long, painted nails, Gothic rings, and a half-pound of silver bracelets play their instruments. Long hair, body piercings, Celtic tattoos, and brightly- colored nylons show a lot of pale, smooth flesh. In the confusion of glimpses, it's hard to tell who's a boy or girl, but they're all young and beautiful. Breaking in on the CACOPHONY of MUSIC COMES ONE GUITAR CLOSER and LOUDER than the rest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SCRAPING ROAR, like a bandsaw being twisted into the most gorgeous, powerful chords, almost religious in its emotion.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A music so sublime, so deeply vampiric, I had no doubt it could be heard in Hades. I had no choice... it summoned me.

<DIRECTION>
An ULTRA-FAST TECHNO BEAT BEGINS and the FULL-SOUND of a BAND RUSHES in, creating a sense of vertigo with its energy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOMB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BAND'S sounds ECHO about the stone chamber, thrumming a deep, life-giving pulse. Suddenly, the LID of a SARCOPHAGUS SCRAPES and slides to one side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LAFAYETTE CEMETERY (NEW ORLEANS) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Figure re-emerges from the tomb, his cape now in tatters -- posture bent. He creeps across the cemetery in unnatural, staccato movements as if hindered by the physics of distance and time. All the while the SONG plays, drawing the figure toward it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Figure moves through the shadows avoiding the spill of yellow light from the street lamps. Stopping in a darkened alleyway, he gasps for air, exhausted by his movements. He listens again to the mesmeric TUNE of the band in the distance, when -- From down the alley, a voice...

A MAN proffering a little parcel wrapped in foil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulling deeper into the shadows, the caped Figure beckons the dealer over. The man approaches when -- With a wild animal cry, the Figure lunges like a phantom -- A flash of teeth -- The Dealer is on the ground -- the Figure set upon him. OVER this scene the BAND'S SONG RUSHES IN LOUD again, reaching an incredible CRESCENDO as the violent frenzy continues -- the monster gnawing at the Dealer's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON FIGURE'S HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its vein refilling with the flow of warm blood -- skin regaining a youthful tautness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rising from his victim we see for the first time the revitalized face of this creature, a mane of blond hair frames the beautiful features of the VAMPIRE LESTAT -- his bulbous lips glistening red.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whether it was that first meal, the music, or the 100 years of rest, I'm not sure, but suddenly I was feeling better than ever. My appetite for living was voracious. My hearing so exact I could locate precisely the source of the music...

</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW ORLEANS HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the street, Lestat emerges from the shadows in the dealer's snug-fitting leather outfit. He looks up at an extremely run-down flophouse...
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My old house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
High in the attic, a single window glows with dim light. The source of the MUSIC. The whole house is shaking from the sound of the BAND playing upstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC - JUST AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room booms with music, speakers stacked high on all sides, literally shaking the house to its foundations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVEAL the band members of Satan's Night Out. JAMES, ALEX and MAUDY stare at each other as if in some tantric trance, as they play their music -- Alex's long fingers climbing up and down his guitar, Maudy's waifish body sensually curls around her keyboard, the waves of music flowing through them while James, on drums, drives them further into it.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was hard to believe these beings were mortal -- so confident in their skin. Everything in my body wanted to be with them. I couldn't help myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Then, from somewhere in the room, an ANGELIC VOICE begins to hum the most hypnotic melody over the tune, melding in exquisite harmony. Arching her neck in some higher ecstasy, Maudy looks across the makeshift studio and suddenly stops playing.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell, Maudy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing Maudy's stunned face, Alex and James turn to see Lestat perched like a raven on top of the stack of speakers, eyes closed, still humming to the fading reverb of the guitars. Slowly opening his cool grey eyes --
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't stop.

<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>

	The door, of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
James and Alex look at the door on the other side of the attic -- they should have seen him. Maudy stares at Lestat, quite taken by the handsome vampire's looks -- Drinking Maudy in with his eyes --

As we REMAIN ON the stunned looks of the band's faces --

<LESTAT>

Suddenly from across the room --

<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All that you've ever dreamed of will be yours.

<DIRECTION>
They spin around to see Lestat now right behind them, smiling.

They all stare at him, faces white. A beat. Then James breaks into a big smile.

<JAMES>

Maudy and Alex look at each other getting used to it. They break into smiles, going with it.

<LESTAT>

(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a bold move, I admit. But from that moment on, they were my friends, my children, my band. Together we rode on the wave of my preternatural ambition to superstardom, giving the world a new god... me.

</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
We COME ACROSS the city lights of London. Below, police cars section off a few blocks around a very sleek, ultramodern office building where a huge crowd has gathered.

<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSE: LONDON (6 MONTHS LATER)

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

<DIRECTION>
Through the crowd, a very long, black limousine snakes its way toward the building. Rows of fans dressed as Goths, ghouls and vampires scream out...
</DIRECTION>
<FANS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lestat! Lestat!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FANS>
<DIRECTION>
Girls press their breasts and necks up against the limousine. Thump! Thump! Fan after female fan flings herself on the car. Groupies scream with pure excitement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Confusion of screams as the door to the limo opens. The crowd's scream reaches a fever pitch as... James, Alex and Maudy climb out, ogle at the sight. ROGER SMYTHE, their business manager (40s), gets out next, hustling them through the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wave of hysteria hits the fans. Roger hustles the band through the crowd and up the stairs into the church, past the giant billboard with their own images written huge, Lestat's smiling face above them all and the announcement --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESTAT -- LIVE & UNDEAD -- OCTOBER 31, ALL HALLOW'S EVE, DEATH VALLEY, U.S.A.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - SOON AFTER

A high-tech conference room. The band, sitting up front, is faced by an audience of over fifty journalists and then another fifty photographers and TV cameras. The room crackles with anticipation. Roger steps to the podium.

	<DIALOGUE>
	May I present the Vampire Lestat.

</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes a button and a black curtain slides open to reveal a huge monitor on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every eye is glued to the SCREEN... CRACKLE, CRACKLE. Nothing. Then suddenly, on the screen, a face in shadow appears... Lestat. His voice booms out over the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening. I'm so sorry I'm late. I was just having my... breakfast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Lestat leans forward into the light. Hushed whispers move through the crowd. Lestat's eyes burn unnaturally bright. His white skin absolutely glows, luminous. Lestat smiles out at them with a tight smile. Then grins wider, revealing his fangs.
</DIRECTION>

</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
He points to a PRETTY FRENCH JOURNALIST.
</DIRECTION>
<PRETTY_FRENCH_JOURNALIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Lestat. You say you're a real vampire. Correct me if I'm wrong, but what I remember about vampires is you guys usually keep your identity secret.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRETTY_FRENCH_JOURNALIST>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. But why hide it in this day and age? I've hidden in the shadows for centuries. It's time to share myself with the world.
	</DIALOGUE>

In the corner, Roger gives a big winking smile to the camera crew. The journalists smile, playing along. A younger, hipper MUSIC magazine JOURNALIST pipes in...

Staring up at the dark heavens, Lestat inhales like an emperor taking in his kingdom, stretches his arms out, still drinking in the adulation.

A beautiful young woman, JESSE, 22, lays in black satin sheets. Her long red hair snakes over her slender neck as she sleeps to Lestat's voice, still as death.

A grand party is in progress. There are about thirty vampires, all thin, pale and beautiful. An eclectic group, elegantly-dressed in Indian silks, Arabic veils, mixed with a few gaudy Versace outfits. Guests lean into each other's necks, showing blood-red tongues and fangs.

Jesse puts the photo down, catches her reflection in a mirror, lit by flickering candlelight. Her face is distressed, troubled by the dream. She goes to the window, stares out into the black night.

EXT. TUBE STATION (LONDON) - THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fluorescence pierces the black night. Jesse comes out of the tube station in a tight, short skirt, boots. She looks down the street. In one direction, a busy, brightly-lit street. Jesse gazes at a group of tourists coming out of a pub, laughing. Then she turns, looks the other direction. A dark street. She hesitates a long moment, stares at the light, then can't help herself, plunges toward the darkness, the LAUGHTER ECHOING, then DYING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - JUST AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse passes "rent-boys" stepping from the shadows as cars cruise by. Jesse, unable to look away, gazes as one gets in a car. He stares back at her, disappears into the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRIDGE - JUST AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse passes couples using the shadows for privacy in the dark, filthy streets. She strides past a girl leaning against a brick wall, the man grunting, moving rhythmically against her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LONDON STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fog floats in the yellow vapor lights. Jesse pauses at the intersection of a narrow alley. She hesitates, nervous, then turns down the dark lane, disappearing into the blackness...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WAVERLY ARMS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse, from the shadows, gazes, wide-eyed, at the Soho private club's entrance, a solitary door with a faded sign and a dull blue light mounted above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse hears strange whispering. She sees now figures moving through the fog. One pushes a buzzer. Jesse stares, barely breathing, her heart pounding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figures have white, luminescent faces, strange, bright, glowing eyes. Their fingernails are glass-like. A moment later, a slot in the door opens. The glowing eyes of another creature stares out at them, scrutinizing them. The door closes quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse stands there, deliberating. She takes a step closer to the door. Stops. Takes another nervous step. She hears something, whirls around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another group of the strange figures walk steadily down the street towards her. Jesse begins backing away. A HISSING sound slowly fills the alley...

INT. LIBRARY - TALAMASCA INNER COUNCIL CHAMBER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat's face appears on a video screen in front of a room lined from floor to ceiling with leather-bound books, ancient scrolls. Subjects are marked, Werewolves, Poltergeists, Possession...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSE: SECRET ORDER OF THE TALAMASCA: CENTER FOR
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PARANORMAL STUDIES: LONDON HEADQUARTERS
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse, making a presentation, stands before an impressive and imposing group of 10 TALAMASCANS, wearing demure suits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse is excited, a bit nervous, hoping to impress. She holds a remote which controls images appearing on the large video screen. Clips from Lestat's press conference continue. Jesse gazes out at the Talamascans.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have reason to believe Lestat's the real thing. A vampire. And an ancient one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<TALAMASCAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, Jesse. It looks to me like the guy's got a good P.R. man with a flair for the theatrical.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALAMASCAN_1>
<JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
(leans forward, eagerly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would appear that way. But have you listened to his songs? Read his lyrics?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
The Talamascans glance at each other, surprised. Shake their heads. A few laugh. They're not Lestat's usual audience.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well,i have. In one of his songs he refers to a pub called the Sailor's Arms. I think it's a clue...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes a button, the lyrics appear on screen.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
(reading screen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Where are you now? Back in the sailor's arms, somewhere in the back streets of Soho?' I tracked down the old leases in London. It turns out, in the late 1700's, there was a pub right in the backstreets of Soho called the Sailor's Arms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
The lyrics on screen are replaced now by an old engraving of a pub with the sign reading "SAILOR'S ARMS."
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it had a reputation for dealing with black magic. Witches' covens, seances, that sort of thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Quick flashes of gruesome drawings appear -- animal sacrifices. A corpses floating above a table...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse talks faster and faster with her enthusiasm.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And most importantly, reports of people being lured there and subsequently attacked by bloodsucking fiends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Quick flashes of gruesome period newspaper drawings, blood pouring from the neck of a screaming woman. A white-faced ghoul with fangs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse is smiling wider, excited by her discovery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On screen, an old map of London appears.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's where you could find the Sailor's Arms in old London.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
A modern map appears, overlaying the old map.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And here is where it would be today. Of course the Sailor's Arms is not there anymore. That part of London is mostly old warehouses, meat-packing plants.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<TALAMASCAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a few years it will be artists' lofts and pretentious French cafes...

</TALAMASCAN_2>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse leans forward now as she talks.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but right now there's only one place to get a drink -- of sorts. A private club -- in exactly the same place. The Waverly Arms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
On screen, a photo of the Waverly Arms.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what happens at the Waverly Arms now makes the Sailor's Arms look like a Happy Meal at McDonald's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
She pauses for emphasis, gazing at the faces of the Talamascans, gauging their reactions.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a vampire coven. And Lestat's leading us to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Murmurs. Many of definite interest. Some of definite skepticism. Jesse's face shines bright with her enthusiasm.
</DIRECTION>
<TALAMASCAN_1>
<DIRECTION>
(skeptical)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what makes you think so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALAMASCAN_1>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse smiles. Pushes a button. Ready to receive the Talamascans' approval.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On screen, a new picture appears of several figures, white faces, dark clothes -- but they're very blurry.
</DIRECTION>
<TALAMASCAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesse, can you, uh, focus that any better?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALAMASCAN_2>
<JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
(excitement dampened by embarrassment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... it was taken... while...

<DIRECTION>
(clears throat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... in motion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Talamascan #2 smiles at her sympathetically. Jesse gazes out at the other Talamascans, sees she's losing their interest.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly, trying to cover)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But listen, if you look closely, you can see they're vampires. I'm sure of it. And Lestat's leading us to them and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<TALAMASCAN_3>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Interesting. Perhaps we should assign someone to observe --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALAMASCAN_3>
<TALAMASCAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh please, based on this so-called 'data'? That's a waste of time.
	</DIALOGUE>

	But... uh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<TALAMASCAN_2>

	Wait a second. Who took this picture?

</TALAMASCAN_2>
<JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat, softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Murmurs bubble through the entire group now. They stare at Jesse, dismayed.
</DIRECTION>
<TALAMASCAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You went there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALAMASCAN_2>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<TALAMASCAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And who gave you this directive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALAMASCAN_1>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one. I... just... went.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I know it was breaking protocol and I'm really sorry, it's just I think --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<TALAMASCAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesse! You're just an apprentice here! You must follow our rules... Or perhaps we need to reconsider your position.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALAMASCAN_1>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<TALAMASCAN_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For 12 centuries our mission as Talamascans has been to observe and record paranormal behavior. But never get involved. You're getting far too close.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALAMASCAN_3>
<JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing to photo, defending herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, does it look like I got involved? That is not called involvement. That is called running.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<TALAMASCAN_2>
<DIRECTION>
(leaning forward, trying to help)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, Jesse, tell us, what did you see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALAMASCAN_2>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse turns to her.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vampires. Gathering. I'm sure of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse steps from the podium, moving through the Talamascans as she pleads her case. She talks a mile a minute, her passion rising...
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to listen to Lestat's lyrics. They're amazing. Many of the references could only be derived from years of research in the Bibliotech de Paris, which seems unlikely for a young rock star in his early twenties. Plus there are historical details dating back hundreds of years Lestat describes that don't exist anywhere... except in our library. He refers to Marius, the great white lord, who ruled over a group of islands off the Bay of Naples in the late 18th Century. What I'm trying to say here, and maybe I'm not doing the best job of it, is that Lestat may be the oldest and most powerful vampire ever documented!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse sees some of the Talamascans are again listening. But Talamascan #1 shakes his head...
</DIRECTION>
<TALAMASCAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't make any sense. Why would he be forecasting this to the world? He's all but drawn a map and marked an X. What vampires hold sacred is keeping their kind a secret. You never name other immortals, tell where their lairs are. They'd be hunted down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALAMASCAN_1>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. That's the best part. Lestat's not afraid to piss them off. He wants mortals and immortals to know he's there, to know he exists. I don't know why...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing at skeptical Talamascan #1)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this has never happened before. Don't you see? He's a one man revolution.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
All the Talamascans gaze at her a moment. Jesse holds her breath. Has she gotten them back?
</DIRECTION>
<TALAMASCAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this photo is your evidence? It's hardly conclusive.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(snorts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon. It looks like the Blair witch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALAMASCAN_1>
<DIRECTION>
The Talamascans burst out laughing, even Talamascan #2. Jesse gazes at them, her face burning red. She's lost them, blown it. Made a fool of herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her frustration rises, she can no longer contain it. It bursts out of her.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. Well then, I guess I'll just have to go back and get better, more conclusive evidence! Maybe you just can't unravel all the mysteries of the world out there, by sitting around all day in a dusty old library in here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
As they gaze at her, astonished, she gathers her materials, starts out. Several start shouting back at her. Amidst the uproar, a voice booms across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<TALBOT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone turns. Quiets down. DAVID TALBOT stands in the back of the room. He's clearly the superior Talamascan, though younger than some, very charismatic.
</DIRECTION>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My office. Now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<DIRECTION>
He turns, walks out. All the Talamascans look at Jesse. It doesn't look good. Her face burning red, Jesse turns, leaves.

Bouncer #1 is now making out with one of the young sexy girls he let in, trying to get a hand up her dress.

	Hey, perv, get the hell out of here.

The figure steps from the shadows. The Bouncer's face turns white.

Roger tries to laugh it off. Lestat sniffs the air. As Roger backs away, he turns to open the door, stumbles, cutting his hand on a fallen shard of glass. Blood trickles from the cut. Roger looks up at Lestat whose dark eyes stare intensely at Roger's blood. Roger quickly sticks his hand in his mouth. With a horrified expression, he realizes he's sucking his blood. He quickly heads out. But Lestat is faster and reaches into Roger's shirt pocket. Pulls out a clove of garlic. Lestat shakes his head with a smile.

	You know we work in a really strange field? The supernatural is beguiling at times. It doesn't like to just be observed, it is only satisfied when it has drawn us in completely. I know cause I've felt these things myself. That's what we have to resist, as Talamascans...

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come back here. I'm gonna show you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to the paintings hanging on a wall in the back of his office, covered with black velvet. Jesse follows. He unveils them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stand before an Eighteenth-Century painting. The interior of an enormous Italian villa. There's a man in his forties with long white hair, back to us, but his face is reflected in a standing mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're all nightscapes. The detail is amazing. Mid-1500s. Florence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. And what do you see in this one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse moves to the next painting. Another nightscape, a giant medieval tableaux, circa Bruegel.
</DIRECTION>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I know it's a Dutch pastoral.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse runs her finger across the faces, then stops on the face of a gentleman with long white hair watching the bloodshed of gory battles and the sacrifices of saints burned at the stake.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This man is in both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. He's in all of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse moves to the next painting, then the next and the next, all nightscapes set and painted in the style of different eras, all featuring a portrait of the same white-maned man.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carbon tested? Yes. The different paint samples are all authentic. All painted at the time of that particular style.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse stops at a contemporary self-portrait.
</DIRECTION>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Marius, Jesse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
(whirling around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marius?! From Lestat's lyrics. I knew I was right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, you were. Good work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles at him, victorious.
</DIRECTION>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been personally tracing him for decades. My little obsession. The oldest vampire ever documented. The closest we've come to the original vampire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean the original vampire?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Pointing to a larger depiction of a beautiful woman in Egyptian garb --
</DIRECTION>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a Mesopotamian legend that there once was a queen of Egypt, Akasha, long before Tutankhamen or Nefertiti. She was believed to be the original vampire... Marius himself dates back to 400 B.C...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse gazes at all the paintings, shaking her head in wonder, then speaks softly.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David, you've been tracking Marius your whole life. Maybe he's out there waiting for you right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(without looking at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you ever want to just go and find him and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Talbot crosses to her.
</DIRECTION>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Jesus, we are not talking about having a drink at the Dorchester, Jesse. You know that. Especially with the ancient vampires -- the older they are, the more powerful, the more dangerous...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<DIRECTION>
He takes her by the arm, smiles down at her.
</DIRECTION>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, you don't need to go and stake out some club. Your time is too valuable. I have something far better for you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
He steers her over to a locked cabinet.
</DIRECTION>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. And I'll tell you something. I've never shown this to anyone. No one else has proved themself in the way you have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
(touched)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
As he unlocks the cabinet...
</DIRECTION>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh you're gonna love this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Although I'm sure it will keep you up nights to come with nightmares...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out an old leather-bound journal. Turns to Jesse.
</DIRECTION>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lestat's diary. I found it some years ago. This is where you'll find the answers you need.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse stares up at him in absolute awe, taking it in. Talbot gestures in the direction of the Talamascans in the library.
</DIRECTION>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't need to know everything, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles at him. He gives her the diary.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My pleasure. When I took you on as an apprentice, I knew it was the smartest thing I'd ever done. Now you and I'll meet when you're done... This will be our project...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<DIRECTION>
As Jesse goes out, holding the journal, Talbot smiles after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But after the door closes, his gaze turns again to concern. He crosses back to the paintings, pauses a moment, staring up into Marius's eyes. Then Talbot covers each with the black velvet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JESSE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse sits on the floor, curtains drawn, the room lit with candles. A LESTAT SONG plays in the b.g. She opens the journal.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Je suis le vampire Lestat...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am the vampire Lestat.

FLASHBACK - EXT. MEDITERRANEAN ISLAND - FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A solitary paradise in a rough, nighttime sea.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was the winter of 1788 and I was brought to a Mediterranean Island by the man who made me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
A lightning flash illuminates a sprawling 18th-Century sea-front villa.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... if a man is what you'd call him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VILLA BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A great round room encircled with candles, their reflections flickering in the great glass windows braving back the outside STORM. A huge antique bed sits in the room's center, and on it... Lestat lays feverish and fitful, dressed in a soft linen nightshirt. His neck wears a swollen bite. Another flash of lightning suddenly jolts him awake. His hands feel the inflamed wound as he sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An indistinct shape of a man dressed in draping red velvet, sitting asleep in a chair across the room. An easel stands before him, holding an unseen painting. Lestat rises out of the bed and grabs his clothes from a nearby Louis IV chair. He makes for a door when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat suddenly stops. He looks back to see the painting that stands on the easel. It's a portrait of himself in ancient Roman garb, like the god Mars, complete with his blond hair and fiery blue eyes. Unable to help himself, he approaches the painting, completely fascinated by his own image, when suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sleeping man leaps up, grabs Lestat unmercifully and again plunges his teeth into the young man's neck. Lestat fights as best he can but his strength is no match as he's slowly drawn down to the floor. Finally...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The strange man lifts himself up from Lestat's neck to reveal the face of the vampire MARIUS, the mysterious figure. Wiping his blooded mouth on his painter's cloth --
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lestat. Welcome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Weakened and helpless, Lestat drags himself back across the floor in terror.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you? Do I know you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm unknowable by nature.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Marius advances again on the young man...
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you may call me Marius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
As Lestat keeps weakly dragging himself away.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the lord of a great manor. They'll send an army of men to look for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I doubt they'll find you, Lord De Lioncourt. You're a long way from home...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
His strength leaving him, Lestat slumps flat on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're weak... near passing. I can barely hear your heartbeat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll kill you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Marius smiles, impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really do fear nothing. It is why I chose you. Because you think things are possible which aren't possible...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat stares at him, his eyes wide.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chose me? For what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My companion. Someone to share my burden.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Bending down, he gazes at Lestat.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've lost a great deal of blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(near tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm dying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Marius draws a knife from a Roman sheath on his belt. With the last of his strength, Lestat grabs his attacker's wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Guiding Lestat's hand with the knife, Marius smiles and cuts his own arm, opening his veins. Lestat stares in true terror as Marius lets his blood drip onto Lestat's lip. Lestat pulls away as the blood slides into his mouth...
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, is it not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
And indeed... it does taste good. That's the new terror that's gripping him. He crosses himself and stares up into Marius's gentle eyes. Marius bends down, cups Lestat's chin.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drink and live. You've been brave enough for one night, my son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Marius brings his open vein to Lestat's lips. Lestat hesitates, but then suddenly... Feeds hungrily as Marius's face fills with the bond. He slowly sinks down to his knees as Lestat feeds and feeds. As Lestat drinks, a barrage of IMAGES flood into him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IMAGES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of Marius's life through the ages... Impressionistic, subliminal burst of IMAGES, color... the glory days of the Roman Empire to this very moment flash by...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO LESTAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He keeps drinking from the vampire Marius who gasps with the creation of his child.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drink... drink and learn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat's body grows stronger, his back arching up as he draws the "life" into him with full force, as... Marius begins to weaken, himself.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There... there... that will do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
But Lestat keeps on feeding hungrily.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... no more. Lestat, no more!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
With one great move, Marius pulls Lestat off his arm and tosses him across the floor twenty feet away. Marius reels back, clamping his open vein with his hand as Lestat curls on the ground, gasping ecstatically from the rush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, Lestat starts to feel something. Pain begins travelling through his body, consuming him until he screams. Marius crosses to Lestat convulsing on the floor. He kneels and gently wipes his brow. Lestat's body thrashes as he grabs at his own limbs...
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be afraid, it's only your body that dies...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Wiping his brow as he dies...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, Lestat's face still buried in his arms, he begins to laugh almost drunkenly. Raising his head, his metamorphosis is clear as his face pales and his eyes fill with a new kind of power.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat smiles with red glistening lips. A beat on Marius as he slowly smiles, too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A million stars...
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I impressed my maker with my thirst for things. He set out to educate me in the unknown. Taught me all about the world, its hidden history... and about myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
TILT DOWN to reveal an old fisherman who cries out as Lestat bites into his throat. Marius watches as the fisherman's body relaxes. He pulls Lestat away.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's enough, my son... When you feed, you must hold back from the moment of death. You must never take the last drop, or it will draw you in and you will die...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
The fisherman is moaning. Looking down at the suffering victim, Marius swiftly snaps his neck and dumps him into a boat. He picks up an oar, and with vampire strength, drives it like a stake through the bottom of the boat. Water starts bubbling in.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember, there is wisdom in the flesh, Lestat. A man wears his history on his skin...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Marius feels Lestat's gaze, turns to him.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm talking about humanity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
As Lestat watches the water begin to fill the bottom of the boat...
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Humanity?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(snort)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're murderers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're more than that. Their blood that we take into us carries with it life... their life, their knowledge, their complexity. Appreciate your prey, Lestat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Marius gazes at the fisherman, then, with vampire strength, shoves the boat far out into the ocean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below the brightest of summer night skies, Lestat and Marius walk along, talking intensely. The ocean appears to shimmer in the faint light of stars. In the distance, several bonfires burn on the sand, dancing figures gathered around.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My senses run amok, like a newborn child. And as for my new powers, I was beside myself with the pleasure of it all...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The trick is to find the way to face eternity head on. The spirit can be annihilated by boredom just as the body can be destroyed by sun or fire. My solace, my delight, is witnessing the unfolding of human destiny...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat gazes at Marius's eyes dancing with intellectual fervor. As they walk, they pass a group of teenagers, just younger than Lestat, at a bonfire, dancing, laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat gazes over at them as he and Marius pass, hidden in shadow.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... From Christ to the Dark Ages to the enlightenment, I've never been able to divine what was coming. That's what keeps me going -- I can't wait to see what human beings are going to do next...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat nods, taking it in. They pass another bonfire. MUSIC floats through the night. An OLDER MAN, 50, plays balalaika while his daughter, 18, plays violin with great passion.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who could've predicted the Enlightenment? Or Hannibal and his elephants?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Marius stops talking, turns. Lestat is no longer beside him. Marius turns back and sees Lestat standing in the shadows, listening to the music. The young woman, sensing something, turns towards Lestat in the shadows as she plays. Marius goes to Lestat, pulls him farther into the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But why must we hide, Marius? We are the powerful, we are the immortal. We should walk fearless in the open!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhh. The life of a vampire is a life of discretion. We must sleep during the day, when we are vulnerable to the sun. Mortals must never know about us. It is forbidden, for the sake of all our kind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(gazing at violin player as it sinks in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I could never know her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not unless you wanted to kill her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(beat, quietly, intensely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I can never be known?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're known by me. I granted you that. There are others of our kind... though most are solitary creatures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat's eyes fill with some existential realization.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget God. You're no longer in his realm. Now we must leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Relenting, Lestat starts to follow. But the music quickens. Lestat pauses, turns back. As if the music is calling to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girl still faces into the shadows towards him, and plays fast and wild, her fingers flying. Lestat stands there frozen to the spot. The music pulses through him. He gazes at her fingers, studying their intricate movements intensely...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Impulsively, Lestat goes back to them, hovers, his face still somewhat obscured by the darkness. Lestat starts clapping along to the music, exuberantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girl and Father smile, nod to him as they play. Marius, in the shadows, is fuming. Lestat's eyes fill with the moment, the girl's vitality. He notices that sitting on the ground by the girl are several instruments. Impulsively, he reaches over, picks up a violin. He studies the girl's playing again, then with his new powers, as if by osmosis...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Begins to play with exactly her skill, exactly her movements.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girl and her Father laugh, delighted with this new musician. Lestat plays along with them, joyful, exhilarated. The girl's fingers fly. Lestat's fingers pick up speed. Faster. Faster. A glittering torrent of notes fly out of his violin as if made of gold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unconsciously, Lestat steps closer to the music, into firelight. The Father and his daughter become less certain, as they gaze at Lestat's strange, pale, glowing skin, the luminous shine of eyes. But Lestat is completely taken by the music, the moment. The Father and the daughter, sensing something strange, stop playing. Lestat looks up. Sees terror in their eyes. The Father is slowly backing away, pointing in horror at Lestat.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fantasma!! Teras!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Lightning fast, out of the shadows, steps Marius. He grabs the Father. The girl drops her violin, turns, starts running down the beach to a bonfire in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop her, Lestat!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat turns to Marius, shaking his head no in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat hesitates, then runs after the girl. She turns back, sees him getting closer, starts to scream... Lestat is suddenly in front of her with his hand over her mouth, covering her muffled scream. Her struggle is no use against his strength. Reaching up to her neck, he touches it. He looks into her terrified eyes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ISLAND'S SOUTH SHORE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marius kneels over the body of the Father on the island's deserted shoreline. Tosses him in a boat. Lestat gazes at the lifeless body of the girl. Marius turns to Lestat, furious.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not have you put everything at risk! You will mind our laws!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Picking up Lestat's victim, Marius tosses her into the boat as well.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We remain in the shadows. To do otherwise is a road to destruction...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Marius turns to Lestat, who stands in silence, gazing at the girl and her Father.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see you still have a few lingering mortal emotions. They will serve you no good, Lestat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat turns to Marius, shaking his head, speaks in a horrified whisper...
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God, what have you done to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat turns again toward the bodies of the dead girl and her Father, his face filled with pain, enormous sadness.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's just a child... forgive me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
EXTREME CLOSEUP - LESTAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
closes his eyes. A violent VIOLIN STRAIN as we PULL BACK to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat standing alone in the bedroom, in a deep reverie, playing the girl's violin with incredible passion. His playing picks up speed as he works himself into a Pagnani furor...
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The faces of my victims haunted me, rising behind my eyes, reminding me of my fate... I played for days trying to expel the last bit of my human feelings... and face the cold, dark wasteland of eternity...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
The violin dissolves into Lestat's ROCK MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO JESSE (PRESENT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reading the journal, listening to LESTAT'S MUSIC. She hears the lyrics... "Mine eyes dazzle, she died so young..." She looks up, her eyes fill with tears, moved by Lestat's loneliness. She gazes into the dark night... then turns, sees her camera...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET (LONDON) - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse moves steadily along the street past darkened warehouses. Several bonfires line the lane, illuminating rows of prone bodies, cardboard shelters, empty bottles. The drunks look up at her with dead eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse goes deeper into a labyrinth of alleys, the street becoming darker with every step. In the distance she sees the blue light. Figures moving through the fog. Jesse moves slowly along a wall in the shadows trying to get a better look... Suddenly, out of the shadows, a BOTTLE SMASHES... She starts, quickens her pace...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Runs straight into a bulky figure. A primal scream rises from her stomach. The figure is a homeless drunk, more scared than she is, who scuttles off quickly into the night. Jesse presses her back against the wall. Breathes. She inches around the corner...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WAVERLY ARMS - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and from the shadows, gazes at figures knocking on the solitary door in the wall up ahead, with the dull blue light mounted above. The slot in the door slides open. A moment later, the figures vanish inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later, two couples approach, dressed in black. Jesse takes a deep breath, then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... falls into step behind them. One knocks on the door. A face peers out at the group. Steps back. The door opens. Jesse follows the couples in. The door shuts behind her.

INT. CLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music is part blues, part Kurt Weil, part Gothic, dark and ominous as if the pianist knew exactly the sort of trouble Jesse was in. The bar is comprised of elaborately-carved Chinese dragons, a TV mounted incongruously in the corner showing a silent Vampire Lestat video.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Couples dance cheek to cheek, rotating like figures on a music box. Another couple is necking hot and heavy in the corner. Jesse stares at the patrons of this vampire coven. Many of the faces are unnaturally pale, gaunt. Their eyes shine with a strange, reflective light. Jesse moves through the tables, passing a mortal YUPPIE-TYPE sitting with a VAMPIRE GIRL he's obviously just met that night.
</DIRECTION>
<YUPPIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. This is the coolest after hours club ever. You sure you don't want a drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YUPPIE>
<VAMPIRE_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAMPIRE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
The Vampire Girl smiles, glances up at Jesse as she passes. Jesse looks away quickly, moves on... The pianist watches as she passes by. The couple necking in the corner begins to get even more aroused. A mortal girl sips on her drink while her lover, a vampire, kisses her shoulder, her throat...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNKNOWN POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unaware that she is being watched, Jesse continues her circuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Jesse approaches the bar where three PUNK VAMPIRES slouch, looking up at Lestat on the video.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNKNOWN POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We watch the Punk Vampires and hear every word they say as the other SOUNDS FADE AWAY.
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK_VAMPIRE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every coven's going...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUNK_VAMPIRE_1>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVEAL unknown POV. A vampire, face hidden behind a hood, seems extremely interested in what the Punk Vampires are saying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO PUNK VAMPIRES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A young girl dressed in Goth gear sits down at the bar. Punk Vampire #1 turns and smiles insincerely at her as she stares up at Lestat on the TV. Getting a sudden chill, the Goth girl takes her drink and moves back into the crowd as the vampire looks after her with murderous eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JESSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reaches the Punk Vampires. They fall silent as she pauses at the bar. She turns, stares at the necking couple...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JESSE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... a brief glimpse of the tiny trickle of blood on the mortal girl's neck as she swoons... an even briefer flash as her vampire lover comes up for air, his lips and teeth shiny with blood...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JESSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stares, horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK_VAMPIRE_1>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come here often?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUNK_VAMPIRE_1>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse turns to see Punk Vampire #1 leaning towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, all the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
The Punk Vampire pulls down her collar.
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK_VAMPIRE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't see any marks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUNK_VAMPIRE_1>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You haven't seen the rest of my body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<PUNK_VAMPIRE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that an invitation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUNK_VAMPIRE_2>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse finds herself surrounded by the three Vampires. She shakes her head, too frightened to get out a response.
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK_VAMPIRE_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, where's your host?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUNK_VAMPIRE_3>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My host... oh he's here somewhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
She peers into the darkness, starts moving towards the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finds herself blocked by Punk Vampire #2.
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK_VAMPIRE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your host. What's his name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUNK_VAMPIRE_2>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse looks around, trying not to panic. Pale faces, pale eyes stare at her. A long, terrible pause... Suddenly --
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marius...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
HOODED FIGURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leans forward, surprised, studies this strange mortal, fascinated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK_VAMPIRE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. Don't know the guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUNK_VAMPIRE_1>
<DIRECTION>
The Punk Vampires laugh. Jesse desperately tries to cover her terror.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marius has the blood of the ancients flowing in his veins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<PUNK_VAMPIRE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There aren't any ancients left. They all turned to dust...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUNK_VAMPIRE_2>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a myth. Marius is around here somewhere...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse again heads for the door. But Punk Vampire #1 has appeared in front of her. She stares at him, terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You... you really should meet him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<PUNK_VAMPIRE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And why is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUNK_VAMPIRE_1>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse watches the other Punk Vampires slowly begin to close in on her. As she speaks, she slowly edges to the door...
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because... because... he's wise, a philosopher... he asks the big questions. Like how are you going to get through eternity? It's easier for us mortals. Life is brief, but for you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
She inches toward the door, desperately stalling. Their white faces gleam menacingly as they close in. She struggles to get the words out...
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean... what can you really do with immortality besides just slip from one day to the next, trapped in a void of meaninglessness, relieved only by your next victim? How do you not give in to despair and just wither away from boredom, hopelessness?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
The Punk Vampires pause, staring at her, as her words sink in. The hooded figure leans forward revealing his face...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is Lestat. He stares at Jesse, amazed. Jesse glances desperately at the door. It's just a few feet away now.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, it's like they say -- the more things change, the more they stay the same. For you that's forever, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
All around her, vampires are turning to look. The Punk Vampires stare at her, eyes narrowing. Jesse is now inches from the door. She can barely breathe. Punk Vampire #1 gazes at her, his confusion suddenly turning to anger.
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK_VAMPIRE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, you're really a downer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUNK_VAMPIRE_1>
<DIRECTION>
He bares his fangs. Jesse bolts out the door... PAN ACROSS vampire faces staring after Jesse TO Lestat who gazes at her, absolutely entranced. He watches the Punk Vampires head after Jesse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse hurries up the alley. Breaks into a run. But the three Punk Vampires from the bar have somehow gotten outside. They land in front of her, beside her, behind her. Heart racing, she shakes with fear. They close in, smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK_VAMPIRE_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now this isn't gonna hurt. You might even enjoy it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUNK_VAMPIRE_3>
<DIRECTION>
He runs his hand up and down her body. Jesse starts to shake. She breaks out in a cold sweat. The others grin. He picks her up by the throat. Her legs flail in the air...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the two vampires turn and hiss like cats. Jesse hits the flagstones hard with a grunt. She gasps for air, looks up as the vampires are hurled out of the alley by an invisible force. Jesse alone, turns, still woozy. Finds herself staring at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse's eyes open wide, entirely stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drinks her in with his eyes, marking the soft paleness of her skin, her long, red hair, the flush on her cheeks, her pulsing jugular.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse stares into his entrancing grey eyes, tries to gather herself together, half fearful, half titillated. They gaze at each other, the air suddenly electric.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You saved me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps... So you know Marius...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse notices her rucksack cast aside by the Punk Vampires -- Lestat's journal sticks out. She glances at Lestat. He mustn't see it. She steps away, tries to distract him.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know a lot of things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
He gazes at her. Moves closer, breathing her in, making her flustered. He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not how to stay alive apparently.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I guess we've got that in common. Although I think I'm a little ahead in the race here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat, surprised at her brazenness)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I can fix that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
He circles her. Jesse is shaking, terrified. Enjoying the game, Lestat smiles, moves closer. But Jesse suddenly blurts out.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Mine eyes dazzle, she died so young.' It's about the girl with the violin, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
That stops Lestat. He gazes at Jesse, surprised. Recovers his composure. Stares at her intensely, regarding her anew.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it? And what else do you think you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
(desperate, stalling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... I think you're a lot like Marius, Lestat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(staring into her eyes, probing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I? Tell me all about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're... you're both artists. He's a painter. You're a singer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
As she speaks, Lestat guides Jesse over to a pile of crates. She stares at some beer bottles shattered on the top of one. He guides her hand downward, closer to the shattered glass.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that so? What I do is art, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... From nothing... you try to create... something beautiful...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking now as her
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	hand gets closer
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
and closer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... out of the... the cold, dark wasteland of eternity...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at her, the words oddly familiar, then scrapes her finger along the bits of broken glass, gravel. She gasps with pain...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat gazes at the drops of blood that appear, glistening on Jesse's finger...
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something beautiful...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But... but Marius isn't a rebel. You're different in that way. You don't want to hide, follow the laws, concealed in the shadows like some insect. You... you still want to walk with the living, don't you, Lestat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
He stares into her eyes, slowly brings her bleeding finger toward his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm not hiding now, am I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
As her bleeding thumb gets closer and closer to his mouth...
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, but the only time you're not really alone is when you kill... But, Lestat, you can't help it... it's not your fault... He made you this way...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(with her blood on
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	his lips, shakes
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah. Poor, poor me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
As he brings her finger closer and closer to his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes bore into each other, he stares at her rosy cheeks, the cold sweat on her forehead, taking in her remarkable, if foolhardy daring. Her eyes gazing straight into his...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He brings her bleeding finger into his mouth. She may swoon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat's eyes burn as he tastes her for mortality, her fragility a brief second, listening to her blood. there's something there that surprises him as he gazes at this mortal girl. He feels something. Desire...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then her blood speaks to him as Lestat's eyes fall on her rucksack. He sees the journal. It all falls into place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat's lip curls in anger. He shoves Jesse away. Wipes his mouth. The mood suddenly changes.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Talamascan, you're certainly a very clever librarian, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at him, found out. He turns from her, laughing, but not the kind of laugh to make Jesse think all's well.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How sad, you people always trying to know the unknowable... So, was it a good read? My diary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse slowly nods, admitting to all. He shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talamasca's been following me for years. I've never known one to be so brave. Or is it just foolish?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... I'm only an apprentice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
He waves her off, dismissive.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go. I'm through with you. Your kind never satisfies my thirst.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
He turns, walks away. Jesse lets out a sigh of relief, then stares after him. She hesitates, then suddenly calls out:
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does anything, Lestat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
A pause in his gait. But he keeps walking away. Jesse hesitates again, but still calls out.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, what's the point of coming into the light if not to have someone really know you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
But he keeps going. She takes one last chance --
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want the world to see you're real, don't you, Lestat? Don't you? Well, here I am!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Lestat spins. Stares at the fragile mortal girl risking everything. Flash. Jesse gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He now stands right before her. He grabs her, pulls her to him close, tight, hard. He could just snap her neck and be done with it.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You better just stick to your books, Talamascan. 'Cause you have it all wrong. I love all this. I delight in it. The dark, dreary world I went to sleep in has burnt itself out and been replaced by the 20th Century -- can you imagine my joy at waking up to discover such a world? It has outdistanced my wildest dreams of it. I scream of good and evil, and mortals stand and cheer. I adore being back in action... every moment, every single drop of it! Now consider yourself exceedingly lucky and go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes her away. She gasps, humbled by his physical power.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She retrieves her rucksack. Starts away. As she reaches the end of the alley, she pauses, takes a breath, turns back, daring everything.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lestat!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back, stares at her, astonished.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's something you left out of your diary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(amazed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
(stares right into his eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You kept her violin, didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, then Lestat shakes his head, laughs at the absurdity of what she's saying. But Jesse is undaunted.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, it's okay. I understand...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After all, it's only human.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
That stops him. Their eyes bore into each other again. Electric. Then Lestat hisses at her, the inhuman sound filling the alley. Lestat lunges, fangs bared. Jesse screams. Turns. Runs. Finds herself --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUSY STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the midst of traffic on a busy street. People walking by.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
She stands there a moment, happy, amazed to be alive. Then it sinks in. She realizes -- Lestat let her go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She glances back at the alley, but Lestat is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She brings her finger to her mouth, slowly sticks it in, tastes her own blood, shivers with fear -- and something else -- desire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What she doesn't see is...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat in the shadows, silently watching her. He gazes at her youth, her bright eyes, her daring, her mortal passion. She has affected him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches as she turns and runs away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

The CAMERA TRACKS WITH two young GROUPIES as they walk through the lavish palace.

	Oh, please...

They crack up.

<DIRECTION>
INT. LESTAT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat enters the bedroom. Behind him, Lestat's dressing room stretches off into the distance, rows of beautiful suits made from the finest wools and silks. The gradation of colors is spectacular. Peering out at the near-dawn light, a look of loneliness clouds his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses to the closet. Opens a panel to reveal a safe. Stares at it a moment. Punches in the code. It swings open to reveal something wrapped carefully in black velvet. Lestat unwraps it delicately. It's the ancient violin.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clever, clever librarian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
He quickly puts the violin back, closes the safe door. He shakes his head, tries to laugh it off. But a shadow remains on his face. Lestat hears a gasp. Turns. Roger has just entered.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't see you come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Roger, you wouldn't have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So this house is fine I assume. To your liking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. For the moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll be here for what? A week you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... I wouldn't unpack if I were you. ROGER
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right... the... girls you asked for. They're in the guest wing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah. Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat gazes at the door, pensive.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want me to take them home later?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat smiles at the clumsy attempt to protect the girls.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thank you, Roger. I'll make sure they're taken care of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Roger nods, trying to hide his nervousness. Lestat smiles...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LESTAT'S GUEST WING - SOON AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA MOVES OUT INTO the lavish room TOWARD the two girls who are now dreamy, floating with the effect of the joint they are smoking. REVEAL Lestat as he approaches the girls. Looking up, they smile childishly at their host, then fall about laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think we've met.

He smiles. She offers a joint.
</DIRECTION>
<GROUPIE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want some?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUPIE_1>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat calmly shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<GROUPIE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUPIE_1>
<DIRECTION>
Circling the couches, he just smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<GROUPIE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hungry?
	</DIALOGUE>

<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>

The girls laugh nervously. Lestat laughs dangerously...
</DIRECTION>
<GROUPIE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hungry for something else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUPIE_1>
<DIRECTION>
She opens her legs provocatively. Pacing across the room, he stands before the girls. He curls his finger around the first groupie's hair when a shadow crosses his face.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mine eyes dazzle, she died so young.

Losing enthusiasm, Lestat walks away and drops himself onto a couch. With a clap of his hands, the TV switches ON. He silently watches one of his video clips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girls glance at each other, then, giggling, crawl over toward Lestat. Groupie #1 slides her hand slowly up his leg.
</DIRECTION>
<GROUPIE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, don't you want to have some fun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUPIE_1>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches for his belt. But he recoils at the touch and slides off the couch onto the floor with grace.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do that.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The Second Groupie giggles as well...
</DIRECTION>
<GROUPIE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you ever been tickled by four hands at once? Hey, can you take both us, Lestat? What'd'ya think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUPIE_2>
<DIRECTION>
And at once they both start after Lestat on all fours to tickle him. He gazes at them, torn, then laughs at the sight and gets down on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All fours as well as he leads them around the room in a childish game.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Let's see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
They try to tickle him but he stays just a few feet ahead of them the whole time. The girls giggle as they pursue...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat crawling just ahead of them across the floor and... Up the wall. The teenagers keep giggling as they watch him ascend the wall like a spider. They can't believe what they're seeing as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat reaches the wall's top and now crawls upside-down across the ceiling. The girls begin to giggle and half-cry... as they arch their necks all the way back to see... Lestat crawling down the opposite wall. The girls sit open-mouthed with terror as Lestat reaches the ground --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He heads straight for them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girls begin to scream... SCREAMS CONTINUE OVER...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACKNESS.

She hangs up. Can't quite believe what she's doing. REVEAL Jesse is heading for a boarding gate at Heathrow airport. She hands over the ticket, boards the plane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID TALBOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in his inner sanctum. He looks at all the paintings. His neat, protected world. It's as if Marius is taunting him. He slams his fist down in fury. Stares at the rising dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PLANE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse puts on headphones, listens to LESTAT'S MUSIC. As she opens the journal, LESTAT'S MUSIC DISSOLVES INTO VIOLIN...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK - INT. VILLA - BEDROOM - LESTAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat standing alone in the bedroom in a deep reverie, playing the violin, with incredible passion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His playing picks up speed, the bow bending across the strings with a maestro's speed and precision.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Marius was impressed with my thirst for knowledge... But it
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	turned out that there was such a thing as knowing too much. There were things Marius was not yet ready to teach me... and Marius and I parted ways.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the bow flies out of his hand and slides across the floor, jamming itself under an old bookcase. Lestat comes out of his spell, walks across the room to the bookcase, bends down to cleave the bow out from under it. Having difficulty, he pushes back an old rug on the floor when he sees something...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carved into one of the floorboards is an Egyptian eye with a hole dug out of its iris. Stepping aside, he realizes he is standing on a manhole. A beat ON Lestat as he thinks... Poking his finger through the hole of the Egyptian eye, he lifts the manhole to reveal a steep set of steps leading down into the villa's basement.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marius!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. Lestat looks around wondering what to do. Taking a candelabra off the table, he ventures down the stairs, peering down into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARIUS'S VILLA - SECRET STAIRCASE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat negotiates a circling flight of stone steps, winding its way into the lowest bowels of the villa, still carrying his violin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARIUS'S VILLA - UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat finds himself facing a steeply descending passageway that stretches into darkness. He tests the stones ahead of him with caution...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the sconces along the passageway come to life... In quick succession, they flare up and burn with an unnatural intensity. Lestat, struck with curiosity and wonder, puts down his candelabra and ventures forth. We FOLLOW Lestat as he rounds the corner and stops. There is an open foyer area leading to two great wooden doors, held firm by a tree-sized carved wooden bolt that bars the doors shut from the outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the BOLT flies up and SPLINTERS with a SHRIEKING CRACK. The doors fly open revealing a bright light from within... Lestat, apprehensive, continues towards the open doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SANCTUARY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat enters, squinting through the bright light from scores of burning sconces. At the far end of the sanctuary Lestat makes out the shape of two statues, an Egyptian man and an Egyptian woman sitting stone still, seemingly staring straight at him, AKASHA and her King, ENKIL. We recognize Akasha from the sketches in Talbot's office. Stepping closer, they appear not to be statues at all but rather alabaster humans with the palest skin imaginable. His eyes widen at the sight of their clothes -- the most valuable Egyptian finery; bracelets of gold, headdresses of incredible gems, clothes of silk. Staring up into their faces, Lestat is struck with the realization...
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're... alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat is drawn to the woman -- her form and beauty is exquisite even in its absolute stillness. As if this statue had just asked him to play, Lestat holds out his violin.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like me to play for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes still bore into him. Lestat smiles. He raises his violin and begins to play.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The song of the VIOLIN ECHOES around the walls...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat plays, with increasing abandon...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Akasha and Enkil sit frozen...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat plays and plays, lost in the music. He throws a glance up at the throne and stops...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Akasha is moving...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, her eyelids pull back to reveal pale green eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat stares in amazement... Her arm rises up, her wrist extended outward towards Lestat. The pulse of a HEARTBEAT begins... Lestat moves toward her as if beckoned. A green vein appears beneath the marble surface of her skin. The vein pulses as the blood courses around. The HEARTBEAT POUNDS LOUDER, DEEPER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound fills Lestat's head as he is drawn closer to Akasha's wrist. Lowering himself, as if genuflecting, Lestat bends closer to the vein which looks like the very font of life to him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VILLA ROOF - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marius sits under the stars, painting, when his hand begins to tremble... Suddenly, he drops his brush, startled by some unexpected feeling that passes through him. He stands bolt upright as a frightening GUST of WIND sweeps across him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SANCTUARY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat sinks his teeth into Akasha's vein, drawing in the unimaginable font. A burst of image and color floods into him, as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESTAT'S IMAGES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of Ancient Egypt... power... supremacy... slavery... all impressionistic, subliminal... the bright burning sun, red lips, blood spurting like a fountain...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END OF IMAGES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARIUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in the sanctuary, hovering over Lestat, who lays on the stone floor in a catatonic state, staring. Marius looks down upon him, the sconces above blazing high with flames. Marius's VOICE ECHOING furiously...
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have you done, Lestat? Lestat!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARIUS'S VILLA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat lays in bed, feverish, his skin paler than ever. At the foot of the bed stands Marius.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lestat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
The young vampire's eyes bulge open in the grip of some incredible sensation, smiling the most wicked of smiles. Lestat's chest heaves upward, pulling his body with it, only to be jerked back by the manacles that hold him to the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so, my little lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat writhes with a physical delight that is almost painful. Lestat realizes he is shackled to the bed with manacles and chains. Struggles against them.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You've drunk the purest blood. Seen the oldest of things -- far too much for one as young as you. You've been unconscious for days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, her blood is like liquid fire.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(squirms)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She... she is your mother, my mother... Akasha, the Queen of all who are damned. And he is her King.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Release me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat struggles with all his might. One of his manacles splits, releasing a leg. Marius stares, surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She made you quite powerful.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(withdrawing a saber from its sheath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't make me use this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat still struggles. The manacles strain.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marius, please, just one more time. I felt the sun. The light, Marius, the light!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly pressing the knife to Lestat's throat --
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lestat, listen to me! I have watched over Akasha and her King for 2000 years! They must never awaken!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat stares up at him.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Akasha and her King nearly drank this earth dry when they ruled over Egypt. They drank until they lost their will to drink. They became living statues. And yet Akasha still sustains the life force of all vampires. It is believed what happens to her, happens to all of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat gazes up at him, taking it in. Marius moves slowly away.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If she were ever to rise, she would again desiccate the earth! She has no respect for anything except the taste of blood. Immortal and human alike...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat roars and struggles against his manacles.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll not stop me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Marius stares at him, shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hear her blood in your voice... In all the years I've cared for them, not once have they moved...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until tonight. And she chose me! Me! Never you! You'll not stop me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Marius moves at super-speed, grabs Lestat by the neck, and pins him down.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are part of a great coven! You take responsibility for your kind!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(snarls)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must have more!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat, lost, looks at Marius, his eyes intoxicated with Akasha's blood. Marius steps back. Looks at his fledgling with great sadness, anger, disappointment.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I chose you for your bravery, but I was wrong. You know only selfishness. I can no longer trust you... It gives me no pleasure to look upon what I have created.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Marius turns his back on Lestat. Lestat stares after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARIUS'S VILLA - NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH the balcony we see the last warm colors of the sunset vanish into the blue of night. Lestat awakens, his manacles removed. He stretches, shakes his head, as if clearing his head, but something causes him to stop... Something has changed. Marius's paints have gone. Some of his paintings remain, but his easel and paint boxes are removed, leaving splattered outlines on the faded marble floor.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marius!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
No response.

Lestat runs down the staircase, which is dark except for the candelabra in his hand.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MARIUS'S VILLA - UNDERGROUND SANCTUARY

Lestat throws open the doors and enters to find... Akasha and Enkil have been taken, as have the thrones and most of the royal paraphernalia.

Lestat runs down the beach, the sand showing no footprints.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Many times since, I have called to Marius. I howled into the night in loneliness and pain.

Lestat screams into the darkness, filled with despair, grief. He disappears off into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But there was no answer -- just the endless procession of days, months, years... My teacher left me to my darkest lesson -- that in the end, we are alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat looks up from feeding on a mortal. Wipes the blood from his mouth, gazes into the dark night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PLANE - NIGHT (PRESENT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse closes the journal, her eyes wide with the new knowledge of Lestat's past. She sits there a moment, speechless, then stares out at the vast, black night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TILT DOWN TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOLLYWOOD SIGN (LOS ANGELES) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSE: LOS ANGELES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN DOWN to Lestat standing on the edge of a very high fence high above the sparkling lights of downtown, gazing into the dark night. The fence encircles his Hollywood Hills home, a high-tech modern version of a medieval fortress of steel and glass, hidden deep in the canyon, his only neighbors, chaparral and coyotes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat closes his eyes as if listening to something. As we PULL BACK again, and RISE UP INTO the sky, a LESTAT SONG begins to play and magically we are in the MUSIC and with a visual splash we are... MOVING SWIFTLY ACROSS the globe with the MUSIC -- as we CUT ACROSS the world INTO the west and INTO... The night fallen over Asia where we soon find ourselves in...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ASIAN FACTORY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where LESTAT'S MUSIC plays for the evening shift over a sweatshop BOOM BOX.

<DIRECTION>
INDIAN MARKETPLACE

where LESTAT'S MUSIC plays from SPEAKERS in a shop window. We TRAVEL WESTWARD TO...

ANCIENT GRAVEYARD

where the... Ground splits open before our very eyes. From out of the dirt, a beautiful teenage boy stands naked...
</DIRECTION>

VAMPIRE ARMAND

He pulls the pieces of a worm-eaten coffin from his person, as the MUSIC travels further to...

MASSIVE ANCIENT STONES

<DIRECTION>
parting as another resurrected figure rises from the darkness and reveals itself to be...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VAMPIRE PANDORA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With one self-assured twist of her head, she shakes the red dust from her hair to reveal long curling black tresses falling down over her dark-skinned shoulders. The MUSIC travels further to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PORTABLE RADIO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
held by a camel driver camping out in the Sahara Desert. His CAMEL BRAYS fearfully... The camel driver stares before him, drop-jawed and terrified, and we now see what he sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMEL DRIVER'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A corner stone of a desert sarcophagus begins to move, as a figure in tattered rags emerges from the sarcophagus and unbandages his face and neck, shakes the sand from his hair and eyes to reveal a skeletal form with white leathery skin bulging with strange blue veins...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VAMPIRE KHAYMAN offers the driver a polite smile. The driver faints back into the sand as the camels bolt off. And still LESTAT'S MUSIC plays as we finally END UP AT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SANCTUARY OF AKASHA AND ENKIL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An OVER the SHOULDER SHOT of Enkil sitting motionless in his throne, not resurrecting at all. Akasha and her throne remain O.S. We MOVE CLOSER to reveal... Enkil's throat gapes, torn open, and whereas before his skin was pale, it's now a chalkish powder. And next to him... Akasha's throne sits empty. A god again walks the earth. A GUST of WIND suddenly blows and Enkil crumbles into white dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tall, shapely female flight attendant sways down the first-class aisle of an airplane, her back TO us. She stops by a seat where Jesse sleeps uncomfortably. Pulling out a blanket, the attendant drapes it over Jesse, tucking it closely around her neck, then, curiously, the stewardess leans down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON LIPS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
begins to sensually kiss Jesse's neck. We begin to hear the BEATING of a HEART, getting LOUDER...

INT. LESTAT'S HOUSE (LOS ANGELES) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat suddenly glides through an open door and calmly touches ground. He empties his pockets out on a coffee table. We see a --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - BOX OF MATCHES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Sky Bar."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dabbing his mouth with a handkerchief, Lestat tosses it on top of the matches to reveal fresh bloodstains on the cloth... a look of loneliness clouds his face.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate bedtime.

He turns, enters his bedroom, closing the door behind him.

<DIRECTION>
INT. LESTAT'S MANSION - STRANGE POV - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We find ourselves in the strange blue-grey world of a VAMPIRE'S POV, walking THROUGH Lestat's mansion. PAST his band, James, Alex and Maudy, laying in the studio in a hazy sleep from yet another night of debauchery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We MOVE menacingly INTO... Lestat's expensive living quarters, PAST the huge glassed-in space and into Lestat's private hall, leading to his bedroom door. We ENTER easily, PASSING the enormous bed, and CONTINUE THROUGH INTO a smaller, darker chamber... OVER TO Lestat's coffin, stealthily APPROACHING his "sleeping" figure laying closed-eyed and almost peaceful-looking, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESTAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
bolts up and looks around the room to see... nobody. Lestat's instincts are as alive as they could ever be as he scans the room with all his powers, and to his utter surprise finally sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A painting leans against a wall, turned front-side-over. Lestat gets out of his coffin and goes over to the painting with trepidation. He turns it over and then smiles to himself. It is a portrait of Lestat as a rocker. The hand and style are unmistakable.

EXT. SUNSET BLVD. - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat and Marius sit perched on a giant billboard advertising Lestat's concert. Down below, Sunset Strip is filled with Goths, club hoppers, HONKING CARS, a traffic jam.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Impressive. Reminds me of mad old Druids running around chanting in the forest. Very primitive stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out there. My fans. Thousands and thousands. They worship me. Millions of arms reach out to embrace, beg me to come into their lives.

<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's what you've always wanted.

Lestat looks at Marius, trying to understand.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't you hear it? Or is the applause all you can hear now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Marius becomes eerily still. A deep, somber TONE starts to VIBRATE. The GROUND RUMBLES. Lestat taken aback, remembers the scope of Marius's power. Lestat stares at Marius, then closes his eyes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON LESTAT'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the sounds of the WORLD seem to FADE AWAY, revealing beneath the cacophony of mortals a DEEP PULSE like the beating of a heart the size of a planet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat suddenly opens his eyes as the sounds of the WORLD rush BACK IN. Marius stares for a beat, then --
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Akasha has risen. She has taken her King's blood. Absorbed his power. You've done it this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat stares at Marius, letting the knowledge sink in. Then he grins.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good! I'm glad she's risen! Let her come.
	</DIALOGUE>

</LESTAT>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Not the same! You've only known Akasha dormant. She too will find you. She is choosing her moment. She has come to destroy you, Lestat. And in her wrath, she will devour everything that moves. Mortal and vampire alike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles at Marius, softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well then, it's every vampire for himself. Just the kind of rules I like. The rules you taught me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Marius is enraged, tries to control himself. Lestat gazes at him, speaks steadily.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you remember your first words to me, Marius? 'I am unknowable.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd rather not exist at all than have to live eternally as a ghost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you're taking everyone with you, you fool! We were once mortals, too. It is our heritage we protect!

	<DIALOGUE>

Lestat turns, leaps off the billboard, disappearing into the black night. Marius stands alone.

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAMPIRE COVEN BAR (LONDON/SOHO) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No mortals in sight. Amongst various vampires, we spy the Vampire Lover talking to the Punk Vampire who tried to attack Jesse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VAMPIRE BAR - FRONT DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vampire doorman opens the door and peers out. A figure moves towards him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AKASHA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
glowing, beautiful, majestic. The vampire doorman is frightened, but mesmerized as she moves in...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAMPIRE BAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The barman looks up at the sound of the DOOR SLAMMING. He does a double-take and watches in awe as... Akasha steps in. Everyone in the bar turns. She smiles at all the undead staring at her.
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes sweep the room, taking in every inch, searching, then she hears a Vampire Lestat VIDEO PLAYING. She whirls around quickly to the TV -- gazes at the video intensely. Her eyes narrow, focus on Lestat, speaks as if to herself.
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmm... his scent is fading. He was here too long ago...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
The Vampire Lover slides up next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<VAMPIRE_LOVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like him, love?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAMPIRE_LOVER>
<AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
(still staring at TV)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He reminds me of someone I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<VAMPIRE_LOVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All he's gonna remind you of soon is a pile of bones. We're gonna dismember him. Bleed him dry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAMPIRE_LOVER>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Is that what you're going to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to Vampire Lover, takes him in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As if with a new idea, smiles at him, moves to the dance floor, moving to LESTAT'S MUSIC, her eyes closed, swaying sensually, her hips gyrating. The dance is seductive, slow, her head thrown back. The vampires turn, stare at her, mesmerized, aroused by her movements. They move to the dance floor, watching. Akasha opens her eyes, smiles at them, then turns to Vampire Lover, points to him, beckons. He smiles back, happy to be chosen, moves onto the dance floor. She dances a little farther away. A game. He laughs. Moves closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON VAMPIRE LOVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears a LAUGH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO AKASHA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But she's disappeared. He turns. Akasha's behind him now. He stares at her. Her hips are gyrating, her body slithering. A moan escapes from him. Again, he moves to her, reaches for her. She laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON HIS PUZZLED FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's dancing across the floor now. Vampire Lover's smile is not so friendly now. He steps toward her, determined... She moves behind him. Her body pressed up tight against his. He smiles, shudders with a rush of desire. All the other vampires watch, envious. Her lips brush his neck, her hands run up and down his body pausing on his chest. He reaches for her. She kisses him just as he kissed the mortal girl. On Vampire Lover's face, pure pleasure...
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then again, you could always do this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Akasha sinks her fangs into his neck and at the same time, plunges her hand down. We can't see where... We STAY ON Vampire Lover's face as Akasha disappears FROM FRAME. The sound of BONE SNAPPING, the SQUISH of RIPPING FLESH. LOUD SUCKING. A look of horror appears on Vampire Lover's face. Akasha REAPPEARS. In her hand, she now holds...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... his dripping heart. She brings it to her lips, sucks again thirstily...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vampire Lover gurgles as she sucks the heart to a dry husk, then tosses it. She turns back to Vampire Lover, his face frozen in a grotesque mask. She laughs, drops him unceremoniously to the floor...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Akasha turns to face the rest of the horrified vampires. They begin to back away. But the DOOR LOCKS itself LOUDLY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Akasha sways again to the music, moving faster now, as if refreshed.
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn up the music!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
The terrified barman quickly COMPLIES.
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles, to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I do love the 21st Century.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Akasha turns to the terrified barman again, pulls him over the bar and attacks him as if she were just reaching for a snack. He flails but is overwhelmed by her strength...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Vampire Girl who Jesse saw vanish with the Yuppie, flies towards Akasha, knife raised, but Akasha just turns... Suddenly there is an EXPLOSION of FLAMES. The Vampire Girl screams as she is consumed. The piano player and guitar player go up in flames...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All hell breaks loose as the other vampires run for the door. The lock won't budge and it's too late anyway as the flames overwhelm them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And THROUGH the flames, we see Akasha smiling, now sucking on the Punk Vampire's aorta like it's a straw. She tosses his body, her long tongue slowly licks her bloody, thirsty lips. She strides out through the flames. In a whispery, sing-song voice.
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lesta-at... come out, come out wherever you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOLLYWOOD SIGN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marius stands in the hills by the Hollywood sign, gazing down, his brow furrowed, at Lestat's fortress-like mansion hidden in the canyon below. The WIND BLOWS the trees, bushes. Marius turns, uneasy, sensing something, peers into the shadows cast by the brightly-lit sign. Marius stares as a figure emerges from the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is Mael, a vampire, his face hidden in a cloak.
</DIRECTION>
<MAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marius, you've broken your oath. You were to watch over Akasha and Khayman. You are a great disappointment to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Marius looks up to see all the Ancients now stepping from the shadows. KHAYMAN, the desert vampire, in Egyptian dress along with PANDORA, the dark-haired beauty in her sari, ARMAND, the boy sage, in his Mesopotamian robes. Last, MAHARET steps from her grand door. She is beautiful with long red hair, alabaster skin.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pandora, Armand, it's been a long time. Khayman, Maharet, to what do I owe this honor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<KHAYMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have been summoned because of your errant child...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KHAYMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Khayman crosses to the edge, peers menacingly into the distance at Lestat's house.
</DIRECTION>
<PANDORA>
<DIRECTION>
(giving deep, sexy laugh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's quite the devil, isn't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANDORA>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His music mocks us, Pandora!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<PANDORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His music moves my blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANDORA>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep your amorous thoughts to yourself. His music is a threat to all vampires. We will let the covens dismember him at his concert.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<MAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. It will set an example.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAEL>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see how this solves things. This isn't thought through.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<KHAYMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marius, we understand your affection for Lestat, but your duty is to us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KHAYMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He gazes again down at Lestat's house with a threatening glance. Turns to Marius with a look of warning.
</DIRECTION>
<KHAYMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could always get rid of him right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KHAYMAN>
<MAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. We will contact the covens. Let them know we condone the slaying. It will be better for all to see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Marius, with a tortured expression, gazes at Mael. Maharet steps up.
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. Never mind Lestat! We have greater problems...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
(stepping up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maharet is right. It is Akasha we face now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<PANDORA>
<DIRECTION>
(joyous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it true, Maharet? Has our Queen really risen!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANDORA>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be so happy, Pandora. I knew Akasha when she walked this earth. I was her slave. I am now her enemy. I know what she is capable of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. We've all felt her presence, even as she hides from us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as others nod,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	acknowledging the
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
truth of this)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does she want now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She knows only one thing. Taking pleasure in destroying life. She is already killing the young ones to build her strength.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's sucked the life out of her King like a praying mantis. I sense she is getting closer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She has come to destroy Lestat, but he will only whet her thirst more...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<DIRECTION>
The Ancients look to each other, taking this in. Pandora looks around, suddenly nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we act together, we have a chance to destroy her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<DIRECTION>
They all gaze at Maharet, astonished.
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! We must destroy her immediately! If she is not stopped, I'm afraid of what will happen to the entire mortal world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<MAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But can she be destroyed? I am left to bear the scars of the last attempt on her life. She was dragged into the sun. She survived. But we almost didn't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Removing his hood, we see his terribly-burned face. They all stare at him.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happens to our Queen happens to us. If Akasha dies, we die as well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then so be it! We must take that chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<DIRECTION>
She gazes at them all intensely, as the meaning of her words sink in.
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We must destroy Akasha. For the sake of humanity! We must find her. Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But perhaps she has come to kill Lestat and then will go back to her slumber. That is our only hope.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<PANDORA>
<DIRECTION>
(eager)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. That's right. She and the covens will take care of that brat. We must go to the concert and pay our respects to our great Queen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANDORA>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How? With your own throat! You've all been asleep too long! You're still dreaming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<DIRECTION>
Marius steps up beside Maharet.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maharet speaks the truth. It is our only hope.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Marius then goes and stands beside Maharet and Khayman. The others gaze at the three standing together now.
</DIRECTION>
<MAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Armand is right. We will go to the concert and first see what she does. There may be no need for action.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Pandora and Armand nod their assent. The two groups face each other. Maharet gazes at their faces, spits out the words.
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you go to the concert and you shall see!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I thought the Ancients became wise with their years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<DIRECTION>
As we REMAIN ON the Ancient Ones, AKASHA'S HEARTBEAT creeps back in over... Marius gazes again down at Lestat's house, anguish on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MERCEDES - CLOSER ON ROGER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
cruising the Hollywood streets, wearing sunglasses, hat. He sees something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROGER'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Goth girl on the street in front of a record store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO ROGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sighs, pulls over. Gets out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him now we see a cab pull over. It's Jesse, trailing Roger. She gazes at him intently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JESSE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roger's back is TO us as he talks to a Goth girl in a whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO JESSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse pays the driver. Gets out. Gazes at Roger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LESTAT'S HOUSE (LOS ANGELES) - SOUND STUDIO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOUD, intense MUSIC as the band rehearses. Lestat creates a fantastic melody around the beat. He lets the note trail off, eyes closed, smiling, the REVERB still RINGING in the room. Lestat hears something, turns. Outside, in the Hollywood Hills, DOGS are HOWLING across the canyons like wolves. Lestat crosses to the huge glass doors, goes outside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat stares out at the ominous night. As Maudy and the band continue to play, the wolflike HOWLS in the night get LOUDER. And beneath it all, a DEEP PULSE BEATS. The song comes to an end. Lestat turns, gazes back at the band THROUGH the window, at their excitement. He comes back inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roger now stands there, a nervous look on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The... girls you asked for, Lestat. They're here, in the guest wing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah. Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat gazes in that direction, pensive.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was uh... just gonna go catch a movie at the Chinese. I don't suppose you'd all want to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat smiles at the clumsy attempt to protect the girls.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thank you, Roger. We'll entertain ourselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
As Roger leads Lestat to the guest room, he can hear FAINT GIGGLING. Lestat turns back to the night. The PULSE of Akasha still ECHOES in his ears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GUEST WING - JUST AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roger and Lestat walk in. A young GROUPIE giggles nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<GROUPIE_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God, it's him! It's really him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUPIE_3>
<DIRECTION>
She turns in paroxysm of excitement to the girl next to her. Lestat stares, taken aback. It is Jesse. Dressed in Goth gear. Jesse stares back at Lestat brazenly. A long moment.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps you would like a tour of the place... first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<GROUPIE_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah, wow, we'd love that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUPIE_3>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roger... would you be so kind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised, relieved)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Right this way, girls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
As they start off, Lestat puts up his hand, points to Jesse.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roger. Not that one. Leave her to me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
The other groupie pouts, disappointed. She goes out with Roger. Lestat turns to Jesse... considers her...
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must be very keen to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse's heart pounds with terror.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Talamascans have become quite stealthy. I didn't know infiltration was quite their style.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not. I... I came on my own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at her, taking her in.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you find me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been tracking your manager for days...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing to her Goth outfit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I figured out you simply have to look the part.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clever librarian... You should know, based on all your research, that groupies don't ever find their way out of here again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not a groupie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat gazes at Jesse's pulsing jugular. He steps closer.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why are you following me? What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
(terrified, in a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you granting wishes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles, in a whisper playing with her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last wishes. What's yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show me what it's like to be you. That's my last wish. Grant it, Lestat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at her, feeling some connection with this strange mortal girl. She stares at him with penetrating eyes. He again finds himself drawn to her. Tries to fight it.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(turning away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have time for this.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand why you're doing it. You have to be who you are, no matter what happens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns, gazes at her. She steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But how are you spending what may be your last night on Earth, Lestat? As you always have... Alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse takes a breath, crosses to him, stands very close, stares up into his eyes. He stares down at her, amazed, his heart pounding. He breathes in her hair, the scent of her skin.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't kill me yet. Let's spend our last nights together. Share it with me. Show me what it's like to be you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know what you're asking! I don't know what's in that librarian's head of yours, but it's not what you think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. You don't know what's in my head, Lestat. Do you want to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll know when I kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, Lestat, that's a great way to get to know someone. Here. I'll give you a preview. Coming attractions. This is what you'll find.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
She crosses to him, stands close.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have this recurring dream that I'm a child and I'm living in this big house filled with vampires. And every night when I go to sleep, I wish to God the same thing... you know what that is, Lestat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
He gazes at her. She leans forward.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That I will have the dream again... Because in the dream I'm happy. And the dream is more real than my life... I don't know how, but I know you, Lestat... My life is a big mystery and you, you have the answer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
He gazes at her, being taken in, tries to resist it. Jesse moves even closer. He stares down at her, the softness of her skin, her penetrating gaze, the heat of her body.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't go on pretending this life of mine is real. I can't live a lie... I'm just like you Lestat. We're the same...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are we? I seek the light. You seek the shadows.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. We're looking for exactly the same thing. You know it... Please. Show me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at her. Her eyes gazing directly into his... Suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse breaks into a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This may be painful for a mortal. You're still attached to your skin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
(an excited whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Close your eyes. Don't breathe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Her heart pounding, fluttering her eyes closed, Jesse holds one deep, hesitant breath and... Flash -- with preternatural speed --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESTAT AND JESSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
whisk through the night, flashing past trees and houses. Opening her eyes for a moment, Jesse watches the world whiz past her at incredible speed and suddenly -- they stop on a dime.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse gasps, catching her breath to find herself at Hollywood's highest peak overlooking the city laying out before her like a glimmering blanket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRIFFITH PARK OBSERVATORY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking out over the observatory's ledge, Jesse can't believe what's just happened. She laughs, intoxicated by the experience.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do that again!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat laughs, impressed by her bravado. Her trust. For a moment she laughs like a child. Then they look at each other deeply, feeling something. He wants to kiss her. She knows it. He turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now for my next trick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat pulls out a knife, quickly slices his arm open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse gazes at his blood dripping down his arm, something stirring in her. Magically, the wound heals up. She stares, impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did it hurt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. For just a moment. But as the pain is more intense for us, so is ecstacy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gazes at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, we love our victims.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love? I thought it was the blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, although the taste is so rich and sweet. Love is the essence of the dark gift. The connection is so much more satisfying, brief as it is, than anything else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat again becomes aware of Jesse's pulsing jugular, the white flesh of her neck. He reaches out, touches her neck, strokes it. Jesse shivers under his touch, terrified, but wanting more. Lestat brushes his lips against her hair, her neck. Runs his hands down her arms. She closes her eyes, lost in the gentle rhythm of his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you drink, you feel the heart weakening... it struggles even though there's no hope. You feel the life slipping away, the flash of those brief years. The taste of mortality you can no longer experience... and it is beautiful...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pulls away sharply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No 'relationship,' no commingling can ever reach the heights of that experience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
But Jesse steps forward. Lestat turns, stares at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes burn with an urge that will not be silenced. One button at a time, her fingers quivering, she opens her blouse down to her navel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat stares as Jesse removes a long, silver hairpin from the mane of her red locks which then cascade about her shoulders. Her face remains aimed unwavering at Lestat's as she brings the hairpin down to her breast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With her eyes moored to his, she draws a line with the point across her breast. She inhales through clenched teeth... then settles as we see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The long incision go from pink to red; then the blood, like a hot spring pouring over the brim and dripping down her chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat staggers. Breaking their stare, he accepts her gift, lapping up the overspill and then onto the wound itself. Lestat closes her eyes... He comes up to her face, brushing his lips against her cheek. She shivers...
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(groans)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your blood...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
(murmurs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you like it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
(losing himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
He comes down to her slender neck. Stares at the soft, pulsing skin. He bares his fangs.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering, overcome)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it to me... Please... With your blood I'll know you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON LESTAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can't help himself. He moves to Jesse's white neck... closer... closer...
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll know everything...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
But suddenly her words catch him... His head flails as he tries to stop his natural impulse. Lestat lets out a desperate cry and throws her aside. Jesse gazes at him, surprised. He looms over her, angry.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to know everything. You want to see what it's like. Then come! I'll show you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat and Jesse quietly move among the trees. Lestat stops on a dime -- senses tuned. He looks into the dark. Jesse is about to speak when Lestat raises his finger to her lips and then points at... A couple of lovers moving across the meadow. They sit on a park bench. The woman giggles drunkenly. Jesse watches and gasps as she realizes the male lover is a vampire. Lestat moves forward. Jesse gingerly follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taking his lover in his arms the vampire begins to bite her neck... Lestat looks over at Jesse who watches, fascinated and disturbed. The vampire senses another's presence -- stops and turns to reveal his vampire eyes shining in the dark. Lestat steps into the halo of a street lamp and hisses. Sensing Lestat's power, the vampire hisses and instantly -- the vampire is gone. Jesse turns to Lestat but he has disappeared, too. Spinning around again she sees... Lestat hovering over the mortal woman who is still in a swoon. Checking to see that the vampire is gone, Jesse moves closer to the bench.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she alright?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat looks up to face her, revealing his blood-stained lips. Jesse reflexively looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come closer, Jesse. You want to see? You want to know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lestat, no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat's expression turns cold as ice -- he arches his back like a great cat and goes in for the kill. The woman's body convulses... Jesse watches in horror as... the woman's hands clutch at Lestat, her back stiffens... finally her legs relax in an obscene parody of orgasm. Jesse gasps, backs away. Lestat finishes and, wiping his mouth, approaches Jesse.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see now? Are you ready? Now do you want it?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
He gazes into her eyes, finding himself desperately wanting her to say yes. The horror, the revulsion in Jesse's face says it all.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Of course you don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
She backs away from him, now terrified. Something's changed in his eyes. They are cold, blank.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I didn't grant your final wish.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was an impossible wish to begin with. You see, I am unknowable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes still as death, he starts moving away.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lestat! Wait!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat turns toward her suddenly, grabs her forcefully, pulls her into his arms, gazes into her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good-bye, Talamascan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse closes her eyes in terror, knowing her life is about to be over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Jesse reaches for her mouth as if she were touched by something when... the IMAGE of Lestat's lips kissing her lips flashes by in VAMPIRE TIME as... Jesse's face is completely still in HUMAN TIME. As her hand drops, she realizes what just happened. And with that, Lestat disappears. She stares into the night. There's a SWISH and the sound of RUSHING AIR. Jesse turns, screams, backs away. It's not Lestat standing there at all but Mael, the Druid vampire. With great speed he glides towards her, envelops Jesse in his cloak, muffling her cries... WHOOSH.

STARING EYE

<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to reveal a porcelain doll, beautiful, perfect but unsettling. We TRACK ACROSS rows and rows of dolls from different eras. TRACK PAST the billowing floor-to- ceiling curtains to reveal Jesse -- still an adult, but lying awake in bed just as she had as a little girl. Jesse gets out of bed, trapped in her own childhood memory. Is she dreaming now?

Making her way down a long hall she passes an amazing array of medieval tapestries.

Jesse as a child picking at the thread of a wall-hanging in a large room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)

She stands wondering -- eyes moving back and forth with rapid thoughts when... She sees a door at the end of the hall. Walking a little faster now, she draws toward it as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK - INT. HALLWAY

<DIRECTION>
Jesse as a little girl, wanders down a similar hall toward what sounds like a COCKTAIL PARTY. Reaching the thick wooden door she peeps through to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse stares up at an enormous mural dominating the far wall -- a mural of names, a family tree -- extending up onto the ceiling and down to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK - MURAL

Jesse, as a little girl, walking beside Maharet, looks up at the mural.

<MAHARET>

Jesse takes the tear and goes to put it to her mouth but Maharet violently grabs her hand. Young Jesse is frightened.

	Forever is a very long time.

Jesse looks up out of her memory to see in the doorway down the end of the hall...
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, my princess.

</MAHARET>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aunt Maharet?

Jesse rushes to her. Stops. Stares at her aunt's glowing eyes, the strange pallor of her skin.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a...?

</JESSE>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Oh, Jesse, I've missed you so much, but I had to keep this from you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse stands there, soaking it in. Maharet takes her hands gently.
</DIRECTION>

</JESSE>
<MAHARET>
<DIRECTION>
(strongly)

	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You are not. I was once mortal, too. My sister died before her child was one year old. I took care of that child, and her children, and her children's children...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<DIRECTION>
Pointing up to the huge family tree...
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is our family -- my way of coping with eternity. The labyrinth of life. The family teaches me the rhythms and passions of each age.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<DIRECTION>
Her finger trails down the great line to a name -- "Jessica Reeves"...
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are my most prized light. You are what keeps me connected to the world of the living.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse stares at Maharet, amazed.
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When your parents died I took you to India to take care of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And something happened there.

</JESSE>
<MAHARET>

Maharet stands close, gazes at her.
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesse, you must stay away from Lestat. You must forget all about him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse looks at her, surprised. Maharet smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I know about your new friend. You think you love him, but it's not as you thought it would be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse stares at Maharet, surprised she understands so well.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I was like him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, but it is not who you are, not who you are meant to be. You have found that out now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse sits on a stone bench, confused. Maharet smiles sadly, feeling Jesse's inner turmoil.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lestat's all I can think about... I felt like I belonged with him. Now I know why...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Maharet sits beside her, speaks emphatically.
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesse, you must forget about him. You must trust me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<JESSE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.

</MAHARET>
<DIRECTION>
Just then the gloom of the pre-dawn's light begins to illuminate the windows of the great hall.
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will go home to London in the morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse holds Maharet's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this is my home. This is where I belong. Why do you want to get rid of me so quickly?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Maharet touches her face gently.
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now is not the time to be here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<DIRECTION>
The light is getting brighter. Maharet stands.
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were seeking answers. Now you have found them. The family is who you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<DIRECTION>
Maharet goes to Jesse, wraps her arms tight around Jesse. Despite the coldness of her skin, Jesse warms to the embrace, closes her eyes, holds her tight. Then, beaten by the sun, Maharet stands, exits into the shadows, turns back to Jesse, gazes at her.
</DIRECTION>

INT. LESTAT'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat stands by his bed, playing the ancient violin... a long mournful note. He stops a moment, lost in his thoughts. A flash of the first morning light reflects off the ancient wood. Lestat puts the violin away. A tear of blood trickles down his cheek. His face is filled with sadness at what will never be. A word escapes from his lips.

Jesse moves down the hallway past paintings of vampires. She pauses at one of Maharet. As Jesse shifts, the glass over the painting catches Jesse's reflection. Jesse moves slowly until her face just covers Maharet's. In the reflection, Jesse's eyes now glow with Maharet's luminescence. Jesse stares a long, long moment.

Jesse walks away from the house. Coming to a highway, she reads a sign -- "DEATH VALLEY 120 miles." Just then, a VW minibus barrels down the road in Jesse's direction. She sticks out her thumb... The minibus pulls to a stop on the shoulder in a cloud of dust. A VAMPIRE DRIVER leans out the window -- not a real vampire, just a kid with white face-paint and fake fangs.

Marius smiles. Talbot is awestruck -- the goal of a lifetime's searching. He tries to say something, but it's too late. Flash. Marius is moving through the crowd at unnatural speed. Enormous pipes spout flames high into the sky, run like a corridor of red light along the crowd, leading to two enormous Egyptian effigies of Akasha and Enkil flanking a stage at the top end. And before the stage stretches a mass of human bacchanalian debauchery... Woodstock on mescaline. Naked bodies, pierced and tattooed, mingle with the strangest of fashions as crowds gather in circles around their own lit fires, drumming out awesome rhythms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The whole place is an enormous flaming mosh pit -- naked bodies walk across heads of people while others get tossed and thrown. This crowd is determined to get what they were promised... Nothing like they've ever seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A new world, a world of the initiated who have somehow managed to include themselves in the select number of attendees to a sacred rite. And among the mortals are the immortals. Amidst them we see the tattooed Vampires, the Armani Vampire, the others, now dressed in cloaks which they use to hide their knives and sickles.

Standing on the strange rocks are the Ancient vampires, except for Maharet. Some of whom can't help but smile at the scene below. Marius is now with them.

INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Backstage is all abuzz with pre-show energy; press everywhere. Roger still worrying and sweating. James, Alex and Maudy sit in their own circle, jamming with their unplugged instruments, psyching themselves up for the biggest night of their lives.

BACK TO CROWD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse makes her way through the throng, trying to get closer to the stage. Suddenly the torches go out sending the place into utter darkness. A stunned moment. The place goes berserk. We see the dim figures of the band take their places. Jesse desperately tries to push toward the front.

Lestat readies himself as he scans the valley from behind a speaker, and sees...

BACK IN CROWD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM, the torches relight and an enormous CHORD surges through the crowd louder than a jet on takeoff. The mass surges forward... The stage lights up in a huge halo of blood-red light. The band plays a hypnotic tune that would put the devil in a spell, as... We wait for Lestat. The band keeps playing the pounding cadence, as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The audience doesn't see Lestat anywhere and cheers over the sound, and it seems as if the whole of Death Valley is shaking, when... Lestat appears above the stage, inhumanly levitating and...

</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
The place erupts into one solid scream as the band kicks it in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He swoops down through the air over the stage and into their very midst. Jesse, in the crowd, screams up to him... But her voice is lost in the thousands of screams for him. Lestat takes the microphone and leans his lips into it, letting his voice soar into an inhuman note, filling the valley like a demon demanding heaven be replaced with hell.

BACK TO CONCERT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pulsing strain moves into a faster beat as the whole place resonates with the most incredible harmonics, the energy throbbing, the crowd almost genuflecting in front of this papal devil. All move and sway except for... Jesse, desperately squeezing through bodies trying to get closer and closer to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat, who commands the place with his echoing voice. Lestat holds the place in the palm of his hand. Lestat's dark soul seems ready to burst as he moves his voice into an even higher unworldly octave, and then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESTAT'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vampires move through the crowd. Goth girls in the front row, weeping... Maudy, James and Alex off in the clouds, playing the best music of their lives. The place has gone wild, living off its own energy now as waves of sound bounce through the valley band up into the night sky.

<DIRECTION>
All yell that they have, but the covens know it's for them. Lestat launches the band into a new number that makes the previous song seem like a lullaby. He eyes the coven-assassins here and there and sings straight to them. His lyrics challenging the assassins, flaunting them with satire. Jesse whirls around, spying the assassins in the crowd. She shakes her head no... The covens need no more encouragement as they begin to move through the crowd toward the stage. We RISE UP OVER the crowd to see fifty assassins snaking at preternatural speed, unseen to all except us in our inhuman vantage.

The assassins approach closer -- Lestat assaults with relentless lyrics... Reaching the stage, they are suddenly on it -- roadies run in and are immediately cast aside by inhuman powers. We speed into vampire time as... (NOTE: In camera, no C.G.I.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The assassins draw knives and lunge, determined to dismember Lestat. Lestat does an acrobatic leap, dodging the knives. He rips the microphone from the stand and holds it up just in time... as an assassin is impaled. The assassin squirms and convulses. The crowd goes insane... Lestat snarls at the audience as if this really were part of the performance... The assassins attack again, this time hurtling massive light stands like they were small spears. Lestat dodges them. The assassins BREAK GLASS BOTTLES, lunge with the deadly shards. (NOTE: Band should not be seen in this part of sequence.)

<DIRECTION>
He lands square in the middle of the fray. Back to mortal time. The crowd cheers at the sudden appearance of the figure on stage, loving the show. Lestat grins at Marius. The band keeps playing. Marius hurls a huge LIGHT at the assassins. It EXPLODES as it hits them, pinning one with shards. But an assassin hurls a sickle at Lestat. Lestat is struck down, his singing stopped. The assassins move in.

As the killer vampires make their final move, it looks bleak for Lestat... But one after the other they spontaneously combust, turning hot-white to black ash and drift up into the air like strange supernatural kites. The crowd hollers and screams, not quite believing what they saw or how it was done, when... Down in the throng, vampires also begin to combust -- hot flashes of white exploding through the crowd, turning into black paper dolls -- wafting up over the valley -- crumbling into fluttering puffs of soot. Panic takes over the mass of people, running in all directions. Jesse remains pinned to her spot.

The mortal crowd looks around, distracted from their panic, as they sense something truly awesome...

LESTAT

Jesse, now almost to the stage, screams to him.

Suddenly the wooden platform beneath Lestat begins to buckle under his feet. Fragments of WOOD EXPLODE upwards around Lestat. Marius loses his balance and staggers backwards...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fragments of sharp wood fly into the audience. Jesse raises her hands to protect herself. She looks up. Freezes. Akasha rises up through the stage. Beautiful and terrifying. She grabs Lestat and the two of them shoot up into the air. The crowd stares in awe. Jesse is frozen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roger, the Fire Marshal, the band, everyone is frozen. Talbot stares up at Akasha, his face white, unable to believe his eyes. Even the Ancient Ones are stunned to see their Queen come to life.

Scaffolds collapse in an EXPLOSION OF ELECTRICAL SPARKS... (NOTE: Practical explosion.) The Ancient Ones stare up into the sky as... Akasha and Lestat vanish. Jesse stares in horror after them.

Lestat whirls around to suddenly see behind him Akasha in an extravagant Egyptian robe, its sheer cloth of gold draping her godly form. Lestat is awestruck. Akasha comes to life...

Akasha spreads her arms, moving ever closer to Lestat.

</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Akasha bites her own lip. Blood trickles slightly across her chin. Lestat stares at the blood, yearns towards it, as the pulse of her blood increases... Lestat looks at it, both wanting and fearful. Wrapping her arms around Lestat, she braces him, licks his face.
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>

(NOTE: Shoot as practical, actor against plain night sky, as much as possible.) Akasha rises above him, hovers over Lestat, letting a single drop of blood spill into his mouth. Lestat levitates above the ground to meet her as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Akasha hovers higher, drawing him into the sky until their mouths finally meet and her blood flows freely into him. Lestat pulls away as a great surge of power gathers in him and floods his body with an electric rush.

	Be my King. Forget about everything else.

<AKASHA>

	What's your answer?

</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat looks at her and then smiles. Akasha's mouth spreads into a smile. Flashes of brilliant light strobe over them as Lestat moves to her, sucks again. There's a powerful rush of WIND that engulfs them as they spin together, detached from time and space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH CUTS - STOCK FOOTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All INTERCUT WITH Akasha's skin, her body taut and arching. Lestat falls back in ecstasy. He shakes out his body and lets out a howl of pleasure -- feels his arms, his chest, his groin as Akasha's blood courses through his veins. Akasha watches and waits. Finally Lestat grins boyishly through bloody teeth and wipes his lips with the back of his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we try that again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Akasha smiles at him, then laughs a strange laugh, a kind of purr/growl. Lestat gazes at her as the sensual hissing seems to surround him. It is seductive and scary. Lestat steps up, puts a finger to her lips.

Mael leads Jesse down the hall. She stares ahead at what looks like statues standing in the shadows. Her eyes widen as the statues come to life: Armand, Pandora, Khayman, Marius are talking in hushed tones, gathered before Maharet's "Great Family Tree." CAMERA SWEEPS OVER the endless lines, the rows of names that stretch down the stone wall -- ACROSS the floor, filling room after room. The Ancients all stare, deeply moved. Maharet turns to them.

Lestat's white skin breaks the surface. Lestat is lowered into the bath, his skin alive with the dancing candles reflected in the water... the water laps gently -- strange sighs of pleasure as girls' hands caress Lestat's torso... their hands reach down lower and lower through the water... Lestat's eyes remain closed but his mouth opens... Now it's Akasha kissing him. Lestat responds, but his eyes sneak a peek. Akasha smiles -- takes his head in her hands -- she kisses him, pushes him back -- he tries to resist -- he can't, startled by her strength... Akasha kisses his neck, his chest, bites... Lestat arches in ecstasy... Akasha rises up from his breast, blood on her lips, smiles, goes back down and drinks.

Lestat stares, amazed, blinking... Shielding his eyes, Lestat goes to window, gazes in awe at the setting sun. As the last rays slice through the sky, Lestat closes his eyes, stretches his arms out, feels the warm sun on his skin. He smiles at this feeling he's craved for so long. Still smiling, he opens his eyes, blinking from the light. He turns, gazes towards the bath and gasps. The dying light illuminates...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The candles have all melted, forming pools that spread across the lace cloth. Food sits uneaten on plates. The last of the sun's rays strikes ten dead bodies sitting around the table, some slumped onto their food, some frozen in death. Lestat moves through the room, a feeling of dread spreading. We FOLLOW as he moves...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... out the French windows onto the beach, bodies of servants and villagers are scattered. Lestat's feet step down the wooden stairs, onto the sand, through the bodies...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat, shielding his eyes, stares up in horror at the pink sky.
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Behold our Kingdom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat sees Akasha standing further down on the beach.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
(puzzled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?

</AKASHA>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the reason you have risen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They believed in nothing, now they are nothing. But you and I will change all that. We will give the world something to believe in again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Akasha smiles, raises her hand, suddenly slices her wrist with a knife. Lestat stares at her dripping blood. She crosses to him, her eyes locked on his. She lifts her wrist, drips her blood into Lestat's mouth. Lestat's eyes glaze over again. He smiles, feeds hungrily, lost again. Akasha smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, my King. We have a score to settle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
The Queen and her King swiftly fly up into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAHARET'S MANSION - GRANDE HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ancients are still debating. Suddenly, the whole place begins to shake. (NOTE: Practical shadows not C.G.I.) A shadow passes over the Ancients' faces.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She comes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
The WINDOWS along one side of the hall EXPLODE with a startling GUST. The Ancient Ones look up to see... Akasha's silhouette looming, dark and foreboding.
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My children. It warms my blood to see you all gathered... plotting against me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
They trade glances and begin to fan out around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Akasha.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maharet. You will address my King first...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat enters, his possessed eyes showing only evil now. Unable to help herself...
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lestat!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns slowly to the corner where she sits. They lock eyes. Lestat's face stares cold and hard.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What has she done to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Made me see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Taking his arm, Akasha draws Lestat to her. The Ancient Vampires subtly position themselves under the medieval weapons hanging on the walls, as Marius moves toward his son.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lestat... step aside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never. She is my Queen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Marius looks for some recognition in Lestat's eyes. There is none. Maharet turns to Akasha.
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Akasha. The world has changed since you reigned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we shall change it back. Humans are animals, brute creatures. Their destruction can only make sense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've found other ways to co- exist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. In the shadows. In silence. In shame. For what? For respect of mortals? They are nothing to us. They are only... food.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
She casts a dangerous eye towards Jesse. Maharet instinctively moves forward to protect her.
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor Maharet. Still trying to hold onto what I took from you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Maharet doesn't even flinch.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Akasha, please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
(venomous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think you can change my will? I'm tired of this discussion. Join me, or die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<MARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIUS>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to hear it from every one of you. What will it be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Akasha scans the faces of the other Ancient Ones, staring deep into their souls. Akasha sees Khayman glance at the family tree. Akasha's eyes blaze with anger.
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell me, you have feelings for these ridiculous mortals!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
She crosses to the family tree, traces the names down to one. Jessica Reeves. Akasha is beyond fury, yet she keeps her temper under control and turns to Lestat.
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you love me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Smiling, she bites her lip, letting a drop of blood glisten there, tempting Lestat.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
He draws closer. Jesse stares, mortified. Akasha and Lestat's mouths almost meet when Akasha pulls away. Akasha slowly turns to Jesse.
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prove it. Kill her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's nothing to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just the same, I'd like you to kill her. For me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Ancients)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've had enough of this 'great family.' It's time to end it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Maharet steps between Lestat and Jesse.
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will not touch her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<DIRECTION>
Akasha flicks her wrist. Maharet is hurled against a pillar, pinned by Akasha's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You still think to challenge me, Maharet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beg you, spare this child.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Maharet struggles but Akasha is too strong. Jesse gazes at Lestat. Then steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right, Maharet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
Maharet stops, standing fixed with the sound of Jesse's newly strong and calm voice. Jesse looks to Lestat, straight into his dark irises, her gaze absolutely unwavering.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's what I want. I am ready.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches up, pulls aside her shirt, revealing the top of her breast. A thin, red scar remains from where she cut herself with the silver stick from the Chinese barrette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat gazes at her, begins to advance. Jesse keeps her gaze steady into Lestat's, risking everything.
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
(smirking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How sweet...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat moves closer and closer to her, gazes into her eyes, hesitates for a moment, then continues on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse watches him with absolute love. He reaches her. Maharet flies across the room, but Akasha meets her halfway. Grabs her by the hair. Maharet struggles but Akasha is much more powerful. Jesse offers up her neck to his bite. Maharet looks away and Akasha looks pleased as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat sinks his teeth into Jesse's neck. Jesse gasps with the bite, but puts her arm around Lestat as he draws her into him, draining her of her very life-force as she holds him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With that Maharet's great family mural begins to weep blood from every name. All the Ancients turn, stare at the mural as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat drinks and drinks and Jesse sighs with intimacy, clutching his neck and back, and drawing his bite deeper into her flesh. She slowly crumples to the floor, being drawn down until finally...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse lies on the floor, eyes closed and pale. Dead.
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good-bye, great family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to the MURAL with a fierce gaze. Flash! It EXPLODES, CRUMBLING to a million pieces on the ground. Maharet stares in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, my children, remember your real family! Or else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to them with a killing smile.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, My Queen, you've forgotten my reward!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to him.
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. My King, you've just earned your crown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat smiles with a blood-stained mouth. Akasha approaches Lestat and offers him her vein. She looks scornfully at the others as he cradles her wrist...
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see how he obeys. You will or you will all die!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat looks once at Marius, then sinks his teeth into its original font. He drinks as Akasha gasps with pleasure at giving so much pleasure to him. She keeps smiling to the others. But Lestat doesn't stop drinking. Akasha looks back to him, her face changing.
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's enough, Lestat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Still Lestat doesn't stop.
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lestat. Enough. Stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: Scene as scripted here is quite different from what was analyzed in boards. Notable potential expense or savings indicated with brackets. [])
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Lestat clamps down even harder. Akasha thrashes, trying to release herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maharet and Marius realize what he's doing, see the chance Lestat has gained for them. A silent signal passes between them as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ancients make an instantaneous decision. Akasha looks up, gasping, in time to see Maharet, Marius, Khayman, Armand, Mael, Pandora flying towards her. Akasha lets out a hiss...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Most of the Ancients are thrown to the ground while Mael ignites in mid-air. Mael's skin bubbles. He screams, the veins in his face rise up and explode as if his blood were burning acid...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pandora too bursts into flames. She falls to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Lestat, strong with Akasha's blood, keeps his hold and Khayman, Armand, Marius, Maharet fly at her again. They swarm over Akasha. She rises into the air, thrashing about, but they hang on, forming a flying mass of flailing limbs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The THUMP of Akasha's HEART ACCELERATES as they try to drain her...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Akasha turns on [Khayman to incinerate him. Flash. He screams as his blood boils, exploding out of his fingertips -- But he doesn't ignite... His wounds quickly heal. He moves in for another attack...]
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ancients are still flung around by Akasha's great strength, but they all hold on, as the thrashing finally begins to subside. The mass of bodies sinks to the ground. The Ancients pull back to reveal that...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Akasha's skin is deathly blue white. In horror, she manages to spit out her words.
</DIRECTION>
<AKASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You kill me, you kill yourselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKASHA>
<DIRECTION>
The Ancient Ones look to each other, uncertain a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Akasha gazes at them, then turns slowly, fixes her gaze on Lestat. He gazes back at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Akasha takes her chance, rises, her eyes flare green, marshalling the last of her wrath. Lestat cries out in agony as smoke rises from his limbs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fiercely determined, Lestat bites into Akasha's throat, this time for the kill. Akasha sinks her nails into his throat. He hangs on, his teeth deep. They are locked in mortal combat. Akasha slowly sinks to the ground, real fear in her eyes as her strength finally vanishes.
</DIRECTION>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, Lestat! You must stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat pulls away, leaving Akasha hanging in a twisted, unnatural angle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They all stare waiting to see what will happen...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Maharet moves quickly. She strides over to Akasha and sinks her fangs into Akasha's neck. Akasha struggles but this time she cannot even rise up. Maharet does not stop. A HOWLING sound as if from hell fills the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ancient Ones stare at Akasha, step back in awe. Lestat sits up, burned but still alive to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Akasha's skin begins to grow horribly pale, to harden and cake into a chalk. There's no blood left to flow from the gaping holes in Akasha's flesh. She slowly begins to transform back to her frozen statue state. Her skin returning to MARBLE. CRACKS multiply, becoming fissures. Finally, Akasha literally falls to pieces, SMASHING on the stone floor like porcelain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A silent moment. The Ancient Ones look at each other, astonished, as they realize they're still "alive."
</DIRECTION>
<KHAYMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We survived!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KHAYMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Ancients let out relieved hisses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Lestat is only concerned about Jesse. He rushes to her, picks up her lifeless head, takes a dagger from the floor and slices his wrist. He brings the open vein to Jesse's mouth, but she's not moving. Lestat bends down to her ear and whispers.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I left you one drop, my love. Drink deep and live.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse's lips slightly move and quiver as she tastes the blood. She begins to take the blood inside her and then finally truly drink and revive as Lestat cradles her. She pulls away, gasping. Lestat looks into her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I'd lost you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drink, my love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Her lips move to his wrist. Lestat strokes her hair, soothes her. Jesse gasps as pain courses through her. Lestat holds her close. She looks up at him, their eyes are locked together.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will never leave you again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
He holds her tight in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the Ancients gaze at Lestat, now understanding what he did.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly Jesse rises, gazes at Lestat, her face pale, her eyes glowing. Then Jesse turns, stares at Maharet. All the Ancients turn, follow her gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A whiteness is spreading across Maharet's face and skin. Maharet stares at her arms and legs, slowly turning to stone. Jesse goes to her.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maharet...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<MAHARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My child, let me look at you... You are finally happy. It is as it should be now... I will watch over you always.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAHARET>
<DIRECTION>
Maharet reaches out, embraces Jesse. Then Maharet sinks into a chair and freezes into a statue.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
(a reverent whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She took Akasha's last drop, took Akasha's death into herself. Behold, our Queen... our new mother...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
The Ancients slowly bow to Maharet. Jesse slowly slips from Maharet's arms. Goes into Lestat's arms.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she... dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSE>
<KHAYMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, she will live forever. She sleeps. She sleeps, and dreams of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KHAYMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse and Lestat hold onto each other, gazing at Maharet's face. On Maharet's lips is the most content of smiles. Jesse wipes away a tear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marius turns to Lestat. Their eyes meet. Then Marius bows at Maharet's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIUS>

	My Queen, I will watch over you always.

	Please don't be sad. I'm where I belong. I'm happy now.

<DIRECTION>
Lestat, content for the first time since we've known him, looks lovingly to Jesse. A flicker of curiosity crosses David's face.

	Well, if you ever should change your mind... Oh. I have a present for you. From an old friend.

</JESSE>
<DIRECTION>
She hands Talbot a canvas. It's a painting. He stares at it. The painting shows Lestat's concert. And in the crowd, Talbot finds Marius, now looking straight out at the viewer, a smile on his lips. Talbot sees standing beside Marius is Talbot himself, dancing with a young, pretty Goth. Talbot smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Marius sent a message. You were right. He doesn't go to the Dorchester. But he's gonna be at Claridge's later...

Talbot stares at them.

<JESSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good-bye, dear friend.
	</DIALOGUE>

Talbot opens his eyes to say something, but they're gone. Talbot turns to the painting. Stares at Marius for a long moment. Then stands, grabs his coat, heads for the door.

EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesse and Lestat come out of the Talamascan headquarters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes her hand and together they float up over the wall and out to the street. Lestat pulls Jesse into his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss. It's long, deep, romantic. They pull away, gaze sweetly, lovingly, into each other's eyes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And exchange happy, fanged smiles...
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall we go get a drink, love?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, nods. Lestat and Jesse take each other's hands, move into the crowd, zipping through the streets at that STRANGE preternatural SPEED...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and vanish into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
