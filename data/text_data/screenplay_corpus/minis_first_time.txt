:SC: MINI'S FIRST TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The face of MINERVA "MINI" DROGUES, 18, watching something. She looks extremely bored by the television images flickering across her eyes. She has a pretty face: Large eyes, and pouty mouth. Her knowing look is incongruous with a face clearly still that of a girl.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you're thinking. Don't bullshit me, because I do... You're thinking, oh dear lord in heaven, please, I'm begging you. I'll gouge out my eyes with the straw in my drink right now. I'll jam every last kernel of popcorn into my mouth until I suffocate, just not another fucking teenage coming-of- age story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
We pull back to reveal her body, which is moving out of that awkward stage between adolescence and womanhood. Though tall and thin, her hips haven't quite rounded. She's wearing a "FUCT" T-shirt and jean shorts.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, relax...no prom night highjinks, no nerds becoming popular and no Shakespeare set in high school...I promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: THE TV SCREEN. "When Animals Attack" is on. In a series of quick cuts:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A zoo keeper is mauled by an elephant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sport fisherman is attacked on the deck of a boat by a shark he and his buddies thought was dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pit bull clamps down on his owner's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An alligator hunter stupidly puts his head in the mouth of a just-captured alligator, only to have it chomp down on his skull.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since it happened, everyone's asked me how it all started.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Mini's face registers no reaction to the gruesome images. We now see she is sitting in the living room of a well-appointed Studio City hillside home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LIVING ROOM- EVENING- A PARTY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TEENAGERS OF PRIVILEGE and their UPTIGHT PARENTS are milling around, dancing and chatting as A DEEJAY spins tunes.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose the obvious answer is my eighteenth birthday...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Mini dances with a few friends in a very short mini-skirt and halter top. She clearly understands how to the drive the boys crazy and this is not lost on her mother, DIANE, 42, who stands off to the side, nursing a drink with some other HYPER- AEROBICIZED MOTHERS.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, I was blessed with a terrific mom. Not only is she a lush, but she also hates me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Diane is beautiful, but there is an essential hardness to her that comes from a life spent trading on her looks. The blouse and mini-skirt she wears are inappropriately revealing for the occasion of her daughter's birthday.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A few days before the party, I overhear her on the phone ordering me a male stripper. Nothing says "I love you" like ten inches of man meat in your face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Diane and the other mothers are talking about Mini's dancing.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And knowing dear old ma, she'll try and nail him after the party...in my bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Mini's friend KAYLA, a little rounder, but also brash, comes dancing over. She's swaying her hips provocatively at Mini, almost challenging her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE RUDELL, a tanned and trim man of 55, watches their display, clearly enjoying the way it's jump-starting his imagination.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That guy? Our neighbor Mike Rudell, big shot TV producer and the guy my mom screws whenever the batteries run out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Kayla and Mini begin dancing together in a very explicit way, clearly trying to make the adults uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yo, bee-ach!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<KAYLA>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. THE KITCHEN - LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kayla instructs some CATERERS to start wheeling a giant birthday cake into the living room. The caterers look confused, but Kayla is insistent and the young men obey, starting to wheel the cake down the long hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cake emerges from the hallway. The caterers begin singing "Happy Birthday", as Diane turns to see it and her eyes flash rage. As Diane comes storming over, we switch to SLOW MOTION.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, to understand me, you need to understand that life, in my opinion, is all about new experiences. "Firsts" is what I call them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
As she strides across the room, the look of vitriolic rage on Diane's face grows stronger with every step.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somewhere around fourteen, when I had my first...rhymes with duck, I realized that the goal of life, any life, should be to cram as many "firsts" into it as possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>

We switch back to real time.

A YOUNG CATERER'S face turns white.
</DIRECTION>
<CATERER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, but her friend said--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATERER>
<DIRECTION>
POP! Suddenly the lid to the cake flies off and from behind we see A NUDE MINI rises out of it like Venus on the half shell.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SURPRISE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
MINI'S POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A collection of reactions from the party goers: The mothers are numb, the fathers pretend to be disturbed, while copping looks, and her friends are in stitches. Some are even waving dollar bills.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was definitely a first, but more importantly, it was the first time I really understood my potential...And that's when it all started.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE HALLWAY OF MINI'S HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mini and Kayla walk down the crowded halls attracting lustful looks from some of the more aggressive boys.

"Ooohs" and "Aaahs" erupt from the onlookers as Troy looks concerned his ambush has backfired.

Mini walks down a hall and stops in front of a room and knocks. She looks around trepidatiously, as she waits for an answer. The door opens and a MIDDLE AGED MAN opens the door. He's very well groomed in a creepy middle american way. He could be a serial killer or...

Mini's jaw tightens slowly.

The executive "convenience" apartment is cold, sterile and clearly just used for short amounts of time. Mini opens the door, passing the closet, the bathroom door and then stops suddenly as she sees...

MARTIN, her stepfather, sitting up in bed.

She quickly turns away before he sees her face.

A wicked glint dances across her eyes.

INT. THE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Martin turns the light off next to the bed. A little bit of light from the street sneaks in around the edges of the blinds. After a second, the door opens and Mini comes out in a bra and panties.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mini crosses the room slowly and sits on the edge of the bed, letting her hair fall over her face. Martin tries to pull her hair away from her eyes, but she turns away, playfully shaking her head "no".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches down and touches him through the sheet. He looks up at her, clearly excited, but she keeps her gaze down. He reaches over to the nightstand and picks up his wallet.

</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
He obeys.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now just keep them shut for a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Mini pulls the sheet back, revealing his body to her. She starts kissing his chest, inhaling deeply. She looks up at his expectant face, intoxicated with her power. Her mouth starts to move down his chest. Martin lets out a small, almost self-conscious gasp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE ROOM - LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is still dark as Martin and Mini lie under the sheets, post coitus in the "spoons" position. Martin has a dreamy, satisfied look on his face. Mini smiles to herself.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>

Mini is getting dressed.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I literally couldn't feel the ground under my feet. A first to top all firsts. I knew I'd tell him one day, but I wanted to savor it for a while.
	</DIALOGUE>

She reaches her car and looks for her keys in her purse. Her eyebrows furrow as she has trouble finding them. Suddenly, she realizes they aren't there. She freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ginger! You forgot your...
	</DIALOGUE>

Startled, her head whips around to see Martin walking towards her, carrying her jacket. He stops, the realization setting in.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Jacket.

Seconds go by as Mini allows a pathologically triumphant smile to spread across her mouth.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's to immediate gratification.

<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were great.

</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Martin just stares straight ahead, numb. After another moment he walks to the railing of the garage, staring down at the street below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN'S POV: A few cars rush by on the street below. It appears to be about a three or four story drop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks back at Mini. He starts to lift a leg over the railing.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, that fall probably won't kill you, and considering what a caring nurturer your wife is, I don't think that's a risk you can afford to take.

Martin looks down at the street for another moment.

	God, what a drama queen. Don't let this little act fool you. He'd never let mom get all his money.

He glances back at her, looking tortured.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>

(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is just his twisted public relations brain working overtime to figure what the appropriate response should be to fucking your stepdaughter...ah ha! Contemplate suicide!

Martin backs away from the railing.

INT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Martin watches television next to Diane, who's passed out with an empty bottle of vodka sitting on the coffee table. A BOTTLE OF PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION is open as well.

	In the beginning, I was concerned this would violate my rule as he technically was a repeat customer, but then I realized this was my first affair, and with my stepfather no less. To be perfectly honest...I loved it. Talk about electric, knowing at any moment she could walk in was better than any drug. It reminded me of when I was young and brought guys home after school.

</MINI>

Suddenly, the door flies open, as Martin ducks under the covers. Diane stands there with a drink in her hand and what appears to be cocaine residue under her nostrils. She appears truly wired and incoherent, it's unclear whether she's even noticed someone else in the bed.

Martin searches her eyes, almost unsure he's heard her right. Her gaze is unwavering and after a few seconds he realizes she's serious. He can't help but let the hint of a grin cross his lips. M

The sexual tension arises between them, as he starts moving closer to her lips.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, we'll have to make sure her episodes are well documented.

</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
She responds in kind, tilting her head.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And corroborated by friends and people outside the family.

</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A public complaint by a neighbor wouldn't hurt.

Mini leads Carlos back to his vans, just Martin's Mercedes pulls up. Diane turns around to see his car and a look of dread strikes her.

INT. A POSH PARTY IN THE HILLS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

The party is chock full of TROPHY WIVES and their decidedly less attractive HUSBANDS. Diane is in a full blown booze and Ritalin induced monologue, having cornered TWO WOMEN.

<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My god, let me tell you, breaking my hand on that bitch's face...

	Phase three: rambling incoherent monologues in public.

</MINI>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel fantastic, just fabulous. I mean, I feel like I could run a marathon like that Bruce Jenner guy. He did that, right? Boy, I'll tell you before he had that face lift that made him look like a drag queen, I would've let him stick his javelin in me any day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIANE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, her ears unconsciously pick up the strands of a conversation going on behind them between TWO HUSBANDS.
</DIRECTION>
<HUSBAND_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I looked each and every juror in the eye-

</HUSBAND_1>

	I want to talk to you about juries, will you come and talk to me about juries?

</DIANE>
<HUSBAND_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUSBAND_1>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to be on a jury and say "guilty!" or "sidebar!" What do you think goes on in all the sequestered situations? Do you think any of the jurors have sex with each other? I was once on an episode of Love Boat, playing the role of "Bikini Girl" and my line was "I'll have another," it was with "Isaac" at the pool bar. I had to suck one of the associate producers off to get the line, but it got me my SAG card, so I guess it was worth it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The men shoot each other an uncomfortable glance.
</DIRECTION>
<HUSBAND_2>

	Uh, I think I could use a refill.

	But, but we were talking about juries and Isaac and, and that drag queen I broke my face on and..
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIANE>
<DIRECTION>
The two men try to ignore her, but she keeps following them. She finally realizes they aren't stopping. She grabs the first man by the shoulder, pissed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! COCKBREATH!

The party stops. Everyone is staring at Diane as the music continues to play. She looks around the room at the disapproving eyes, panic setting in.

Diane is led away by Martin and Mini, as other partygoers watch the sad scene. They both struggle to keep Diane from stumbling.

Diane considers the question by looking at her face in the bed side mirror. It's still puffy and blotchy from the pepper spray.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTIN AND DIANE'S BEDROOM - LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Diane is almost asleep when the phone next to the bed RINGS, waking her up. She stares at it for a moment, trying to decide if she should answer it. On the forth ring, she answers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIANE>
<DIRECTION>
A DIAL TONE rings in her ear. She hangs up the phone. A second later it RINGS again. She waits two rings and then answers. Again a DIAL TONE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now a bit freaked, Diane is fully awake and staring at the phone, waiting... PLINK! Something small hits the window across the room. Startled, she turns her head towards it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DIANE'S POV: Through the window, in the distance by the hedges a BLACK CLAD FIGURE is visible, wearing a ski mask and goggles. In the figure's right hand there is a gleaming, sharp kitchen knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She can't believe her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV: The figure stands silently, bringing the knife up, indicating that he's going to cut her throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eyes wild with panic, Diane picks up the phone and dials 911.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The phone dials and she waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, please, oh god.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIANE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks back out the window: THE HOODED FIGURE walks out of the bushes and heads towards the house.
</DIRECTION>
<RECORDED_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have reached 911, if this is an emergency, please remain on the line...

Diane realizes she doesn't have time to wait and runs out of the room, leaving the phone off the hook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Diane stumbles down the hallway, almost tripping on the steps down to the living room. She goes straight for the phone on the end table next to the couch. She picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<RECORDED_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please continue to hold, your call will be answered...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECORDED_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
She hangs up the phone and looks back at the hallway, but as she does, she sees reflected in a wall mirror: ANOTHER BLACK CLAD FIGURE outside the living room window, but this one holds a HAND AXE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns around to look out the window. THE FIGURE raises the axe slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...no...help! Help!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIANE>
<DIRECTION>
She heads towards the front door to scream for help, but the axe wielding figure moves swiftly towards the door, making it unsafe for her to even try. Her face dissolves into utter despair, as she stumbles out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE FAMILY DEN - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Diane runs in to check that the sliding doors are locked. She clicks the lock shut, just as THE FIRST FIGURE with the knife appears in the door frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God! Help! Someone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIANE>
<DIRECTION>
Diane is transfixed by her own eyes reflected in the lenses of the goggles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIANE>
<DIRECTION>
(softly )
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, please, no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIANE>
<DIRECTION>
She slowly backs away from the door, as the figure tries to open it. The door frame rattles on its track, as the figure violently tugs at the handle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help! Someone please, help me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIANE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs back in, checking THE WINDOW. It's clear. She decides to check the front door. She runs over and looks out the peep hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PEEP HOLE POV: It appears clear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to undo the lock and then slowly peeks through the slit in the door, leaving the chain on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE SLIT: everything looks good.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the door and looks towards the front gate, which is open. She looks as if she's thinking of making a dash for the gates. Just then, from behind the gate, steps the AXE WIELDING FIGURE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It shakes a finger "no" at her, as it walks towards the house. Terrified, she slams the door, locking it behind her. She instinctively pushes her back against the door, hyper- ventilating. She looks up at the ceiling, her eyes filling with tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please God, please God...please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIANE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around the room, searching for options. Suddenly, her eyes bulge as she sees THE KNIFE WIELDING FIGURE standing not ten feet away in the door to the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Diane screams and runs back down the hallway, towards the bedroom. The knife wielding figure follows behind her. She looks back, as it runs after her, grabbing her by the shoulder. She shrieks and struggles out of it's grasp before running in the bathroom and slamming the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Diane throws her weight against the door, struggling to keep the intruder out. She looks for anything to help her, and then sees in the window to the bathroom...THE AXE WIELDING FIGURE standing silently, staring back at her. Diane collapses to the floor in a pool of tears. She looks up again at THE WINDOW: It's empty. The pushing on the door suddenly stops, but Diane is so disturbed, she doesn't notice through her sobs.
</DIRECTION>

They reach the door to the bathroom. It's still closed. Martin and Mini exchange a look, not believing that Diane could still be in there.

Martin tries the door. Diane still appears to be leaning against it. He pushes hard on the door, opening it a few inches. Mini reaches in and shoves Diane over so they can can open the door. She appears drugged. They lay her flat and try to wake her up.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Diane, it's us, wake up.

Mini looks up at the counter. AN EMPTY BOTTLE OF PRESCRIPTION SLEEPING PILLS lies open next to the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin...

<DIRECTION>
He looks up and immediately sees the bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I picked that prescription up three days ago. It was probably more than half full.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
The two of them look at each other, studying each other's reaction. Seconds go by as both wait for the other to make the first move.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(eerily calm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose we should call an ambulance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
The suggestion hangs in the air, as Martin feels Diane's wrist again.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her pulse is almost gone.

</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>

<MARTIN>

</MARTIN>
<MINI>

	Absolutely Positive!

</DIRECTION>
<MINI>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Take happy couples about to marry and try to break them up. The catch is the couples are always sent on dates with people just a little better looking than their fiancés.

Then the TWO DATES are brought out to sit on either side of the couple. Both dates are, indeed, slightly better looking than the engaged couple.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Speed this up?

</MARTIN>
<MINI>

Martin looks at her for a long moment, clearly realizing the implications of "speed this up".

Martin stares straight ahead, coming to grips with the truth of his actions.

<MARTIN>

INT. THE GARAGE- MOMENTS LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin stands in the garage with Garson, going over what happened.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So after dinner and the movie, we came home at around 11:30 and found her in the garage. I turned off the car and opened the garage door to let out the exhaust.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about trying to revive your wife?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<DIRECTION>
Martin seems a bit taken aback by the question.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, we did that too, but I couldn't feel a pulse. Mini took a course at school in CPR and tried that, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(taking a breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	it didn't work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So your wife did this sometime between 8:00 and 11:33 when you placed the 911 call?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I ask why you left your wife alone when she had been acting in such an unstable state?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We never thought she'd do anything like...this. After the episode in the mall, Diane hadn't left the house for three days and my daughter and I just needed a break. It's been a very stressful time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. So this was your wife's car?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was it in the garage when you left for dinner or did she drive it in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was it in the garage when you left?

</GARSON>
<MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(a little flustered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is, is that important?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just trying to reconstruct what happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well...after she was brought home from the mall, the car was towed here and we put it in the garage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And no one drove it during those three days?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Mini and I have our own cars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are going to have to impound it for a few days to take it to the crime lab.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Crime lab? Oh, okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Again, purely routine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you found a note yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Garson's eyes flicker for a split second.
</DIRECTION>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A suicide note? The deceased usually leaves one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...right, no...not yet. But we haven't really looked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mind if I take a look around?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<DIRECTION>
Martin hesitates for just a split second.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...of course not.

INT. MINI'S BEDROOM- MOMENTS LATER.

<DIRECTION>
Mini and Martin whisper together.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who cares if we didn't leave a note? Just relax.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But they said it's--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what? He'll do his little dance and chalk it up to another failed actress who realized after forty she might as well be dead.

</MINI>
<MARTIN>

(remembering something)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The sweatsuits and goggles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I already snuck out the back and threw them in Mike Rudell's garbage cans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.

EXT. THE LAS HADAS RESORT- MANZANILLO MEXICO - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Martin and Mini arrive in a shuttle bus in front of the lush resort.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After the funeral, I felt it would be good idea if we took a vacation and went somewhere where we could act like a real couple for the first time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THEIR HOTEL ROOM - LATER. Martin tips the BELL HOP on the way out and the moment the door closes, Mini jumps into his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin agreed and let me pick the place. I chose Las Hadas in Mexico, because that's where Dudley Moore and Bo Derek did it in Ten.

EXT. THE BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin spreads sun tan lotion on Mini's back.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I figured sugar daddy/younger woman would be old news down there.

<DIRECTION>
A few other OLDER MAN/YOUNGER WOMAN couples lounge near them, mixed among more traditional pairings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AN OUTDOOR TIKI BAR/DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARIACHIS play a sexy Mexican ballad as Mini, wearing a thin sundress, dances very close with Martin.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could feel that Martin had let the whole thing with the cops go. It had been two weeks since Mom's death and it already felt like it happened a year ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mini lies on top of Martin on a lounge chair. They both stare up at the stars. The gentle breaking of waves further adds to the tranquility of the evening.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I've been thinking that I might enjoy working in your office this summer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Sure, if you want.

</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want.

She moves to kiss him.

<MALE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin, Mini? Is that you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Martin and Mini look up to see MIKE RUDELL, their producer neighbor, peering at them in the dark. He has an arm wrapped around the waist of A YOUNG BLONDE who is clearly Playmate material.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I swear I thought Martin was going to wet himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Mini quickly sits up, trying to make it look like innocent father/daughter closeness.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(extremely tense)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...hi, Mike, what, what are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Rudell comes over, clearly aware of how un-father/daughter they were lying.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last week Mini mentioned you two were coming here for a little R&R, and I suddenly realized I hadn't taken a vacation in god knows when. Jennifer, this is my neighbor Martin Tannen and his daughter, Mini.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDELL>
<DIRECTION>
Martin barely looks at Jennifer as he shakes her hand. She looks equally uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, but, Jennifer, have we met? You look so familiar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer looks quite uneasy, as she forces a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the icing is that Jennifer works for the same escort service that I did. Now this is rich.

</MINI>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted you both to know how sorry I am for your loss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<MINI>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Our loss? He just lost six or seven freebies a year.

<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If there's anything I can do...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	for either of you...

</MIKE>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yikes, now that Mom's out of the way, I guess I'm fair game.

</MINI>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...don't hesitate to ask. Remember I'm just right across the fence.

</MIKE>

The meaning is not lost on Martin.

	Thanks, Mike, we appreciate it.

INT. THEIR HOTEL ROOM - LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin paces back and forth as Mini sits on the bed. His neck muscles bulge with frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you tell him?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just being friendly, I had no idea he'd decide to come here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He knows. He found the clothes and goggles and he fucking knows!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I doubt he even knows where his trash cans are. You're overreacting. It's just coincidence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well coincidence or not, he saw us together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was dark, I sat up before he saw anything. M
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<ARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, he knows. It was like he was toying with us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just relax, what is he going to do? Go home and tell everyone we're a couple? We'll just laugh it off and tell everyone he vacations with hookers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Martin stops and looks at her, surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, come on, could that little moment between you and Jennifer have been any more awkward?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
His face turns a little red.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not jealous or anything, I just think it's funny. Talk about six degrees of penetration.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Martin rubs his temples, clearly overwhelmed.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You realize he could blackmail us? If the police found out about us, that suicide wouldn't look so routine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin, please, calm down. Trust me, nothing is going to happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Her words don't appear to have calmed him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE POOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin sits on a lounger, reading a book and looking very unhappy. From the pool, Mini emerges, soaking wet in a bikini.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The next few days were a laugh riot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Martin looks up from the book, looking around suspiciously. Suddenly, Mini appears behind him and gives him a kiss on the mouth. He instinctively pulls back.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suddenly, Martin was acting like he really was my father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, Rudell and his bimbo enter the pool area, waving at them. Mini's head is not close enough for the scene to look incriminating, but Martin is too spooked to know the difference.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TANNEN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Mini and Martin sit watching TV. Mini flips channels, stopping at Absolutely, Positive! Martin snatches the remote and grumpily changes channels. Mini looks very annoyed.

THE DOOR BELL RINGS. Mini looks towards the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE FRONT DOOR TO THE HOUSE- MOMENTS LATER.

Mini answers it, having removed her Marilyn wig, but still in the sequined dress. Detective Garson stands at the door, looking her up and down. Mini hides her surprise well.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Mr. Tannen is your stepfather?

	Nice work, McGruff.

</MINI>
<GARSON>

	Again, I am sorry about that night, but it is policy that we get the preliminary facts as soon as possible.

	I know, it's stupid as hell to talk to a cop without a lawyer, but I didn't want to look jumpy and my first real interrogation? I could feel something tingle deep inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Mini and Garson take a seat. Mini lights a cigarette. Garson looks over her outfit again.
</DIRECTION>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a little early for the prom, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A girl can dream, can't she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfectly legal. So, anyway, we got the preliminary coroner's report. Although the pills knocked her out, she died of the carbon monoxide poisoning from the exhaust.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it that important?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's just a little unusual for a suicide victim to use two methods. Her choices seemed, I don't know how to put it... improvisational.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, maybe she wanted to drift off before the fumes got her? She clearly put some thought into that outfit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clearly...But dying from carbon monoxide poisoning is actually pretty painless, you just basically pass out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I doubt she would have had an intimate knowledge of how car fumes feel when you choke on them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose you're right...Also we checked the phone records and there was a 911 call placed at 8:12. It was a hang up and when the 911 dispatcher called back a few minutes later, there was no answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?

Mini lounges in a bikini, talking on the cordless phone, while sucking on a red popsicle.

Mini looks across the yard to see...

<DIRECTION>
MIKE RUDELL looking down at her from the upstairs balcony of his home. He's dressed in a plush terry cloth robe and is smoking a pipe, which he raises in greeting. His eyes are locked on hers.

Garson opens his briefcase and removes a report. He starts leafing through papers.

	There appears to be some question as to the time of death. You said you went to dinner and a movie-

	Detective, not to be overly sensitive, but do I need my lawyer here? Because these sound like the questions one asks when there's a homicide investigation.

</MARTIN>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Tannen, I'd really like to just finish this up, I've got real homicides that need attention. How about if I just ask you some questions and the one's you don't want to answer, we'll just skip?

<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't aware my wife was taking ritalin.

</MARTIN>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither was her physician, he had never prescribed it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, as you may have discovered by now, my wife had substance abuse problems, I'm sure there were many drugs she took without a prescription.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, but it's an odd drug to be taking. It's mostly given to adults and children with Attention Deficit Disorder to calm them. But in people who don't need it, it has the reverse effect, making them incredibly hyper and agitated.

<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Again, Detective, I really can't say why she was taking these drugs.

</MARTIN>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fair enough...Mr. Tannen, were you and your wife close?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...we led, for the most part, separate lives. We had decided to stay together for Mini.

	I see...

</GARSON>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Detective Garson, I must admit I don't see the relevance of these questions. Diane was an extremely disturbed person. Haven't you interviewed enough people who saw her at her worst?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but what I'm still unclear about is her time of death.
	</DIALOGUE>

<MARTIN>

	Well, that makes two of us... Again, detective, we were out for the whole evening.

Martin turns to Mini, giving her a fatherly smile.

<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another demerit...

Mini rolls her eyes at Garson.

	For now? Detective we are trying very hard to put our lives back together, but every time you come by, it just dredges everything back up. We've told you everything we know. G

Mini sits in a chair as Martin paces.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell was I thinking, letting you talk me into this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's probably just routine stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was not routine, my dear.

</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice use of the word "us", by the way.

	Look, just chill, I'm sure this will blow over in a few days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chill?! Believe me, we'll be chilling in a pine box if he figures everything out. You do understand they could go for the death penalty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's probably just trying to spook us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?! They don't try and spook you unless they think you did it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a great plan, no one can prove we stuck those sleeping pills in her mouth, because we didn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(seething)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if it was such a great plan, why am I cancelling business dinners to accommodate a detective who appears convinced it wasn't a suicide?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Mini glares at him and then stands up, heading inside.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see you later.

<DIRECTION>
INT. A DANCE CLUB IN EAGLE ROCK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The club is packed with YOUNG LATINO CLUBHOPPERS gyrating to the pulsating beat. Mini, in a tight crimson dress, has attracted quite a crowd, as she dances very provocatively with a MUSCULAR YOUNG LATINO.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would he follow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
His face and shoulders glisten with sweat, as she lifts one leg around his waist and then the other. As she straddles him, their hips rocking together, she puts her arms around his neck and leans all the way back, her hair hanging down in ecstasy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she pulls herself back up, her eyes scan the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN stands in the back, watching her, his eyes sullen.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was there any question?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Mini's eyes move quickly enough past him that it's ambiguous to him whether she spotted him or not.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin watches as Mini leans in and in SLOW MOTION gives her partner a deep, long kiss. MARTIN looks ill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mini's car pulls into the driveway. She gets out, looking rumpled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE KITCHEN- MOMENTS LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mini walks in to find Martin, sitting at the table in a bathrobe. He's reading the paper, with a cup of coffee. Mini opens the fridge and removes a carton of orange juice, taking a big slug.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A phone call would have been appreciated at some point. I was worried.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Worried that refugee from a J.Lo video rode me `til the tires fell off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh...Martin, I'm not sure you're aware, but at this point you can't be my dad and my lover. Where I go and how late I stay out is my business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't saying that as a dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(very sincere)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before your mother and I...grew apart, I would worry if she was out late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's sweet, but I'm not her and I can assure you I won't end up passed out in some greaseball's fuck pad with my panties around my ankles...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(cold, smooth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	unless I choose to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell's gotten into you? I just expressed concern for you and you turn around and threaten me? Mini, in a relationship, it's okay to worry about someone else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I kind of have to admire this. He really is one of the world's premiere bullshit artists.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haven't you ever been in a relationship?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
The questions hangs in the air. Mini looks down, almost ashamed.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My god, you haven't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to hold back the tears as she looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulations...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sniffling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	you're my first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
He comes over and gives her a very sweet hug.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, angel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'd like to thank the academy and god and, oh yeah, "Free Tibet".
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AN ELEVATOR - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin rides up in the elevator with other OFFICE WORKERS. His eyes look tired from staying up all night.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fake tears aside...he actually was my first relationship. Which, in itself, was significant, because I had always felt that by living my life by the rule of firsts, I would never be able to find someone who could accept me on those terms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTIN'S OFFICE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He strides off the elevator sending "hellos" and nods to his employees, as he passes the large corporate logo: "BOYD, MATHER, TANNEN & ASSOCIATES".
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I was willing to give him the chance to be that person...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches his desk, where his YOUNG SECRETARY, LOIS, is waiting with an envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...if he could just hold it together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning, Lois.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<LOIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Tannen, this just arrived for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOIS>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him a manila envelope marked "MARTIN TANNEN- VIA MESSENGER". He takes it from her and walks into his office, sitting down. He opens the package to find an 8x10 glossy photo of:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MINI SITTING WITH HIM AT THE POOL IN MEXICO. The caption reads: "THANK HEAVEN FOR LITTLE GIRLS".
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's when things started to get interesting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Martin looks up, the empty look in his eyes revealing a terrified mind already calculating the potential outcomes. He examines THE ENVELOPE. There is a SPEEDWAY COURIER STICKER, but no return address.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTIN'S CAR - LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin angrily honks his horn in slow traffic as he talks on his cell.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lois, I need you to re-schedule the Chapman meeting...

</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SPEEDWAY COURIER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin stands at the front desk, talking to A CLERK.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean you don't keep records on who your senders are?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When it's paid cash, we only keep records on packages, not envelopes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE SPEEDWAY BRANCH - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin walks outside, frustrated. His cell goes off and he answers it.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<LOIS>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Tannen, I just spoke to Mr. Chapman...he told me to tell you that he's going to be seeking a new firm to handle his company's needs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOIS>
<DIRECTION>
Martin's jaw tightens.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Lois.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Martin hangs up the phone, as he looks up, he sees across the street a large sign on a modern office building: RUDELL WORLDWIDE ENTERTAINMENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin closes his eyes, trying to remain in control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM AT MARTIN'S FIRM - LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin walks into the office to find his partners, STEVE BOYD and CHARLES MATHER waiting for him. Martin looks surprised and concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Steve? Charlie? What, what are you doing in town? Why didn't you tell me you were coming--
	</DIALOGUE>
<MATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We just heard about Chapman...not that it matters.

</MARTIN>
<BOYD>

	We can't afford to lose any more clients.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOYD>

The color drains from Martin's face.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, guys, my wife just committed suicide...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one's saying this isn't a difficult time for you, but whatever's been distracting you started long before that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATHER>
<BOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's just no way to sugarcoat this...you're a liability we can't afford anymore...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Martin sits very still, his world crumbling around him.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifteen years...we've been--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(curtly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll be asking all our clients who they would prefer to stay with, and of course, you'll have an equal shot to make your case with them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Martin continues to stare off into space, reeling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTIN'S CAR - LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin sits in the traffic on Beverly Glen. The veins in his neck are starting to bulge as he stares straight ahead. Suddenly, he starts pounding on the steering wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking shit! Fucking shit! Fucking shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, he looks over to the next car. A three year old GIRL in the back seat holds up her "PO" TELETUBBY DOLL to show him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW OF MIKE RUDELL'S HOUSE-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through a BINOCULAR'S VIEWFINDER: Rudell is seen through the window talking on the phone, unaware he's being watched.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at that smug prick...He's fucking with me and I will not be fucked with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE KITCHEN OF THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin and Mini stand in the dark kitchen, as Martin peers out the window through binoculars at RUDELL across the yard.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you gonna do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Martin goes to a drawer and removes the LARGE KNIFE they bought at Williams Sonoma.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna go over there and tell him to back off or he's gonna get hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you crazy? We're not even positive it's him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My god, the picture was dropped off at a messenger service right across the street from his office! He was the only person at the resort who knew who we were!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He could go to the cops and tell them you threatened him, then they'd really start investigating us. It's just one photo and you can't even really tell if it's me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That son of bitch just cost me the firm I worked fifteen years to build.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you start waving that thing around, he's gonna cost you a lot more than that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THEIR BEDROOM - LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mini lies awake, looking annoyed as Martin keeps turning and shifting in bed.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin didn't sleep at all that night and made damn well sure I didn't either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE FRONT DOOR OF MIKE RUDELL'S HOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mini walks up the long driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With Mommy Dearest out of the way, I decided to take the matter of Rudell into my own hands. I knew Martin wouldn't approve, but at this point...action had to be taken.

</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
She arrives at the front door and rings the bell.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would catch him off guard, disorient him and then kill him...

The door opens and Rudell stands before her in the same plush bathrobe.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...with kindness.

Eighteen foot ceilings frame the room, garishly decorated with very modern, modular furniture. Rudell leads Mini in.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow, I haven't been here since you redecorated.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RUDELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was just finished. I'm sorry your mother never got to see it completed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDELL>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know she'd approve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<RUDELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you don't mind me asking, ...how are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDELL>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been hard, but I guess I've just been telling myself that she's probably much happier where she is now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<RUDELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're absolutely-
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDELL>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Positive!?

Mini giggles, almost embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDELL>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that too, but "correct" was the word I was thinking of. Do you like the show?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDELL>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, god, it's my favorite. I love how you never know if the couples will decide to stay together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<RUDELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could arrange for you to go to the set one day if you'd like, or even be a contestant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDELL>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A contestant? Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<RUDELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, those dates are really quite harmless. You just spend an evening with the person. We prep you on what to say before the show.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDELL>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It sounds like fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Rudell lets his eyes take a walk all over her. Mini, keenly aware, blushes.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, what's on your mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDELL>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, um...this may sound strange, but you haven't seen any suspicious looking people around our house lately?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<RUDELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, is everything okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDELL>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it's just that since mom's death, someone sent us a photo of Martin and I together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<RUDELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Together?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDELL>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It indicated that we were...I know this sounds crazy, but...a couple.

	A couple? You and Martin? Hmmm...I mean, certainly older men and younger women are an

	Hmm, I haven't noticed anyone at all...Out of curiosity, what kind of a picture could they send you to indicate that you and Martin were together?
	</DIALOGUE>
</UDELL>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, it wasn't like we were naked or anything. I mean, of course, he's seen me naked, he is my step- father.

<RUDELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course.

EXT. RUDELL'S POOL - LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mini and Rudell sit at a table, enjoying iced teas, as Mini flirts shamelessly with him.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Much to my surprise, I was invited to stay for a refreshing beverage...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUDELL'S HOT HOUSE - LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudell shows Mini around his collection of rare tropical flowers. He plucks a tiger lily off a stem and puts it in her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew he had had no shortage of young women in his bed, but he had been paying for it in one form or another for a long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUDELL'S PUTTING GREEN - LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudell shows Mini how to use a pitching wedge on the small putting green off his back patio. He stands behind her, wrapping his arms around her, guiding her arms through the swing.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the one undeniable fact I had learned from Martin is that there is no greater thrill or triumph in a man's life...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUDELL'S KITCHEN - LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudell makes her a giant banana split, covering it with whip cream.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...than getting a ripe young woman to open the gates to heaven for no other reason than she wanted to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
He accidently gets some whip cream on his nose. Mini reaches over and wipes it off, licking her finger clean. Rudell tries to hide the wonderment in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frankly, I'm surprised the anticipation of pulling off a mother-daughter double dip didn't give him a stroke right there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUDELL'S FRONT GATE - LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mini walks out, skipping down the path, singing "The Candy Man" to herself.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Who can take tomorrow? Dip it in a dream, separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream, the candy man, oh, the candy man can"

</MINI>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I left that day, exhilarated in the knowledge that in one afternoon, I had turned Rudell into a trout on a line...and he'd follow me anywhere I tugged the pole.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mini walks down the corridor with Kayla.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The photos stopped coming and although Martin was freaking out about his business, things were returning to normal. I even decided to return to school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
They approach TROY, the football player she humiliated earlier. Mini raises two fingers to her mouth in a "V", simulating cunnilingus, taunting Troy. His friends laugh and he wilts, pretending he didn't see her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A CLASSROOM- MOMENTS LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mini and Kayla walk in with other students. Her teacher, Warren Bishop, comes over to her immediately.
</DIRECTION>
<BISHOP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mini, I've got a message for you to go to the principal's office right away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BISHOP>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mini is led in by A SECRETARY, as Detective Garson sits in a chair next to PRINCIPAL PATTY ANDREWS, 50.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then things got interesting again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Mini immediately sizes up the situation and takes on the appropriate concerned tone.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Detective Garson, is everything all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: A VIDEO MONITOR. A black and white surveillance tape of one of the school's hallways is seen.
</DIRECTION>
<GARSON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mini, this tape was shot a week before your mother's death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the nurses office is seen opening and Nurse Hauptführer walks out.
</DIRECTION>
<GARSON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The next day, the school nurse reported two bottles of Ritalin missing from the medicine cabinet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<DIRECTION>
A few seconds later, Mini is seen entering the nurse's office, checking over her shoulder to make sure no one saw her. THE TAPE FREEZES, then fast forwards. Mini is seen leaving the office, stuffing something in her pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AN EMPTY CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TV and VCR sit on a rolling cabinet in the corner, as Garson puts down the remote and looks at Mini. Principal Andrews is not pleased.
</DIRECTION>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've lifted two prints from the door and the inside of the medicine cabinet. They don't match the nurse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<PRINCIPAL_ANDREWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mini, is there something you'd like to say to Detective Garson?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCIPAL_ANDREWS>
<DIRECTION>
Mini eyes remain calm.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we see the tape of the Der Führer sucking down her afternoon fix of Smirnoff, or don't you have cameras in the bathroom stalls?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<PRINCIPAL_ANDREWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Young lady, stealing anything, especially prescription drugs is a serious matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCIPAL_ANDREWS>
<DIRECTION>
Mini looks at Andrews, her eyes suddenly starting to tear up.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got me, okay? But what was I supposed to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<PRINCIPAL_ANDREWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCIPAL_ANDREWS>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly hysterical)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She...She said if I didn't, she was...was gonna--

</MINI>
<PRINCIPAL_ANDREWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who? Another student?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCIPAL_ANDREWS>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother! She made me steal them for her! I didn't want to, but she said she was going to send me to boarding school in Canada if I didn't! P

<RINCIPAL_ANDREWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Canada?

</MINI>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(sobbing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Yukon territories! Are you happy, now? You got me!

<PRINCIPAL_ANDREWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my lord, I had know idea, she was--
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCIPAL_ANDREWS>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An addict? Detective Garson knew! We told him, and now what? The whole school's gonna know!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Mini hides her face in her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's dead, my mommy's dead. Can't we just leave her be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Andrews casts a harsh glance at a frustrated Garson.
</DIRECTION>
<PRINCIPAL_ANDREWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Detective Garson, I assume, there won't be a need to press charges against Ms. Drogues?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCIPAL_ANDREWS>
<DIRECTION>
Mini holds out her wrists to Garson.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(sniffling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gonna cuff me, Copper!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Garson looks at Mini, clearly not convinced of her innocence.
</DIRECTION>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's free to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LOBBY OF MARTIN'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin gets off the elevator and heads across the lobby. GARSON and A UNIFORMED OFFICER approach him. Martin looks a little unnerved to see them.
</DIRECTION>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, Mr. Tannen, we were just coming up to see you. Have you got a minute?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Detective, I told you no more questions without my lawyer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you'd better call him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AN INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin sits at a table, conferring with his lawyer, NED VOLANT, an impeccably dressed operator with a mane of thick, heavily gelled hair. Garson sits across from them.
</DIRECTION>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a small discrepancy that I can't quite figure out and I was hoping you might be able to explain it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose I can try.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The final toxicology report came back and your wife definitely didn't die from the pills. She wasn't conscious past 9:30, but it was the fumes that killed her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, hallelujah, thanks for the update-
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<VOLANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin, easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOLANT>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, but this is harassment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, here's what I needed to ask you. The gas tank in the Jag was almost full, just a gallon had been used.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if she was unconscious by 9:30, that means the car must have been running for at least two hours when you found her. An unconscious person can't turn on a car, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<VOLANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Detective, with all due respect, could you get to the point?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOLANT>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, here's where I get confused, see, that particular model idling for two hours will burn at least four gallons of gas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<DIRECTION>
Martin tries to remain calm, as the panic starts to settle in for a long stay.
</DIRECTION>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, there's really no way the tank could be almost full if it was running for two hours. Is there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at Martin, waiting for an answer.
</DIRECTION>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, I guess what I'm asking is, whose idea was it to put her in the car?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<VOLANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin, don't say anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOLANT>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Mr. Tannen, you clearly had the most to gain from her death, but I've learned from a number of your wife's friends that she and Mini had a strained relationship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<VOLANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Again, Detective, my client won't be answering anything, so let's just cut the cat and mouse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOLANT>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like Mr. Tannen to know that if he's trying to be a protective father by covering up something Mini did, I'd be careful. The district attorney is viewing this case as an opportunity to show the public that the rich don't get away with murder in this town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<DIRECTION>
Martin whispers something in Volant's ear and he in turn, whispers back.
</DIRECTION>
<VOLANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does this mean he's offering Mr. Tannen immunity if he says he was protecting his daughter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOLANT>
<DIRECTION>
Garson takes a sip of water, as Martin anxiously waits for his answer.
</DIRECTION>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a strong possibility. But he wants Mr. Tannen to know he will go for the maximum sentence if he doesn't. No manslaughter, no plea bargains, nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<DIRECTION>
Martin's eyes shift slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANOTHER INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Garson, now finished with Martin, sits across from Mini and her lawyer, HERB PELHAM, who doesn't look nearly as confident as Martin's lawyer.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was Colonel Mustard in the library with the candlestick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Garson smiles at Mini, admiring her resolve.
</DIRECTION>
<PELHAM>
<DIRECTION>
(nervously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh...Miss Drogues, as your lawyer-
	</DIALOGUE>
</PELHAM>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't wet your pants, I know when to shut up and swallow...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Mini takes out a sip a water, letting a trickle of liquid roll down her chin.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...my tongue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Even Garson appears a little intimidated by the overt flirtation.
</DIRECTION>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, the fact that the marriage was unhappy and there was no pre- nup gives all the motive to Martin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you want me to say it was his idea?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<GARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it was his idea, give me one reason you should take the fall?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARSON>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At that moment I knew we had him. If he was trying to get me to rat on Martin, he didn't have enough to charge either one of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So if I tell the jury it was his idea and I was scared for my life, because he said he'd kill me if I ever told anyone, then I walk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Garson instinctively leans forward in his chair, just a bit. Mini stares into Garson's eyes, unflinching. She looks around the room, weighing her options. Pelham attempts to whisper something in her ear. She waves him off.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, sport, but I'll take my chances.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTIN'S CAR - LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mini and Martin drive home together. There is an icy chill between them, as Martin looks over at Mini.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never doubted for a minute you were going to hold firm. Not a second. I hope you know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I knew...I knew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. You realize, we've got to rely on each other?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who else do we have?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. We're almost home free. My lawyer says that gas gauge theory is circumstantial as hell. I've only got one concern now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rudell. If a jury knew we were a couple, we've both got a motive and that changes everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Mini puts her hand on Martin's, reassuringly.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby, don't worry about him, he's just jealous 'cause you've still got rockin' abs and a better hairline.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Martin looks over at her, softening.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even if he did send that picture, what does it prove?...Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE SHERMAN OAKS GALLERIA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mini walks through the mall.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For all of Martin's talk of relying on each other...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN follows about a hundred yards behind.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Garson had succeeded in planting the seeds of distrust.
	</DIALOGUE>

MINI turns around and Martin ducks into a boutique.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mini walks out of a movie theater, with Kayla and TWO BOYS.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our relationship had turned into what some might call...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
A few seconds later, Martin walks out of the theater, wearing dark glasses and a hat. He follows them.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...unhealthy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THEIR LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mini sits in front of the TV, watching a commercial. She is wearing the same "Fuct" T-shirt she wore when we first met her. Her eyes are filled with anticipation.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something had to give, and ironically enough, it was the night I was making my television debut. I had asked Martin to be home by eight for a big surprise.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Martin walks in the front door with his briefcase.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hey, come and watch. You're missing me, I'm on TV!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurry up, the commercial's almost over!

</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Martin walks over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: THE TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Absolutely Positive! Comes back on and we see that MINI and A MALE CONTESTANT are sitting on either side of this show's BLONDE HAIRED ENGAGED COUPLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mini and her male counterpart are just a bit better looking than the engaged couple, both of whom have a midwestern wholesomeness.

MARTIN'S FACE turns white.

THE HOST turns to the camera.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, since Becky and I have dated since high school and decided to remain virgins until marriage, I just wanted to go on a date with another girl just to see how I would react. You know, whether there'd be any feelings of doubt about my decision?

	You slept with her?!

<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had me come home early to-

	Don't be jealous. It won't happen again. It was just a goof.

Martin stands there, speechless, while ON THE SCREEN:

BECKY dissolves into a puddle of tears as Jason tries to console her. Suddenly, she runs off stage.

MARTIN picks up the remote and hits "mute".

	Rudell? He let you go on?

	I can't believe you...th-that couple, you ruined their relationship.

<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, by the way, some intern from your office stopped by earlier today with something. It's on the desk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Martin walks over to the desk and picks up an envelope marked "MARTIN TANNEN". He opens it to find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN 8x11 PHOTO of him and Mini kissing passionately on the beach in Mexico. This time there is no question as to the nature of their relationship. Scrawled across the bottom in black marker is: "REMEMBER, I'M JUST ACROSS THE FENCE".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin's eyes scan the photo, a look of resignation setting in.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?

</MINI>

Martin slowly holds it up for her to see.

	Oh, my god.

<MARTIN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's time I had a little chat with our neighbor

</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, this is exactly what he wants! What if he's working with Garson?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then he can't blackmail me. Wait here, I'll be right back.

Martin heads for the back door.

<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, please, don't do this! Let me go with you!

</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said wait here.

Mini jumps up and runs over to him, grabbing his wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do this, we can leave tonight! We'll drive to Mexico!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Martin looks up at her.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll never leave us alone, you realize that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Let me talk to him, he promised me he wouldn't hurt us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He did? When?

</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A few days ago!

<MINI>

</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I made him think I was... interested.

A wave of nausea washes over Martin's face.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And was he?

</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Mini nods.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please tell me you didn't.

</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Mini hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Martin looks unconvinced.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just made him think I would, so he wouldn't turn us in.

	Thank you, I appreciate your restraint.

</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you. I'd think you'd be a little more appreciative.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who were you doing it for when you did it with that kid? Huh? Who was that selfless act for!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, like you're such a martyr for being faithful? It shows amazing restraint to limit yourself to just one stepdaughter!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't lecture me about fidelity! Your mother was cheating within six months of the "I do's"!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
He heads for the door again.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, if you'll excuse me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Mini grabs him again, desperate.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please-- Look, I'm sorry, I really am, but this isn't the answer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
Martin grabs her wrist, forcefully.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're hurting me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(through his teeth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Calm down or I'll snap it in two, do you hear me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Mini nods her head.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, I want you to wait here for me. Do you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Mini nods again.

<MINI>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't do this.

He lets go and calmly walks towards the sliding doors to the back yard. Mini watches him go.

EXT. RUDELL'S FRONT DOOR- MOMENTS LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin stands outside and rings the bell. The door opens and Rudell stands there in a smoking jacket and pajamas. He looks Martin up and down with a self-satisfied smile, as Sinatra's "Nice and Easy" is playing on his stereo in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martin, what a surprise, how are you?

	A natural, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<RUDELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like a duck to water...and totally willing to take direction.

Martin's jaw tightens, as Rudell is loving twisting the knife in him.

	I wish all the girls I worked with had her...how can I put this?... Need to please.

Rudell struggles to his feet and charges Martin, shoving him against his wet bar. Rudell grabs a glass and smashes it over Martin's face, grinding the glass into his face.

Martin screams in agony and throws Rudell off him. Rudell crashes into a glass coffee table, smashing it to pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin tries to pick the glass out of his eyes, as Rudell gets to his feet and grabs one of metal legs of the shattered coffee table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rushes Martin, clubbing him in the head with it. Martin crumples to the floor and Rudell starts kicking him. Martin grabs Rudell by the ankles and flips him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two men grapple on the floor.

Martin bends down and grabs Rudell's hair, twisting his head around so he can look him in the eye. In the distance a SIREN is heard getting closer.

<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, pal, she's mine! Diane may have taken pity on you between vodkas, but not her! Not her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Martin smashes his face into the patio. Rudell lets out a moan, grasping at the ground, trying to get up, but his legs don't obey him. Martin stands up and grabs the club, raising it with both hands above his head for a final swing.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now tell me where they are or I swear to god, I'll crack your head open!

He turns around to see Mini, tears coming down her cheeks, standing ten feet away. The SIRENS suddenly stop.

<MARTIN>

	Go look for the negatives!

</MARTIN>
<MINI>

	No! This is insane!

<MARTIN>

He raises the club again. Mini runs for him, grabbing his arm before it comes down.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gonna kill him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to pull the club away.

Martin turns around to see TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS with their guns drawn. Martin looks down at Rudell, gasping for air, his face covered in blood. He looks at his own blood-soaked clothes, the reality hitting him.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop the club and put your hands up!

Martin obeys and Mini runs into the arms of the second officer. The first one moves quickly to Martin and shoves him on the ground.

Martin stares straight ahead, showing no emotion as Mini sobs behind him.

<MINI>

	Oh...I wouldn't worry about that.

</MARTIN>
<MINI>

	I'm pretty sure he won't be doing anything with them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI>
<DIRECTION>
He looks suddenly very worried.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mini, you're not thinking of sleeping with him to keep him quiet? Because I've met people in here who could help us with him, if it comes to that.

</MARTIN>
<MINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help us?

Mini's eyes glint ever so slightly, as she examines Martin's face, almost as if he's an animal at the zoo.

Martin furrows his brow, confused.

Martin looks at her blankly.

Suddenly, it hits him. He looks almost nauseous.

	What a sweetie, I thought I might have to fuck him, but just giving him the camera was enough.

His knuckles tighten around the phone.

Martins jaw tightens as his pupils go black.

Martin stares at her, taking deep steady breaths.

	...As many of you know, the past few months of my life have been very difficult. I don't know how I would have gotten through it without all of you. I really think it is a testament to the love in this institution, that I stand before you today, as the first straight "C" student in school history voted Valedictorian.

	I know I did, and I just wish my dad could be here today, so after this speech I could just walk down into the audience and give him my love right here...in front of all of you. Thank you and good luck.
