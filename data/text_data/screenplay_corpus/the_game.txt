EXT. VAN ORTON HOUSE - DAY (HOME MOVIES)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1. TITLES OVER "HOME MOVIES" from the 1960's -- FLICKERING, GRAINY, HAND-HELD, KODACHROME COLORS. MUSIC OVER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BIRTHDAY BOY with a blindfold spins round and round, the HANDS of OTHER CHILDREN keep him spinning. MAIN TITLE. It's a game of pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey. The dizzy boy is given a strip of felt, and the CAMERA follows as he stumbles toward a large cardboard donkey. He pins the tail on its nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
2. QUICK, RAGGED CUTS-- the BOY blows out candles... opens gifts... a CLOWN ties balloon animals. CHILDREN, MAIDS and BUTLERS hover about; there's even a real-live PONY. The party take splace in the gardens of a massive Pacific Heights MANSION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
3. THE BOY is SCHUYLER VAN ORTON (7), and this is his birthday party. He's a serious-looking child, who adjusts his glasses as he poses for a shot with his mother, MRS. VAN ORTON, a stiff-looking society matron. A NANNY brings over an INFANT and gently places the baby in Schuyler's arms. Schuyler is ultra-careful, over- whelmed by the responsibility of holding his tiny BROTHER (DAVID).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
4. THE BOY and the other children sit spellbound, watching a magic show in the front GARDEN-- a MAGICIAN waves a colored handkerchief, a DOVE FLIES OUT. CAMERA FOLLOWS the bird UP toward the house...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
5. THE CAMERA FINDS MR. VAN ORTON, a pinched, depressive man of about 40, wearing glasses. He stands on a high balcony at the top story of the mansion, in a bathrobe, smoking a cigarette. The unseen photographer ZOOMS IN jerkily on the man. When he realizes he's being photographed, Mr. Van Orton turns his back and goes inside the house. The film SOLARIZES and runs into LEADER--

EXT. VAN ORTON HOUSE-DAY(PRESENTDAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES CONTINUE. Early morning, the same mansion (ideally an ornate Victorian or Arts & Crafts). The landscaping has changed, there are some modern touches, such as an iron gate surrounding the carriageway, a black 500-class MERCEDES in the drive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC DOWN, SEGUE to a CNN NEWS BROADCAST OVER as the CAMERA MOVES IN ON THE UPPER BALCONY where we'd seen Mr. Van Orton earlier... it's now COVERED and GLASSED-IN. We move THROUGH THE GLASS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACK THROUGH a large master bedroom; neat, masculine and Spartan, free weights, a treadmill. Atop the bed a LAPTOP COMPUTER runs STOCK QUOTES. A LARGE-SCREEN TV plays UNWATCHED, a familiar CNN ANCHOR (we'll assume BERNARD SHAW). The Bang & Olufsen CLOCK RADIO CLICKS ON, 6:30 am; CLASSICAL MUSIC now DUELS with the TV report. HAND-ANNOTATED PAPERWORK and STOCK READOUTS cover a NIGHT TABLE, where the ringing multi-line TELEPHONE JOINS the cacophony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END TITLES as we MOVE TOWARD a DOOR, it's open a crack-- from this adjacent bath we hear the SOUND OF A SHOWER RUNNING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASTER BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the steam-filled bathroom, we make out SCHUYLER VAN ORTON, now 38. He's handsome, fit and apparently in complete control of his world. He steps out of the shower, wraps a towel around himself and grabs the BATHROOM PHONE.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(on phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Van Orton... Yes, it is my birthday, Bob, is that why you called...? Ah... No, I'm not carrying Alan Baer another inch, fuck him, BG Lumber is history...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
As he speaks, he continues his morning ritual-- hair combing, Q- tips, etc. (Schuyler is a man in almost constant motion.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black Mercedes moves quickly through morning traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHUYLER'S CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER is on his car phone, NEWS RADIO LOW in BG, maneuvering aggressively through traffic. His laptop RUNS in the passenger seat, its cellular antenna up.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(on carphone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ignore the rumors, Alan, you know me, of course I'm behind Baer- Grace a hundred per cent... great, see you at the shareholders' meeting next month...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up and HONKS at another driver, displaying no emotion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAN ORTON OFFICES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACK WITH SCHUYLER through an elegant suite of offices. He passes a discreet sign: "THE VAN ORTON GROUP." Schuyler is on a cell- phone, carrying the laptop, trailed by MARIA, his middle-aged secretary. She bears paperwork and patiently awaits his attention.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(on cellphone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got buyers for the BG paper mill, goose the lawyers, final papers in three weeks... sure it's sad, but an old dog loses its teeth and pisses itself, you put it to sleep...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
As Schuyler walks, he's GREETED by passing UNDERLINGS, whom he ignores. He SHUTS OFF the phone, Maria hands him a couple of items, follows him into his office.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carol from the museum called. She's sending architect's sketches of the wing...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHUYLER'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The office is large, tasteful, reeks of old money. A window overlooks the San Francisco skyline and the Bay.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That Business Week reporter called again--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him to fuck himself. Nicely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<MARIA>
<DIRECTION>
(awkwardly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--and, um, somebody who identified himself as, um, P.P. Willy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER FREEZES at this, stares at her.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, I figured it was a crank, but he swore you'd know who he was. He wanted to meet you for lunch, I told him you had appointments all--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cancel. Cancel the whole afternoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it. Did he leave a number?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. He just said he'd be at Leo's in the Haight. At noon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<DIRECTION>
Maria hands him a slip of paper, lingers, awaiting explanation...
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all, Maria.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
She heads out quickly. Schuyler stares at the slip, then turns to look out the window, lost in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LEO'S - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A working class bar, an ALCOHOLIC or two, pinball machines. SCHUYLER sits a table near a window, checking his watch, it's not his kind of place. A WAITRESS arrives in a too-small uniform-- young, multiple earrings, CHRISTINE according to her name tag.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I take your order?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't seen the menu.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, right. Here, see ya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him a menu and starts off. Schuyler calls after her.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An iced tea, please--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
She waves a hand, "yeah, right," without looking back. Schuyler sighs and opens the menu. Suddenly, someone BACKHANDS the side of his skull, he assumes a defensive posture. Schuyler sees his LAUGHING brother: DAVID VAN ORTON.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yo, Sky. Happy birthday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(rubs his head, annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, "Pee-pee." I never get tired of that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID slides into the seat opposite him. He's in his early 30's, good-looking but unkempt, wears bright, funky clothes, an earring and a perpetual grin. There's an intense, edgy quality to him which Schuyler has some trouble readjusting to.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, since Mom died-- what, five years? So how you been?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Business as usual...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's Elizabeth? Any kids?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congrat--
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not mine, she married a pediatrician in Sausalito.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're divorced...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Schuyler's nod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad, she was actually interesting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She stopped drinking, I guess getting rid of me was the 13th step.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're all alone in the House of Pain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I redecorated. Where have you been?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All over. Nowhere in particular. Didn't your fucking gumshoes keep you informed of my every movement?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I called them off two years ago, David. You'd kicked the heroin, you'd left the ashram, you were windsurfing somewhere in Central America...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gorgeous down there... you should go sometime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, are you in trouble, is there anything you need? You can't have gone through the trust fund...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at him, hurt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not why I'm here, Sky, I just wanted to see you... I even brought a gift, for a change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't bake me a cake, did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't still be mad about the hash brownies...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler's unamused by the memory. David grins and pulls a small envelope out of his pocket, tosses it on the table in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy birthday, bro.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a bomb. Open it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler shrugs, opens the envelope and shakes out--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BUSINESS CARD in BLUE and ORANGE: "CONSUMER RECREATION SERVICES." The C, R and S are HIGHLIGHTED, a PHONE NUMBER at the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER picks up the card, fingers it.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Consumer Recreation Services. OK...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't tell you very much about it, that'd ruin the surprise. Just promise me you'll give 'em a call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just call 'em. OK look, it's simple, really. They entertain you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this an escort service?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's nothing like that. They're a business, they're for real... They guarantee just one thing-- you won't be bored.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler gives him a bored, blank look. David throws up his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They make your life fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've heard of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Christine the waitress has shown up with Schuyler's iced tea. She puts it down hastily, spilling some across the table. Schuyler shies away, grabbing a napkin and blotting it up before it can drip into his lap. Cracking gum:
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She moves off as Schuyler tries to order, raising a finger--
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a cheesebur... how'd you find this place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Old connection used to meet me here. So you gonna call 'em?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(a sigh, carefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, David, this is sweet, but it's an awfully busy time, I'm in the midst of a delicate liquidation--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(mimicking him bitterly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"A delicate liquidation," God, you would do this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't get together once without you making me feel like shit. That's important to you, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget about it, don't bother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David slumps in his seat, won't meet Schuyler's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you still on medication...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
David glares at him. With the impeccable timing of all waitresses, CHRISTINE appears, chipper.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys know what you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
She curls her lip and departs before Schuyler can open his mouth. He sighs, resigned to the idea of not eating. Calmly:
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just thought you'd like it. I did, it was a blast, best thing that ever happened to me. And for your information, I'm not on anything anymore, I'm not even seeing a shrink, I'm in a better place than I've ever been, I'm even happy-- but that's something else I wouldn't be able to explain to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, OK, I'll give them a call...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, take a pill. Just be normal for thirty seconds and tell me what this is. I hate surprises.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>

David WINKS, puts a finger to his lips-- not another word.

EXT. VAN ORTON OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

ESTABLISH the moonlit exterior of an older, classy building in downtown San Francisco. MOVE IN on a high window, one of the few LIT at this hour. We hear the SOUND OF A PHONE CHIRPING OVER.

INT. SCHUYLER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

COMPUTERS run, stacks of PAPERWORK, etc. PHONE continues to RING.

ELIZABETH is Schuyler's ex-wife-- an earnest woman, a stranger to subtlety. STAY WITH SCHUYLER, who half-smiles, looks at his watch.

(on speaker) (slight chuckle; serious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you, Sky?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
She has the concerned, forthright tone of a "recovery person," someone who's been through a lot of therapy and wants to reach out. Schuyler GRIMACES, then mimics the tone:
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just fine. How are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<ELIZABETH>

	I meant-- because of your father.

</SCHUYLER>

He PUNCHES off the phone in the middle of her "Good-bye." Schuyler returns to his work, as if the call hadn't taken place-- but a few seconds later, we see his concentration is completely shattered, he leans back in his SQUEAKING deskchair.

EXT. VAN ORTON HOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LIMOUSINE pulls into the ungated carriageway. THE BACK DOOR OPENS and SCHUYLER (7) emerges from the backseat, carrying elementary schoolbooks. As he approaches the front steps, he looks upward at something, blinks and squints.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE UP-- MR. VAN ORTON, in his robe, stands on the balcony railing, looking up at the sky. He turns his gaze slowly downward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YOUNG SCHUYLER is puzzled, gives his dad a tentative wave.
</DIRECTION>

MR. VAN ORTON waves back, his eyes dead, expression blank.

YOUNG SCHUYLER opens his mouth to call to his father-- instead we hear an URGENT ELECTRONIC BEEPING--

INT. SCHUYLER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

A MICROWAVE OVEN BEEPS that the meal is "READY." SCHUYLER opens the door, takes out his upscale junk food, grabs a fork.

INT. SCHUYLER'S DEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON A BIG-SCREEN TV, a CNN NEWSCAST shows a FIRE OUT OF CONTROL. MOVE FROM THIS through the manly, book-lined den. The house is traditional, opulent, densely decorated with "good pieces"-- and it feels like a mausoleum.

FIND SCHUYLER peeling open the plastic food container. He sits in a leather armchair. A BOTTLE OF DOM PERIGNON sits on the coffee table, near a champagne flute glass, a CUPCAKE with a CANDLE in it. The LAPTOP computer is RUNNING.

SCHUYLER reaches for the REMOTE CONTROL. He settles back on the sofa, CHANNEL HOPPING. He despairs of this quickly, points the remote at his own head-- CLICK, CLICK. He closes his eyes.

EXT. VAN ORTON HOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. VAN ORTON stands on the edge of the balcony, waving as before. He looks skyward one last time, then suddenly LAUNCHES HIMSELF INTO SPACE in a head-first dive. We hear what sounds like a SCREAM--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRS BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--it's a CAR HORN. The vehicle passes to reveal SCHUYLER striding toward a postmodern building in the financial district; a ramp leads to a parking garage beneath. Casually dressed, he glances up at the facade for a few moments, then goes in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRS LOBBY AND ATRIUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The very new, dramatic structure is built around a central twelve- story atrium narrowing to a SKYLIGHT above. There's still some minor construction underway on the ground floor, scaffolding about. Schuyler crosses to a bank of lobby elevators.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRS ELEVATOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler looks out the glass elevator as it rises vertiginously. HIS POV as the atrium shrinks below him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRS OFFICES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Partitioned work areas, terminals, clutter and disarray. Office doors open off a reception area. CRS EMPLOYEES move about hectically. Schuyler enters, wanders about for a moment, confused. A friendly female RECEPTIONIST glances up from her desk.
</DIRECTION>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this Consumer Recreation Services? I have an appointment, the name's Van Orton.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
The woman flips through an appointment book with a logo, CRS. IN BG, JIM FEINGOLD pays a CHINESE DELIVERY GUY for a BAG OF FOOD.
</DIRECTION>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hm... I don't seem to--
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Schuyler Van Orton, I called last week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
The woman shakes her head. FEINGOLD slows as he crosses past Schuyler, carrying the bag. He's 30-40, a no-nonsense engineer, looks a bit dull, but he exudes competence and trustworthiness.
</DIRECTION>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This gentlemen says he has an appointment, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<DIRECTION>
Feingold glances at Schuyler, shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Van Orton, huh? I'll take him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes his hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jim Feingold, v. p. in charge of engineering and data analysis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<DIRECTION>
The man leads Schuyler to a row of open boxes on the floor, looks in a couple, then finds what he's after. He snatches up a couple of pages, hands them to Schuyler. Then he finds a clipboard on the floor, tosses it to him like a frisbee.
</DIRECTION>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about the chaos, we're still in the process of moving... follow me, I've got an office around here someplace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>

He reaches into a box of PENS, passes one to Schuyler.

INT. FEINGOLD'S OFFICE/HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A modern, dramatic office. Swoopy furniture, imposing ART, all very cool-looking. Feingold moves behind the desk, unpacks a couple of white cartons.
</DIRECTION>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't remember the last time I ate in a restaurant, all I do is work...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER sits on a couch, looking at the forms.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you mean. Look-- what is all this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
The fast-talking Feingold moves energetically through the office, occasionally picking at his food or poking at the air with chopsticks-- he's a bit hyper and fidgety in general.
</DIRECTION>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Application, MMPI and TAT tests, financial statement...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating food)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want some? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Schuyler shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The tests serve a threefold purpose. First off, are you right for us? Are we right for you? Unfortunately, there's a limited number of slots--
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's back up here--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<FEINGOLD>
<DIRECTION>
(over him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	B, we need an idea of your abilities and limitations, what turns you on, and off. Numero tres, our insurance company requires it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat, studying Schuyler)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're familiar with our service, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all. What are you selling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... it's a game.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A game.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Recharges the batteries, gets you off the treadmill, it's an experience. Sort of a-- vacation for the guy who's been everywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This really doesn't sound like my sort of--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Feingold sits on the edge of his desk, arms crossed, nodding and smiling condescendingly-- he raises a hand to stop Schuyler.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's so amusing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. I know who you are. You're David Van Orton's brother, he got you in here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<FEINGOLD>
<DIRECTION>
(remembering fondly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David was-- impressive, one of the better I've seen. But frankly, I can see you're not the type.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The type.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, a player.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not a player.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mean anything personal by it-- I know you're an important guy, powerful guy, you're used to being on top. It's just, this isn't for everyone. Not everyone can handle it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(nearly losing it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of fu-- game is this?
	</DIALOGUE>

	The ultimate fucking game. I wish I could tell you more, but it's different every time.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for coming in--

</FEINGOLD>
<SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(doesn't move)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not an idiot. I see what you're doing. First the vague yet intriguing pitch, then I'm supposed to feel like my manhood's in question because I'm not up for, what, some motivational role-playing fantasy nonsense--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Interesting, you don't know the first thing about it but you've already decided what it is... Listen, I don't wanna waste any more--
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Jim, cut the hard-to-get shit. I've got the afternoon free, I'll take your silly tests.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Feingold cocks his head, reappraising him. Then, with a smile, he calls to an attractive young WOMAN passing in the hall; Schuyler, meanwhile, flips through the pages of the tests.
</DIRECTION>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Nelson, are you busy? We need someone to run Mr. Van Orton.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<MS_NELSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This way, sir...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_NELSON>
<DIRECTION>
As she leads Schuyler out the door, Feingold WINKS at him.
</DIRECTION>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll catch up with you after the physical.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler reacts-- a physical? He throws up a hand and follows the woman into the hall. Alone now, Feingold cracks a fortune cookie and glances at the slip of paper inside. He furrows his brow with concern at the fortune-- then tosses it aside.

:SC: CRS OFFICES - SERIES OF SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
During the following QUICK CUTS, SOUNDS will be layered in and CONTINUE over one another, e. g. the SOUND of a scraping pencil, the BLIPS of machinery, HEAVY BREATHING, MURMURING VOICES of TECHNICIANS giving instructions...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A. X-CLOSE: A #2 pencil FILLS IN box after box on a long MMPI form. CLOSE on a couple of these: "I sometimes hurt animals... I feel guilty when I masturbate..." each followed by TRUE and FALSE boxes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B. A WHITE-WALLED ROOM: Schuyler concentrates on a drawing held by a stone-faced PSYCHOLOGIST, a TAT test; he laughs as he speaks into a tape-recorder, analyzing the pictures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C. X-CLOSE: The DRAWING, a large ant with an apron feeding a TV dinner to a human child. The card moves just as we register it to reveal another DRAWING of a smiling man toppling backwards in a chair, perched on the edge of a cliff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D. A LAB: Electronic MONITORS and PRINTERS record Schuyler's EEG and EKG. We see him on a doctor's table, wearing a medical gown with the CRS logo. He's hooked up to the wires, a female TECHNICIAN studying the readouts while a NURSE takes his blood pressure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
E. X-CLOSE: The traveling trace of intersecting colored waves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
F. A DARKENED ROOM: Schuyler in FG, still in the gown, watches a screen as images FLASH-- geometric SHAPES, WORDS, PHOTOS. His finger hovers over a bank of three buttons, he presses different ones from time to time. There's a MIRROR to one side of the room--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
G. X-CLOSE: A COMPUTER SCREEN shows green columns of NUMBERS-- SCHUYLER'S NAME is steady at the top of the screen, with an account number. CAMERA MOVES FROM THE SCREEN to show an unseen COMPUTER OPERATOR watching Schuyler through the one-way glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CACOPHONY of the MONTAGE ends abruptly as we CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CUBICLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler, in the gown, sits on an examination table with his hands in his lap in a small, featureless cubicle-- he seems vulnerable, looks around blankly. To himself, irritated and bemused:
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David, you suck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
FEINGOLD BURSTS IN, a slew of COMPUTER PRINT-OUTS under his arm.

<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry to keep you waiting, a client's head exploded...

<DIRECTION>
(grins)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can get dressed, we're done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<DIRECTION>
He throws open a closet door. Schuyler reaches inside for his clothes, which are neatly folded and on hangers. Feingold turns his back on him as he DRESSES, perching on the examination table and studying the unburst print-outs.
</DIRECTION>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks promising at this point. You test well, you're in decent shape for someone in your tax bracket... Hm, some resistance to the psych questions, but we got the general idea...

</FEINGOLD>
<DIRECTION>
He heads out, beckons for Schuyler to follow.

INT. CRS MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Feingold leads him through the office-- SECRETARIES and other WORKERS pack up at the end of the day.
</DIRECTION>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We design the game around your schedule, you're free to give it as much or as little time as you wish. And of course, you can call it quits at any point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was actually a gift. Did my brother pay in advance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd have to ask our billing department... the price varies. But our service comes with a guarantee. If you're not satisfied, there's no charge. And we've never had an unsatisfied customer...

CLOSE ON PAPERWORK as it's dropped on the desktop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER, CRS pen in hand, looks at this dubiously.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I'm supposed to sign up for a game when I don't know the rules, I don't know the object, I don't know how much it costs...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a leap of faith. But at this stage, there's no commitment-- we just need to process your application. And if you qualify, you're in for the ride of your life. What have you got to lose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler CLICKS the ballpoint pen, they both lean over the papers.

	Initials-- initials-- sign here.

Schuyler's about to sign when Feingold grabs his wrist.

FEINGOLD snatches up the forms, suddenly seems in a hurry for Schuyler to go.

	Very good, Mr. Van Orton. Please, keep the pen.

EXT. COUNTRY CLUB BAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER, in casual clothes, hair still wet from a shower, comes out of a locker room area toward an outdoor BAR by a SWIMMING POOL at this upscale country ciub. He passes PETE and JOHN, two middle- aged RICH MEN sitting at a table near the bar; he overhears a snippet of their conversation--
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--like fuckin' wildfire, just opened an office in Frisco here--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<PETE>

</PETE>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not likely, would you?

Schuyler slows down, eavesdropping, then moves toward the bar, addresses the BARTENDER with a nod toward John and Pete.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	New members?

Schuyler moves casually toward the men--

SAME LOCATION, LATER, the bartender brings another round of drinks to the table, Schuyler and the men have been chatting a while, all seem relaxed. Pete, the friendlier (drunker) of the two, puffs a CIGAR as he speaks:
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...last time I played Pebble, I swore I'd never pick up a club again...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
The others CHUCKLE knowingly. Schuyler sips his drink, blinking and coughing discretely at the smoke; there's a slight pause.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great thing about golf, the way it takes you out of your life... Speaking of games-- I take it you two are familiar with CRS...?

</SCHUYLER>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-oh. Time to piss...

He slides off his stool. Pete studies Schuyler, sizing him up.

	Why do you ask, Schuyler?

</PETE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>

<PETE>

	We don't usually talk about it.

	Did you? Kudos.

	Sorry?

</SCHUYLER>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I don't know you, you don't know me, but... I hit a certain point, nothing meant anything. My work, the wife and kids-- hell with 'em, I was sick of it all, y'know? But CRS... they changed everything. "Are they for real?" Who cares, maybe nothing is.

	<DIALOGUE>
	To reality.

Schuyler raises his glass, numbed by this outpouring. Pete drains his drink, chuckling to himself. His friend comes back, looking concerned, takes the man's arm.

A slick, designery conference room, filled with BABBLING LAWYERS-- at the head of the table stands BOB PLYMPTON, a trustworthy man in his late 50's. MURMURING CONTINUES during Plympton's address.
</DIRECTION>
<PLYMPTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. Excuse me! Postponing the Baer-Grace meeting is out of the question. Schuyler gets on a plane for Washington tomorrow morning at seven with every contract, every side agreement, the complete closing package!

Schuyler has been going through paperwork in the back of the room, he steps forward during the above.

<DIRECTION>
THWAP! Schuyler DROPS the stack of papers on the table, SILENCE.

	No is not an option. If you fail to recognize that, I'll find ten other law firms in the yellow pages that can get the job done--

CLICK and a DIAL TONE. Schuyler shuts the phone and replaces it in his pocket, his mind suddenly far away from the meeting at hand. PLYMPTON, a wel1-meaning man with a fatherly attitude toward Schuyler, steps close to him and speaks quietly, concerned:
</DIRECTION>
<PLYMPTON>

EXT. VAN ORTON HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER pulls up in his MBZ, the electric gate glides shut. He gets out of the car and SETS THE ALARM. He heads for the front steps of his home-- then freezes, blinks--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HIS DOORSTEP lies a body, face-down, apparently a WINO, in a tattered, filthy overcoat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VAN ORTON HOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAME ANGLE, QUICK SHOT of the body of MR. VAN ORTON, sprawled across the steps in much the same position as the wino, flat on his stomach, head twisted at a grotesque angle. His bathrobe is even similar in color to the wino's overcoac.

EXT. VAN ORTON HOUSE - NIGHT

SCHUYLER shakes off the memory, looking alarmed. He calls out:
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello! What are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
THE BODY doesn't stir. He approaches gingerly.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wonderful. You OK? You dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He crouches by the wino, winces at a strong smell, covers his nose. He reaches out to touch the body, but hesitates, pulls back. Alive or dead, he doesn't want to have anything to do with this person.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, shit, shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
The "wino" suddenly SPRINGS UP like a jack-in-the-box, bending backwards impossibly at the hips. Schuyler lets out a CRY and scrambles back toward his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HEAD swivels to face him-- it's a grotesque HARLEQUIN, its head made of COLORED GLASS, LIT from within. The MOUTH DROPS OPEN and a tongue in the shape of a corkscrew SPRINGS OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SMALL KEY ON A HOOK dangles from the tip of the tongue. One of the harlequin's glass eyes WINKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER stares in amazement for a few moments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on the dangling KEY as Schuyler fingers it. The key catches the light and we see the letters "CRS" embossed on it.

INT. SCHUYLER'S FOYER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DUMMY is dumped in a straight-back chair in the foyer.

SCHUYLER takes a step back and studies it. He crosses its legs, smirks and shakes his head, ascending the stairs.

WIDER, Schuyler, squinting, in a bathrobe, enters from the bathroom off the bedroom, putting his contact lens case into a toiletries case. He's been packing a leather GARMENT BAG, which hangs from a door, slips the toiletries into a "side pouch. The TV PLAYS in BG, Bernard Shaw delivering the news.

On this last line, Shaw's voice starts to ECHO and CHANGE.

SCHUYLER rises, staring at the TV, mouth agape.

SCHUYLER has snatched up the CRS pen to write down the number-- it doesn't work. SWEARING, he tosses it aside, grabs another.

SCHUYLER crouches by a coaxial cable line emerging from the side of the house. He fingers a box with a miniature LOOP and RABBIT EAR ANTENNA that's been spliced into the line with a tiny S-shaped WIRE. He starts to unscrew it, then thinks twice, heads back in.

SCHUYLER comes out of the gate with the garment bag and a briefcase. He joins up with a DRIVER carrying a sign that says VAN ORTON, the man takes his bag for him.

	I'm expecting a package with some documents. Did it arrive?

The man shakes his head, Schuyler, exasperated, whips out his cell- phone and dials. As he and the driver move through the CROWD, they pass a red-eyed, dredlocked, homeless-looking RASTA MAN in a BRIGHTLY COLORED outfit with knit cap, hassling other TRAVELERS. He turns his attention to Schuyler and begins walking alongside.

The rasta man jogs alongside, holds up a stained, newsprint religious TRACT, Schuyler glances at it without taking it--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-- we see the words "CRISIS, REVELATION, SOLUTION." The letters C, Rand S are printed in a different color from the rest.

EXT. SEA-TAC TERMINAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cold and bleak. The little white truck emerges from the terminal, crosses the tarmac, heading toward an IDLING HELICOPTER, where is stops. From the chopper, ALAN BAER emerges-- he's an elderly, muscular man, bluff, once blue-collar. He gives Schuyler a firm handshake. They have to SHOUT over the WHIRRING BLADES:
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alan! What's wrong with a car--

SCHUYLER looks uncomfortable with this prospect. The driver is already loading his bag into the chopper. Baer claps a hand on Schuyler's shoulder, leading him under the wash, into the chopper.

THE RASTA MAN is walking slowly across the tarmac nearby. He watches the HELICOPTER ASCEND with a half-smile.

</DIRECTION>

ON SCHUYLER, looking disappointed, and annoyed with himself-- he realizes he's missed something. He reaches into his pocket as Baer DRONES ON beside him. Schuyler pulls out his KEYS, fingers the gold one with the CRS logo, thinking.

PAN from a WINDOW. Outside, we see a sign-- BAER-GRACE LUMBER-- and the helicopter, now idle on a pad. MOVE PAST a HUMMING FAX MACHINE, find Schuyler addressing Alan Baer across a table. A couple of other LUMBER EXECS are present. Everyone wears a stricken expression, Schuyler's tone is matter-of-fact.

Schuyler studies the SENSELESS PAGES for a moment then puts them down, shaking off his apprehensions.

	Never mind... we'll just have to go with the earlier draft.

In BG, one exec picks up a page, WHISPERS to an ASSISTANT, who moves out of the room. Schuyler moves to his briefcase. It's LOCKED. He starts patting his pockets.

	Up my ass, very funny...

</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes drift to a piece of CORPORATE STATIONARY on the table in front of him. He picks it up:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - UNDER BAER-GRACE LETTERHEAD we see a handscrawled note: "CRS CALLED." We don't see what's written below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER is reeling, paranoia confirmed.

<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't-- OK. OK, you're with CRS...

</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Baer stares at him blankly. Schuyler puts a hand over his eyes, seems disoriented, trying to piece it all together.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So the game, it's just a screen, to blow this deal...

	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
The assembled execs are looking at Schuyler in utter confusion. As he speaks, the ASSISTANT returns with some PAPERWORK. Schuyler stares at him menacingly. Hesitantly:
</DIRECTION>
<ASSISTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um... sorry to interrupt. We've been having some trouble with this fax, so they re-sent the material. It's all OK now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSISTANT>
<DIRECTION>
The assistant comes over, cheerfully places the crucial documents in front of Schuyler. The assistant fishes in his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<ASSISTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh and Mr. Van Orton-- are these yours? The pilot found 'em on the floor of the chopper...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSISTANT>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler gingerly takes the KEYS which the assistant holds out, looks from them to the paperwork. Then he glances back at the handwritten note on the table:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT NOTE: It actually reads "CBS CALLED." (Schuyler's thumb or a Post-It note covered the base of the B before, making it look like an R.) It continues "Re: Interview with Alan B. on Sun..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER takes a breath, reassembles his composure and consults his watch. He rises, anxious to put the last few minutes behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything seems to be in order. Please disregard my last comments. The shareholders meeting is about to get underway... Shall we?

The rasta nods with a big grin. Schuyler steps forward, hand extended. The rasta flings open the door of a STALL beside him and hurls the key into the TOILET. Instinctively, Schuyler moves to grab it, reaches into the toilet, pulls out the chain, his hand and sleeve DRIPPING. The key is missing from the end of the chain.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck am I doing?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<RASTA_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don' worry, mon, it's a world a shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASTA_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
He drops the rasta schtick, speaks with an Ivy League accent:
</DIRECTION>
<RASTA_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So try looking at it through rose- colored glasses... here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASTA_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
He takes off his sunglasses, folds them and tucks them in the pocket of Schuyler's suit. Then he reaches above him and pulls down the briefcase, which was perched on top of the stall. Schuyler grabs it from him, raises his voice:
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you, this is over! I quit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<RASTA_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They all say that at first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASTA_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
He gives Schuyler a hearty SLAP on the back and strolls off, HUMMING. Schuyler leans against the wall, shaking his head. He puts down his luggage, pulls the sunglasses from his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON SUNGLASSES-- there's the image of a tiny GOLD KEY embossed on each of the arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER puts them on, looks around for a moment, catches a GLIMPSE of himself in the mirror-- he looks silly. He quickly takes them off. As Schuyler heads out the door we see him from behind... the Rasta has slapped a colorful SIGN that reads "KICK ME" on his back.
</DIRECTION>

CUT TO:

EXT. LEO'S - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE NEON SIGN FIZZLES in front of this low-rent establishment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LEO'S - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELLS RING and LIGHTS FLASH as a DRUNK plays a PINBALL MACHINE with a lot of body English. SCHUYLER, stuck at a table right next to the machine, winces at the noise, checks his watch and rises. He makes his way through the lunch hour CROWD to the bar, leans toward the bartender, a gravelly-voiced woman-- RONNIE.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was supposed to meet someone here, a David Van Orton-- I was wondering if he'd left a message.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Fraid not, sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
He drums his fingers, then whips out a CELLPHONE, spins around quickly as he starts to dial--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--and SMACKS into Christine the waitress as she emerges from the kitchen carrying a tray--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--SCHUYLER gets hit in the chest with a TRAY OF DESSERTS, colorful JELLO, CREAM PIE, etc. He stands there, stunned and DRIPPING.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She starts picking up plates and silverware, oblivious to Schuyler's own plight; Ronnie charges out from behind the bar. After the first shock, Schuyler CHUCKLES with annoyance. He wipes the phone clean, pocketing it.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh this is cute. Very cute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened here, you OK?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was an accident--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No it wasn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie gives Christine a look as she starts wiping at Schuyler with a rag. He picks at his chest, examines the WHIPPED CREAM, tastes it. Schuyler addresses the kneeling Christine:
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's next, a giant banana peel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
CHRISTINE squints up at him, puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh? Oh I get it-- you're nuts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chrissy, just apologize...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dickhead here was on the phone, he walked right into me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop the act, you've been waiting all day for this moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut the fuck up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go home, you're fired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You heard me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She THROWS a plate on the ground, it shatters, then storms off into the kitchen. Schuyler CHUCKLES angrily, pushing through the slop on the floor with his shoe, looking for something.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get this over with... Where's the next key? Does she have it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie stares, uncomprehending... Schuyler goes after Christine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LEO'S KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses past a short-order COOK in the grimy industrial kitchen, pulling a cube of JELLO out of his lapel pocket. He finds Christine in an alcove with a couple of lockers, as she finishes changing into her street clothes. Her brown uniform hangs from a locker door, the nameplate "CHRIS" prominent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE as his fingers touch the CRS of CHRIS-- they even look a bit brighter than the H and the I.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish you people could be a little more subtle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
CHRISTINE notices him for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Asshole, just send me the goddamn dry-cleaning bill. Could you--?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She waves a hand at him, "go away" and ducks out of view, finishing dressing into punk-grungy street clothes. She SLAMS the locker, starts to push past him, pulling on her backpack bag.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you have something for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh sure, here you go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She puts her hand into her side pocket, pulls it out with her middle finger extended, moving away from him in a hurry. Schuyler's face falls-- he made another mistake.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, you really work here--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not anymore, thanks to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She's out the SWINGING kitchen door. Schuyler absorbs his blunder for a moment, then hurries after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LEO'S - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler catches up as Christine hurries toward a MUNI station, LIGHTING a cigarette. A few PEDESTRIANS come off the steps from the arriving elevated train in this residential SF neighborhood.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Slow down-- you don't understand, I thought it was a gag.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you don't understand. I carry mace and I know how to use it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches into her purse/backpack, Schuyler backs off.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was only trying to apologize.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, it's in here somewhere--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to move away, then they both hear GASPING O. S.--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE STEPS, a HEAVY MAN, 60, in a coat and tie has collapsed, struggling for breath, very pale. Christine and Schuyler are the only pedestrians around now.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She rushes to help the guy, loosening his tie-- he JOLTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER looks up at them dubiously, brushing a scrap of food still clinging to his suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHRISTINE reaches in to clear the guy's throat, starting CPR. She shoots a look at Schuyler.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a fucking phone, call an ambulance!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler approaches slowly, pulling out his phone, studying the guy as Christine gives him mouth-to-mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is just too weird-- it can't be real--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really are insane!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER leans close to look at the man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE MAN'S FACE-- sweating, contorted, unnaturally pale, his eyes rolling back as he GAGS his last...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHRISTINE grabs the phone away from Schuyler, dials.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need an ambulance, guy's having a heart attack near the MUNI station at 5th and Market--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Schuyler)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the number on this thing?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't give it out--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off her horrified look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	731-5723--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	731-5723-- yeah, thanks--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She stuffs the phone in a pocket and pumps the man's chest, returns to the mouth-to-mouth. Schuyler looks around uncomfortably, starting to believe this is a real heart attack.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there anything I can do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
CHRISTINE ignores him, all attention on saving this guy's life...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE as an AMBULANCE pulls up, SIREN BLARING. A couple of MALE PARAMEDICS hurry out with a stretcher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE STEPS, the two PARAMEDICS lift the unconscious HEAVY MAN onto the stretcher while Christine and Schuyler stand aside. Both have small EARPIECES that look like hearing aids, with wires into their clothes. Throughout the following, there's a lot of MEDICAL BUSINESS-- feeding the victim OXYGEN, giving him INJECTIONS, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<PARAMEDIC_1>
<DIRECTION>
(to Schuyler)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you come with us, help us fill out a few forms--
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARAMEDIC_1>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! I have work to do--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She climbs into the back, they start to shut the doors.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute, you've got my phone--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs in to get it back, they SLAM THE DOORS and start moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE AMBULANCE peels out. We now see the LOGO on the back: "CITYWIDE RESCUE SYSTEMS," with the C, R and S in RED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AMBULANCE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PARAMEDICS are intent on the gasping man. The SIREN BLARES, a bit MUFFLED in here. Schuyler, looking out the back, is extremely pissed, makes a fist and almost punches the wall of the ambulance.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chill, will you?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to be here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither do I, now siddown, get outta their way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
A BUMP almost sends him flying atop the stretcher. Schuyler sits near Christine on a ledge near the back doors. Petulant:
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like my phone back please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE/GARAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An UNDERGROUND RAMP, signs reading "EMERGENCY VEHICLES ONLY," a set of DOORS leading into the lobby of an EMERGENCY ROOM; MEDICAL PERSONNEL visible inside, INJURED PEOPLE, etc., a few PEOPLE mill outside the doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE AMBULANCE SCREECHES to a stop, the back doors fly open, the PARAMEDICS wheel out the dying man and rush into the entrance, automatic doors OPEN and CLOSE for them. Schuyler and Christine climb out, disoriented, walking more slowly to the doors. The AMBULANCE pulls away behind them. Schuyler nearly slips in a mysterious dark PUDDLE.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, this day keeps getting better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is your problem, you think the whole fucking world revolves around you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
As she says this, she walks right into the ELECTRIC DOORS, which fail to open for them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV-- THROUGH THE DOORS the gathered STAFF and PATIENTS all turn at once to regard Christine and Schuyler. They GRIN and WINK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SCHUYLER AND CHRISTINE, who barely get the chance to register this before--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LIGHTS GO OUT... PITCH BLACKNESS and SUDDEN SILENCE. We hear only SCHUYLER'S BITTER LAUGHTER. Dialogue OVER DARKNESS:
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a matter of fact...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck is going on?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
We hear RUSTLING in a purse, but still see next to nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a little hard to explain...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the STRIKING OF A MATCH, there's some ORANGE LIGHT-- CHRISTINE holds the match. The whole area is DESERTED, except for the two of them. SCHUYLER kicks at the glass doors-- they're not going to give, nothing is visible beyond them.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I seem to be playing a game. This is supposed to be funny--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--a challenge, a puzzle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, I'm puzzled. Where are we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER has found a STEEL DOOR with a GLOWING RED SIGN: EMERGENCY USE ONLY. He yanks it open and a PAIL swings down, dumping WATER on his head. He's facing a BRICK WALL through the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHRISTINE can't help but LAUGH, then YELPS in pain as the match burns her fingers. LIGHTS another. Schuyler flips open his phone.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it, no signal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's a lightswitch--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
She flips it on, A BLINDING STROBE FLASHES for a few seconds-- both CRY OUT-- then the BULB EXPLODES in a shower of sparks.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know the rules, if there are any, but it seems the obvious move usually backfires...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. I have no idea what you're talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
They've taken a few steps forward, exploring the DARK. She LIGHTS a cigarette with the next match, nearly running into ANOTHER DOOR. She RATTLES it-- locked.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son of a bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I have a key.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler pulls out his keyring and tries the gold CRS key-- nope.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat, thoughtful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wrong key...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last match.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
In the matchlight, we see Schuyler fumbling in his pockets, pulling out the ROSY SUNGLASSES from the Rasta. He puts them on.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bright for you, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER'S POV as the last MATCH GOES OUT-- CHRISTINE GLOWS RED in the matchlight for a moment, then as soon as it goes out, we see a GLOW of FLUORESCENT PAINT on the ground... a series of STRIPES and ARROWS in DIFFERENT COLORS, GLOWING. These start PARALLEL near where he stands, then RADIATE in different directions. CHRISTINE is but a SILHOUETTE against the COLORED LINES.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can see now. Grab my arm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way! You're crazy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
CHRISTINE moves away from him.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay on the path!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
A BURST OF FLAME erupts from the GROUND close enough to scare the shit out of CHRISTINE, who SCREAMS. SCHUYLER hurries toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FLAMES VANISH, she lurches in a differrent direction--
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christine, don't move!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave me alone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She LOSES HER FOOTING on a slippery surface, falls, sliding down a gentle SLOPE.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER follows. FALLING himself. They try to reach toward each other for purchase, but it's no good, the slope is getting steeper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
58A. In a moment SCHUYLER tumbles on top of Christine in a four- foot deep round CHILDREN'S POOL, but it isn't full of water. There's a bit of BLACK LIGHT here, enough to make out--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--COCKROACHES, thousands of them, a TEEMING ROIL OF INSECTS in a CHURNING LIQUID. There's a BUZZING NOISE, both SCREAM.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaggh! BUGS!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER quickly helps lift Christine out. She starts to pull him upward, but--
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are the glasses?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck the glasses!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't get out of here without them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He steels himself and rummages amidst the bugs, about to get sick, finally coming up with the glasses. He shakes them free of INSECTS and clambers out to join Christine, who's GASPING and brushing the bugs off of her. SCHUYLER puts on the glasses and holds up a BUG.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're rubber. Hold onto me, I'll get us out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine, stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs his arm; both are now covered in MUCK from the bug soup.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your favorite color?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Blue?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes off the glasses, puts them on her. She looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV-- the RAINBOW of COLORED LINES on the FLOOR...
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow... OK, this is kinda cool. Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER slips the glasses off her, puts them back on.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, it's my game. But we'll take blue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV-- a BLUE LINE moves in a snaking path ahead of them, going in circles now and then, INTERSECTING or moving PARALLEL to other colors, up a series of ramps. This space sometimes resembles a PARKING GARAGE, scmetimes a SEWER or a STEAM TUNNEL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHRISTINE keeps a hand on Schuyler as he follows the path.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talk about the blind leading the blind... what's your name anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sky Van Orton.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sky? Were your folks hippies or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Far from it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Christine Kaminsky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice to meet you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
LATER, CHRISTINE almost hugs Schuyler now, as they move in a seemingly random pattern in the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a company called Consumer Recreation Services, CRS. I never know what's gonna happen next.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, who does.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until recently, I had a pretty good idea... Duck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
The BLUE LINE has led them into a NARROW TUNNEL, soon they're crawling on hands and knees.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So are you like a serious masochist, or just really, really bored?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, you shouldn't have been dragged into this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... I have to tell you something. Some guy came into Leo's yesterday, showed me your picture, offered me 250 bucks to spill that food on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Said it was a practical joke. I figured what the hell, I can use the money-- I got him up to 500. I hated that fucking job anyway--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, so the heart attack, you knew that was a joke too--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! It scared the shit out of me--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that CPR routine--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to be a lifeguard.

<SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're getting somewhere...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
The TUNNEL has opened up again. There's even a tiny bit of VISIBLE LIGHT now. He takes off the glasses, gives them to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV-- the COLORED LINES are all joining up from different directions. A few steps onward they all converge at a point, like the spokes of a wheel, at a WHITE SPOT on the ground...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER AND CHRISTINE look around, then Schuyler points upward--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WHITE RING overhead... it looks like the underside of a MANHOLE COVER, with an illuminated CIRCLE OF LIGHT around the rim, a halo.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do we get up there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER steps on the circle of WHITE-- it's a BUTTON. A ROPE LADDER drops down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WALKWAY - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MANHOLE COVER slides aside, SCHUYLER climbs out and helps Christine up. It's a short, covered WOODEN WALKWAY in an alley.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that was pointless... but different... kind of fun...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm, a different kind of fun. What's your middle name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Louise... why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER points to some GRAFFITI-- a HEART with "SVO + CLK."
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're supposed to be here... they picked you for a reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But-- why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
They start to move shakily down the CONSTRUCTION WALKWAY, both bedraggled, covered in goo. HANDBILLS cover one wall.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably knew you'd play Good Samaritan for that guy, drag me along-- but they could have hired an actor for that, less of a risk...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE WALL, a series of HANDBILLS say, "AREN'T YOU FORGETTING SOMETHING?" SCHUYLER puzzles over these as they move, gets to one last one-- "BEHIND YOU, STUPID."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER looks back toward the end of the alley--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A YELLOW DUMPSTER with the logo, "CONSOLIDATED REFUSE SUPPLY" and the smaller image of a KEY. SCHUYLER moves quickly to it, throws open the lid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE IN DUMPSTER-- a MOUNTAIN of SHREDDED PAPER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER rolls his eyes, sorting through it. Christine approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is really sick. I think they're trying to fix us up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you can't play alone--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who says I want to play?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a sigh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, what the fuck are you doing in the dumpster.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's something in here I need.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs inside, dives in... and pops up again in a moment with--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-- A Z-SHAPED WINDOW CRANK. Sure enough, there's a KEY embossed on the side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER climbs out again, brandishing the small crank.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I imagine I'll find out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRS BUILDING - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER pockets the crank as he and CHRISTINE emerge from the alley. PEDESTRIANS give them a wide berth. To a PASSERBY:
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you looking at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler heads straight for the CRS doors, the large numbers 636 printed above-- it's LOCKED. He tries his little GOLD KEY on a deadbolt, it's USELESS of course.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is their offices. We must have been in their garage... my office is just a few blocks from here, we can get cleaned up there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He walks a few steps on, she stands still for a moment, then nods agreeably and follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHUYLER'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
START ON THE SKYLINE-- SCHUYLER moves from the window, as we hear a DOOR OPEN. CHRISTINE emerges from the attached dressing area and bath, toweling damp hair, in an oversized Harvard sweatshirt and gym shorts, with a large plastic bag containing her filthy clothes. She looks good, clearly she put some effort into her make-up.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your turn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(moving past her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Find everything you need?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're outta conditioner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My apologies, I'll have it taken care of. Help yourself to the fridge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He points to a MINI-FRIDGE, shuts the door, a moment later we hear WATER RUNNING. She looks around the office, letting down her facade. She seems quite impressed, and intimidated, by the place. She looks back toward the bathroom door-- maybe this guy isn't so bad after all. From this point, she takes a more seductive tack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DRESSING AREA/BATH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER, Schuyler has cleaned up, is finishing dressing, pulling a pair of jeans over boxer shorts, tucking in a sport shirt. Christine talks through the closed door.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(O. S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So um... how rich are you anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rich enough. Bit forward, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(O. S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what exactly do you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Manage investments, some venture capital, I'm on the board of a number of publicly traded companies...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(O. S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you just like, move money around?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHUYLER'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler emerges, shoes in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Basically. Beats working, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Christine sits on his desk, with her bag slung over her shoulder, eating an APPLE. She slides off the desk, flirting rather bluntly.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't look so bad, without the tie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I hope you haven't been too put out... I could probably get you another job, I have a stake in a couple of restaurants--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not much of a waitress, really. Y'know, today's been kind of--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you type?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kind of a turn-on, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(getting no response)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean-- just, the danger... Like fucking in a graveyard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm. So where do you live?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Christine realizes her come-on is falling flat, she pulls back, tossing her unfinished apple in the trash.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out in Concord, with my folks, unfortunately. They're never gonna believe that I've been hanging out with a guy like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing, just-- most of the guys I see have tats, y'know?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off his confused look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tattoos...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. We'd better head downstairs, the limo's waiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Christine nods disappointedly as Schuyler moves to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIMO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler and Christine ride in silence in the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mind if I smoke in here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(leaning forward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up here on the left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
As the limo pulls over, he and Christine turn to each other. It's a somewhat awkward moment.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's our next move? I mean, in the game. Obviously we need to figure out what that crank thing is for--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not playing anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(disappointed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a life. Jack'll take you home, or wherever you want to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, maybe I'll get in a little ballroom dancing before bed--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
The limo has stopped now. Schuyler has started to open the door.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, what about your clothes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon it's a brand new sweatshirt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
So saying, she pulls it off. She's wearing a black bra... a ROSE is tattooed on her shoulder. Schuyler can't help but react. She thrusts the shirt at him, he's half out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's not-- just-- back from the cleaners.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(throatily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You dry clean your sweatshirts...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
He nods slightly... as he reaches to take it--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--CHRISTINE leans forward, cups the back of his head and gives him a LONG, HARD KISS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK THE DRIVER, middle-aged and trustworthy, turns and catches a glimpse of this, quickly turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHRISTINE breaks the kiss, sinks back against the red leather seat, waiting for Schuyler to make the next move.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See ya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler nods again, torn. She's looking at him expectantly. He's clearly aroused, but this is such an inappropriate female. Sadly, he waves a hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LEO'S - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler shuts the door, sweatshirt in hand, the dome light slowly DIMS OUT out on the crestfallen Christine-- we see her mouth a CURSE. Schuyler moves toward his MBZ, the limo IDLING. He's about to get inside when he sees a TICKET IN AN ENVELOPE under the windshield wiper. He SNORTS-- insult to injury-- tosses it on the dash as he climbs in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHUYLER'S MBZ - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits behind the wheel, watching the lights of the limo disappear. He sniffs the sweatshirt a moment, then STARTS at the sound of a MOTOR STARTING across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE THROUGH SIDE WINDOW-- an MBZ the same year, model and color as Schuyler's-- pulls away from the curb, Schuyler gets a glimpse of something REFLECTING STREET LIGHT in the window of the car-- a gun? A camera with a long lens? The car makes a quick U-turn and drives in the same direction as the limo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER, curious, STARTS THE ENGINE as if to pursue. Then he glimpses the envelope on the dash out of the corner of his eye. He doesn't put the car in gear, picks up the envelope instead...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON ENVELOPE-- The words "OPEN ME" are printed in BLOCK LETTERS on the outside. He opens it quickly-- there's no ticket inside, but he shakes out a RAINBOW-COLORED CONDOM in a clear wrapper and a NOTE in KIDNAPPER LETTERS: "BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER frowns at this and throws the note aside. He flips on the WINDSHIELD WIPERS (it's started to DRIZZLE) and pulls out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV THROUGH WINDESIELD-- A DARK FIGURE runs from the curb by Leo's, right in front of the car, SCHUYLER SLAMS on the BRAKES--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--It's DAVID. He hurries around to the passenger door and jumps in, looking haggard, scared, a man on the run.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drive. Anywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, David, you scared the shit out of me--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry Sky, just drive, please--
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER pulls forward.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where were you today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I almost didn't make it at all. I been in the bar for hours, waiting for you to come back to your car-- Jesus, I can't believe I did this to you, I'm so sorry--
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Slow down, take a breath-- what are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The game! It just doesn't stop! I thought I'd finished playing a long time ago, I paid the bill, then it started all over again, they won't leave me alone--
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(slowly, evenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Calm down. What are they doing to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything. It just doesn't stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. That's crazy. Yes, it's a pain in the ass, but why would they keep playing once you paid them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know! I paid them MORE to make it stop, God help me I even gave you to them... but they won't leave me alone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
He sees the crumpled note on the floor, picks it up--
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was on my windshield--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit, oh SHIT they must be following us--
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
He cranks his neck around, looking for pursuers. Schuyler looks at him for a beat-- BANG! He almost loses control of the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TIRE HAS BLOWN. Schuyler drives ON THE RIM, struggles to get over to the curb, BRAKES hard and stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHUYLER'S MBZ - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David's losing it, looking around.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're shooting at us!

</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David, get a grip, it's just a flat tire!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up the phone, punches buttons, gets nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it, the phone's not working--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine, I'll change the fucking thing myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just hurry-- I'll pop the trunk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David reaches for the glovebox.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you can't do it from--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON GLOVEBOX-- it POPS OPEN and KEYS SPILL OUT. There are at least fifty of them jammed in there, all kinds, silver and gold... and all have CRS stamped on them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER leans closer, intrigued. David's eyes go wide as he fingers a few of these keys.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck are those--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(whirling on him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like you don't know. Sonofabitch, they got to you first, didn't they?

<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, David-- hello?

EXT. GOLDEN GATE PARK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David gets out of the car in a hurry, amidst the greenery in the park. RAINING HARDER now.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's more than that isn't it? You're part of it, you're one of them! Of course, it makes perfect sense!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They planted those keys! I don't know what the hell they're for--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler tries hard to be rational, but David is over the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're behind the whole thing aren't you? You and your sick fucking friends set it up--
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?! What friends? Get a grip, David-- why would I do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, out of boredom, to get back at me--

</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For being a weirdo, for trying to be happy? Well, congratulations, you win. Now make it stop!

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't! Listen to me--

</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David SLUGS HIM in the face, Schuyler staggers back, clutches his BLEEDING nose. David runs, full tilt, into the woods near the Japanese Tea Garden.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER pursues amidst the trees and vegetation, running out of breath, calling after David, who's vanished. He leans against a tree, PANTING, dabbing at his bleeding nose with a SCRAP OF TISSUE from his pocket. He hears a PHONE RINGING, moves toward it, emerging through bushes near the ACADEMY OF SCIENCE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses at the RINGING PAYPHONE. He decides not to pick it up, looking around at the deserted MUSEUM BUILDINGS and hurrying toward civilization. He passes other PAYPHONES en route to the park exit... each one STARTS RINGING as he approaches it. He moves faster, freaked. At the edge of the park, he snatches one up--

	If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and dial again-- if you need help--

<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER slams the phone down. He dabs his nose one more time, tosses the paper scrap into the trash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON SCRAP-- "CRS" with the emergency NUMBER, the blue ink has BLED with the rain and Schuyler's BLOOD...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
76(NEW). EXT. FULTON STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV THROUGH CAR WINDSHIELD, as Schuyler emerges from the park. The car suddenly MOVES FORWARD--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH SCHUYLER. He walks to the curb, distractedly raises a hand for a cab, which pulls up instantly. He climbs in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An aged, battered CAB; PLEXIGLAS between the CABBIE and the back.
</DIRECTION>

The cab roars down the street, KICKING UP WATER from the gutters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler bites his cuticle, not watching where they're going; the windows are wet and fogged. Then he looks out, narrows his eyes and RAPS on the PLEXIGLAS PARTITION.

The cabbie turns IN PROFILE for a moment. He appears to be wearing a HEARING AID, a round piece of plastic, a tiny WIRE disappearing into his shirt. And there's something familiar about his face. Schuyler glances at the driver ID on the back of the seat--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON PHOTO, the man is the RASTA from the airport, with a new hairdo. The COMPANY NAME-- "CONSOLIDATED REGENCY SEDANS." CRS.
</DIRECTION>

SCHUYLER rubs his head, very angry.

FILLING WITH WATER from the car's floor, from overhead. EERIE LIGHT from the front of the cab. Schuyler tries to roll down the window, the handle SPINS, nothing happens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cab GOES UNDER with a BURBLE of BUBBLES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler CRANKS the other window handle desperately, now up to his waist in water, water GUSHING IN now. INCREASING BLACKNESS through the windows as he sinks. The handle falls off in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
88. UNDERWATER SHOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sinking cab, HEADLIGHTS and INTERIOR LIGHTS STILL ON, Schuyler inside KICKING at the windows and the Plexi, without any success.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler stops his frantic kicking, tries to think coolly. He's up to his neck by now. Angry at himself for not realizing it sooner, he pulls what he needs out of his pocket-- the HANDCRANK he found in the dumpster. He takes a deep breath and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUBMERGES. UNDERWATER he inserts the crank into the window handle hole... a perfect fit. He CRANKS FAST, WATER FLOODS IN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: U N D E R W A T E R S H O T - N I G H T
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler SLITHERS OUT the open window. Cheeks puffed out, he kicks frantically for the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He BURSTS to the surface, SPLUTTERING, catching his BREATH. A FLASHLIGHT BEAM catches him.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister-- are you all right?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler, treading water, turns around--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CABIN CRUISER at the dock nearby. A very beautiful GIRL in a yellow rain slicker, holding a powerful FLASHLIGHT leans over the edge, tosses him a life preserver, hauls him toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CABIN CRUISER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER clambers onto the rear ladder with the girl's help, teeth CHATERING. HOLD ON the boat's colorfully painted name on the stern: "POSEIDON'S CURSE," and in small letters, "COSTA REY SOL."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER boards the large, ritzy craft.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you... I'm very grateful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shouldn't swim in the Bay, you could get hepatitis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler nods, looking around, recovering from the shock.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to get in touch with the police.

<GIRL>

</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOAT CABIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler's wet clothes hang from a hook, he's in a towel, starting to pull on a fresh set of casual clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you need any help?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
His back is turned as the girl climbs down, opens her raincoat-- only a STRING BIKINI beneath. She could be a Playboy centerfold.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, no. I'm fine. These fit...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(buttoning his pants)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...perfectly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He turns slowly, just as the girl reaches behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure I can't do something for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She WINKS as she lets her top drop. Schuyler smiles strangely. She takes this for lust, approaches him with open arms. He GRABS her by the hair. Menacingly:
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am finished playing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OW! Let go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She pounds at him, tries to kick. He wrestles her to the floor, kneels on top of her. He seems about to hit her.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This has got to fucking STOP!

</SCHUYLER>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just got hired to show you a good time! C'mon please get off me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler gets his rage under control, horrified at himself. He climbs off her, she scrambles away, afraid, covering herself.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not into this kinda shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who hired you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, the service set it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The service?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y'know, Fantasy Girls. They said you had this wild fantasy, I should just wait in the boat...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler realizes he's not going to get anything more out of her, pulls on a shirt, grabs his wet clothes and leaves the cabin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHARF - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler leaps off onto the wharf. The girl, pulling the raincoat on, leans over the deck.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doncha want your thing? I'm supposed to give you this, this key thingie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler pauses, turns slowly, approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A key.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
THE GIRL nods quickly, reaches over the railing to hand him a SMALL WOODEN COFFIN with a BLACK BOW and a RED KEY BURNED into the lid.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They said you'd figure out what to do with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER takes it from her gingerly, undoes the bow, opens the lid:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE IN COFFIN-- an ornate HATCHET with a KEY DESIGN on the blade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER REMOVES it from its QUILTED resting place. THE GIRL backs away, nervous to see SCHUYLER with a weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm supposed to carry a fucking hatchet around...? Relax. I don't want it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He drops the AXE and the COFFIN into the water with a SPLASH--

THEY GO UNDER and DISAPPEAR...

Early morning, the RAIN has stopped-- a RAINBOW arcs behind the office building. TWO COP CARS, marked and unmarked, pull up at the curb, lights FLASHING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRS LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler, in the clothes from the boat, and Plympton, his lawyer, are joined at the elevators by two plainclothes detectives-- BARNETT and GALLO-- and two UNIFORMS.
</DIRECTION>
<PLYMPTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for your promptness, officers. I'm Robert Plympton, Mr. Van Orton's attorney--

<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go. Seventh floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRS OFFICES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler enters, followed by the others. He stops short, reacts. WIDE SHOT reveals-- the same offices, now entirely empty. The partitions, the desks, everything has been removed. A small amount of TRASH is scattered on the floor-- the move was evidently hasty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER. UNIFORM #1 SPEAKS into his walkie-talkie, COP TALK; #2 pokes around in a box full of SHREDDED PAPER; Plympton CONFERS with Barnett, nods, then both of them cross to Schuyler, who sits on the carpet, back to an empty wall. Barnett checks his notes.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Management company for the building said this floor hasn't been rented. We checked with the Secretary of State and the county recorder, there's no listing of a "consumer research service."
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNETT>
<PLYMPTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Recreation service.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLYMPTON>
<BARNETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. No sign of the boat or the girl. Divers got the cab's vehicle ID, the company junked it a month ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNETT>
<DIRECTION>
Gallo, who'd been talking on a phone IN BG, approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<GALLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The numbers you gave us are disconnected, sir, this was the only address the phone company had. And we found your car-- it's in impound.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALLO>
<BARNETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a little confused as to motive here. You said your brother sent you to these people...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNETT>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not his fault, he's unstable, he didn't know what he was doing--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<BARNETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And they were supposed to show you a, a good time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNETT>
<GALLO>

(a cautioning look at Barnett)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My guess is this Feingold guy's using an alias... is there anything else you can tell us about him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALLO>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler spots an empty CHINESE FOOD CARTON crumpled in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER as SCHUYLER picks up and fingers the container-- Chinese characters on it, the name TUNG HOY.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He likes Chinese food...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<BARNETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, Mr. Van Orton, we'll get these jokers.

SCHUYLER nods, unconvinced.

PLYMPTON pulls up in his LEXUS, SCHUYLER gets out wearily.

	<DIALOGUE>
	There's clearly a civil case once we locate the defendant...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLYMPTON>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<PLYMPTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y'know, Sky, things are quiet since the closing-- you could take some time off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLYMPTON>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER sighs and nods, closes the car door and waves good-bye. He climbs the steps to his front door and Plympton pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHUYLER'S FOYER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER enters and automatically reaches for a LIGHTSWITCH--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLUE SPARKS leap to his fingers, the switch has been RIPPED OUT, leaving exposed WIRING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER CURSES and shakes his hand out. He looks around in disbelief-- the walls are covered in GRAFFITI.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"GAME OVER" is the first one we see in the foyer, above the HARLEQUIN, who still sits in the only upright chair... but now a GLOSSY BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO is stuck in its teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER pulls out the picture, looks at it, hand trembling--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A POLICE PHOTO of MR. VAN ORTON, his body sprawled in a pool of blood. It's stamped "PROPERTY SFPD" in red...
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER tosses the picture aside, moves into his living room--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHUYLER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More GRAFFITI everywhere: "FUCK THE POLICE," "SORE LOSER!," "NO FUTURE," "CRS RULES," assorted OBSCENITIES. BOOM, as Schuyler moves through the living room, CONTACT EXPLOSIVES on the floor EXPLODE beneath his feet, making him LEAP and DANCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER THE MANTLEPIECE, A NOTE is stuck into a PAINTING with a KITCHEN-KNIFE. SCHUYLER approaches and rips this down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT NOTE, PAN DOWN SLOWLY, X-CLOSE: "Like my father before me, I kill what I love. Goodbye, cruel world, blah blah blah..." A RED SIGNATURE ARROW is affixed by a DOTTED LINE at the bottom, "PLEASE SIGN HERE."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER GROANS and crumples the note. He reaches for a phone-- he PICKS up the receiver, it's been MELTED into the body of the telephone. He throws it aside. He hears VOICES from the next room, enters cautiously, picking up a SMALL SCULPTURE as a weapon--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHUYLER'S STUDY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TELEVISION is on, playing a silly-looking CARTOON. ACTION HEROS fly through the air, shooting LIGHT from their eyeballs, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER lowers his weapon, moves to shut off the tube. More GRAFITTI over the walls, the books, etc.: stick figure drawings of a MAN HANGING HIMSELF, a BROKEN HEART, a PENIS, a NAKED WOMAN, etc. Across the walls, over the TV, are the words, "YOU ARE NOT ALONE."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER presses the on-off switch-- nothing happens.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't touch that dial, Sky!

ON SCREEN, THE MASKED ACTION HERO stands proudly, hands on hips, before a colorful MOVING BACKGROUND. It speaks in a cheezy HE-MAN VOICE, an ANIMATED MOUTH. There's a CRS LOGO on its chest.

The PHONE has started ringing during the above. Schuyler, breathless, moves around the room now, trying to find it. He finally tracks it down in the bottom of a GARBAGE CAN, covered with disgusting SLIME which he wipes on his shirt.

SCHUYLER crosses the opulent lobby to the desk. A passing BELLHOP gives him a nod and a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<BELLHOP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Mr. Van Orton.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLHOP>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler stares after the bellhop, whom he's clearly never seen before. He proceeds to the check-in desk. Before he can even introduce himself, the DESK CLERK turns to him with a tight smile--

<DESK_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Van Orton. Here's your credit card... and the maid found this under the bed...

Schuyler looks at the man, who stares straight ahead, not believing him for a second. Schuyler shakes his head, looks down at the open briefcase in his lap.

ANGLE IN BRIEFCASE-- a set of HANDCUFFS, assorted BONDAGE GEAR... and a few BLURRY POLAROID PHOTOS, showing a NAKED WOMAN with a LEATHER MASK chained to a bed. ONE SHOT shows her shoulder clearly-- we see a ROSE TATTOO.

SCHUYLER bends down to look in the window.

SCHUYLER'S MBZ cruises past rows of similar-looking, lower-middle- class homes, a pretty shabby neighborhood. He parks the Benz. A WHITE VAN is parked just up the street, a LOOP AND RABBIT EAR on the roof. PAN to show THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR... A cartoonish logo with the CRS MAN holding a wrench by a TV SET in front of a RAINBOW, the words "CABLE REPAIR SPECIALISTS."

<DIRECTION>
AT THE DOOR, an older, working-class man in a T-shirt appears-- Christine's dad, MR. KAMINSKY.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_KAMINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KAMINSKY>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Kaminsky? Schuyler Van Orton--

</SCHUYLER>
<MR_KAMINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that a name? Look, I'm kinda busy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(starts to close the door)
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a daughter named Christine? I'm afraid she might be in danger.

<DIRECTION>
MR. KAMINSKY narrows his eyes at him as we hear--
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(O. S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy? Who is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler, very surprised, peers around Mr. Kaminsky--

<DIRECTION>
INT. CHRISTINE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler does a double-take as CHRISTINE comes down the staircase, wearing a sweatshirt and shorts. She lights up when she sees him, then quickly hides her excitement.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sky? Hi, Sky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
MR. KAMINSKY allows the relieved Schuyler to enter now.
</DIRECTION>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm gonna get back to that carburetor... nice meeting you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<DIRECTION>
Christine's dad WINKS at his daughter as he moves back to the basement. She rolls her eyes, but mouths, "thanks," and then moves to sit beside Schuyler in the modest, over-knick-knacked living room: religious pictures and statues, family photos, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't think I'd-- what are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER is smiling at himself now, shaking his head. Christine reaches across him to FLIP ON a lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last night, when Jack dropped you off-- did anything happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... unfortunately.

</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>

</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>

<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CRS... I saw pictures, girl with a tattoo on her shoulder like yours--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(touches her shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ssh, my folks don't know about that yet. So, what-- they wanted ransom from you or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I thought they were trying to frame me, they planted evidence...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would they do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no idea, nothing they do makes any sense. Forget it, it's just a game.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that's the only reason you came out here to East Hell, your stupid goddamn game.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was worried about you. I wanted to see you again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(thinks for a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you pretend to mean that, I'll pretend to believe it. Well, looks like your pals are trying to keep us together. Buy me dinner at least?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, why not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(rises)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I look like a slob, let me change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She hurries upstairs. Schuyler sighs, wondering what the hell he's doing here. He glances at a VIRGIN MARY statue, squints-- then unscrews the head, it's a decanter. He takes a sniff and puts it back with a bemused expression. He takes another sniff, noticing something else in the air...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WISP OF SMOKE rises from the lamp Christine turned on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER peers beneath the shade. On the table is a framed PHOTOGRAPH of a LITTLE GIRL who could be Christine in a frilly white dress, holding flowers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INSIDE LAMPSHADE-- a new PRICETAG dangles from the shade against the bulb, starting to TURN BROWN, smoking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER licks his fingertips, reaches inside the shade to PULL OFF tag-- in doing so, he burns his fingers on the hot bulb, STIFLES a curse and jerks his hand away. He KNOCKS OVER the picture, which FALLS to the floor. Shaking his hand, he rises distractedly, pokes his head through a swinging door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHRISTINE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DIMLY LIT from outside. Modest, surface clutter, hanging pots, etc. Schuyler moves to a sink, turns on the tap and RUNS WATER over his burned fingertips. He SHUTS OFF the tap, looks around for a towel, shaking his hand-- the paper towel dispenser has no roll on it. He pulls open a kitchen drawer--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE IN DRAWER-- completely empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER, curious now, opens a cabinet, absently drying his hand on his shirt-- also empty. He tries another couple of drawers, finds nothing but scraps of paper, matches. No utensils. He exits, a disturbing thought forming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHRISTINE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER picks up the photo to replace it on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON PHOTO: Schuyler slips the picture from its cardboard mount-- it's an ADVERTISEMENT clipped from a glossy magazine, TEXT printed on the portion previously unseen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER quickly returns the clipping to its mount, puts the photo back on the table as Christine comes downstairs, dressed and made- up for a night on the town.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you get us into Chez Panisse? I always wanted to eat there--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler nods casually toward the photo as she sits beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(quick glance)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm-hmm, First Communion.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(touches his hair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter, you look a little green around the gills--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs her hand away. Icily:
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't touch me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
His tone alarms her-- he stares at her with hatred. A silent BEAT between them, each tries to assess the new situation. She realizes he's onto her. She swallows, makes a quick decision. Suddenly she leans close to him, reaching around him to SHUT OFF the table lamp. She leaves her arms around him and HISSES in his ear-- she drops her lower-class accent, speaks in a clipped, educated voice:
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be stupid. Don't say anything, not here, they're watching.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(sickened; to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God damn it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him, he doesn't open his mouth, neither shuts their eyes. Then she gets up quickly, moves to a corner of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(back in character, accented)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, I know a good place we could go and like, be alone...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She glances up quickly to indicate something on the ceiling--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON CEILING, a large SMOKE DETECTOR with a RED LIGHT, a cable from it-- there's a small LENS in the center... A HIDDEN CAMERA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER looks at this, starting to rise. She moves to a window, out of range of the camera, beckons him over.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a beautiful night, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler comes up beside her, she nods for him to look outside--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV-- THROUGH WINDOW-- the CRS VAN. Christine WHISPERS urgently:
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's four of them in the van, they're armed. Just play along, I'll get us out of here--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER turns to her, his voice is tired.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to surveillance camera)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, that's it, game over--

<RASTA_MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're blown, let's do it--

Christine's furious and terrified, dashes in front of him, LOCKS and THROWS A CHAIN across the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You idiot! Come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to pull him away from the door, he throws off her arm.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, enough already. I've had it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to the window and opens the curtain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH WINDOW-- the Hack/Cabbie, the Rasta/Pilot and a pair of CRS AGENTS (JOHN and PETER from the men's club) hurry toward the house, the older men reach inside their jackets--
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what.

THE WINDOWS BLOW IN, GUNFIRE, Christine TACKLES HIM and pulls him to the ground as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KNICK-KNACKS fly to pieces directly behind where he was standing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHRISTINE AND SCHUYLER keep low as they dash for the kitchen--

Christine pulls him toward a basement door--

<DIRECTION>
INT. CHRISTINE'S GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They dash down steps to the darkened one-car garage, mostly empty with a few random tools. MR. KAMINSKY looks up from a game of SOLITAIRE, a day player confused by the sudden commotion.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, wake up, it's a con game!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
THE GARAGE DOOR OPENS, Christine pulls Schuyler against a wall--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A "PARAMEDIC" charges out of the shadows, pulling a handgun--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN BG MR. KAMINSKY dives for cover with a frightened NOISE--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHRISTINE grabs a WRENCH and CLUBS THE PARAMEDIC, who falls with a CRY, clutching his skull. They hear FOOTSTEPS on the stairs they just came down. Christine hustles the dazed Schuyler out of there.
</DIRECTION>

Christine and Schuyler dash for the Benz, climb in and SCREECH OFF. CRS MEN run for their van to pursue.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MBZ SIDESWIPES a car as Schuyler runs a light, his WINDSHIELD CRACKS, the side of the car's CRUNCHED IN, but he keeps driving. He crosses lanes directly in front of an oncoming TRUCK-- the VAN HITS THE BRAKES to avoid getting squashed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler SKIDS into a narrow alley. THE VAN, having lost a half a block, misses this and continues straight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Christine's looking behind as Schuyler drives.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>

	OK, we lost 'em--

</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She's THROWN FORWARD as Schuyler SLAMS ON THE BRAKES, reaches across her and THROWS OPEN the passenger door, which CREAKS from the collision. He gives her a shove, she clings to the doorframe--
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Listen to me you bastard-- I know what's going on! No one else is gonna tell you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler pulls the door shut, the car starts BACKING AWAY. Christine gets to her feet, looks after him. He reaches the end of the alley and stops-- then SCREECHES FORWARD. She jumps to the edge of the alley, fearing he's trying to run her down. Schuyler HITS THE BRAKES a few feet away. He leans across, calls to her.

INT. SCHUYLER'S CAR - DAWN

Schuyler, bleary-eyed, drains coffee from the thermos and tosses it aside. He glances over at the sleeping Christine, her head tilted toward his shoulder; she looks pretty sexy. He stares at her for a moment, SIGHS and turns away.

EXT. OREGON LAKE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful Northern lake-- dense forests on the mainland, pines and fall foliage. A STORM coming in, ominous CLOUDS. The Benz is parked at the shoreline. MOVE TO FIND Schuyler and Christine, as they paddle a rowboat toward a small island with a surprisingly humble, somewhat decrepit cabin on it. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING.

INT. OREGON CABIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHRISTINE pours a cup of coffee from a metal pot on a wood-burning stove in which a FIRE CRACKLES. This cabin is genuinely rustic and run-down-- hewn wood, fishing rods, cobwebs, rain damage, dust. WATER DRIPS from the ceiling in a few places. LIGHTNING FLASHES in BG through the scene, the STORM has gotten pretty bad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER finishes taking out his contacts, DROPPING them in cups full of water. He slips on his glasses, then looks at a few framed family photos on the coffee table in front of him. Christine, barefoot, brings him a cup of coffee, which he sips gratefully.

<CHRISTINE>

	Never drink it. Makes my tits hurt.

</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler gives her a sidelong glance, looks back at a photo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON PHOTO-- he rubs away the dust from a shot showing Schuyler's father, with young Schuyler, on a boat with fishing equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHRISTINE takes a step and CRIES out, clutching her foot and sitting beside Schuyler. A small FISHHOOK protrudes from her foot,
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold still.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He talks while he carefully removes the hook from her foot.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, this place hasn't been cleaned in a while. My dad built it himself, spent a lot of time here alone.

	Rotten carpenter...

He pulls out the hook, puts it aside; she rubs her foot.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER suddenly starts LAUGHING, wipes tears from his eyes.

	Well... I always told myself I wasn't gonna end up like him. And now here I am, running his corporation, living in his house, hiding in the cabin where he went to hide right before he... I even look like the bastard.

Christine looks at the photo of MR. VAN ORTON, then at Schuyler.

SCHUYLER struggles to absorb the import of this as well as Christine's behavior. She shakes her head with a sigh, rises to refill his coffee cup.

Schuyler HANGS UP, breathing hard, pacing, clutching the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to get out of here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Christine approaches him with a fresh cup of coffee, which he sips. The PHONE CHIRPS again, Schuyler THROWS it violently against the wall, it's silenced. He gulps more coffee, rising again, looking at the smashed phone, sickened by his own loss of control.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that was stupid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Christine watches him closely. He keeps balling his hands into fists as he paces, trying to think out his next play.

	OK, they've gotten to him. OK. Is there anyone I can trust?

</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a step, stumbles, shakes his head to clear it. She rises, picks up his half-empty cup and heads for the kitchen area. His gaze follows this, he realizes he's been drugged.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christine!!

</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not my name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
With a CRY OF RAGE he lunges after her, but CRASHES into the wall, clutching at a hanging ROD, which falls when he does-- he KNOCKS OVER the table of photos as he goes down, PANTING for air like a fish out of water, clutching his stomach, nauseated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV-- SIDEWAYS, LOW ANGLE. SFX, BLOOD POUNDING in his head. Schuyler's eyes FOLLOW the GROOVES of the wet, warped hardwood floor, they lead to-- and almost seem to point to-- Christine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE-- from the counter she picks up a small vial with a bit of powder at the bottom, slips it into her pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER's eyes roll into his head as he struggles against the effects, tries to get to his hands and knees. He gasps:
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
CHRISTINE approaches, stands a few feet away, lights a cigarette,
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We needed you to call your banks. Cellular calls can be intercepted, rerouted, y'know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She crouches by him, flicking ashes a few inches from his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All those calls to Switzerland and Chase Manhattan-- you were talking to our people. See, we were still missing a lotta pieces-- access codes, passwords, stuff even Plyrnpton didn't have-- but now we have I everything. I guess you are pretty fucking stupid-- but thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
He CLAWS at her helplessly with a GROAN, but misses. His glasses fall off, he collapses again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER'S POV-- everything a BLUR NOW, except in EXTREME FG-- the photo of himself and his father, which now lies on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH-CUT TO: FLASHBACK POV-- THE MOMENT OF IMPACT, as MR. VAN ORTON'S FACE SMASHES into the ground, his GLASSES SHATTERING, BLOOD SPRAYING from his head.

SCHUYLER'S POV-- FROM FLOOR-- Christine moves INTO FOCUS, crouches near him, studying her victim almost clinically.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CRYPT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WOODEN LID SPLINTERS as SCHUYLER pounds his way out of a COFFIN. DIM LIGHT through CRACKS in the walls, this is an old and moldering MAUSOLEUM, other COFFINS nearby. FRESH FLOWERS surround his resting place, otherwise everything is completely DECAYED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By the time SCHUYLER gets out of the coffin, his arms are BLOODIED. He's been dressed in an ALL-WHITE BURIAL SUIT. A RED ROSE is TAPED to his chest. He blinks and stares about wildly--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV-- BLURRY, can't make out much.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER blinks, breathing hard, utterly freaked. He notices the ROSE on his chest, tears it off, SNIFFS it, then THROWS IT aside with a frustrated CRY. He stumbles to the heavy door of the crypt, tugs, then realizes it opens the other way-- he gives it a PUSH--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IT COLLAPSES immediately. SCHUYLER tumbles out of the crypt into the HOT SUNLIGHT. He's in a ramshackle city of the dead, a SPANISH GRAVEYARD. There are endless rows of TOMBS, rioting tropical VEGETATION, many FLOWERS, impossibly bright COLORS. It should be quite beautiful and peaceful...
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He walks around tentatively, SQUINTING. AN OLD WOMAN in black sits contemplating a grave, fingering her rosary. SCHUYLER slips a hand absently into his pocket, and finds something there, pulls it out--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER'S POV-- BLURRY shot of a NOTE in SPANISH, with a KEY on the stationery...

SCHUYLER blinks, slips the note in his pocket.

EXT. CENTRAL AMERICAN STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT SHOT on Schuyler blinking, disoriented, JOSTLED by a sea of HISPANIC PEOPLE on this busy street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER'S POV-- WALKING TENUOUSLY. The world's a BLUR, FACES move in and out of FOCUS. They're dark, foreign, many POOR PEOPLE, poverty-scarred features. Scraps of SPANISH. He grabs a DARK MAN.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where am I?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
The man replies with an EXCLAMATION in SPANISH, pushes Schuyler away, CAMERA TUMBLES--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OBJECTIVE SHOT-- Schuyler's on his knees in the middle of this third-world thoroughfare, utterly disoriented. STREET VENDORS sell weird-looking foods, squads of SQLDIERS march with rifles, MUSICIANS PLAY odd instruments... Schuyler clutches his head, as if trying to wish it all away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A COP IN BEIGE UNIFORM suddenly prods at him with a nightstick, YELLING AT HIM in SPANISH to move on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER'S POV-- the COP looming over him, a BLURRY menace, the end of the nightstick SHARP in FG as it POKES at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE-- Schuyler pleads with the man:
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, help me, I'm an American! I'm lost! Please!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
This doesn't seem to help. He tries to get away from the stick, but the cop pursues. He bangs into people as he tries to move quickly, the stick right behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler FALLS over a BEGGAR on the ground, in far worse shape than he is. The cop YELLS at him. Schuyler covers his head, holding out the NOTE WITH THE KEY, which the cop finally snatches away. He studies it for a moment, then BARKS with LAUGHTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER'S POV-- the cop reaches down to him--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OBJECTIVE ANGLE-- Schuyler cringes, expecting a blow, but the cop just pulls him to his feet. He drags him away with him, speaking more gently IN SPANISH, amused. Schuyler nods thankfully.

HIGH ANGLE-- the THRONGS on this crowded street.

The pawn shop owner nods knowingly. There's one other CUSTOMER, a shabbily-dressed but honest-looking HONDURAN MAN, looking through a BIN full of sports equipment. He seems to have been eavesdropping, the pawn shop owner now exchanges a few words with him IN SPANISH, clearly they're coming to some kind of deal. Meanwhile, Schuyler puts on a rhinestone-studded pair of woman's glasses, looks around.

In the back of the truck, Schuyler rides among HUNDREDS OF BAGS of COFFEE BEANS, marked "CAFE, PRODUCTO DE HONDURAS." He wears the silly rhinestone glasses, as well as cheap new clothes-- shorts, a Spanish message T-shirt, sneakers. He munches on a mango, peeks out a hole in the tarp at the passing scenery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV-- a VISTA of spectacular beauty, ideally jungle-encrusted MAYAN RUINS against the backdrop of the rising sun.

All seems quiet, the house dark-- late at night. There's a movement in the bushes near the street-- SCHUYLER emerges, on the lookout for any surveillance. It seems safe. He digs out a hidden KEY from within a FAKE ROCK then goes to the front door, gathers up NEWSPAPERS and a thick stack of MAIL from his box. He flips through it quickly, finds a postcard that interests him and shoves it in his pocket-- the rest of the mail he leaves in the box. He punches in his code on the alarm pad, unlocks the door and enters.

CLOSE ON ALARM PAD-- the light goes from GREEN to RED.

INT. SCHUYLER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER blinks as he enters the house-- the graffiti is gone, the mess cleared up, it actually looks cleaner than ever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK SHOTS, JUMP-CUTS, the rhythm jarring. LIGHTS LOW throughout, Schuyler wants to attract as little attention as possible...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE KITCHEN, SCHUYLER gobbles handfuls of dry cereal, grabs for anything he can find in the refrigerator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE SHOWER, Schuyler scrubs away the grime.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BATHROOM, he inserts a CONTACT LENS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN A DESK DRAWER he finds a few $20.00 bills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BEDROOM-- Schuyler changes into jeans and a sport jacket, tucking the MONEY and the POSTCARD into the pockets. As he turns to leave, he spots something on his dresser--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WHITE ENVELOPE, with a handwritten "TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER frowns at this. tears it open. reacts with fear...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE KITCHEN, SCHUYLER holds the handwritten note to the BLUE FLAME. He tosses the BURNING PAGE into the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOTS on the curling, burning note, we make out KEY WORDS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"MY FATHER WAS RIGHT," "NO REASON TO CONTINUE," "TAKE MY OWN LIFE," "I WANT ONLY DEATH..." and finally the signature, "SCHUYLER VAN ORTON..." This suicide note is no joke.

EXT. VAN ORTON HOUSE - NIGHT

A CAR DOOR CLOSES, we see a UNIFORMED FIGURE MOVE O. S., revealing A POLICE STYLE CREST, the words "CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL SECURITY," the initials "CRS" in the center.

SCHUYLER, sneaking around the side of the house, takes this in, waiting for the RENT-A-COPS with FLASHLIGHTS and WEAPONS to enter his house. Then he hurries away, book under his arm.

UNDER A STREET LAMP on a hilly street, SCHUYLER reaches into his pocket and squints at THE POSTCARD--

David turns to him, half-smiles; food particles on his lips.

Schuyler sits close to David, upset.

	What are you doing here?

</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, I was just eating... I'm much better. Really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David does seem in control now, if a little hazy.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God... Listen, I know you put them onto me-- but I understand, we're both victims of this thing... They've stolen everything we ever had, they're trying to drive us both crazy-- but we won't let them. We'll find a way. There's gotta be a way to beat these bastards! We're in it together...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He clutches his brother's hand. David narrows his eyes, confused.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In what together?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The game.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Schuyler, there is no game. It was just a fantasy of mine, a self- aggrandizing delusion... I can't believe you took that shit seriously.

	Oh, man, stop fucking with me! You know the game doesn't exist... it never did! It never did...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler stares at him for a beat-- no getting through. David leans forward, turns UP THE TV VOLUME, aiming the set at Schuyler.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you see?

INT. SF POLICE STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barnett, the detective from earlier, has come out to the reception area to speak with Schuyler, who's trying very hard to be rational.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So the waitress was in on it--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNETT>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She isn't really a waitress.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<BARNETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--and now you're brother's been institutionalized... is there a history of mental illness in your family?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNETT>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER narrows his eyes at the question. GALLO, beyond a METAL DETECTOR in the rear area of the station, gestures to Barnett, who holds up a finger.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Scuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNETT>
<DIRECTION>
Moving away, Barnett glances at the leatherbound book, which Schuyler clutches very possessively.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatcha reading?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNETT>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Barnett purses his lips, nods, steps around the metal detector to chat with Gallo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH GALLO AND BARNETT
</DIRECTION>
<GALLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just spoke with his lawyer Plympton, he thinks Van Orton's having a nervous breakdown, we should probably hold onto him till his people can get down here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALLO>
<DIRECTION>
WITH SCHUYLER as GALLO AND BARNETT glance in his direction, gesture for him to approach. Gallo WINKS casually at Schuyler.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER, wary now, moves toward them through the METAL DETECTOR-- which GOES OFF with a WHINE. The ALARM MONITOR woman approaches with a wand-- but Schuyler steps back, wide-eyed.
</DIRECTION>
<ALARM_MONITOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably just your keys, sir--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALARM_MONITOR>

SCHUYLER turns and moves quickly for the exit.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yo, Schuyler, wait up--

He's through the door. The WHINE OF THE DETECTOR continues as we--

INT. BART TRAIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIGHTS FLICKER on and off in a moving train car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER scribbles intently in a brand new kid's school notebook, open in his lap. He sits at the end of the moderately crowded train car. Suddenly, he looks up, eyes wild, starts SCANNING the subway car slowly, sensitive to it all. By now he's definitely the sort of person you'd avoid in a public place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT POV with his REACTIONS, as everything falls into place in his increasingly febrile mind...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER'S POV-- SLOW PAN OVER the assortment of nighttime RIDERS-- a couple of TEENAGERS, an OLDER WOMAN with shopping bags, a DRUNK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PAUSES on a patch of GRAFITTI: typically unreadable SCRAWL, but the letters could be CRS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA MOVES to the overhead ADVERTISEMENTS: one for hemrnorhoids, a seasonal bank ad featuring the EASTER BUNNY... PAUSE ON a PHOTO of an ecstatic CALIFORNIA LOTTERY WINNER holding up a wad of cash with the words "YOU CAN'T WIN IF YOU DON'T PLAY."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN READS the SPORTS PAGE: "GAME FINAL 23-2."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE FLOOR, a CANDY BAR WRAPPER with A GOLD KEY printed on it, part of a contest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER picks this up, examines and discards it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER' S POV-- an ELDERLY MAN with a clunky HEARING AID is looking at Schuyler with a blank expression. The man suffers from a facial TWITCH that causes one eye to BLINK rapidly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER narrows his eyes at the man, then looks away pointedly. He puts the notebook into A PLASTIC BAG. Beneath it, cradled in his lap, is the mysterious black book. He opens this carefully--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE, the book is hollow. Inside is an expensive HANDGUN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE SHOT from the next train car-- A FIGURE IN FG is staring through the scratched, fogged window AT SCHUYLER as he puts the leather book into the bag with his notebook...

Schuyler is using the plastic bag and his jacket as a pillow, his eyes closed. Suddenly there's a KNIFE at his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	End of the line, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUNK>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER starts; the PUNK keeps the knife on him. He's a young, glassy-eyed junkie. He wears a RADIO EARPLUG in one ear, a wire heading down to his waist. Schuyler nods, starts studying the man's arms, heavily TATTOOED with crude cabalistic SYMBOLS.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are the tattoos supposed to mean something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<PUNK>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, they mean you're dead, you don't gimme what you got.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, there's the C...

<PUNK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me the fucking bag!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUNK>
<SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(cold, deadly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, you're not going to put me through all this shit and then kill me on a fucking train, it won't look like a suicide...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
As Schuyler speaks he sits up, the PUNK grabs the bag-- Schuyler grabs the guy's knife hand, they wrestle on the floor of the car, clawing at each other. The punk drops the knife, it gets knocked beneath the seat, both men reach for it...
</DIRECTION>
<TRANSIT_COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freeze assholes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANSIT_COP>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler and the punk look up to see a TRANSIT COP pointing his WEAPON. The punk throws his hands up, scrambles to his feet--
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Psycho pulled a knife on me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUNK>
<DIRECTION>
The cop has grabbed the still prone Schuyler, flipping him over and slapping a handcuff on him--
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think you're doing, this guy attacked me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
The cop has dropped his guard; the punk spins and bolts into the next car, squeezing through the door. The TRANSIT COP hastily cuffs Schuyler to an armrest--
</DIRECTION>
<TRANSIT_COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait here--
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANSIT_COP>
<DIRECTION>
He dashes into the next car after the punk. Schuyler looks at the floor of the car, sees--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SMALL RADIO and its EARPLUG attached by a WIRE. The radio has a tiny LOOP/RABBIT EAR antenna on it. He snatches it up, then YANKS at the cuff. He spots the knife under the seat, grabs it, starts using the blade to unscrew the armrest from its post.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM THE NEXT CAR he hears SHOUTS, SCREAMS, a serious commotion going on, he doesn't know who's winning. Schuyler's almost gotten free as the TRAIN SLOWS, when--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--the DOOR at the far end of the car opens, it's the PUNK, bruised and bloody, ready to kill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lunges at Schuyler just as he PRIES THE ARMREST off the seat and CLOBBERS him with it. The punk reels back. The train has stopped, the doors have opened-- Schuyler grabs his bag and squeezes out onto the platform just before they shut again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BART STATION - DAY

SCHUYLER locks the free cuff on to the same wrist as the other, sliding his jacket over them, moving briskly up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BERKELEY STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER emerges and walks quickly, checking over his shoulder, BLINKING IN THE BRIGHT MORNING SUN. He fiddles with the RADIO, the PLUG to his ear. We hear STATIC, BLEEPING NOISES, FILTERED VOICES. For a few moments the VOICES ON THE RADIO become CLEARER.
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO_VOICE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--can't let him get away with this, he's outta control! The next thing you know, he'll push the wrong button and we'll all be dead--
	</DIALOGUE>
</RADIO_VOICE_1>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER listens intently, leaning against a wall in the shadows, breathing hard. He stares nervously at a couple of nearby STREET PEOPLE huddled by a shopping cart, they stare back. Another VOICE on the radio talks OVER the first:
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO_VOICE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--Whoah whoah whoah-- OK the guy's a moron, sure, but he doesn't have the balls to end the world! Anyway I'm sicka talking politics, let's get back to the business of nipple piercing-- you got a ring, don't ya Robin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RADIO_VOICE_2>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the HYSTERICAL GIGGLING of ROBIN QUIVERS. SCHUYLER blinks, recognizing the voice of RADIO DJ HOWARD STERN.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ugh, we gotta do commercials, this is the Howard Stern show...

SCHUYLER fiddles frantically with the dial and antennas, calling up RANDOM RADIO MUSIC, COMMERCIALS, etc.

CLOSE ON A TRASH CAN-- Schuyler tosses his hollowed leather book into it. It falls open, we see the gun is gone.

TRACK DOWN an institutional corridor, a few EMACIATED PATIENTS in wheelchairs... they only come here to die. ELIZABETH, Schuyler's ex, 4Oish, fit and attractive, a few months pregnant, READS to a couple of sad PATIENTS in a lounge area. She trails off as she looks up, astonished to see--

INT. BREAKFAST PLACE - DAY

ELIZABETH FLIPS THE PAGES of Schuyler's notebook-- page after page of psychotic-looking scribbling, dense UNDERLINES, many EXCLAMATION POINTS. ON ONE PAGE-- "CRUEL RANDOM SHIT."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER-- a few BUSINESS PEOPLE read papers, pick at eggs; A LARGE- SCREEN TV plays MORNING PROGRAMS. Schuyler stares at Elizabeth, awaiting reaction... she seems incapable of speech. He puts the tiny radio and earplug on the table between them.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is one of their devices, I pulled it off their assassin in the subway. It's how they communicate with each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>

Elizabeth picks the thing up, studies it, puts the plug to her ear.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's... a radio...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler waves dismissively, "you don't understand," takes the radio back from her and pockets it.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't find the right channel... Listen, I may not make it through this-- if anything happens, get that notebook to, to, the press, or the FBI or something. Someone you can trust, I don't know, assuming you can trust anyone. I just want you to know I'm not crazy, and I didn't kill myself, no matter what they say--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at him, trying to be strong, but she's very freaked out. A BARMAID brings their order. Schuyler stares at the barmaid suspiciously as she puts a cup of coffee before Elizabeth, and gives him a bottle of water and a glass. He tests the seal.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has this been opened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<BARMAID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No sir. Just like you said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARMAID>

He watches her as she retreats, leans toward Elizabeth, puts his hand on top of her cup.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think coffee is safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>

Schuyler opens the bottle and drinks straight from it thirstily. Elizabeth registers the CLINKING HANDCUFFS on his left wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Schuyler, try and listen to me. I love you, I always have, I always will. And maybe this is... good. Maybe this a point you had to reach, before--

	<DIALOGUE>
	Before what?

</SCHUYLER>
<ELIZABETH>

</ELIZABETH>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Crisis people. Crisis people?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
A CELL-PHONE RINGS in her purse, she makes an exasperated noise and pulls it out, with a "one sec" gesture at Schuyler. He rises during her conversation, a new look on his face-- he can't trust her either.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Hi, hon, I'm OK... um, could I call you back...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler's distracted by something on the TV... he lets out a STRANGLED CRY. Elizabeth turns her head to see.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TV SCREEN-- It's JIM FEINGOLD, clutching his head, rubbing his temples with a look of pain. CHEESY MUSIC, THROBBING SPFX.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER approaches the set, shouting at it.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bastard! You fucking bastard! How did you find me here!?

Elizabeth gets up, tries to pull him back to the booth, he pushes her away, not taking his eyes from the set. PATRONS react nervously to the deranged man.

FEINGOLD gives way to the image of A BOX OF AMBUTOL.

SCHUYLER lets Elizabeth escort him back near the booth. He's completely absorbed in his own thoughts.

He shakes his head, waves his hand dismissively. He's thinking about something else. Elizabeth starts dialing.

<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Schuyler, I'm calling a friend right now, I want you to wait here with me until--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>

Schuyler tries to sound normal, claps her on the arm. WHILE HE TALKS, CAMERA FINDS Schuyler's other hand, which slips stealthily into her PURSE, lying on the seat of the booth.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elizabeth, please... I'm sorry, I'II be alright, it's just been a hard day... Listen, I gotta use the restroom, be right back--

EXT. RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Schuyler emerges from a back exit, looking behind him, the EMERGENCY ALARM SOUNDING. He twirls Elizabeth's car keys on his finger as he jogs toward her sports car. He unlocks it and the ALARM SCREAMS for a moment before he figures out how to shut it off, then he starts it and PEELS OUT. CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNG HOY - DAY

A cramped, funky restaurant, rows of CELEBRITY HEAD SHOTS on a wall behind the delivery counter. SCHUYLER pursues the CHINESE WOMAN as she serves bowls of noodles to a CHINESE FAMILY.

	He's an actor, does TV commercials, I know he's ordered from you, he had food delivered to an office building on Mission--

</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler stalks away from her, finds himself facing the wall of signed photographs--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON WALL, old and stained pictures, the most famous being the likes of ED McMAHON and CHARO. Among them is a newer HEAD SHOT of FEINGOLD with a shit-eating grin... below, the name WILLIAM FISHER.
</DIRECTION>

SCHUYLER leaps on the counter and tears the photo off the wall--
</DIRECTION>
<CHINESE_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop that, what you doing?!

Schuyler's already leapt off the counter, bolts out the door.

INT. ELIZABETH'S CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER is on the CARPHONE, glances from the road to--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OBVERSE OF THE HEAD SHOT in his hand, a PHONE NUMBER before the (short) list of credits, he flips it to show Feingold/Fisher.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(on phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Mrs. Fisher, I know it's short notice but we were hoping your husband could come in for an audition today, he's perfect...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER looks annoyed at what he's hearing.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't there any way we can get in touch with him now...? I see...

</SCHUYLER>

He makes a quick U-TURN, the tires SCREECHING.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ZOO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Late afternoon. PAN FROM THE ENTRANCE to find SCHUYLER buying a ticket and hurrying in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE ZOO, Schuyler prowls the crowd with manic energy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER'S POV-- ZOO-GOERS gazing at the ANIMALS... CAMERA FINDS Feingold/Fisher, wearing casual clothes, eating a popsicle. He's doing his best to supervise THREE OBNOXIOUS CHILDREN, two boys and an older girl. He's just another dad at the zoo, far from impressive-- the Wizard of Oz after the curtain's been pulled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he makes eye contact with Schuyler, he pales, trying to herd the children together as Schuyler moves in on him... he can't get away. Schuyler grabs the man's shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bill Fisher, hi! I really admire your work...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh please... I got my kids here...

</FEINGOLD>

Schuyler releases him, Feingold sheepishly avoids his eyes. Schuyler casually shows him the gun, the man's eyes widen.

	Hey, everyone-- here's a twenty! Snack time!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<DIRECTION>
He dangles the bill over their heads, the KIDS CHEER, leap like dolphins after fish. The girl's tallest, grabs the cash, they run for a nearby concession. Schuyler and Feingold stroll together.
</DIRECTION>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, buddy, it was just a job-- nothing personal, y'know? I play my part, improvise a little, that's what I'm good at, I still do a little stand-up--

	I've seen your resume. I'm sick of foot soldiers, I've gotta get to whoever's in charge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of CRS? Christ, nobody knows, nobody gets the big picture--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<DIRECTION>
FEINGOLD'S BOYS ARE THROWING ROCKS at the monkeys. They give their father a look and saunter along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER's not interested in the zoo drama.
</DIRECTION>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddammit, why do they do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do I find them!? Their offices were abandoned--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They own the whole building, they just move from floor to floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler takes this in for a moment, thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK... They know you, you've worked for them. You're going to get me inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<FEINGOLD>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-uh, I'm sorry and all, but--
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell them anything, tell them the cops are after you, you've gotta talk to someone or you'll blow the whistle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way, it's too dangerous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler cocks his head, steps in front of him. Right in his face:
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't seem to understand. Right here, right now-- I'm the danger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Feingold gets the message.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRS BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIGHTS OFF in the building. A battered STATION WAGON rounds a corner, PAUSES before the ramp to the garage entrance-- the same garage he and Christine were once tormented in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STATION WAGON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FEINGOLD drives, looking very tense; a kiddie seat strapped next to him, junk galore; he's apparently alone.
</DIRECTION>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're here, Sky. They said they're on the twelfth floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND THE SEAT-- Schuyler crouches under a blanket.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drive in, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look-- what are you gonna do? Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really-- I don't know. Improvise. Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRS GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The station wagon stops at the bottom of the ramp. A BEEFY GATE GUARD behind glass glares at Feingold, who waves timidly. The STEEL GATE RISES and the station wagon drives in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE STATION WAGON parks near an elevator bank; a handful of CARS, a few white CRS SECURITY VEHICLES and VANS parked nearby. Feingold climbs out, trying hard not to look scared. ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and a beefy, frightening-looking SECURITY MAN in a suit steps out. He looks around carefully as Feingold joins him. He takes Feingold's arm and pulls him toward the elevator. They wait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER'S POV from the back seat-- just as the DOORS OPEN, the Gate Guard steps up behind Feingold, puts a gun in his back.
</DIRECTION>
<GATE_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not authorized to be here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GATE_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
HE FIRES-- Schuyler glimpses a SPRAY OF BLOOD, Feingold collapses. The Security Man grabs the body as it falls, starts dragging it out of sight while the Gate Guard puts a hand to his ear, talks into a mini-transmitter in his other hand. He follows the Security Man out of sight. The elevator doors remain open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the guards out of sight, Schuyler rises slowly. He looks stunned and sickened as he lets himself out cautiously, sneaking behind vehicles. The main gate is sealed, he has no idea how long the guards will be gone. THE OPEN ELEVATOR DOORS beckon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler crawls on his belly the last few yards, starts, finding--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE, a RUBBER BUG on its back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER creeps military style, on hands and knees, the rest of the way to the elevator. He puts a hand in some of Feingold's BLOOD, winces, then gets in the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRS ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER presses the button for 12-- the top floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON PANEL-- nothing happens, the button LIGHTS for an instant but GOES OUT again. The elevator won't move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER's getting exasperated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON PANEL-- he tries BUTTONS allover, same story.
</DIRECTION>
<GATE_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GATE_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INTO GARAGE-- the gate guard jogs TOWARD the elevators, pulling his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER starts to panic, pulls his own gun and POINTS IT AT THE GUARD, who freezes and raises his hands. Behind him, the Security Man approaches Schuyler from a different angle, his gun out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler can't get a bead on both of them.
</DIRECTION>
<SECURITY_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a dead man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECURITY_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler looks one more time at the elevator panel--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT BASE OF PANEL, a gold keyhole. CLOSER-- the letters CRS are printed beneath it, very small.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER shakes his head-- it couldn't be; but what else can he do?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INTO GARAGE-- the guards are fanning out and getting closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER reaches with one hand for his keys, fumbling for the small gold key he received at the start of the game.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON PANEL-- his hand shakes as he tries to insert the gold key... it fits into the hole; he turns it and PUSHES THE BUTTON for 12.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER-- as the DOORS CLOSE, both guards train their guns-- but too late. Schuyler's on his way up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GLASS ELEVATOR RISES through completely blackened spaces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER stares at a BULLET HOLE in the back of the glass elevator, a remnant of Feingold's murder. He holds the gun in front of himself in both hands... then he closes his eyes, steeling himself, almost in an attitude of prayer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATRIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PITCH BLACK but for the LIT ELEVATOR ascending swiftly through the darkness... Schuyler, like a solitary spaceship pilot, looks upward toward his unknown destination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRS ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DIGITAL READOUT slows as it comes to 10, 11 and STOPS at 12.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER comes out of his trance, slips the revolver back into his jacket pocket, keeps a hand there, and stands against a wall of the elevator as the DOORS OPEN ON--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 12TH FLOOR COMMISSARY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--A BUSTLING, NOISY COMMISSARY. Schuyler keeps the gun concealed as he steps out of the elevator-- nobody here is paying any attention to him anyway. There's a cafeteria style counter along one wall, people CHATTING and LAUGHING at Formica tables... amongst others, everyone from his game appears to be here... there's the RASTA, the PARAMEDICS with the HEART ATTACK VICTIM, JOHN and PETE from the men's club, the GIRL from the boat, the DESK CLERK and BELLHOP... also the HONDURAN TRUCK DRIVER, the SECURITY PEOPLE from his house, the PUNK and the TRANSIT COP... and a lot of ENGINEERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER inches into the room, meets the eyes of--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHRISTINE, who's just come away from the cafeteria counter with a tray of food. She nearly drops it, looks over her shoulder to see if anyone is watching. Suddenly, Schuyler is in front of her, backs her into an alcove-- she holds the tray between them as if to protect herself.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, Schuyler's not sure. His voice is flat, monotonal:
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm back from the dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, everything's OK, nobody touched your money, nobody stole a thing, that's impossible--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't give a fuck about the money, I wanna know who's behind this, who did this to me, how, why--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just a game!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Even though she's keeping a surface cool, he notices the GLASS and SILVERWARE on her tray RATTLING. She starts to move toward a table, he blocks her path.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not going anywhere. Feingold, or or Fisher, was that just a game too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I watched him die...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler shows her his BLOOD-STAINED HAND. Christine looks utterly perplexed, then shrugs, finding a place to put down her tray.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seemed like a nice guy, actually, father of three--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, look, I'm sure it's just another stunt-- that can't be real, taste it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You taste it, you fucking vampire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes his palm in her face, she flinches, swipes him away, then puts a finger to her ear as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and the guard and security man from downstairs burst into the commissary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the ROOM QUIETS, many others are touching their ears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They all TURN in the direction of Schuyler and Christine. The gate guard gestures at Schuyler, attempting a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<GATE_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you come with us, please? You're not authorized to be here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GATE_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler grabs Christine, wraps an arm around her throat, puts his GUN to her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back off. Everybody back off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He uses his knee in the small of her back to push her brutally toward the nearest door, she CHOKES and GASPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door shuts behind them, the stairs only lead UP.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, how do we get out--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Christine STOMPS his foot and ELBOWS his gut, breaks free and bolts up the stairs. Schuyler catches his breath and pursues. Beneath him, the stairwell door opens, GUARDS PURSUE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRS ROOF - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HIGH LEDGE surrounds the roof on all four sides, a ROOF ENTRANCE at each side as well. The NUMBER "636" is painted large for helicopters; there are air conditioning vents, ducts, etc. A MUFFLED ALARM sounds as Christine bursts through the door, followed by Schuyler. She spins, her back to the EDGE of the atrium, a black pit in the center of the roof with a sunken GLASS SKYLIGHT, a white RAILING around it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler SLAMS the door, a large number 1 painted on it in BLUE. He throws the HEAVY BOLT. He and Christine circle each other warily, his gun trained on her. POUNDING from the other side, MUFFLED VOICES that can't be heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For the first time, Christine focuses on the gun in his hand, then clutches the railing.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler addresses her as if speaking to a child:
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my gun...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We didn't give it to you? Where did it come from?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A gun store.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We searched your house!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess you fucked up again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Christine touches her ear, listening to something, then puts her hand to her mouth, speaks urgently.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's armed, he's got a real gun. Real Situation, real--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler steps forward and violently wrenches the EAR PIECE and HAND MIKE away from Christine, the wire tears her blouse open.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it's real all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Schuyler this is all fake, tricks, it's all part of the game--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it. Every word out of your mouth is a lie--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Christine's desperately panicked, fumbling for words.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The key!! They, we gave you a key to the elevator! Why would we do that?! We wanted you to come up--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course you did. So you could kill me or, or frame me for murder--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, it's THE GAME!! Blanks, squibs, high-tech special effects, none of it's real! Just open that door and I'll show you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler hesitates a moment, looking in the direction of the door.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I open the door and I die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE DOOR-- POUNDING DESPERATE, but the ALARM DROWNS out the sounds of VOICES on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER turns quickly as she takes a step towards him. He points the gun at her again. He looks ready to use it. The following DIALOG overlaps and collides, growing AURAL CHAOS--
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You move again I swear I'll kill you, you bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THINK ABOUT IT!! They followed you every step of the way, the cab, in the trunk, we had a diver--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They? We?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--the guy in Honduras, the cop on the train, there was always a safety net, always--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up, shut the fuck up!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
AXES DENT the metal door, which BULGES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at the monitor in his hand, the one he tore from her body, putting it in his own ear, letting the rest of the device dangle.

<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been trying to end it since you got back, our people came to your house, they tried to bring you in from the subway, you kept running, you weren't supposed to keep getting lost--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just said you wanted me to come here-- you're making this up as you go along!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please Sky, please. Take a breath and think about it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop. Fucking. With my head!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler runs a hand over his sweating forehead, the gun TREMBLING in his hand. Christine's regaining control. Schuyler's mind whirls, he GROANS, almost crying as he considers for the first time that she might be telling the truth. She steps closer.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're all right, it's OK, just relax...

	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her, almost ready to lower the gun. He raises his bloody hand to his lips, about to taste it.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	--we're at the North entrance, Number 2, just a few more seconds and we'll nail him--
	</DIALOGUE>
</RADIO_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler's eyes dart toward--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER DOORWAY, on the other side of the atrium, like the one that's bolted. The number 2 is painted on it in RED. The handle starts to TURN just as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--CHRISTINE LUNGES AT HIM to wrest the gun away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER comes to his senses, struggling. The GUN GOES OFF, the report should be DEAFENING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spins, points the gun at Door #2 and FIRES again, several times. THE ALARM STOPS-- SILENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christine STIFFENS, falls backwards onto the ground, clutching her BLOOD-DRENCHED stomach. Schuyler just stares. Dark blood SPILLS from her mouth as she CHOKES in pain...
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God. I blew it... we blew it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
DOOR #2 OPENS and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID steps through. He wears a brightly colored, silly looking PARTY HAT, carries a magnum of CHAMPAGNE bearing a huge BOW that reads, "SURPRISE." BLOOD PUMPS from HIS CHEST. He DROPS THE BOTTLE, which SHATTERS... David collapses amidst the broken glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLOW OF THE AXE SEVERS the deadbolt and Door #1 flies open behind Schuyler. FEINGOLD is the first of a group to come charging through, he wears a TUXEDO with a ROSE in the lapel, holds the axe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER spins, points the gun at this axe-wielding man, then, utterly stunned, lowers it in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FEINGOLD looks from Schuyler to the wounded Christine-- her agony is painful to watch. He drops the axe with a CLATTER and runs to her side, kneels. His voice CRACKS.
</DIRECTION>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shot her!? No!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking toward David)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Qh God no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<DIRECTION>
THE GUARD and SECURITY MAN come out on the roof looking very disturbed, followed by the RASTA and a few OTHERS. Many are dressed for a party now. Feingold looks to their horrified faces.
</DIRECTION>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He fucking shot them!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<RASTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll call an ambulance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASTA>
<DIRECTION>
The Rasta dashes downstairs. Schuyler backs away, drops the gun, staggers over to David. He's GASPING for breath. CRS EMPLOYEES give the brothers a wide berth, move toward Feingold and Christine.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David, David, no, no--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God, Oh God, Sky, save me, I don't wanna die, I don't wanna--
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not gonna die. I'm here, you're not gonna die...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
David's already DEAD, eyes wide, body limp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH FEINGOLD and CHRISTINE. He holds his colorful cummerbund over her stomach to staunch the bleeding. She CHOKES in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang on, just hang on, you're gonna make it--
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That stupid...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
They stare over at Schuyler, registering David's death. Schuyler is now drenched in his brother's blood, rocking him in his arms. Most of the assorted CRS people move to get out of the building before the cops show, MURMURING amongst themselves in fear.
</DIRECTION>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God. I thought you could handle it. All the tests... they said you could handle it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<DIRECTION>
CHRISTINE yells at Schuyler, unable to stand--
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fucking psycho, you piece of shit, how could you--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER gently lowers his brother and rises, like a zombie now. The big security man picks up his gun and backs away with it, keeping it out of his reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler backs away from the body, starts to SHAKE, looks as if he really has lost his mind. Feingold SOBS aloud.
</DIRECTION>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, why-- there was no point. It was supposed to be fun...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler looks back and forth from the wounded Christine-- who GASPS silent curses, beyond speech-- to David's body...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slowly turns to the Atrium pit directly in front of him. He's strangely calm...
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fun...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
SHIFT TO SLOW MOTION:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER moves for the edge of the atrium pit...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OTHERS react in HORROR, SHOUT "NO!!", lunging TOWARD HIM...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID'S HEAD suddenly MOVES, he BLINKS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER leaps onto the safety barrier around the atrium pit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHRISTINE jumps to her feet, perfectly alert, a hand extended, SCREAMING, just as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER CATAPULTS HIMSELF INTO SPACE, and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID SITS BOLT UPRIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SKY, NOOOO!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER sees this, too late--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE AND DAVID make terrified, helpless eye contact across the void, arms outstretched. Schuyler has time to register his irrevocable error as he seems to hang suspended above the glass skylight for an agonizing MOMENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEN HE FALLS... LEAVE SLOW MOTION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATRIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER CRASHES through the skylight, TUMBLING-- SPARKLING SHARDS surround him like stars as he PLUNGES, SPINS, SCREAMING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAPID CUTS-- the CLOWN, CHRISTINE's face, SCHUYLER and DAVID as CHILDREN, HIS FATHER's head striking the landing. These FLASH PAST so rapidly we can't quite process them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT WITH: INCREASING DARKNESS, GROUND RUSHING CLOSER...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SCHUYLER'S FACE as he experiences the epiphany that comes before the end. BRILLIANT ANGELIC LIGHT suddenly illuminates him, his eyes roll into his head, closing--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE FROM ABOVE-- the LIGHTS are real, they've COME ON to show--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER'S IMPACT-- he LANDS on his back, arms outstretched, eyes squeezed shut--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--and is swallowed by an ENORMOUS INFLATED LIFESAVING CUSHION that covers the floor of the atrium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER BOUNCES in the cushion a few times, gradually coming to a rest, harmless bits of BREAKAWAY GLASS showering down around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't move a muscle, his eyes still closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ON HIS FACE... muscles twitch. His eyes open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV-- UP the now illuminated tunnel formed by the walls of the building around the atrium. THE FULL MOON in the very center through the hole in the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the lighted GLASS ELEVATORS COME TO EARTH, packed with people.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER stares upward, mouth open, motionless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID comes running from an elevator, leaps up onto the cushion and bounces over to Schuyler, a huge smile on his face.

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, bro, how you doin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Getting no response, David hops closer, squats by Schuyler's side.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Admit it, you weren't bored...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER remains motionless, David's worried now, grabs his arm and starts shaking him.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus. Sky, c'mon Sky--
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER begins to LAUGH, a tremendous catharsis. DAVID laughs too, greatly relieved as he helps Schuyler to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TWO BROTHERS clutch each other for support on the BOUNCING surface, LAUGHING. CRS EMPLOYEES have gathered around the cushion, CHEERING and APPLAUDING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER wipes his eyes, shaking his head with amazement. Then he hauls back and SLUGS DAVID in the jaw, sending him flying onto his back on the cushion. MORE CHEERS from the crowd, as if they were watching a boxing match.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRS LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HALLELUJAH CHORUS from Handel's "Messiah" plays. SCHUYLER and DAVID enter together from the atrium, the CUSHION deflates behind them. David licks blood from his lips, rubs his jaw.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been wanting to do that for a long, long time, haven't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler half-smiles. The SECURITY MAN unlocks Schuyler's handcuffs, giving him back his gun, which Schuyler stares at.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like they'd really leave a loaded gun lying around. They went over the whole place with a metal detector, then packed that thing with blanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
They turn a corner into the main lobby, Schuyler absently pockets the gun, looks up in wonder...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER'S POV-- a SURPRISE PARTY: A STEREO, STREAMERS and BALLOONS, a CHAMPAGNE FOUNTAIN, CAKE and FOOD. CRS EMPLOYEES (mostly ordinary-looking office workers) CLAP and CHEER for Schuyler. They wear PARTY HATS, blow PLASTIC HORNS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMILING PEOPLE eager to offer CONGRATULATIONS surround him. He's pretty shaky, like a newborn calf. JOHN and PETE shake his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good one, buddy, really had you going, didn't we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait'll you try level two...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a wink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
The RASTA SLAPS his back, Schuyler instinctively looks over his shoulder for a gag message.
</DIRECTION>
<RASTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That look on your face up there? Shit, man, I almost lost it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASTA>
<DIRECTION>
The RECEPTIONIST POPS a bottle of Dom Perignon, hands it to Sky.
</DIRECTION>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Awesome game-- best I've seen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<DIRECTION>
Not knowing what else to do, Schuyler takes a slug. The GIRL from the boat KISSES his cheek. TECHNICIANS, men with STUNTS UNLIMITED T-SHIRTS, the NURSE from the asylum, the SECURITY PEOPLE, CRS GUARDS, AGENTS, all want a piece of him at once.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "MESSIAH" FADES and an R & B BAND breaks into ROUSING MUSIC as Feingold approaches and sticks a CIGAR in his mouth, LIGHTS it.
</DIRECTION>
<FEINGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure glad you jumped, compadre. Otherwise I was supposed to throw you off.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not strictly legal, so don't tell anyone...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat, off Schuyler's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The cigar. It's a Monte Cristo, straight from Havana.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEINGOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Christine approaches, wobbly and dazed herself; she touches his arm. Her voice is soft for the first time, accents gone.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey... you all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(nods slowly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so. You?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little shook. I'm pretty much a method actress, y'know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Susan. Susan Waters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice to meet you, Susan...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I have a puff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
He gives her a DRAG on his cigar.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I have to know. Who's really in charge?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
She shrugs, blows a SMOKE RING and sticks her finger through it.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She winks and strolls off. Schuyler smiles, looking after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DANCING is starting up IN BG. A clutch of non-CRS people approach tentatively-- including PLYMPTON, ELIZABETH, MARIA and JACK. They all look very confused.
</DIRECTION>
<PLYMPTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this, Sky? We got a call from your brother, said there was a surprise party...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLYMPTON>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kind of late for your birthday, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
Schuyler LAUGHS, gives her a hug, surprising her. He still has a giddy smile plastered on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you wanted to borrow my car, you could've just asked--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, Liz, I've been an idiot, and I'm sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<PLYMPTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You OK?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLYMPTON>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah-- I'm good, really. Happy to be alive... Listen, it's great to see all of you, thanks for coming-- but there's something I have to do. Excuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He moves away quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHUYLER FLUSHES and moves away from a urinal. David waits a few feet away by the sinks and mirrors; Schuyler starts slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's the object of the game?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What game?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(rinsing his hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it always like this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mine was a little weirder. Tell you about it sometime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David pulls out A COLORED ENVELOPE, slips it into Schuyler's shirt. Schuyler looks at him curiously as he dries his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bill. It's itemized. Don't bother opening it now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SCHUYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(opening it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought it was a gift.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, no, the card was the gift, the rest was up to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FOLLOWS as David hurries out of the rest room, Schuyler behind him, flipping pages of a long, long bill--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRS LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--we rejoin the PARTY, which is now in full swing. Schuyler stands alone at the periphery of the dance floor with the bill. He hits the bottom line... he blinks and GASPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHRISTINE appears, taking his hand and pulling him away.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHUYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Where are we going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHUYLER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does it matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
They move into a stairwell and start climbing O. S., their hands all over each other. We hear the MUSIC and FESTIVITIES continuing in BG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA HOLDS for a beat on a SIGN painted on the wall with an arrow upward: "LEVEL 2..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BLACK
</DIRECTION>
